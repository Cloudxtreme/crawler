I&apos;m mostly very satisfied with the WOTC DLC, so if you enjoyed the base game, then it&apos;s worth the investment.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>1. A lot of new weapons and gear.
<br>2. Factions and faction orders give the game more depth, and the three new classes are fun.
<br>3. The Chosen themselves are fairly tough opponents.
<br>4. Breakthrough and inspired research give more life to that aspect of the game and the bonuses are appropriate.
<br>
<br>5. All previous DLC has been streamlined into the game, sparing you the extra missions and cut scenes.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1. The Chosen are kind of boring and uninspired. They can be challenging in combat, but not as much as the Rulers. They talk CONSTANTLY during missions and while in the Geoscape, which is the most annoying part of the game.  After defeating the Chosen, it&apos;s just back to the vanilla game. If you&apos;ve beaten the game numerous times, then this is kind of a let down as WOTC doesn&apos;t span the length of the game in a meaningful way, other than adding some extra cut scenes at the end.
<br>
<br>2. WOTC doesn&apos;t add much story to the game at all, just a few extra cut scenes. I, and probably others, were hoping for a more interstellar scope, one which might shed more light on the Ethereals. Considering that the vanilla game drops a pretty obvious hint to possible sequels in the final cut scene, I had hoped DLC wouid go this direction, but if it&apos;s intent is still to suggest a future XCOM 3 altogether, then I&apos;m fine with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7515301">Expand</a></span>

I would have liked to see some more tweaks to the main campaign, the final 1/3rd still feels like a forgone conclusion once you get your troopers up to god-tier, especially with the new extra ability unlocks. Ironman Commander Difficulty was not much of a challenge, and where I think they made the DLC ruler aliens too OP, I think the Chosen were a little bit under-powered. More story missions involving the Lost and more diversity in the Avatar facility missions would have also been welcome. I expect the Mod community to have a field-day with all of the new changes, and new campaign options allow you to customize the game to your experience. I&apos;ll be back in another month for my Legend Ironman playthrough, wish me luck!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7515380">Expand</a></span>

This expansion works more like a supercharged DLC than a true expansion. Don&apos;t get me wrong there is a lot of new content, but none of it extends the original ending of the game and it becomes bloated at various points in the game (more on this later). So lets get to the meat of it. This expansion is all about three new bosses (chosen) and making you hate them.
<br>
<br>X-Com has never been much of a game with &quot;bosses&quot;, so it feels a little out of place, too Hollywood for a game that once was a pretty gritty and realistic strategy game. These over the top, trash talking bosses could be great if used more subtly, but Firaxis shoves them down your throat. They pop up to tell you how weak and doomed you are at any given point. They die, reappear, only to come back stronger. They would be great for a cinematic game like Metal Gear, not in a strategy game.  Now lets move onto the ridiculous power of these bosses. They get to move, attack, move in battle. Can summon Advent out of thin air. They automatically hit (defense is irrelevant, they&apos;ll hit you through with smoke grenades and Aid bots). So there is the problem, a once hardcore strategy game has thrown out strategy to create drama, wanting you to hate these bosses. In a  game like XCom the mystique of a powerful alien should be mystery and subtlety, I think they did it all wrong. Some new developers are on the Firaxis team for sure.
<br>
<br>The other main draw if the exp is the three new friendly factions. Reapers, Skirmishers, and Templars. I kind of like what they did with this. Through these new factions you get covert actions which open up some decent strategic options and unique upgrades (I love pistol specialized snipers and getting a flat +1 damage to all of them made for some fun gaming, albeit a tad overpowered :).
<br>The actual classes of these factions are well done, and feel distinct enough from the original classes to have a place. My rating of 7 is mostly due to these factions.
<br>
<br>So I have mixed feelings on WOTC. There is a lot in this expansion pack but fitting it in the original core story seems overwhelming. A new player who didn&apos;t play X-Com 2 vanilla will be lost in all the new missions the expansion throws at you. The rate of main story mission to side mission is about 1 in 10 in the expansion, where the original is more 1  in 5.
<br>
<br>Hopefully Firaxis will tone the bosses down in XCom 3, while keeping these factions. Give us a longer main story with time to better fit in all these new missions and upgrades. Bring back some of the mystery into Xcom. Let us stumble on a big bad boss by turning a dark corner and seeing it for the first time.  And always make sure its a strategy first game over theatrics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7500761">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The dialog/story is still a bit campy/cheesy and the new posters for solider bonds (think Fire Emblem/Disgaea bonds) are ridiculous. A lot of the new customization options for soldiers are funny, but don&apos;t fit the tone of the game imho. Some people will love the new options though.
<br>
<br>The story doesn&apos;t really get much better here. They added some new story missions regarding the new resistance factions and Chosen. The story is still very silly IMHO (bordering on stupid) and imho it loses a bit of tension it had before because of the Chosen being goofy. It&apos;s hard to believe the aliens would run the world the way they do. For example, why wouldn&apos;t the aliens simply build a ton of SAM missile batteries/anti-air ships/UFOs over the past 20 years to control any resistance? As powerful as they are, it&apos;s a bit hard to buy into.
<br>
<br>X-com 2&apos;s greatest strength is the smoothing of the campaign difficulty and progression. New players will find the game much easier to start than the base game, as the new maps are better designed with less randomization frustrating you. There are still old story missions weaved into the game, and it&apos;s a bit jarring to go back to them, for many reasons.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s new enemies, solider classes, abilities, armor, weapons, buildings, ect. which are welcome additions that consists of the other big chunk of the expansion content. I feel like they added a lot in that regard.  The new Chosen enemies are neat, but a bit out of character compared to X-Come lore, as they will taunt you constantly from your base and show up constantly. It&apos;s weird to kill something in X-Com many times and not be dead and it&apos;s weird tonally for them to talk the way they do.
<br>
<br>Overall X-Com 2 War of the Chosen is a great game, provided you can deal with a few bugs, cheesy story, and retreading many old missions. I recommend it. Thanks for reading.
<br>
<br>*I did not use any mods while playing the game for this review, however, X-Com has a great mod community and that can enhance you experience greatly, depending on your tastes.*</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7497611">Expand</a></span>

You don&apos;t, what you get are 3 new skins, 1 new room to build in the Avenger, 2 new alien types which are just re-hashed version of what is already in game, and a pinched idea form Shadows of Mordor.  Which are 3 alien bosses that pop into random mission and talk to much.  So to re-cap, no new, innovative content, no new story, no new tech to build, ohh hang on, it now has white zombies, cause that&apos;s innovative, zombies in a PC game, so all they could come up with was white zombies for $40usd
<br>
<br>Anyone that claims this is worth $40 is delude and anyone that claims this adds hours upon hours of new and exciting content is an idiot.  If you feel the need to waste money on seeing a few new skins then go ahead but my advice is to WAIT till this rip off of an DLC is $5-$10.  The free mods on steam workshop are better than this pile of crap.  Oh, also it is still riddled with bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7493803">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Many encounters are made more challenging by the appearance of a Chosen, and they&apos;re a constant thorn in your side until dealt with. The Chosen work in much the same way as the Avatar Project - forcing the player to choose between trying to take them on earlier and potentially suffer heavy casualties, versus leaving them alone until the later game, by which point it may be too late.
<br>
<br>As mentioned, the addition of some new enemy types, map layouts and game modes will keep most XCOM fans happy for a long while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7499368">Expand</a></span>

WOTC goes some way to correct this, introducing dark and abandoned sewers and lost cities, but it also introduces even more psychedelic artistry and marvel-esque characters. This doesn&#xB4;t matter that much though, since what have been the sole reason to play xcom all along have been the gameplay on the tactical maps in conjunction with the research and construction in between the skirmishes. I&#xB4;m not exactly sure WOTC so much improves as reinvents, but since I already loved the gameplay, making the game feel fresh and surprising again is enough for me. I would probably recommend that new players start with xcom 1 with DLC before jumping into WOTC. This feels like an expansion created for people who have put lots of time into the old games and wants a reason to go back to them. This is the xcom game that I want to play, but I have been very much schooled into thinking this way by the former games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7491937">Expand</a></span>

I use that in brackets because there is so much content its practically a new game.  It reinvents what was an already superb title and things look very good on the horizon if they are using this as the base idea for XCOM3.  It has a few elements of Shadows of Mordor and the nemesis system as the chosen hunt you down, which is backed up by narrative as they refer to other game elements that you have been doing in the meantime.  All this adds to a much grander narrative that fleshes out the middle part of the game.  Which if the original had any faults, aside from new alien types and the odd boost to your technology, it could turn into a bit of a grind fest as you relentlessy ground out victory after victory in the same 3 or 4 mission types (albeit an excellent one).  Now theres all sorts you can be doing.  Variety really is the spice of life.
<br>
<br>All that said, I do think the asking price was a bit steep for what was supposed to be a &quot;dlc&quot;.  But i feel it justifies its price, although i am going to knock a mark off as unless you are a fan of the game, then you might want to wait for a sale before you pick it up.  Which is a shame, as what you get for your cash is really rather good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7492574">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>to be mentioned the new options, when you start a new campaign, to double the avatar project meter and the mission timers, since the game gets harder, i really suggest to do so.
<br>
<br>nice compatibility with the precedent must-have expansion Shen&apos;s Last Gift and the one of the Vahlen superaliens. you can choose to have a simpler experience by adding the extra content (sparks, weapons and the three alien kings) without having the dedicated missions.
<br>
<br>that&apos;s good, after all, since the experience would be extra hard if not made so.
<br>
<br>All and all, a phenomenal must buy game and expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7528350">Expand</a></span>
