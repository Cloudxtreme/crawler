It is the Atari E.T. of indie games.  Many were following this game&apos;s development for over a year.  The developer has released an alpha product and is selling it as a finished game.  It most certainly is not.  AVOID THIS GAME.</span>

<br>
<br>My thoughts, if youre making a game, make it but dont release on early access half broken at least make sure your game is 90% done...
<br>
<br>Steam shouldnt allow this kind of games on Early Access.
<br>
<br>Hope you make something better in future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3596909">Expand</a></span>

It didn&apos;t seem like their was much to the game at all. Seemed like a bland  version of SWAT/Rainbow 6 games. When the game came out, it confirmed was I was thinking, but it was much much worse than I ever believed.
<br>
<br>First problem I had was options. Graphic options are pathetic with only v-sync, overall quality, brightness, and resolution. No way to tweak specific elements. In-game you can not access the options menu at all. You can not change graphics, controls, sound, etc. AT ALL in-game.
<br>
<br>Another problem I had was the gameplay. Controls work for the most part, but the movement felt stiff. Sometimes the game will glitch your gun when you switch and leave you stuck unarmed. AI is spotty at best. Teammates can not being commanded to move anywhere, they only follow like sheep and get in the way. They rarely get any enemies. Enemy AI is mediocre, they don&apos;t react to your unsuppressed gunfire all the time and won&apos;t shoot you even you stand right in front of them sometimes. Also the timer is obnoxiously in the middle of the screen, something that can just be on the corner of the screen.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer flat out didn&apos;t work at all. Insulting to anyone that wanted to play with others.
<br>
<br>The overall presentation and gameplay of the game is generic to put it mildly. Should of just called this game Tactical Shooter, because it does nothing to stand out from the crowd despite being much newer than similar games. If your going to revive a genre, take what was good about it and refine was not so good about it. There is no heart to this game, it&apos;s a cold and lifeless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3579029">Expand</a></span>

If this was released on steam&apos;s &quot;Early Access&quot; then I would understand why it&apos;s so buggy and why it crashes so often. But yet it was released as a full game, so I will give it a review as a full game. 1/10</span>

<br>The enemy AI difficulty seems to swing wildly between super-human and dumb as a rock. Sometimes they will be alerted to your presence from 2 floors down after you&apos;ve taken a step and proceed to swarm you, and other times you can stand a couple yards away from a target and empty an entire magazine in the to wall they are standing next to with no reaction at all. It also appears that they spawn in randomly but there isn&apos;t any sort of buffer between your spawn and theirs, which has lead to a couple times where I would start the match and be killed instantly as soon as I finish loading in. Another odd occurrence I&apos;ve experienced is enemy targets that are invincible but also don&apos;t seem to do anything other than yell at you; I believe it may have been caused by them spawning in to a piece of furniture but when I went to investigate further I lost connection to the host, which was me, in a single player game.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer hardly ever works in any way, shape or form and when it does you have to cross your fingers that you don&apos;t error out.
<br>
<br>TL;DR: Don&apos;t buy this game, take your money and instead spend it on Rainbow 6, SWAT or any other game that actually works.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3578603">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Yes, if the AI sees you and you duck out of sight they will forget you are there. You can then lean around the corner and shoot the wall beside their head and they do nothing. They do not react to noise so even if you empty a clip in the next room they won&apos;t react, they just wait for you to come in and hopefully stand still so they can shoot you.
<br>
<br>Every door in open at the start of a mission.. all of them, wide open. This looks like an early release or early beta phase game, and should not be released in this state.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3575609">Expand</a></span>

The AI is non-existent, really, wire-bots in CounterStrike 1.6 seemed more realistic, there is no real way to loadout and manage your team, and overall, i can&apos;t find anything to recommend this aside from maybe saying it looks &apos;nice&apos;. The weapons feel like utter garbage and the only real mechanic they tried, sound detection isn&apos;t even working. One hit-dead is rare, mostly ending up soaking 4-5 bursts before dying and even so, without any injuries.

<br>The game is a glorified tech demo that i wouldn&apos;t pay 1$ for. I have Android games that are better shooters as a whole than this. Just stay away, it won&apos;t get fixed, and don&apos;t let ANYONE trick you into buying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3577043">Expand</a></span>

Artificial intelligence, both hostile and of our comrades is a total bottom of all bottoms. Amount of maps as well as maps themselves causes shock and in most cases this product is just rotten up to a bone marrow. Situation is not saved by archaic graphics and not very standing out audio. Lack of any control on our squad, irritating random objective spawning system and non-functional loadout along with other cons makes for a very explosive mix that creates unbearable stench spreading out miles from a working PC. I understand and appreciate Allen&apos;s effort on the game; nowadays, the genre of tactical shooters is practically extinct. But that doesn&apos;t mean it should be finished off by releasing such a mess and at the same time - lie to those who supported the project. I&apos;d rather break a jar on my forehead than play this abomination. Seriously, you shouldn&apos;t play this crap even if given for free. Unless you like to paddle in a cesspool and you&apos;re welcoming tonnes of sweat, blood and tears with open arms. Otherwise, just forget about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=4409227">Expand</a></span>

<br>This was a big let down, I purchased this for some of my friends and it was a complete failure. The AI is a joke, it is not immersive at all, there are no events, basically your just entering a room and have to pie it and when you see someone you can line up a shot but the others are oblivious, the enemy units do not use formations or lean or do anything with anything but stand move and gun. The maps while a small positive in there size and diversity are few in numbers, the AI do not use any map elements or items or anything, they do not seem to acknowledge each other, like they stand there every day really? Don&apos;t they live life? Have a cig? Talk to each other, actually use each other? Na, they are just dummies. The PvP is ok but other games like Insurgency surpass this game. I prefer Tom Clancy Rainbow 6 3 over this. The AI, actually react and use each other, and the map elements, and you can open doors in inches or all at once. I think this game tried to copy that, but with better graphics.
<br>
<br>The gunplay in the game is so blah and nothing, for example in Insurgency it is decisive, and dynamic, like Counter-Strike but realistic. Here it is like a carnival game almost. They once sold this game for $1.00 so do not buy for $5, can you believe I actually paid around $45 for 3 copies, now at full price I can have 9. Please take that as a sign that this game is a no go.
<br>
<br>Remember if your looking at this game and say your gonna like it anyways, go look at Insurgency,
<br>
<br>Thats right INSURGENCY. It is exactly what your looking for and better, and has a more dynamic co-op mode. The bots in Insurgency use cover, seem to communicate with each other, you can even hear them sometimes barking orders. They also do flanking and apply pressure at key moments.
<br>
<br>Takedown Red Sabre co-op is only good when your with friends and you use your imagination. The Dev sure has issues, be careful he is sensitive about the word gay, he will ban you months after you been initially punished for it.
<br>
<br>BTW, Just breezing thru the community hub, is a whole community of people that made videos that highlight the **** gameplay, even regular posts about people raging that this is incomplete, be careful the DEV has a vendetta, **** risk ban hammer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=4651303">Expand</a></span>

<br>CQB must be quick and you work with a team mostly 2 or 3 team-mates. It fully works with vocal communication and fast but precise reactions.
<br>
<br>For example  the way you penetrate a hall with 2 doors, there is more than one way to do it. BUT any-time everyone will act as synchronized as possible.
<br>First case, everyone follows it&apos;s leading element and follow a wall with for each a NON-CROSSED cover (AI are really dangerous).
<br>Second case, one takes left, two take left, three covers the back. Etc etc etc.
<br>NEVER (as in NEVER!!) fire if you have a tea-mate in sight (basics  always cover YOUR sector even if someone fires the opposite way.
<br>Moreover, in real life you lean (eventually  not a full lean) even when walking, you take different stances, you use different movement speeds, you can pre-aim your weapon, you use the wall as weapon stabilization  so many small features that could have made this game unique.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m really sorry guys but ArmA III is a better (from really far) tactical shooter, even  CQB than this.
<br>This game looks more like a cheap unreal tournament mod or Source engine mod than a professional game.
<br>
<br>You should have sticked on a rainbow six remake.
<br>
<br>Anyway i laughed hard in front of some AI reactions enemies or teammates so that allows you a three </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3594555">Expand</a></span>

The devs are apparently aware and working a patch, but it doesn&apos;t change the fact that this game, bugs aside, is terrible, even from a design perspective. It&apos;s completely lacking in any kind of functionality and usability that you would expect from a tactical shooter. There is no way to plan your mission, no way to familiarize yourself with the layout of the level before going in. Changing your loadout is done from the main menu, and when you choose which loadout you want for a mission, you better have a good memory because it won&apos;t tell you which one is which, except for a number. No way to change, or even see any of the options once you&apos;re playing. There&apos;s no way to take down enemies non-lethally, no way to subdue them.
<br>The AI is absolutely horrendous. It&apos;ll run back and forth between two points, being completely indecisive about which is the better coverpoint, allowing you to kill them with ease. It&apos;ll snipe you from across the map with deadly precision, and if the enemy is not in your field of view, good luck trying to find out which direction the shot is coming from, as there are no indicators of the sort. The enemy also spawns randomly in the map, sometimes directly in front or behind you when you spawn, leading you to be killed the instant you begin the mission. There are no difficulty settings of any kind and the default seems to be on both ends of the extremes. The AI will react with lightning speed and kill you with deadly precision, or completely ignore you firing at the wall beside them.
<br>The friendly AI is just as bad. You can change between defensive/offensive/quiet/assault rules of engagement, or have them stay where they are or follow you. That&apos;s it. You can&apos;t order them to move to a specific location, can&apos;t ask them to open a door, can&apos;t order them to flashbang a room. The only them your friendly AI serves as, is lives and meatshields.
<br>I&apos;m assuming this was supposed to be a multiplayer focused game, but the multiplayer hardly even works. Sometimes it won&apos;t connect to a game, other times, if you spam double-click a game enough, it works. There are no filters of any kind, and the modes that exist in singleplayer are not even present in the multiplayer lobby (Tango Hunt, Mission, Bomb Disarm). You can host a co-op mission just fine, but there doesn&apos;t seem to be any way to find them (Singleplayer can also quit on itself, telling you the &quot;Connection to host has been lost&quot;.. What?).
<br>Once you&apos;re actually in a game, you can&apos;t see who you&apos;re actually playing with, can&apos;t see how many are left on the opposing team, there&apos;s no way to spectate if you join a game mid-round and you just end up looking at a wall. I read that this was because they felt scoreboards were unrealistic, but it just ends up feeling like a missing feature. They could easily have implemented a scoreboard that only showed the names of the players and which team they were on, but nope. There&apos;s also a horrendous text-to-speech feature that can&apos;t be turned off (In fact, there are hardly ANY options, and no way to turn off specific graphical effects, except through a config file).
<br>The menus themselves are also terrible. Some menus can not be quit out of by pressing &quot;Escape&quot;, and you have to click the button that says &quot;[Esc] Back&quot;. Sometimes it&apos;s the other way around; You can&apos;t click the back button, you HAVE to press escape. That something as simple as these menus are, are not working properly and consistently is baffling. The loadout menu is also completely unintuitive. To actually save a loadout you have to manually press &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;Modify&quot;, even though you&apos;re actually saving it. Why not make it clearer what you have to do? If they had made the loadout part of the mission selection, it would have been less of a problem as you&apos;d just select your weapons directly; You wouldn&apos;t have to remember them.
<br>Every old school tactical shooter that Takedown tries to emulate, such as Rainbow Six, SWAT 3/4 and the first Ghost Recon, is better in every single respect. For a minute, it had me doubting, if my memory of old-school shooters were somehow better than what the actual games were like. I installed Raven Shield, just to see if I was wrong, and thankfully, I was. It&apos;s not the genre that&apos;s broken, it&apos;s just this game. It feels completely empty and devoid of features, and as a Kickstarter game (I didn&apos;t back Takedown, personally), I can&apos;t help but feel bad for those who backed it. This game is a massive disappointment.
<br>Time to replay SWAT 4 and wash away the taste Takedown: Red Sabre left.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3582541">Expand</a></span>

There is no story you are trying to follow or campaign mode. They just throw you into a map and tell you your objectives. The game is difficult (which is good) as the AI behave like hackers from Call of Duty, rubber banding to where you are and rarely missing. The graphics are pretty bad and there are some standard features missing which need to be implemented. The one that stands out most is I would really like to make a private server for friends. There are plenty of bugs that should have been fixed before release. I give it a 2 because I do like the difficulty of the game and the fact that you don&apos;t regen life, you don&apos;t have a map, you can&apos;t tell when you get a kill sometimes. The cons just outweigh the pros too much to be a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3581528">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sound just doesn&apos;t sound real. There isn&apos;t a feeling of immersion, especially when you get shot at.
<br>
<br>Graphics aren&apos;t special, and looks more like something from 5 years ago.
<br>
<br>AI teammates in single player don&#x2019;t do anything useful.
<br>
<br>Moving slow, dying in 2 hits and leaning aren&apos;t the only things that make up a tactical shooter. There seem to be a few things like reload animation jumps magically to a locked back slide when it didn&apos;t start that way, and the holosight not behaving like a real one just kill the experience outright for me.
<br>
<br>After only playing for 30 minutes, this game appears to be more like a mod someone made that takes away half the functionality from R6 Raven Shield, than a standalone release that is ready to be sold on the shelves, even if it only costs $15.
<br>
<br>My recommendation is rather than spending an hour playing this, spend the next 30 minutes finding your old Raven Shield disk and play terrorist hunt for 30 minutes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3603130">Expand</a></span>

Even in the trailer you can see the disgusting animations and the bland textures. Should just be a garrys mod game imo.</span>

My ai squad wouldn&apos;t shoot people in-front of them, and some enemies I could just run straight past them and they wouldn&apos;t care, other times they just do what they should do! If I have to play a game like this again, I&apos;m gonna swim in an ocean of acid.</span>

<br>Okay, so I&apos;ll start with some background information first. I... was really looking forward to this game, as I had not played a tactical shooter before and I thought that a game like this sounded very fun. I buy it the day I see that it&apos;s available, foolishly not looking into the reviews first. Oh boy, that was a mistake.

<br>Okay, so I&apos;ll start with some background information first. I... was really looking forward to this game, as I had not played a tactical shooter before and I thought that a game like this sounded very fun. I buy it the day I see that it&apos;s available, foolishly not looking into the reviews first. Oh boy, that was a mistake.
<br>
<br>The title screen alone bothers me because it&apos;s incredibly generic, with music playing at a very low level. The menu doesn&apos;t save changes to settings if you leave the game. This is the slowest game you will ever play. Movement speed is laughable, walking being slightly faster than a snail, running speed being faster than walking speed, and sprinting speed is if you were speed walking. This already makes the game seem stupid. And your team AI is just the worst. They walk with their legs, and by that I mean NOTHING moves on them when they walk. their arms just stay on their gun and move forward. When you run into an enemy, they do nothing except stand and get shot while shouting random garbage that is of no use to you. Speaking of getting shot at, you have ridiculously low health levels, and since there is no way to recover, this means that you are stuck with maybe 1 hit for the entire level.
<br>
<br>Enemies notice you way too easily. Play a game like Metal Gear Solid, and you can get noticed pretty easily, but the nice thing about it was that you got a chance to fight before you got shredded to pieces. Not in this game. The enemy sees you and shoots immediately without giving you a chance to respond. This seems ok, right? Just memorize the enemy movement? Nope, they don&apos;t really have a set route, they just move places and stuff happens. There&apos;s nothing like a radar either, so you can&apos;t plan anything ahead of time. The game tells you that those with a plan will do better than those that go in guns blazing, but in fact, you have a better chance for survival if you just run in blasting everything you can see. Doing mission objectives is tedious because of this, since you need to actually look for what you&apos;re supposed to do, and exploring to find your objective simply isn&apos;t fun because of enemies that can kill you in the blink of an eye, and you not realizing what just happened, and then you switch to a teammate that gets immediately killed because it took too long for the game to switch.
<br>
<br>Bugs do not seem to be an issue, because it feels more like it&apos;s simply filled with the worst design choices ever made.
<br>
<br>The reason this isn&apos;t a 0 is because there is ONE redeeming factor.
<br>
<br>The ONLY postive thing I can say about this game is that the team continues to patch the game, which tells me that there is still hope for the game&apos;s future as something maybe somewhat decent. But until then, this is probably the worst game I have ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3805341">Expand</a></span>

<br>Anyway, DO NOT BUY this game RIGHT NOW if u wanna get a serious video game. At this point, its only a &quot;trolling game&quot; for having some stupid time spending fun. This game includes insta-deaths (but only for u, not for enemies), silly acting NPC.s and every time u respawn u will get a new prime weapon(!!?), no matter what, u have chosen for your equipment at the beginning of the mission.....DAFUQ?!?   And those are only some &quot;funny&quot; things from Takedown: RS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3647916">Expand</a></span>

TAKEDOWN is this kind of game   but completely empty. Where SWAT had tactics, Takedown has &quot;Open/Close door&quot; situations. SWAT had different actions of hostiles and hostages  Takedown added stupid guards with collective mind, passing from one to another right at the moment when you&apos;re not ready for it. And it&apos;s not about skill  it&apos;s about random encounters that don&apos;t make you adapt, they scare and destroy you. It was the first  not-horror game throughout 7or 8 years which scared me. And it&apos;s awful. Graphics are pretty much ok, but common glitches with textures are still there. Gameplay is not tactical, but dumb. You may try, but I warned you  you will not like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3607159">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>pros:
<br>-difficulty is as advertised, feels super rewarding to kill enemy Ais
<br>-The emphasis on teamwork is the vital component of the game which I like very much.
<br>-It takes actual skill to progress through the levels (a valuable characteristic that most fps games lack)
<br>
<br>cons:
<br>-multiplayer is dead
<br>-textures for squad members,AIs, and swepts are visually deplorable
<br>-menu/ui is unappealing
<br>-no actual tactical mechanisms other than shooting and walking very slow
<br>-The game itself is flavorless, even when it comes to other simulation/indie games such as payday and payday2, there was some kind of theme to flavor the experience and i was expecting that with this game but I was left disappointed.
<br>
<br>Overall, if the devs were able to improve the game dramatically over the course of a few weeks to a few months (multiplayer support,improving texture/graphics,improving ais), enable a mod community, add more content (game modes,maps),than I can see this game being revived from the dead but as of its current state, its a zombie.Not saying that I regret paying the money because I am waiting for multiplayer so i can actually enjoy the game but its just not up to par as of right now.I can imagine the negative reviews surrounding this game might have some kind of adverse affect towards the motivation and work ethic for the developers but hopefully they will overlook it and set out on improving it and delivering potentially awesome game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3635519">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Despite those things i was able to get in with a good group of players through the mumble provided by Serellean we played for about 8 hours straight and had a great time, at this point playing with randoms who are unwilling to cooperate (mumble/skype or other forms of communication) make this game a living breathing nightmare, But once you have a cohesive group of people working together game after game it becomes a very enjoyable experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=3577936">Expand</a></span>

On your own it&apos;s not much fun, I&apos;ve managed coop and mp, and both worked fine with workarounds. They need to fix a lot of things before they released this game, but overall, I can see this game has potential especially for modding  maps from R6, Swat 4 etc</span>

I hold high hopes for this game and it has plenty of potential. Putting bugs aside, it has some pretty damn awesome gameplay. Its really getting down to the gritty tactical shooter it is meant to be, 1 shot one kill, hardcore and difficult. Take it slow and plan out your moves. playing with a friend is an absolute THRILL because of just how difficult it is. I love this game and I know it has a bright future. The graphics are not bad AT ALL, especially for a game that is full price only $15. Its no AAA title but it is a game with potential. All the 1 ratings are haters, the game is nowhere near that bad.

Only marred by a few minor glitches (AI not paying attention, no reloading&quot;) this game is one of the best of the year. It needs a few updates, but I eagerly await to see the console version of this game, and a sequel</span>
