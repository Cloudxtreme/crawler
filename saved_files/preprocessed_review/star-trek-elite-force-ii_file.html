<br>*Random Klingon Fight Later*
<br>The game shows promise as a shocker, but then quickly gets to &quot;how many enemys can we spawn before you die&quot; (More than that I&apos;m afraid :P)... unfortunatly it quickly becomes obvious that the game is by no means a squad based shooter, infact, the game rarely keeps you and the squad together and they quickly become unimportant characters as the game progresses (they don&apos;t even DO anything later on). 
<br>So it comes down to the shooting and a minorly interesting story... that quickly gets absurd... then becomes a wtf... and shooting wise, there&apos;s not much variety for most of the game.
<br>The game uses &quot;Balanced Weapons&quot;, which basically means that sticking with your initial weapons is best, because the ammo the &quot;heavy hitters&quot; use is far too much and it&apos;s typically far easier to use the phaser for 1 or 2 kills (and save  very precious ammo). Sigh, when it comes down to it, the biggest tire was the amount of enemies that needed to be killed with the little ammo you had. And let alone that the enemies you&apos;re killing are little &quot;biomorphishthings&quot;, most of which are melee attackers in an FPS game (problem?), and most of the time they just keep spawning cause when AI is crap they have to compensate (forinstance, by making them rather fast and hard to hit [well, in great quantity]) sigh... get it for the far more interesting interludes, then sell it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-elite-force-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=70576">Expand</a></span>
