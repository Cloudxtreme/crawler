<br>No Man&#x2019;s Sky is back
<br>You start the game out customizing your astronaut with extremely limited options, and then skydive into the first world&#x2026;
<br>It&#x2019;s here you learn that you&#x2019;re destined to become a master builder&#x2026;
<br>your ship is wrecked and you need to go gather materials to get it working again.
<br>Sound familiar?
<br>This game is literally LEGO No Mans Sky, without the deformed creatures walking around&#x2026;
<br>Except it actually has a co-op mode that it isn&#x2019;t lying about
<br>you can player either local or online with your psn friends&#x2026; no randoms
<br>You whole point of the game is to complete tasks in exchange for a golden block&#x2026;
<br>And as you progress through the game and collect more blocks you unlock new tools which in tern unlock new quest types&#x2026;
<br>You have a discovery tool which you use to scan to items and animals in the world.. this tool allows you to shoot and place these items anywhere in the world&#x2026;
<br>there&#x2019;s a paint tool to change the color of items...
<br>a copy tool that allows you to select a structure in the world and save it to bring it with you..
<br>a land scape tool to alter the landscape,, raise it, lower it, change it, remove it, and finally the build tool that allows you to freely build items brick by brick
<br>You run around and complete the handful of tasks these residents need, they give you a golden block in return and you can either explore or go to a new random world&#x2026;
<br>the game also gives you a preview before you land so you can constantly search for something else if you aren&#x2019;t happy with the procedurally generated planet you get&#x2026;
<br>unfortunately.. This is all the game is...
<br>and because of that it gets boring fast and loses its charm fast&#x2026;
<br>The worlds are extremely small when you start out&#x2026; they gradually increase in size when you hit the mile stones of collecting 25,50,and 80 blocks.. Eventually having multiple bio domes...
<br>The issue though is that the game isn&#x2019;t fun enough to entice players to make it that far&#x2026; to have to travel to anywhere from 25 to 80 different planets doing the same boring tasks to eventually be able to play on these larger maps or even collect 100 to unlock the ability to create your own world&#x2026;
<br>And because this is so no man&#x2019;s sky where its land, explore, and go&#x2026; there&#x2019;s no incentive to build&#x2026;
<br>there&#x2019;s no reason to collect all of these items and animals and build a fortress on a planet.. because you&#x2019;re leaving it all behind after you&#x2019;re done painting some gingerbread man&#x2019;s lollipop for the 18th time
<br>basically you&#x2019;re solving problems with Legos on randomly generated planets that all look practically identical that are no fun to explore&#x2026;
<br>ride animals, vehicles&#x2026;.
<br>explore caves for treasures to unlock new weapons to deal with rogue Lego creatures&#x2026;
<br>rinse and repeat until your bored.
<br>it didn&#x2019;t take me long&#x2026;
<br>And that&#x2019;s sad because the game opens with such charm and character&#x2026;
<br>The rest of the game should&#x2019;ve been just as handcrafted as its opening with increasing challenge to your task at hands&#x2026;
<br>But instead they tried to chase Minecraft and no man&#x2019;s sky, and fell on their face
<br>I give LEGO Worlds

As with most things in life, I like to use sets of three. In this review, I will highlight three bad elements of Lego Worlds, three good elements, and three things that set the game apart from the competition and make it a truly unique game.
<br>First off, we start with the bad. The first bad thing you will notice as you play Lego Worlds is the clunky and difficult to use menu interface. Unlike Minecraft (survival mode), Lego Worlds gives you all the materials you need to build your castle/house/structure without having to mine for building materials. What makes this difficult is the fact that there are over 30 different types of Lego pieces to select from in one very small menu. Furthermore, when one builds a structure, it is all too easy to put the Lego brick down in the wrong place and have to erase the piece, reselect it from the menu, and put it down again. All in all, building is a very tedious, time-consuming process. The second main problem with the game is lack of difficulty. Nothing stands in your way to oppose you. Enemies only attack if they are attacked, and they are easily defeated.There is no real challenge in this game besides one&apos;s desire to explore and build. The third major problem with this game is a lack of a map. The Lego world is HUGE, and I have built several structures, only to never find them again as I wander aimlessly around. This is almost a game breaker for me, and I expect the full version of the game will have some form of minimap system. But enough of the bad, on to the good!
<br>The first good thing about Lego Worlds is the vehicles. Minecraft was a huge game, but what did Mojang give you? Horses and minecarts. Lego Worlds says, why stop there? The game features Jeeps, steam rollers, rideable dragons and eagles, horses, bears, a drilling machine, helicopters, and airplanes. (Sidenote, the physics realism for the planes and helicopters is total bullcrap, but it&apos;s still a blast.) The second big thing about Lego Worlds is the map size. Going in, I was worried that the game wouldn&apos;t have very much to explore and I would discover the entire world pretty quickly. Have no fear, this is not the case. The first world I selected had roughly eight or nine different biomes ranging from tundra to redwood forest to candyland to Japan (cherry trees and pagodas). The maps are so large it is almost a bad thing. Finally, the third pro for the game is the preset buildings. In the game menu, you have several different pre-built structures that you can throw on the map whenever and wherever you want. This is still in its infant stage, but I imagine great possibilities as the game comes of age.
<br>Finally we get to the good stuff. You want to know, what makes the game unique? What makes this an experience I need to pay fifteen bucks for? Well, first off, the game makes terraforming really easy. Remember in minecraft when you wanted to build a structure in survival mode and had to spend literally days clearing a spot of land for your castle or roller coaster? You don&apos;t have that problem in Lego Worlds. They give you a tool that automatically smooths, raises, or lowers any terrain that you want. It makes constructing a foundation very enjoyable. The second big thing Lego Worlds does is colors. The color palate is sizeable, unlike minecraft without mods. It&apos;&apos;s also much easier to simply dye any block you want a certain color. Finally, the last big thing that makes Lego Worlds different from the competition is the lack of fall damage. You may not think this is a big deal, but it is. It just is.
<br>Would I buy the game again after having put 5 plus hours into it? Yes. Is it great in its current state? No. Will it get better? Most assuredly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lego-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=5294200">Expand</a></span>

There are three parts of Minecraft: Digging, building and crafting. People often say exploration is a key part of Minecraft; it is not. You can literally spawn, walk 5 blocks to a tree, start punching it and you&apos;re done for the rest of the game. I do like Minecraft, but there are many differences in this game. This game offers proper exploration. You start in the woods, find a horse, and you travel to a land full of candy canes and cupcakes and find a gun and a plane! The exploration is literally endless.
<br>
<br>The building. The building in this game is often the point of the negative/positive ratings. Contrary to popular thought, building is actually not that difficult. The brick by brick build is actually far more simple than most people think. If you actually read how to do it, you&apos;d know that you can drag a brick using left shift and I made myself a fully operational castle with individual rooms in under an hour. Try doing that in Minecraft survival.
<br>
<br>Another thing is the pre-fabs. They are amazing. I have made my own town with roads (using the steam roller) and houses, and barns, and even a McDonald&apos;s down the road. The creation in this game, like the exploration, is pretty much endless.
<br>
<br>The building is far easier than most people think and the exploration is amazing and endless. I have nothing major to fault on this game, especially since it is in early access. The one, tiny, tiny fault is the third person view. Aiming is very hard with guns and bow and arrows and I think it would be a wonderful addition to add a first person view that is optional.
<br>
<br>TL;DR: The exploration in this game is incredibly fun and endless, the building takes a bit of skill but once read up on is easy, and the endless creation is amazing, but this is NOT Minecraft. Third person view can be buggy but otherwise this is an amazing game. I recommend to anyone who likes LEGO and who is very creative.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lego-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=5352924">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Before we get into the review, I want to talk about the game&apos;s early access status and their Youtube policy.
<br>Yes, it&apos;s an early access title. As such, there&apos;s always the possibility that the game will never be finished. However, the devs have maintained constant communication, offered frequent feature updates, and have already shipped a number of LEGO games (TT Games) for Warner Bros. They&apos;re a pretty good studio with a huge publisher backing them. I&apos;ll never say never, but it&apos;s pretty unlikely that the project will be shelved this far into development  given its feedback on Steam.
<br>
<br>Second, I know a lot of us like to stream on Twitch or upload videos to Youtube. The devs have explicitly stated on the Steam Community forums that they are fine with this, so you shouldn&apos;t have to worry about copyright strikes. Now, let&apos;s get to the good stuff!
<br>
<br>First, let&apos;s address performance. I have a decidedly mid-range computer (FX-8120, GeForce 760). Under DirectX 11, the game runs adequately, and MUCH better than it did when it first became available on Steam&apos;s Early Access. The performance gets a little better with each update, so I&apos;d be surprised if it wasn&apos;t completely optimized by release.
<br>
<br>Second, let&apos;s take a look at the gameplay. Some people are of the opinion that this is a Minecraft clone. I disagree. It is definitely the same genre as Minecraft (sandbox creation), but the ability to build things in procedural worlds is about the only similarity on that front. In fact, this game&apos;s creation tools are much more versatile, with the notable exception of not having a circuit system (like redstone) as of the last time I played. LEGO Worlds rewards discovery by allowing players to become characters they have met or recall vehicles and animals they have discovered. The kits are a nice touch as well, allowing you to instantly create entire sets that you have found in-game. While you can still manually create anything you could with real LEGO bricks, you have additional options here. On a somewhat different gameplay note, LEGO Worlds also added a quest system a couple updates back for those who want a break from the sandbox and would like a bit more &quot;traditional&quot; gameplay goals. They&apos;re by no means required, but they are nice for those of you who like game-set goals once in a while.
<br>
<br>Next, let&apos;s talk about graphics and art direction. The art direction and graphics are familiar to anyone who has played any of the recent LEGO games. This is probably due to the fact that the same studio is behind this one. If you like that art style, you&apos;ll like this one. If you don&apos;t, you won&apos;t. If you couldn&apos;t care less about graphics and simply want to create your LEGO empire of doom, they&apos;re more than adequate. Personally, I like the art style, but that&apos;s just my preference.
<br>
<br>If the ability to create anything you want with an infinite set of LEGO bricks sounds like something you&apos;d like, then this game is definitely worth checking out. If the lack of a redstone equivalent is a dealbreaker, wait a little longer to see what gets implemented.
<br>
<br>Now, let&apos;s talk about the features that AREN&apos;T in the game yet:
<br>-Online multiplayer: the devs have continously said that this will arrive later on. That being said, I am of the personal opinion that this will be implemented MUCH closer to release.
<br>-Underground cave networks: The devs say that they will also be procedurally generated.
<br>-Towns, villages, settlements.
<br>-Underwater gameplay (vehicles and creatures)
<br>-Other things that aren&apos;t that important to me but you can check out on their Steam listing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lego-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=6100023">Expand</a></span>

Of course, there are a few aspects of this game that needs to be fixed such as the brick building but the creativity included is so wide that is shadows over a couple bugs and improvements.

There are many tools to use like: Add/ subtract big chunks of lego at a time, specific 1-piece placement, &amp; paint. You explore to find things like vehicles, items, &amp; characters who you can use to customize your character. This game is still early access when this review was written, so it will only get better.</span>

These quests introduce you to the different mechanics LEGO Worlds has to offer. After that, you&apos;re (almost) free to go wherever you like. By finding or unlocking gold bricks you are able to unlock bigger worlds. All the worlds are randomly generated. This brings with it some issues which can happen, like trees clipping through the ground. However, this issue is contained to only a few moments.
<br>
<br>The focus in this LEGO game is on creativity and exploration. You can use the tools you&apos;re offered to build anything you want. Unfortunately you start off with very few bricks, and you have to catch so called Troublemakers (little green creatures) that carry new types of bricks.
<br>
<br>This process is tedious if you just want to build stuff. So here are some cons::
<br>- No creative mode, where all the bricks are unlocked
<br>- The random generation can very rarely cause clipping
<br>- You&apos;re not able to go to the biggest world immediately
<br>- It still has some bugs that need to be worked out
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- There&apos;s a lot of bricks to discover (probably just about every real life LEGO brick that exists)
<br>- The different tools are intuitive and easy to use
<br>- It has good performance on PC
<br>- It&apos;s the only LEGO game which allows for so much exploring and discovering
<br>- The building mechanics are very good
<br>- The randomly generated worlds (while sometimes buggy) are nice to look at
<br>- There&apos;s plenty of quests on pretty much every planet
<br>- The progression through the game is well implemented
<br>- The game doesn&apos;t get boring
<br>
<br>In a period of 3 days I have recieved 3 or 4 updates. The developers are active and the community is thriving. I&apos;m 100% confident that this game with only get better and better. Therefore it&apos;s a temporary 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lego-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=7099009">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I like this game, however now that I have 80 gold bricks I am seeing problems. When I open some of the chests, i just get coins and nothing else??? Sometimes there is an error where I have to restart the game. Also there are some glitches in the game. When you look at each map it doesn&apos;t tell you how many gold bricks are there.</span>

                                        <span>LEGO Worlds is a weird game for no one in particular. Younger players will be happy seeing brick men jumping around brick worlds but they won&apos;t be able to complete most tasks. Older players will become bored by low difficulty level and repetitiveness. There is hope in the inevitable additional content - fingers crossed for free distribution.</span>
