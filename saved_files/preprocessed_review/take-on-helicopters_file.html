The game&apos;s easy going and the campaign pretty much takes you from total novice to feeling yourself pretty much in control of the different choppers, which is pretty much to say. The game also puts you in a great deal of the real situations chopper pilots face in their day to day operations, but spicing them with the interest of the story-driven campaign. This keeps the interest up and will surely meet the needs of users that are attracted to flight sims but keep their distance because of this type of games difficulty and lack of objective. The visuals are just gorgeous and the terrains, while constraint to &apos;just&apos; 20 thousand square kilometers of Seattle and South Asia territory, are more than enough (after all, we&apos;re not flying supersonic jets but helicopters: Much less speed and altitude). Regarding the flight model... After several thousand hours using simulators with realistic flight models (and that excludes FSX for the sake of choppers), I can say that the different difficulty levels excel in allowing you to face a flight model that can go from *very* realistic (and thus, a hell of a challenge to master) to *very* comfortable (while keeping the sensation you&apos;re in a sim and not in a fast paced simplified arcade). What I also found really fantastic is that the game can be enjoyed with just keyboard and mouse, but it will also accept a 360 pad and, of course, a full fledged joystick/throttle/pedals set up. It might need a little tampering with the joystick configuration, though, to get it working comfortably, as the initial settings for control sticks are a bit clumsy.<br><br>So, basically, I found it a great game that offers very interesting perks to simulation fans (without pretending to be a hardcore simulator) and will engage players that are more casual sim players or even that are looking for &quot;some place to start&quot;. Worth the while for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/take-on-helicopters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2098206">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s some nice non-violent fun that acts as an aid to learning how to fly helicopters. There are issues, but the biggest issue for me is simply that the game was too short. I played with a joystick and did not use auto-hover, by the time I got to the end of the game, I felt like I had just mastered all aspects of flying helicopters, from hovering, to landing, to auto-rotation, and even sling loads. But at that point, I was hoping the game was going to give me some harder challenges to really put my skills to the test, instead the game just ended. It&apos;s basically a very long tutorial on how to become a helicopter pilot, and for that, it&apos;s great! If that is what you are looking for then this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/take-on-helicopters/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272830">Expand</a></span>

Take On Helicopters is not as realistic and detailed as some other hardcore flight-simulators yet the game is still demanding and rewarding to master. Terrain graphics look excellent especially around Seattle center with lots of tall and shiny buildings. On other areas graphics quality varies but that&apos;s understandable considering the huge areas of real world terrain the game covers. Creation of user made content (missions, addons, mods) will benefit from the existing creative community based on ArmA-series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/take-on-helicopters/user-reviews?user_review_id=1986624">Expand</a></span>

Graphics is indeed excellent but the feeling you have with the joystick is very very bad and frustrating. So for serious flying I would still recommend FSX and since there are a lot of missions there you can have great fun.</span>
