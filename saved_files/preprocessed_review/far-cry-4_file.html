<br>If you played FarCry3: NOT SO GOOD!
<br>There are some good and bad things about this game. To stay positive, since they game is enjoyable for me, first the good.
<br>
<br>The scenery looks amazing. Tried playing on high and low and preferred low for the FPS, but on all settings, the game looks great for the settings. The big snowy mountains in the background are never dull and really add to the scenery. Character models are nice, faces of important characters are very well made and the terrain overall looks pretty fine, especially when you know that the requirements of the game are not that high. Combat and movement are fluent, the small helicopter is extremely fun to roam the skies and shoot nades from your Grenade Launcher and the game overall feel very solid. Not too suprising if you know that this is the exact same engine as FC3. Which immidiately brings me to the bad stuff:
<br>
<br>If you played FC3, you will almost think FC4 is a DLC of FC3. They might have called it FarCry 3.5 since almost all weapons made a return, a lot of vehicles made a return, ALL signature weapons made a return. Hell, the entire concept made a return. There is little innovation and new stuff in FC4. Although that is not a very bad thing, since it all worked in FC3, it shows some kind of lazyness not to change, or at least add, some stuff. A lot of new guns would be nice, different vehicles would be awesome and new types of enemies and missions cannot hurt. But you face the exact same type of enemies. Even the &quot;heavies&quot; are the same. There is also something kind of off about the combat.
<br>
<br>The PC version has a lot of port-issues, such as a ring for weapons (that is console stuff, PC has numbers) which is not a huge issue, but there appears to be very subtle, yet annoying mouse-acceleration, eventhough every accelleration was turned off. This makes (precise) aiming very annoying.
<br>
<br>FC4 also suffers from frame-drops when you move fast. Every 10 seconds your frames will half when you are racing. Not a huge problem, but annoying as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4735087">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My point is this: Farcry 3 made you FEEL like Jason Brody. You were Jason Brody when he was panicking, tears in his eyes, running from the fresh corpse of his brother Grant. You felt his fear, and you watched through his eyes as he changed. How the hell does Ajay Ghale have no problem just... shooting people? Where did he learn all of his skills? It just makes no sense, there is no characterization, and it feels like you&apos;re just playing some random mercenary. I wish I could give this game a 10, but it doesn&apos;t have a moral or a soul like Farcry 3 did...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4729864">Expand</a></span>

It is essentially a remake of Far Cry 3, with identical mission progression and extremely similar sounding voices. A few gameplay fixes have been made here and there such as making co-op a drop in affair rather than having its own campaign, or making the vehicle repair tool contextual rather than filling a weapon slot. The villain now calls you on your cell phone repeatedly throughout the game, a la Handsome Jack, a storytelling element that I find annoying. The only other thing that really distinguishes it from Far Cry 3 is that the gameplay is awfully buggy. I preordered the game and have experienced maybe 30 or more distinct bugs within 12 hours of playing. A very cynical and run of the mill release through and through; if they could have released this last year, one year after FC3, they would have. Prepare to not be surprised on a game level or on how Ubisoft inevitably will react to any criticism from PC (i.e. more experienced) consumers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4729501">Expand</a></span>

It improves on everything we thought  made Far Cry 3 such a success. Its no revolution but the sheer amount of pure fun and enjoyability you gain from it is incredible and is an extremely solid entry in a franchise with high standards. The graphics here are definitely a step up from its predecessor. The heavily improved fur as well as the godrays make the game look as stunning as ever. The weapons remain solid as before but with more variety and realism added to them (most, anyway). A couple things that would make this the perfect Far Cry game would be a lot more customization options - not only for the weapons but also your attire. The land vehicles seem the same as before. They don&apos;t feel unique enough but the air vehicle (the Buzzer) makes what would have been long and boring journeys an exciting zip across the luscious landscape of Kyrat. The story was decent  but what I thought was well done was the character development as well as the choices you are able to make between them. Overall, these features make Far Cry 4 a solid entry in the series and highly enjoyable. (The references to other games don&apos;t hurt) If you even remotely like Far Cry 3, this would be an obvious purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4709484">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is actually really good. It performs really well, and it is a lot of fun. If you enjoyed Far Cry 3, you will like this one aswell. And well, unlike AC Unity this one actually works. ;)</span>

Now? It&apos;s a solid TEN. Why the change? Because Ubisoft made the critical mistake of releasing a game without adequate QA testing on very common, standard PC setups and peripherals. I was unable to play for more than a week. However, now that the game has been successfully patched to run correctly with a Logitech G13 controller, I must say two things:
<br>
<br>1) It&apos;s WAY more rich and interesting than Far Cry 3. The people claiming that &quot;it&apos;s just a reskinned FC3 with nothing new or different&quot; are IMO totally nuts. Ubisoft has added a LOT of new mechanics and fine tuned some things that were &quot;meh&quot; about FC3. The &quot;autopilot&quot; on ground vehicles is a GREAT and welcome enhancement over getting around. Set your waypoint, get the vehicle moving on the road with a waypoint path, then go autopilot. You can set the speed, look at the scenery, fight, etc. Glider suits are AWESOME: leap off any cliff or hill and glide as much as you like with this always-ready transportation. Grapple points, climbing, swinging, re-grappling at the end of swings, etc. is all so very much fun. The ultralight copters let you fly directly from point A to point B and are reusable as long as you don&apos;t damage them.  Plenty of transport options every where, all the time, including the awesome Elephant riding. Taking forts is tougher and more interesting. The AI of all the standard enemy types is noticeably better than in FC3. And finally: Hunters. OMG, the new Hunter enemy types are just hella fun to fight and play cat and mouse with.
<br>
<br>2) The storyline is solid. It&apos;s different than FC3. The actors/characters are IMO more engaging than in FC3. The voice acting is great. Pagan Min is a great villain who keeps you guessing and seemingly has shades of gray rather than being a cartoon cutout villain. The two opposing leaders of the Golden Path are both sympathetic, interesting, and believable. There are way more decision points (interesting, not easy decision points), and way more types of quests and &quot;completionist&quot; objectives, with useful rewards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4718138">Expand</a></span>

After playing the game for some hours however I felt let down. In total I now played 30 hours of Far Cry 4 and have it de-installed, while with Far Cry 3 I played almost 100 hours before de-installing.
<br>
<br>Story
<br>Far Cry 3 had been commented on for having a poor story, but the story of Far Cry 4 is worse by a million times. Far Cry 4 has the story depth of an average Steven Segal, Sylvester Stallone or
<br>Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. If you only care about action and not about story than you wont be bothered. If you like to have some sense of emerging into a story than this is total crap.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>Gameplay is exactly the same as Far Cry 3. Some things slightly changed as you can read in other reviews. Some weapons are added, different side missions, but the core gameplay is exactly the same. Wish they changed the need for the skinning of animals from the start. It was a nice touch in Far Cry 3, but going to that again just bothers people. It&apos;s just how fast can I get to all the animals to have proper gear. The expansion of the wallet, ammunition and weapon belt is almost mandatory before going very far into the game.
<br>
<br>Online
<br>For me the replay value of Far Cry 3 was in the ability to go online and play coop against AI with other players and go through a level together. This has now been taken out of the game and you get a default FPS online environment which is the same as with other FPS games. For me this is absolutely a big negative as a really enjoyed the online gameplay in Far Cry 3. In Far Cry 4 the gameplay is nothing new to someone playing BF or CoD and is even worse than those competitors.
<br>
<br>Coop
<br>Far Cry 4 has coop gameplay in the open world, which was pretty much the only thing new that I enjoyed. The coop gameplay is however far from what it could have been. It will only be possible to do side missions with you coop partner and no main missions. Taking down a fort is fun with a coop partner, it doesn&apos;t really feel as much fun as going through a mission together. The missions is where the chaos and the mayhem are biggest and most fun. One of the last missions where you encounter a lot of opposition would be great to play coop. This isn&apos;t possible however. What I also didn&apos;t get is why taking a fort together isn&apos;t taken into account in the game for the person joining. Like this is feels like duplicate work. Also freeing towers isn&apos;t taken to the joining players game. Coop was nice but could have been much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4871715">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The high point of the game for me was the whole tug of war between Sabal and Amita for the direction of the Golden Path. There wasn&apos;t a clear cut choice for which direction was the &quot;right&quot; one. Do you take the idealistic route and try to live up to the high expectations placed upon you and side with Sabal or do you take the side of Amita who makes good, well reasoned arguments and has a clear plan for the future? Unfortunately, those missions are few and far between and this dynamic between Sabal and Amita never shows up in the game in any meaningful way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4893478">Expand</a></span>

Pity then that it spends so much of its time trying NOT to be an open world shooter. Had Ubisoft simply provided an opening cutscene and dropped the player into a large, open, hostile world to figure out how to get back at Pagan Min this game would easily have been a 9/10 or better.
<br>
<br>But Ubisoft had to have their scripted, linear narrative. It is, predictability, utterly forgettable. At best. Pagan Min does his best Handsome Jack impression - badly. Attempts to try and humanize the bad guys fall flat and even feel contrived. The writing is poor and the pacing worse. And those are just the main missions.
<br>
<br>The side missions are worse still. Utter filler material, bringing nothing of value to the game. Poor writing, uninteresting characters and contrived mission structure abound. Robbing you of gear, forcing stealth with auto fail, making you literally chase your belongings half way across the world. Stuff such as this inflates play time, but without respect to the player. It exists only as filler and adds nothing of quality to the game.
<br>
<br>Technically the game is sound. It stutters constantly even with a GTI 770 2GB and 8GB RAM on on a core i7 4770 machine. And that is on high. The game simply isn&apos;t sufficiently optimized to run on Ultra even with that machine.
<br>
<br>Far Cry 4 gets a high scores for its open world, shooting, outpost raids, climbing and free-form side missions. Then I venture into the realm of its mediocre plot and forced main missions - another game wherein my experience will be the same as everyone else&apos;s - and immediately the score begins its downhill skid.
<br>
<br>Far Cry 4 is a great open world shooter. When its allowed to be just that it shines. But the extras piled on - and getting in the way of - that open world, make this the last Ubi game I will ever purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4786714">Expand</a></span>

Ultimately you have to confront a white-haired Asian-esque dude with a baddy Brit accent, with a pink suit, who will babble to you at the end about the meaning of making certain choices, but basically you don&apos;t care because you&apos;ve already murdered so much wildlife and goons, you know you&apos;ll be heading where the sun doesn&apos;t shine when it&apos;s all over. Basically, I loved the addition of Fortresses, and the endless repetitive/samey side-missions were still addictive. But, what on earth is going on with the texture pop-ins, even on a Titan X! Music, fantastic, and seriously great animals. I reckon for the next one it should be Vietnam, but with a twist that deep in some Viet Cong jungle there is a dinosaur cave that accidentally gets discovered :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5321939">Expand</a></span>

But what I got is a fast passed regular FPS the main antagonist gave the character nor me any reason to go after him and the character never shows any reaction to the killings he does. Also the voice of skinning is the same as Far Cry 3 and none of the story line missions fully move anywhere until you get to Act 2.
<br>But there are curve balls and a lot of interesting things along with it such as terrain being a weapon, new enemy type to fight and being able to bring in wild animals from the woods to fight for you that made me not want to give this a bad review but it isn&apos;t enough for a good one either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4877563">Expand</a></span>

<br>Again and again Ubisoft releasing remakes of old (and good games), but with higher price and tons of bugs. This is absolutely average game, which is the absolute copy-paste from FAR CRY 3, but with some very minor changes and other exterior. It&apos;s not funny, because we saw that many times. The most annoying part is the story, with absolutely illogical script, missions don&apos;t make any sense, and characters aren&apos;t interesting at all.
<br>
<br>But if you want to burn 60$ and a couple of days, you may buy it. It&apos;s not so bad game, as it can be (sic! Unity)

<br>
<br>1: It&apos;s just Far Cry 3 in a different place. That&apos;s no bad thing as Far Cry 3 was a brilliant game but when you&apos;re being asked to shell out &#xA3;40 for a &quot;new&quot; game, it&apos;s a little insulting to find that it&apos;s little more than a big expansion pack.
<br>
<br>2: It has obviously been developed for consoles first. This means clumsy UIs and some really basic errors that shouldn&apos;t be present in a released game. See points 3 and 4.
<br>
<br>3: Out of the box it&apos;s unplayable due to mouse acceleration that cannot be turned off without unpacking, editing and re-packing the game files. The mouse sensitivity is also painfully low, which means that you have to have it cranked up to 100% to get close to being playable.
<br>
<br>4: The game runs at 60FPS for me but it doesn&apos;t feel like it. Due to a stuttering issue it feels as though it&apos;s running at 15FPS. It&apos;s painful to look at but it can be cured by buffering frames.
<br>
<br>5: Point 3 means that you can&apos;t play the game on multiplayer as the edited game files make the server think you&apos;re cheating.
<br>
<br>So, in conclusion, if you&apos;re happy to pay &#xA3;40 for some DLC that either sort of works as single player only, or doesn&apos;t work at all but is single and multiplayer, then go for it. Otherwise wait until they get off their arses and patch out the problems that should have been caught in alpha testing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4782086">Expand</a></span>

<br>Glad i did wait because my pc port does not have a single issue. it was all patched and ready to play.
<br>Now about the actual gameplay pretty much FAR CRY 3.5, aside from the grapple,riding a elephant and using as a weapon against the enemy(which is hilarious!) and the gyro-copter (which i do love makes getting around the map easy among other things) all the things in FAR CRY 3 remain the same.
<br>To be honest it is very repetitive once you do each thing a few times the game really does not have much to keep it super interesting.
<br>The story is really bad, i like the story is 3 much more, the characters in FC4 just have no life to them?
<br>even the main villain is not all the great.
<br>and the character YOU play is so uninteresting that i still do not know who the hell he actually is! LOL!
<br>Flat,one dimensional and dull is the words i would pick for the characters and story in this game.
<br>I am giving it a 5  because it has decent graphics and the gameplay is smooth. it is not a  overall great game though!
<br>On a final note, i cannot believe that there was not a option to turn off the radio in the vehicles when you get into them! other than the gyro-copter every single vehicle has a LOUD radio playing really distracting,annoying hindu type music or news broadcasts. I hate that a lot in this game,cant even enjoy riding around the map because of it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5199158">Expand</a></span>

So at first glance this game is pretty good, however a few hours of gameplay later and you will be telepathically screaming pure, unbridled hatred at Ubisoft for releasing an unfinished game. So to summarize...
<br>
<br>1. Game fails to save half way through campagne (if you&apos;re lucky).
<br>2. The game will crash to desktop 1/5 times you play.
<br>3. Game will crash if you don&apos;t complete a mission &quot;correctly&quot;.
<br>4. Texture popping becomes distracting.
<br>5. AI is very glitchy and poorly implemented.
<br>6. Textures can be clipped through causing you to fall under the map.
<br>7. Story is terrible and predictable with some recycled audio/character models from FC3.
<br>8. Audio often switches off randomly.
<br>9. Character glitches are quite common.
<br>10. The &quot;open world&quot; is covered, and I mean COVERED in invisible walls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4914913">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Game itself is quite fun, though yes it is Far Cry 3 with new characters, a new story, new map, etc. I have no issue with a repeat from Far Cry 3, i still want more Far Cry 3. It&apos;s okay to not drastically change a game for each new entry, though hopefully for the next installment they change it up a little, it would very much sadden me to see Far Cry become Assassins Creed or Call of Duty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4791386">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game runs better than AC:U but it still have some small performance and stutter issues (45-90 fps)
<br>Just like everyone other Ubisoft title this game has bugs and crashing issues
<br>Also game gets boring and repetitive really quick (did i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?
<br>insanity is doing the exact same **** thing over and over again, expecting **** to change.)

                                        <span>Played a couple of hours and its OK, I guess.. Feels like something is missing tho. Lots of cut n paste set pieces from Far Cry 3 - limited originality, in fact, it could easy be an expansion for FC3.  Graphics are OK but I have seen much better (Metro series)
<br>I&apos;ve just no desire to play it - its not fresh and new, feels like I&apos;ve done it all before. 6/10</span>

<br>Lets look at AC, Watch dogs and Far cry- the gameplay core of these games is the same. Open world with towers/high places to climb on and reveal map, camps/towers to liberate/hack to get new missions, lot of stuff to collect and craft new items/weapons. I mean the setting is different, one is FPS and the other 3rd person perspective gta clone, but main ideas behind gameplay are the same. Theres nothing new or original here, youve done this million times. When i play shooter i dont want to feel im playing Assassins creed with guns, but here i do. Games made by Ubi in fact is one and the same game made in different variations. It may be good craft, but theres zero art and heart here. Its just product to sell, not &quot;from players for players&quot;.
<br>Other problem is milking series. Playing the same boring Assassin game after game, year after year, and now Far cries- i just gave up. Even devs and reviewers (who give 10 after release- hypocrytes) after years admit that a lot of these games are bad entries in series. So why the hell you release them? Why do we need FC4, Ac brotherhood, Ac revelations, Ac rogue? They dont bring anything new, cool or interesting. They are just fillers. I wont be buying Ubi games anymore (games from EA i stopped buying after BF4, they milk series the same way).
<br>Far cry 2 was released in 2008, Far cry 3 in 2012- 4 years break. People wanted next title in series, wanted next open world shooter, people were curious. Maybe thats why it was such a success. But because it was, i bet now we will get another Far cry every year. And as in Ac there are zero changes, also in Far cry 4 there are 0 changes. Only settings is different and coop is added, the rest is the same as in Far cry 3, with less likable and memorable characters and plot. This doesnt feel like another title at all, its just big dlc.
<br>And looking at another FC3 dlc- Blood dragon- its how you create dlcs. It was fun, it has nice graphical filters, new enemies and nice story and humor from &apos;80 movies. I loved it. So Ubi can make interesting game. So why the hell they give us this sh*t year after year? I know, $$$ is the king of the world.
<br>I dont even start with technical issues people have with this game on pc.
<br>Cant recommend this game, its more of the same, you better play FC3/Blood dragon again, and save money for something else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4755858">Expand</a></span>

But I was wrong, Oh boy was I wrong. Where do I begin, oh yah the beginning the only part I got to because I couldn&apos;t handle the rest.
<br>
<br>Lets start with the intro, I couldn&apos;t skip the animations for the creators (Ubisoft and others). Now, I usually don&apos;t mind this if it takes 10-15 seconds but almost a full minute of stupid animations that NOONE in their right minds wants to watch. So After sitting there for a minute spamming every key on my keyboard I got the main minute. This is where the fun really starts.
<br>
<br>I go into the options right away because the audio is blasting(Which is normal for all games) and turn down the master audio and the music audio. The music audio at first I only turn it down to about 5% and it still didn&apos;t go down at all so I muted it. IT STILL PLAYED MUSIC! How is this acceptable. I turn off the music and it is still going as loud as it could possibly go. Great, perfect start.
<br>
<br>I go to hit the apply button on the bottom left hand side of the screen and oh look I can&apos;t reach it without having to lift my hand and reset my mouse to the top of my mouse pad because for some reason there is a lowered mouse sensitivity or mouse acceleration is turned on. So I go into the mouse sensitivity settings and acceleration is off so that&apos;s not the issue and the sensitivity is normal so I don&apos;t what is wrong with the mouse.
<br>
<br>OK That&apos;s not that bad, I&apos;ll just start up a new game. The audio level is to low, I&apos;ll pause the cut scene and up the audio a bit. NOPE can&apos;t go into the options or pause it or do anything. Who in their right minds creates a game with a 5 minute cut scene without a pause option. That makes no sense to me what so ever. If I needed to get up and get some popcorn or use the bathroom I couldn&apos;t even stop the mini-movie(That&apos;s what I call it because it was sooooo long). I&apos;ll just Alt-Tab the game and adjust the audio in the mixer. (I previously set it to borderless window mode).  I Alt-Tab and I adjust the audio levels so that I can hear the movie. I try to get back into the movie and the screen is messed up. It goes into windowed mode and the resolution is all messed up making it so that half of the screen is unviewable. I power through the first cut scene with a smallr screen and better audio levels.
<br>
<br>The second one right after the first NO GAME PLAY IN BETWEEN. I have been sitting watching a movie for to long and I get rewarded with more of the movie. I just want to play the game at this point. This cut scene for some reason has audio levels that are way higher than the previous. So even if I had normal audio levels at the start this cut scene would be to loud. Yet again I Alt-Tab to adjust the settings because I still can&apos;t pause it.
<br>
<br>Oh Joy! The movie has ended and I can move my character! Excellent. Oh wait my screen is still broken let me go into the settings and fix it. I go into the options and I try to move my mouse to the video options. I can&apos;t the screen ends. I can&apos;t move the screen or anything. I can&apos;t adjust the settings that brought me to this situation anyways. So I can&apos;t fix this issue which means I would have to restart the game and go through the movie again. Which I am not about to do.
<br>
<br>Congratulations Ubisoft you have made me hate a game that I haven&apos;t even played after I purchased it. GG
<br>
<br>TLDR: Long intro animations, horrible audio controls, and horrible UI settings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4865876">Expand</a></span>

Pagan Min doesn&apos;t come close to Vaas, he feels fake and overly dramatic whereas Vaas felt truly insane, as he himself claimed. I even preferred to save Brody&apos;s dumb rich friends than the weird Kyrat people. The protagonist is a complete misunderstanding, reminds me of Connor from AC 3, really unintersting guy.
<br>This is subjective, but I hate the mountain enviroment of Kyrat, whereas I adored Rook Islands from FC 3. it just doesn&apos;t speak to me at all.
<br>Side missions are a disappointment. It feels like they are trying too hard to be different than in FC 3 but they became worse in the process.
<br>Main missions are even worse, not interesting at all, and not very much of them either.
<br>There are less syringes and less skills. Only two trees instead of three, everything simplified for no reason.
<br>Honestly, I feel no incentive to even finish the game, and I&apos;m not even thinking about 100 % completion !
<br>I also had major technical issues with the game, it&apos;s a poor console port and the UI is terrible. Took me hours to fix the biggest mouse-related problems.
<br>It has some good thing of course, the free roam is there and the hunting as well but it&apos;s a shadow of the previous part.
<br>It&apos;s a cash grab and should be avoided to teach Ubi a thing or two about proper game development. Gets 6/10 for what good it took out from FC 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4845395">Expand</a></span>

Not only is the game poorly optimized and TERRIBLY ported over to PC, it&apos;s mostly a cut and paste from Far Cry 3. If you enjoyed FC3 a lot and wanted more, then I WOULD have recommended this game to you wholeheartedly, if it was not for Ubisoft&apos;s ATROCIOUS job of porting over they did with this game.
<br>
<br>This is coming from a competitive PC fps player: The controls in this game are so terribly made for PC that I could barely get past the first fights of the game on normal difficulty. If you expect to be able to play this game with a mouse and keyboard, DO NOT BUY IT. Also, if you have anything but an enthusiast grade PC and expect to run this game on more than the lowest graphical settings, DO NOT BUY IT.
<br>
<br>However, if you happen to have a very beefy machine, and happen to be alright with buying a PC game just to play with a controller, and happen to really like FC3 game mechanics (They reused just about all of them) then this game is rather excellent. The main story took me about 15 hours to complete, full of colorful views, great characters, and immensely improved writing in comparison to FC3. This game could have been amazing, however, because of the very slim portion of people who will actually be able to enjoy this game out of how many who think they will, I cannot recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4753637">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story, which for me was the main selling point, was a let-down. It took a total of 12 hours for me to complete the main missions with no fast travel, and it was not as immersive or captivating as the Far Cry 3 story. Ajay Ghale pretty much starts as a boring tourist, similar to Jason Brody from Far Cry 3, but has pretty much no motive that we, the players, can to relate to. Jason Brody on the other hand had the motive of revenge and his character developed over the course of the game, which allowed him to be a character that absorbed the player. Ajay had pretty much no developement as he went from tourist to super solider with no development, and nothing to attach you to the character. Ajay and main characters met throughout the game did not seem interesting and I had no desire to learn more about them, much less work with them. More over, in the very end Ajay does not even spread his mother&apos;s ashes, which made the entire story seem like a waste.
<br>
<br>On PC (and consoles) the game was horrendously buggy. There were numerous times where I had to unplug USB devices just to get the game to start. If you get the game up and running, there are more bugs to behold. The main one being stuttering, which primarily happens as you are moving fast in vehicles. This stuttering makes driving absolutely horrendous, when it could be an enjoyable thing to do. Other bugs include sliding up hills, fall damage from 3 feet (or none from 30), pitch black shadows, falling through the map, birds perching in mid-air, etc.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is a debatable issue. Personally, the game did not add enough from Far Cry 3 to demand a $60 price tag. The grappling system was a neat feature, but it would be much better if it could be used on all mountain or hill sides instead of the designated spots. Uncovering portions of the map is also the same, as you climb up a rickety radio tower, which gives you weapons and uncovers portions of the map (which aren&apos;t even completely covered when the map is opened). Only a handful of new weapons were added, because like most things in the game, they were reused from Far Cry 3. Vehicles were also the same with the exception of the ability to ride elephants and the gyrocopter. You can also set an &apos;autodrive&apos; feature, which drives the car for you, so that you can focus on shooting instead of driving. This feature is let down by the inability to avoid crashes because the car still hits other cars, or even pedestrians in the road.
<br>
<br>A bland story line, very few new features, bugs galore, led to a game that was not near as good as it predecessor. Maybe if Ubisoft patches the game (though unlikely) and the prices drops to ~$30 it will be worth the purchase, but at the moment it is just a piss-poor excuse for an AAA title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4778525">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve spent over 100 hours playing FC3 and loved almost every moment of it. I bought Far Cry 4 hoping for all the mechanics of FC3 in a new environment, with higher fidelity graphics.
<br>
<br>And then I remembered. I was playing FC3 with Ziggy&apos;s mod.
<br>
<br>The terrible horror dawned on me that I&apos;d be playing FC4 with its native, vanilla UI, gun physics, HUD, sounds, and gun customization rules. And they are teh-ri-bull!
<br>
<br>1. I&apos;m not a baby, please don&apos;t give me a perpetual objective reminder that I can&apos;t turn off, (unlike everything else in the HUD).
<br>2. Why is it that a gun can only have one attachment at a time? You&apos;re telling me that a silencer is okay. A scope is okay. But a silencer AND a scope? WHAT ARE YOU CRAAZY?!
<br>
<br>The story is really boring, and a poor attempt to recapture what they did in FC3 (charismatic villain) rather than innovate. Dammit Ubisoft, you got to FC3 by innovating, WHY WOULD YOU STOP AT FC4? Take some risks you cowards. The protagonist has an even weaker impetus to push forward (he wants help spreading his mother&apos;s ashes?! How does that even compare to rescuing your friends from sex slavery or death?! Way to undercut the drama Ubisoft!).
<br>
<br>Tidat is a nice spectacle -- the visuals are certainly different from FC3&apos;s lush tropical islands. In fact, the visual pallet is quite bland by comparison. And underwhelming.
<br>
<br>Graphics are a step up in the game when it comes to human models--the faces of villagers and characters are nearly photorealistic. Granted, I&apos;m running two GTX Titans in SLI, so I have all settings maxed out. But the rendering is really very beautiful.
<br>
<br>In short:
<br>+Prettier engine and textures
<br>
<br>-Intrusive UI
<br>-Boring protagonist (why do I care about what I&apos;m doing?)
<br>-A step back in story from FC3
<br>-Hamstrung gun mechanics
<br>-Bland setting
<br>
<br>Ultimately a stale attempt to recreate the glory of FC3 by recycling old material rather than innovating on prior successes. Game devs, you do get points for creativity, and whoever was overseeing FC4 had clearly clocked out to lunch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4800311">Expand</a></span>

Basically, the mouse acceleration cannot be fully disabled by any method, and it feels as if the mouse has been scripted as a virtual analog joystick device with all manner of strange acceleration effects.  Really, really poor and frustrating if you&apos;re an experienced PC gamer.  There are loads and loads of other bugs as well, from mission scripts being broken, needing to alt-tab in and out of game to make cutscenes play, black screen issues, horrendous frame tearing on relatively high-end video hardware, and more.  And the worst part is that Ubi, so far, have failed to acknowledge many of these issues -- most notably the poor mousing.  As a fan of Far Cry 3, I have been really let down with my experience of this game so far.  I honestly cannot recommend it until improvements have been made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4753518">Expand</a></span>

Even after suggested xml edits and disabling in all possible options it is still there, very noticeable when you start at one point and move slowly to the side and then repeat the process with slightly faster movement, the movement is non linear. The game needs a RAW mouse input instead of this consoley acceleration nonsense, please Ubisoft step up your game.
<br>
<br>I seriously hope they are going to fix that, otherwise i cannot fully recommend this game for PC gamers who value a proper and direct mouse input, even though the game is VERY good on all other fronts, only this open important detail hasn&apos;t been fixed in 3 patches and that&apos;s a dealbreaker for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4723553">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is great that UBI Soft has decided to continue the Farcry series, However after playing nearly 20 hours of Far Cry 4 I cannot help feeling like I am playing FarCry3 DLC &gt; yes the world is relatively large, and there is some new stuff &gt; however essentially the exact and I mean exact weapons from farcry 3 are in the game, little has been done in the way of weapon customizations or skins etc, and after investing 3-400 hours in farcry 3 and loving that game I really do get the oh same same mission parameters etc....... Starting to feel like I&apos;m back playing call of duty series... Maybe on console the graphics are better than Farcry3 but not on a serious gaming rig.
<br>
<br>your getting repetitive UBI better actually release a full game not a farcry3 port DLC next time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4799971">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story was awful, gone are the days of Far Cry 2 with a compelling story. This seems to be another arc of the inferior Far Cry 3, with some agonizingly awful characters mixed in. For this, I&apos;ve halved the score again.
<br>
<br>Finally, I&apos;m taking off one mark for the awfully sluggish controls. I don&apos;t get it, how many frames of latency does all the compositing need to take off? Can we even call these games shooters any more? They may as well just put the series of cut scenes together.
<br>
<br>Final score: 1/10. Avoid until the next steam sale until it&apos;s 80% off if you have absolutely nothing better to play. Or buy Wolfenstein: The New Order, that&apos;s an awesome game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4760421">Expand</a></span>

<br>Their support and management of this issue is completely non-transparent and reeks of board room profits and managers asking support teams responding to tickets in N hours with total waste of time requests for more info. Like they can&apos;t pull out their corporate card, buy the season pass from steam and analyze the issue themselves?
<br>
<br>No public acknowledgement of issues; non-communication and time wasting on top of it.

<br>No Aimtoggle setting, unable to progress past the first area because climbing is broken.. the list goes on.
<br>
<br>This is a TERRIBLE console port and a slap in the face of PC gamers.
<br>
<br>The story is wierd and you get zero sence of who you are or why you are there.
<br>
<br>Granted i&apos;ve only played the first 15 minutes of the game but if they can&apos;t that right i wont waste my time continuing.
<br>
<br>This is one of very few purchases i regret in 2014.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4882608">Expand</a></span>

<br>to make this review short(er), I will cut the chase.
<br>
<br>IF you LOVED &quot;Far Cry 3&quot;, you most definitely WILL LIKE &quot;Far Cry 4&quot;!
<br>want to know why? one VERY simple reason: IT IS BASICALLY THE SAME GAME!
<br>yes, everything is EXACTLY THE SAME, apart from the graphics (which they really amped up this time around).
<br>
<br>you might stop reading here...
<br>
<br>~
<br>
<br>do not misunderstand me, I find FC4 to be a truely well made game.
<br>it is fun to play, the story is superbly written and the characters, especially antagonist &quot;King Min&quot;, are very well developed characters you will love to hate... though, I have to say that &quot;Min&quot; is no &quot;Vas&quot;.
<br>I am not too far into the main-story, so I can only suspect that the main quest will turn out to be nice this time around again - BUT, make no mistake, FC4 has literally NO INNOVATION, NOT THE LEAST BIT OF &quot;NEW&quot;, NO NEW MECHANICS OR WAYS OF PLAYING YOUR GAME...
<br>
<br>FC4 IS JUST &quot;MORE OF THE SAME&quot; - or as vendors in Thailand used to announce their cheap counterfeit things: &quot;same same ... (but different)!&quot; - I will gladly admit that I kinda MISS something, a tiny little bit of &quot;new&quot;, something fresh and innovative.
<br>instead, Ubisoft wanted to play it absolutely safe -. and they could, for FC3 is an almost perfect open-world FPS.
<br>
<br>the whole concept did NOT have to be completely re-invented (as IS the case with the &quot;Assassin&apos;s Creed&quot; series), however, I am sure that most gamers (like myself) would have appreciated &quot;something&quot; fresh... not talking about some game-changing mechanics, but anything that we hadn&apos;t seen in FC before.
<br>
<br>but, we&apos;ve basically got this &quot;Far Cry 3&quot; CLONE ... which isn&apos;t exactly a bad thing.
<br>
<br>FC3 I have rated 10/10
<br>FC4 I rate 8/10 - because it could have been &quot;more&quot; and Ubisoft simply didn&apos;t have the &quot;cojones&quot; to change the tiniest bit...
<br>
<br>from a technical viewpoint I have to remark, even with older GPU like mine (Radeon 5870) you can get this game to run with STABLE 30 FPS!
<br>(what I want to tell you is, the game runs on older hardware - IF you know how to &quot;tweak&quot; your settings - though, it absolutely should be enjoyed on a nicer graphics-card than my old piece) ;)
<br>but, given that the only &quot;innovation&quot; or even difference in FC4 is the extremely nice graphics, you most definitely should play this game on a good GPU, to at least enjoy the only thing &quot;new&quot; and &quot;better&quot; compared to FC3.
<br>
<br>comming to think of it... Ubisoft seems to HATE any &quot;changes&quot; to their franchises!
<br>that is the simple reason for why &quot;Assassin&apos;s Creed Unity&quot; is the &quot;Same **** Different Game&quot; crap it had been from the beginning.
<br>(oh how I wish for the consumers to &quot;vote with their wallets&quot; and finally stopping to buy the BORING BULL**** this AC franchise had become!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4714925">Expand</a></span>

<br>overall in my book its Far Cry 3.5 than FC4.... If you enjoyed FC3 you will enjoy FC4.

<br>now bad side is, they need to fix the mouse movement asap, because its hard to aim and move the mouse at the moment (not properly syncd).</span>

<br>The graphics have improved in the lighting department quite a bit and some new features like fur has been added which is nice.
<br>The gameplay is really copy paste. And the reason why i&apos;m not gonna give this game a high score, while some tweaks here and there refine the gameplay, i don&apos;t think this game is worth the full price. Well, to be really honest, i kkind liked riding an elephant.
<br>Story is okay, nothing too special but the characters are certainly interesting. Not quite at the level of Vaas but it&apos;ll do. Other than that, the Shangra La tiger scratchy scratchy bits were also quite fun before it wore out by the end of it. Oh, the alternate ending videos floating on the web is quite neat. Good job.
<br>Music is whatever. Both AC unity and DA: I have better and much more memorable osts.
<br>
<br>Lastly there was some controversy with one of the writers saying that if you don&apos;t like social justice that you won&apos;t like what they have in their game, but honestly, the character in question is quite well written. She&apos;s nothing extraordinary but it&apos;s decent non the less.
<br>
<br>This game is really a 6 dressed up as a 7 for me. What i mean by that is that i really like the art style so i&apos;m gonna give it a 7 instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4710032">Expand</a></span>

The game makes improvements to mechanics, density of content and graphics, however the story and characters are weaker this time around with various issues from Far Cry 3 are still lingering. Forced mouse acceleration, constant frame stuttering, limited audio options and unskippable cutscenes mar an otherwise good experience at launch.
<br>Probably more aptly named Far Cry 3: Kyrat Dragon than Far Cry 4 it is still an enjoyable, lengthy and visually sumptuous experience with about average PC stability and performance at launch.
<br>Some of the missions try new things and fall painfully flat due to either poor execution or weak mission design, however some other missions really stand out with interesting and unique designs that work well. While neither a flawless nor consistent experience throughout, when it&apos;s on, it really delivers.
<br>If you played Far Cry 3, you really won&apos;t find any surprises or innovations, but what you will find is a solid follow up with enough improvements and plenty of content to satisfy.
<br>It is sure to say however, Far Cry 5 will really need to step it up, as more of the same really won&apos;t fly in another outing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4728877">Expand</a></span>

<br>Does not seem like they have tested the game on alot of system&apos;s to be sure it will run as it should, the release was pushed, could have delayed, better to delay than put it out on the shelves and have problems arise. I&apos;m giving 0/10. This is no way how a game business should be.
<br>
<br>UPDATE 11/22/14: The update was delayed so it was never released on 21st and as of now Ubisoft is giving word that the update may get released sometime next week and that they are sorry &quot;IF&quot; the update gets a new ETA on top of the current ETA.

Performance is fine on 4790k/780 Ti, but picking some of the Nvidia-specific options made the game very crash-happy for me. Also they overdid it so much with the collectibles that just opening the world map gives you a headache, you have no option but to ignore everything and just try to finish the game if you want to maintain your sanity. Also every NPC that you happen to meet in the wilds is permanently running in panic because there is an eagle nearby. There is ALWAYS an eagle nearby, it gets incredibly frustrating chasing all the NPC&apos;s around to talk to them or sell your valuables when they are in perma-panic mode. Sometimes, less is more. Far Cry 4 is one of those cases. Would have benefitted greatly from a more engaging story, more optimization, less collectibles and less eagles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4883269">Expand</a></span>

Like Far Cry 3, the game doesn&#x2019;t properly capitalize on its huge multiplayer potential. Far Cry 3 had a horrible matchmaking system that broke an otherwise outstanding 4 player co-op mode. Ubisoft makes another mistake in FC4 by limiting co-op to only 2 players. Huh? Even free-to-play Warframe allows 4 players. This unfortunate misstep is the primary reason fellow gamers passed on FC4. Although it&#x2019;s a solid game, FC4 feels more like a step sideways instead of a step forward. The missed multiplayer opportunity, sluggish performance, dull story, and gameplay problems keep Ubisoft&#x2019;s newest title from being the top spot on my shelf.
<br>
<br>If the protagonist Ajay stands still, FC4 looks spectacular. The mountain setting is beautiful. Because Kyrat is landlocked, environments aren&#x2019;t as varied as previous FC titles, but I hardly noticed. Once Ajay starts driving/flying around, big problems emerge. Draw distances are too short, even at lower settings. Trees, rocks, and buildings are constantly popping in even if they&#x2019;re only a few yards away. I never noticed this in Ubisoft&#x2019;s Watch Dogs released earlier this year, which looked amazing as well. Some textures shimmer as objects are rendered. It&#x2019;s another classic example of developers pushing graphics over performance. Sure FC4 has the potential to look great, but it performs poorly. Even strong hardware struggle to push out smooth visuals unless gamers are willing to devote hours to tweaking. But tweaking isn&#x2019;t always successful. Even after toying with settings, frame stuttering and fps drops plague FC4. The fact these problems persist at all settings screams of poor optimization.
<br>
<br>For the most part, gameplay is nearly identical to Far Cry 3. The in game menu is better. A few tweaks have been made to crafting, but nothing major. Player upgrades are more streamlined, but now gamers must specific tasks to unlock all upgrades. Except for the improved menu, I like FC3 upgrade/crafting system better. Players had more control and they could choose different upgrade &#x201C;paths&#x201D; that tailored to different playstyles. But that is my preference, both systems are solid. Players can equip just as many weapons/lethals as before. And there are plenty of weapons. Unfortunately, too many are unlocked late in the game. Overall, FC4 plays just like FC3.
<br>
<br>One of my biggest gameplay complaints regards enemy hitboxes. They suck. Baddies just absorb bullets as direct shots pass thru them.  It&#x2019;s comparable to playing a laggy BF4 match. Oddly, sniper rifles and arrows have no problems. So it seems that some weapons are nerfed just for the sake of being nerfed.
<br>FC4 pushes stealth in certain missions. Several storylines benefit greatly from stealth. However, stealth implementation is only OK. There isn&#x2019;t much improvement from FC3, which is absurd since stealthy play is more popular than ever.
<br>
<br>Also, the weapon wheel is a bit confusing, and I found myself accessing the wrong lethal or syringe many times. Not game breaking, but annoying nonetheless.
<br>
<br>Another complaint is FC4&#x2019;s story. Everything feels forced. The player goes from celebrity chef to Rambo in the blink of an eye. In FC3, the tatau had mystical power which imbued the player with abilities. A tad cheesy, but it fit. Also, the choices presented to the protagonist in FC4 are superficial. They don&#x2019;t have much impact on the overall story. And all the characters except the antagonist Pagan Min (and perhaps Willis) are forgettable. This is the same complaint many gamers had with FC3 as Vaas was the only standout character. There isn&#x2019;t any attachment to the characters or the story.
<br>
<br>There is also too much to do in Kyrat. It combines all the activities of FC3, FC3: Blood Dragon, and Watch Dogs into one game. Walk a few yards and there is a baddie holding people hostage.  Walk a few more yards and a convoy zips past. Walk a few more and get attacked by a random animal. FC4 supplies players with the same busywork seen in Ubisoft&#x2019;s other titles. And they supply a ridiculous amount of it. But the lack of originality is the glaring problem here. Ubisoft merely copy and pasted from its other popular titles. A popular developer trend. For new Ubisoft fans, this isn&#x2019;t a problem. For long-time loyalist, it&#x2019;s disappointing because we&#x2019;ve seen it all before. It&#x2019;s time to offer players something new.
<br>
<br>As mentioned earlier, co-op is the biggest missed opportunity. The decision to limit co-op to 2 players is absolutely baffling. Sure there is a versus mode. But players have enough versus games already: Halo, COD, Battlefield, Killzone, Titanfall, CS:GO&#x2026;.. and the list goes on. The market for co-op games isn&#x2019;t saturated yet, and Ubisoft could&#x2019;ve filled the void in a big way.
<br>
<br>Despite the criticisms, FC4 is a good game. However, it&#x2019;s not great. Terrible optimization and lackluster multiplayer are its biggest drawbacks. Ubisoft is being too safe these days and FC4 feels a bit stale. Is FC4 lazy or safe?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4889329">Expand</a></span>

I have loved every single game, but I think they have began to go down a wrong path with the series now. Actually I might suspect they already did with Far Cry 3, even though I absolutely adore that game, but the reason I did not notice it so much was because I played with a tweak on the PC that made all the HUD go away. It was really involving, immersive and realistic. Now playing Far Cry 4 I have not found such a tweak yet so I am forced to play the &quot;vanilla&quot; way and that is why I see all the faults that probably where mostly there in part 3 even to be honest but I was spared against because of the community tweak.
<br>
<br>The main thing is that the game feels extremely handholding. There is HUD clutter everywhere and even when shutting down as much as I can in the options I still can&apos;t get rid of the glowing bodies or the see through walls ability which is just pathetic as far as options go. Why do they have a ton of options but no way to turn this off? Incredible.
<br>
<br>You also get button prompts for EVERYTHING. Looking down a scope? You will have those damn ugly button reminders cluttering up the screen the whole game reminding you that you can use right or left analog to zoom or hold your breath. Flying with the wingsuit? Be prepared to have the gorgeous view blocked by some reminder of pressing a button to get out your parachute. It does not matter if you have done this a 1000 times before, the game still wants to remind you so you don&apos;t get lost. Pathetic.
<br>
<br>As annoying as that there are also other points in the game where you get prompts like this in missions. The game does not seem to be able to recognise I have used an ability 1000 times before, it still needs to remind me how to use that ability in a mission that involves it. It just feels so handholding and forced. Like you are a baby and the game needs to make sure you don&apos;t get lost.
<br>
<br>Also one way to describe the game is quantity over quality. The map is just filled with gems and other things for you to collect. While one might think this is a good thing it is just TO MUCH. A thing that seems to be a thing in many other Ubisoft games like Assassins Creed to. Instead of there being interesting to find it just becomes a game of running to the next glowing thing on the map to collect. It is way overboard and should be tuned down or made into something more interesting. It really takes away from the feeling of this being a real place in a way and makes it more feel like a video game theme park with &quot;powerups&quot; to collect.
<br>
<br>The game is also filled with bugs that I have not seen in previous Far Cry games. Every time I start the game I have to turn off the auto aim, because the game seems to not save this for some reason. If I use the filter on the map I have to first go in to the options and turn on the minimap and then turn it off again. If I don&apos;t do this the game is bugged and don&apos;t let me use the filter on the map. If you run fast in the world you will see birds spawning all over the place right in front of your eyes. Many times I have seen cars spawn right in the road before me etc etc.
<br>
<br>Also while the game looks very good the environment is not really that interesting and quite bland and samey looking. The tropical paradise of Far Cry 1 and Far Cry 3 is so much more inviting and interesting. Even though I understand it might be good to have some other environments I really miss the jungle every time they have another setting. The himaliyas are quite cool though with the heavy snow to be honest.
<br>
<br>Another thing that really annoyes me in the game is the animals. They are way to aggresive and unrealstic. Bears and wolfes should not just attack you on sight like some rabid dogs. And don&apos;t even speak of the eagels that attack anything that moves, extremely annoying after the 100:th time you get one attacking your head. Also there seems to be no way to attack anything underwater, not even to use your knife which is very annoying when swiming and there is a man eating fish at your tail.
<br>
<br>The game is still fun though even though it feels like a reskin of Far Cry 3. The small helicopter and the grapplinghook are both very cool features. It just feels for the first time in the Far Cry series like less of a real sequel worthy of a new number and more like an &quot;expansion&quot; or reskin (of part 3).
<br>
<br>The game is become way to casual, cluttered, &quot;theme parky&quot; and handholding. I really wish they go back on that a bit in Far Cry 5 and make it more grounded and &quot;hardcore&quot;. And for f sake if you have such a long menu for HUD options include options to turn EVERYTHING off!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4766231">Expand</a></span>

There are a few exceptions to this, but generally it is the same game, just in a different place.
<br>
<br>The PC port is quite poor with constant frame-rate drops on my high-end PC. Graphics, though impressive at times, lack in many areas of this title, when all settings are on max. There are low-res textures... everywhere. Climbing a rock face will show off disgusting low-res textures, which are just inches from your face. Tree leaves/foliage from a distance looks horrid and console-like. Vehicle headlights that shine onto natural objects look extremely unrealistic and take me out of the game every time. Overall little is innovative, graphics wise.
<br>
<br>Some of us have powerful gaming rigs, why not optimize some insanely beautiful visuals for us? Our machines can take it. If other devs can make it happen, so should you, Ubisoft. This game comes close, but no cigar. It feels like this game was made for Xbox One/PS4 and you just slightly improved things for PC players.
<br>
<br>Why are most Ubisoft games poorly optimized for PC? Do you guys have a fully-fledged PC version team? It doesn&apos;t feel like it.
<br>
<br>I pray The Division is done right.
<br>
<br>But FC4 does have some fun moments in it, without a doubt. The little helicopter is fun. The characters are interesting. Cut scenes are well-made. Map is insanely expansive. Etc.
<br>
<br>But overall a waste of $60 for me. This game is worth $20-$30 on PC. $40 on console.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4778616">Expand</a></span>

Slowly dragging the mouse left to right across the mouse-pad results in about a 90 degree turn for the character. Quickly dragging the mouse left to right across the entire  mouse pad results in the character doing two 360 degree turns. The mouse acceleration is huge, but whats worst is the negative mouse acceleration which is really the ruining factor here. Trying to aim down the sights feels like your gun is stuck, and you have to quickly move the mouse to free it to be able to aim, but as soon as you slow down the mouse it gets stuck again. Its a horribly frustrating experience, no matter how good the rest of the game is it is impossible to enjoy because the game at its heart is a shooter, and you need to be able to aim to enjoy it. Currently the issue seems to affect at least 95% of  players. I suspect those that claim they don&apos;t have mouse acceleration problems are either fanboys who will admit no problems, or are somehow simply oblivious to this problem. If this issue is fixed the game would be very easy to recommend but in its current state stay away.
<br>
<br>Graphically it runs fairly smoothly on my R9 290x. I can use ultra settings which look fabulous and get a solid 60 FPS. But turning is choppy, but this could be related to the mouse acceleration. Driving can be choppy as well, but the game is actually pretty fast even when driving at top speeds, and the frames drop to about 45 FPS, but it doesn&apos;t ruin it by any means. Switching to very high graphics settings I can get 60 FPS driving.
<br>
<br>Game looks great and if you like Far Cry 3 you will probably love this, as long as you don&apos;t need a mouse and keyboard to play. If you use a controller it works fine. But this is a PC game so this rating is based on mouse and keyboard input, and with current mouse acceleration game is just unplayable and gets a 0.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4737552">Expand</a></span>

Optimization for pc gamers is what we care most  This games uses 99%  ; less vram that other games and very few stuttering . This is what we need . No more horrible ports like unity ; lords of fallen and advance warfare</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4709532">Expand</a></span>

<br>The latest patch has more or less completely fixed the mouse acceleration. It has also completely resolved the stuttering when moving around the world for me. Both of these issues had resulted in huge forum threads of complaints (50+ pages) on the Ubisoft forums. Now, nearly a month later, the game is in a MUCH better state than it was on release.
<br>
<br>Since they&apos;ve addressed those primary issues, I highly recommend this game if you enjoyed FC3. On an i7 4770k and GTX 970, the game is running at constant 70+ FPS on Ultra preset at 1080p with zero stuttering.
<br>
<br>Original post:
<br>I thought it deserves mentioning that the mouse input in this game is absolutely horrible.
<br>
<br>Both Far Cry 3 / 4 have a &quot;mouse acceleration&quot; setting in the options menu, so you&apos;d think the developers knew what they were doing when it comes to translating mouse input into camera movement. After all, that&apos;s the most basic interface of an FPS game. Unfortunately, that isn&apos;t the case. The mouse behavior is wildly inconsistent, there is both positive and negative acceleration as well as mouse smoothing. It feels like they took analog stick implementation and tied it to the mouse.
<br>
<br>I move my mouse quickly, my character does a 360 degree turn. I move the mouse slowly across the same distance, my character turns 90 degrees. Aiming precisely is very frustrating. Playing the game with a controller is probably more ideal at this point. The fact that none of the QA testers noticed this indicates they tested the game with a controller and never used the mouse. That said, a lot of people are complaining about it, maybe it will be fixed in a patch. And yes, this may seem picky, but proper mouse control in a 2014 FPS game is expected.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4715182">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I cannot honestly fault the game itself in terms of gameplay, story arch and what it&apos;s trying to do (except to point out the valid criticism that this should be called Far Cry 3.5, as there&apos;s little to no innovation over the previous title on show here. But that&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing, as Far Cry 3 was excellent and if ain&apos;t broke, why fix it?)
<br>
<br>But you can get all that good stuff in the title, but if it has severe frame rate dips no matter what you do and has a default mouse and keyboard set up that is nigh on unplayable, alongside an FOV issue that actively encourages motion sickness, then you&apos;re gimping your game right off the bat.
<br>
<br>I really don&apos;t know what it is about Ubisoft and releasing games for PC that appear unfinished and untested, but it appears to be a trend that needs to be stopped. Ubisoft in particular have all the skill and ingredients necessary to make flawless, blockbuster titles with the raw materials the AC and Far Cry (and to a lesser extent, the potential in Watch_Dogs) franchises have, but they&apos;re shooting themselves in the foot time and time again.
<br>
<br>But enough of the negative, as they are technical faults that should have an easy fix - this is a very enjoyable title that is worth your money and time, which is more than can be said for Unity. If you have a back catalogue of games to play through, you can probably wait till this goes on sale as it&apos;s not a &quot;must play immediately&quot; kind of game in terms of multiplayer etc. but definitely add it to your FPS/Action purchase list.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4747122">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Anyway I purchased the Limited edition of the game online have had no issues whatsoever. (I5, HD7870LE, Win7/64, 8 G Ram)
<br>
<br>So how about the game.
<br>
<br>I just finished FC 3 to be in the &quot;mood&quot; when I started playing FC 4 and I am not disappointed, yes it is the same basic concept, but there are also differences making it a new experience.
<br>
<br>The scenery is spectacular.
<br>
<br>The AI is much improved.
<br>It is no longer possible to take an outpost by standing at a distance taking out the guards one by one with the sniper rifle. The guards take more damage and they will hunt you down instead of reverting to their scripted track 2 seconds after you shot the guy next to them.. The alarms are better protected against tampering, so you have to get close or stand at an awkward angle to shoot at them.
<br>
<br>There are also tons of predators, and they will kill you if you do not kill them first. So walking around is no longer safe.
<br>
<br>Hunting is MUCH more fun than in FC3 and you need to hunt a lot of animals to get your gear upgrades. Lots of variation and much more challenging than in FC3.
<br>
<br>The weapon upgrades are slower to appear, you will have to advance much further before getting a mini gun...again it puts more pressure on the player and makes it impossible to finish the game in a few hours.
<br>
<br>Flying a light helicopter is great fun and flying low over water or trees have a significant visual effect on both. Making it much more life like. If you jump out of the helicopter before landing will break it bringing more realism in to the game.
<br>
<br>I have not played more than approx 25% of the game and therefore there are lots of things yet to experience, for instance taking one of the fortresses, but I am looking forward to the ride.
<br>
<br>If you liked FC3 then go for FC4.
<br>
<br>If you do not like open world stealth games with a lot of side quests and just want to shoot somebody and get to the next level, then this game is not for you.
<br>
<br>Warm recommendation from here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4773916">Expand</a></span>

Doing missions and collecting stuff is good as usual. However, there are quite a few annoyances:
<br>
<br>- Body armor is practically useless, gets reduced after a few hits, including animal attacks.
<br>- Animal attacks everywhere, can&apos;t get to a mission location without being attacked and wasting ammo and health.
<br>- The helicopter is great but can&apos;t remember where they are except a few places and the map only shows them if they are next to you.
<br>- Some towers have helicopters but they can&apos;t be fast travelled to.
<br>- 50% of the time, if I fast travel to an outpost and try to leave for a mission/task, the outpost gets attacked and I have to turn back to help out which wastes ammo and health.
<br>- High powered sniper rifles able to take down heavies come too late in the campaign, when there are less useful.
<br>- Performance is acceptable but hiccups due to loading happens quite a lot despite being installed on an SSD.
<br>- Enemies teleport sometimes, which makes picking them off from afar difficult because if the shot misses, they get alerted.
<br>- I don&apos;t get the weapon accuracy, especially the bow. Sometimes I need to compensate for distance and drop, other times not. Enemies tend to sway their head quite more often than in FC3.
<br>- Unmemorable location names; can&apos;t name any of them.
<br>- There are lot of collectibles and they don&apos;t show in the map if it is zoomed out to far; I wish you could jump back and forth between the locations of certain collectibles.
<br>- I spent the first 10 hours hunting for animals so I could get my equipment levels up. Starting out with a single weapon slot is ridiculous.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, its a good game but doesn&apos;t go much further than FC3; if you liked FC3, collectibles, free roaming and sandbox gameplay, you should play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4939158">Expand</a></span>

First I&apos;m going to say this is a SUPERB game on the PC and it&apos;s games like Far Cry 4 is why I have a high-end gaming PC! the visuals , the sound, the immersion is absolutely amazing and it&apos;s pure escapism and entertainment at its finest!
<br>
<br>The game runs extremely smooth on my PC and I have everything on Ultra so there is no performance issues. The story line and side quests are amazing and way better than the previous Far Cry games that I have played. Every side quest in Far Cry 4 have so far been a lot of fun where you want to do side quests and you want more of them!
<br>
<br>There are a lot of comments where people are saying that Far Cry 4 is basically the same game as Far Cry 3 and some are calling it Far Cry 3.5. What a load of CRAP! Far Cry 4 is Far Cry 4 and is totally different than Far Cry 3. Hell the graphics engine used in Far Cry 4 is different than Far Cry 3 and you can see the difference in details if you have played both. the graphics in Far Cry 4 are simply sublime!
<br>
<br>A lot of new game mechanics in Far Cry 4 like the Grapling, Gyrocopter, riding elephants, using animals to help take down outposts etc.
<br>
<br>Far Cry 4 is by far the best game release that I have played for 2014. It is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it. Ignore the negative reviews as I doubt they really played the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4875014">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Gameplay is funa t times, when you aren&apos;t experiencing a nasty AI or graphics bug
<br>- The radio made me laugh a few times,
<br>- Decent story line
<br>- Decent graphics
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- EXTREMELY BUGGY, crashes in single player mode as well as online play
<br>- UPLAY IS HORRIBLE, the UI is the worst, it&apos;s super buggy, often messages sent to the user make no sense
<br>- Coop is basically unplayable due to all the bugs (main reason I payed $50 for the game)
<br>- This game is a dog performance wise. For how good the graphics are (decent), it takes a ton of GPU/CPU to drive it
<br>- Huge patches still coming in on the regu;ar and they don&apos;t seem to fix anything. This weeks was another 2.05 GB, this is the thrid patch I&apos;ve gotten since January that was over 2GB, and there have been many other smalle rones.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5112053">Expand</a></span>

Screen goes black when you start the game, crtl + tab twice fixes it, the same happens when you go from the options to the main menu. When I turn on Fullscreen, leave options (of course it goes black), its back to windowed mode...
<br>The aiming with mouse is horrible, playing wth a 360 cntroller works, but it hasn&apos;t enough buttons for all actions.
<br>Sometimes you take damage, when you fall down 1 Meter...
<br>
<br>And now to the worst...
<br>The game sometimes doesn&apos;t notice you progressing!
<br>Right at the beginning, at the first bell tower you get the grapple. I took the grapple, but the game somehow didn&apos;t notice this, the grapple was gone and i couldnt use it, because the game didn#t notice that i took it...
<br>OK... start again... Took the grapple again, worked, climbed up the tower and destroyed the radio thing, nothing happened, current quest is to destroy this thing... game didnt notice, that i destroyed it...
<br>Ok... start again... 2 times, the third time the game noticed, that i destroyed the thing!
<br>Good quest complete. I saved the game and closed it.
<br>After a few hours I started FC4 again. In game I was standing in front of the Grapple, bell tower mission still active!!! Didn&apos;t save my progress... I now have given up trying to play this buggy mess...
<br>
<br>And btw you are forced to download Uplay and have an account  to play FC4. Steam and Uplay must be running in the background for FC4 to &quot;work&quot;...
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t buy this!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5137020">Expand</a></span>
