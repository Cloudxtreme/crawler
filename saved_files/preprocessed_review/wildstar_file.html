The UI is terrible, its completely overcluttered. The enviroment is confusing. Your toon is... something I can&apos;t really tell. Some form of bisexual robocop who walks like a stripper on speed. The quests are ultra boring. Not just normal boring, they are super duper boring. I would prefer old classic kill x quests over this stuff. 90% of the time i&apos;m clicking on the button that shows me where i have to go next, then I click some stuff and repeat..

The UI is almost unuseable and unintuitive, the quest log is obtuse and gets in the way of actually completing objectives, and group quest rewards (which quests grant shared credit, etc.) are not the same across the board. I&apos;m already very disappointed, and I haven&apos;t even gotten near max level yet. The Dominion &apos;flavor&apos; feels like they just think it&apos;s &apos;cool&apos; to be &apos;evil&apos;... and I feel no attachment to any of the characters or sense of why I should think that doing something ever matters. And why is the &apos;evil side&apos; the only one with any touch of religion? Really? Over the top and heavy-handed.
<br>
<br>I really wanted this game to be better, as I was looking forward to it for quite awhile, but it feels as though the game was designed by people with a ton of nostalgia for hardcore mmo&apos;s that never actually had to deal with the BS that went with that hardcore setup.
<br>
<br>The player movement &apos;acceleration&apos; is a huge issue for me, as well, as is the sprint &apos;resource&apos; that is even applied to mount speed. I feel like my character is on a yo-yo when I have to change directions rapidly. &apos;Rolling&apos; breaks auto run. Etc. etc.
<br>
<br>The combat is decently fun (played Esper, Spellslinger, and Warrior), and the visuals are fairly intuitive. I like the flow of it, overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4247597">Expand</a></span>

<br>Crafting looks pretty interesting, almost like mini-games. Paths gives impetus to explore world, that&apos;s a nice way to do it and take some time from player.</span>

                                        <span>This game is surprisingly fun. At level 15 you get access to adventures, which are essentially dungeons. They are super fun and challenging. Completing adventures feels very fulfilling when you clear them. Bosses are unique and engaging with neat mechanics. Combat feels more like an action RPG than an MMO. Manual dodging is fun.</span>

<br>There&apos;s another unique feature called Paths. Besides the usual race, class and tradeskills, you chose a path. And this decides a lot of what you will be doing. For example soldier gets you new bosses to defeat, zones to defend and so on, all with it&apos;s own story. Or settler which I am right now, let&apos;s me build stuff around towns and cities, useful stuff. I&apos;m loving settler tbh.
<br>The skills are very interesting and cool (I was shocked at thow boring skills were in FFRR, the last mmo I tried). And the skill and perk system is very configurable, letting you switch skills on the fly, which I like too.
<br>The crafting system looks cool, but I still have no idea how it works, it&apos;s not just click and craft, you have to select different ingredients and put them in a kind of grid.
<br>The world is full of stuff. The path system helps in this regards. There aren&apos;t any boring zones, because besides missions, events, ingredients, or the usual things, the world is also populated with things related to your path.
<br>The graphics are cartoonish. They don&apos;t look awesome in the sense of technical power, but they are pretty and very detailed.
<br>Oh, and the game has a kind of Borderlands humor.
<br>
<br>All in all, very good mmo and I&apos;d say right now the best you can play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4245205">Expand</a></span>

The 3 days in Headstart i enjoyed every minute with the game with a very nice community (atm). And it&#xB4;s not just a phrase, the dev&#xB4;s a truly listening.</span>

It&apos;s literally the game that WoW would be if it launched in 2013/14.
<br>
<br>The questing. Many people complain that Wildstar has bad questing. It&apos;s not true. It&apos;s the same old questing  that every other MMORPG out there has (maybe except of TSW, but I didn&apos;t play that game, so I can&apos;t voice my opinion). It&apos;s just the usual &quot;kill X, gather Y, fetch Z&quot;. The difference is that Carbine didn&apos;t spend millions of dollars on voice acting (like SWTOR and probably TESO did) that becomes irrelevant after you pass the questing content, instead they spend it on dungeons, raids and developing new content. There is one more difference about questing. Wildstar&apos;s questing truly does teach you how to play the game. It&apos;s not hardcore experience by any means, but it&apos;s infinitely harder than questing in other MMORPGs. By level 50 you have to become a decent player, or you&apos;ll just die on every pack of mobs.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s one annoying thing about questing - challenges. There&apos;s just too many of them. Fortunately, you can disable them if you don&apos;t want to bother with them.
<br>
<br>Alright, I wrote about the questing first, because that&apos;s the first thing you do. Now let&apos;s talk about combat.
<br>
<br>Combat is incredible. WoW has set the new frontier for fluid and responsive combat. No game has matched WoW&apos;s combat for 10 years. Well, now it has. Wildstar&apos;s combat is just as fluid and responsive. It&apos;s also more demanding and engaging, since you have to stay constantly on the move. And don&apos;t even get me started on healing - but let&apos;s just say there&apos;s a reason why healers have pretty much as long queues as dpsers. Spoiler: it&apos;s because it&apos;s just so damn fun.
<br>
<br>Crafting is, generally speaking, great. I&apos;ll leave discovering everything about crafting to you, I&apos;ll just speak about the only flaw of the system. There&apos;s no way to repeat an old craft multiple times, every time you have to manually add the additives. Gets pretty dull if you have to craft, say, 10 of the same item.  I&apos;m pretty sure an addon will solve that soon, or Carbine will, given time. This is just a matter of polishing, really.
<br>
<br>Now to the best part. Dungeons. Even the entry dungeons are equal to WoW&apos;s raids (I&apos;d say they are equal to flex/normal raids in terms of difficulty). They are challenging, they require the whole team to know how to play. They are definitely not Deadmines. And the most important part is - they are just so damn well designed and FUN.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t speak for end-game content and PvP, so I&apos;ll leave it to the others. I&apos;ll just say it again: Wildstar is the new WoW. Whether it will be nearly as successful is to be decided (it probably won&apos;t), but it definitely deserves it.
<br>
<br>Just try the game and get to level 15 for the first adventure and 20 for dungeons. You&apos;ll be amazed, that&apos;s guaranteed. This game is not TESO or SWTOR. The hype is real this time. Don&apos;t listen to idiots giving Wildstar 1/10 or 0/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4245622">Expand</a></span>

There is a ton of things to do, stuff like housing is already in place, and there&apos;s lots of different things to find in the world. Combat system is pretty interesting, and once you&apos;re not just doing simple stuff, standing still mashing buttons mindlessly will get you killed. The ability to quickly dodge around and be reactive makes it pretty interesting.

<br>The game has</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Fun game, overall. There is a ton of things to do, stuff like housing is already in place, and there&apos;s lots of different things to find in the world. Combat system is pretty interesting, and once you&apos;re not just doing simple stuff, standing still mashing buttons mindlessly will get you killed. The ability to quickly dodge around and be reactive makes it pretty interesting.
<br>
<br>The game has a very strong &quot;silly&quot; vibe, which I guess was to be expected from a sci-fi game with what are essentially cat girls and crazy rat mad scientists.
<br>
<br>Server issues have been a thing. Nothing too horrible on the server that I&apos;m on, but there has been downtime and a lot of hotfixes. It&apos;s largely the standard new game from a new studio launch woes.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for something to do in the MMO space, it&apos;s definitely worth a look.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4245750">Expand</a></span>

<br>Firstly I think MMO&apos;s are the hardest to review and I only enjoyed UO/Everquest 1/Daoc/Wow/GW1. Everything after was just &quot;meh&quot; Imo.
<br>Wildstar so far has exceeded in every expectation so far. I am lvl 30 when writing this. I will just some it up in Pros and Cons, since you cannot really explain an MMO until you try it yourself.
<br>
<br>- Pros -
<br>
<br>- Combat is solid...fun and it works! I enjoyed combat way more then I thought I would. Keeps you on your toes.
<br>- It is hard! Challenging...and dungeons are difficult, you will die alot and when you nail that Boss...you feel like a Boss!
<br>- Not boring/Grindy...The experience from lvl 1-15 to 15-20 to 20-30 so far are quite different and different playstyles.
<br>- Great Music/Sound
<br>- Once ingame , it is pretty stable for release.
<br>- Housing is pretty addictive and well implemented, i have never been one for MMO Housing but WS have done well here.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>
<br>- The paths are meh...It really does not matter which you pick in the end. They offer different play styles on the side, but all of em I never really went deeply into or found anything new here. They could a done better with Scientist too.
<br>- UI still needs a bit more polish.
<br>- Server queues
<br>
<br>So far WS has been great, this is only from a leveling up point of view. My worry is end game content, which is what kills most MMO&apos;s for me. They get boring quick.
<br>Looking at the list of current content and the difficulty of WS I am sure for now WS will be fine if you wanna raid/dungeon hunt end game. Where WoW went wrong...(Pre TBC Imo) WS is doing right. Great classes/Great combat/20-40 man dungeons and WS is hard...very hard but in a good way. It mocks you when you die....yet you learn from your mistakes and rewards you well for accomplishing what you were doing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4245393">Expand</a></span>

So I know a thing or two about MMO (though I now prefer strategy games like the total wars). Now after wow I left MMOs , was done because I looked at AION, SWTOR and I tried ESO beta, and I laughed cause they weren&apos;t great. I was certain I would never go back to PC MMO gaming!
<br>
<br>Now two days ago I bought Wildstar early access and had a three hour wait while they worked through a back log of creating accounts (wow, lots of folk wanting to play) But after that I logged on Oceanic PVE, and started my game. I&apos;m casual now, too old for rushing but I felt no need at all. In fact once I left the starter area, a quick zone chat (said &quot;hello&quot;) had three friends and a party to share the questing experience.
<br>
<br>A few things I noticed: 1, grouping is worth while at almost anytime, there is no reason to play alone. 2, the art style is refreshing and humorous. The back story and world is fully engaging (yes I stop to read all the books), in one particular cave is a boiling cauldron and a sack with an intelligent creature in it mumbling to itself, that&apos;s awesome. 3, progression feels natural. 4, I got my own house and garden and workbench and my friends came over, I nearly spent an entire day there.
<br>
<br>Now issues I saw, one, a taxi type creature&apos;s feet did not move while taking me a new village....that&apos;s it for me, I guess I&apos;ve been lucky.
<br>
<br>So you can not go wrong with this game unless your one of the few that has technical difficulties (devs and CS are very open to the community, speak and they shall likely answer). I can easily see this gaming actually being worth the sub fee which so many recent MMOs were not. I am now once again a PC MMO player and will likely have to split my time between Wildstar and destiny. You should be too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4245356">Expand</a></span>

Sure, its colorful and slightly cartoonish, but you have to understand that that type of art style ages well in the gaming industry. The graphics in this game are top notch for this genre of gaming, the cartoonish art style will age well as new textures and features are added. The combat is great and differs greatly from many other tab-targeting MMOs. The abilities feel fluid as does the combat in general, the PVP is actually based on skill (got to aim your shots), the raids are intense, warplots (you have to look that up), in-game physics give it a real world feel, the environments are equally interesting and differed in look, and the list goes on. This game does have the standard MMO type of questing though. Do NOT be mistaken though, all the quests are not these filler &quot;kill 10 rats&quot; quests either. The minority of quests are actually kill-fetch quests while the majority are actually quite enjoyable and interesting. The overall story in the game keeps you interested in the history of Nexus and the Eldan content provides amazing endgame. I have logged approximately 300 hours in this game during beta alone. I understand MMOs and understand what MMO fans want. If you&apos;ve enjoyed WoW, Warhammer, SWTOR, (even ESO), Guild Wars 1 and 2, etc. etc. etc. I highly recommend you check Wildstar out for yourself. The game has so much to offer and absolutely will not disappoint you.

<br>The housing system is also amazing. Each player gets a house around level 15, and you can customize it in infinite ways, with very powerful tools to do so. There are hundreds if not thousands of items you can place in your house, and you can rotate them along 3 axes, scale them up or down, and place them exactly where you&apos;d like.

There is quite a large amount of content for a new release, BGs, adventures, raids, dungeons, war plots and open world events. It really feels like they have taken the best stuff from every MMO and put it together to make the one we have all been waiting for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4245279">Expand</a></span>

<br>-the game definitelly could use some optimisation - the graphics it runs do not justify its steep requirements;
<br>-crafting system imo is over-complicated, with unclear UI, which turns actual crafting into fighting against its own UI. Also - usefulness of some crafting choices is questionable - e.g. achitects earn huge money on AH, while weaponsmithing is a one big money-sink;
<br>-questing - very uninspiring &apos;go x, kill y, fetch z&apos; - nothing new, altough the bizzare/childish sense of humor is refreshing; people complain a bit about scaling issues; difficult to gasp for an MMO title - but group questing does not offer any kind of incentives and actually feels counter-productive;
<br>-group pve: a) HUUUge class balance issues due to telegraph system and how it interacts with melee classes; In my opinion this is a major design flaw... b) instances/adventure zones are buggy...very dissapointing given the amount of beta-testing done to date; c) due to system of multiple decisions in dungeons, some runs turn out considerably more difficult than others - this is not clarified in tutorials; also - its easy to get lost in non-linear dungeons, since objective-tracking is not perfected;
<br>-very decent music, but sound effects quickly become a nuisance and source of headaches;
<br>-housing has some potential - its a good idea, with some not-overpowered-perks, but overall looks like a simple money-sink;
<br>-in terms of customer service/launch issues - early access was a total mess - login errors, 2hour wait queues etc....fortunatelly this got more streamlined with official release; on second thought - early access was 100% NOT worth it;
<br>
<br>Overall feels like a dusk of an MMO era...for a supposedly triple-A product, the actual game dissapoints....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4249371">Expand</a></span>

I am not joking about teleporting bots, the are real and Wildstar (just like Guild Wars 2) is overrun with them.  Carbine will do NOTHING about this because the bots are paying customers, if they couldn&apos;t fix them in GW2, they sure ain&apos;t fixin them in Wildstar.  Disgraceful game, disgraceful company.</span>

High production values and well-thought-out mechanics prove that this is indeed a quality title.
<br>
<br>But you have done it all before.. you have read those static quest boxes, you have gathered x amount of that creature&apos;s questionable loot, you have delivered this to there, many MANY times already...
<br>
<br>If you look at this game in that way, and it doesn&apos;t bother you - you will love Wildstar. It&apos;s another one of &apos;those&apos; mmos you can slip right into and feel at home the first time you boot it up. It does everything you know well and it doesn&apos;t really try to do any more. The combat while it offers a few twists, is very much the staple of the currrent new-breed &apos;action combat&apos; mmos - though it is clearly designed with a future console implementation in mind.
<br>
<br>The game is oozing with charm. From the Warner Bros-esque landscapes to the zany cartoonish aesthetics of each character class, Wildstar is endearing in its personality. You will love all the classes from the adorably psychotic little Chua, to the sullenly undead Mordesh.
<br>
<br>But if you want something more, if you want immersion and the feeling of true adventure, if you want that sandbox mmo that you can chip away at for months or even years, then sadly I feel you will have to look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4245686">Expand</a></span>

GW2, Tera, Swtor, The Secret World, ESO etc... but none of them come close to the content and experience in this game. Not only is the PvP (Battlegrounds, Arenas) incredibly fun but the PvE content is challenging and rewarding. If you want a good MMO to play that has plenty of end-game content, look no further. 10/10</span>

<br>exploring,and especially end game content,pve and pvp.World of warcraft was because it launched in a time where there was no really a decent mmo around.World of warcraft was innovative and preety awesome for his time.Especially tbc and wotlk expansions was a true gem in a gamer&apos;s life.
<br>
<br>But like every kindgom is time for world of warcraft&apos;s reign to come in an end.Many candidates tried in the past to take the throne from wow but no one succeeded.Every signle mmo after wow failed on at least one aspect.Guild wars 2 failed in end game content and having no raids,swtor failed on end game content too and lacking of good pvp,teso..well teso failed on many thing,tera,rift,the secret world.So many games that failed on taking the place of wow.And to be honest,is harder now to be the king in mmos cause now a game must present something really unique at gamer&apos;s.When wow arrived mmo gaming was still virgin on many aspects,was easier to succeed.And when i say succeed i dont mean only the numbers of subscitption.From the prespective of subription mmo will be always be king,but you cant measure the quality of gaming from the quantity of subscribers.Dont forget that farmville has over 100 million players:P,or justin bieber is selling more than james now.Does that making him a better artist?Of course not.
<br>
<br>After a long,long time.After counteless tries of developers and after so many unsuccesful tries that gamers commit to find a good mmo except wow time has come.
<br>
<br>Wildstar,is the next big thing,it succeeds where every other mmo failed.It does what wow does but better.Its not so innovative(gameplay is very innovative though with telegraphs) but does everything right.
<br>Gameplay is magical,you can feel your play swinging his sword,or casting a spell,there is no time delay between your action and the response,everything is being executed smoothly.I was too skeptical about telegprahs before i played but its very very good,and useful.You know where the ability will strike,you have the time to avoid and decide in which area you will cast next ability,you can dodge but you must be careful because you cant dodge all the time(there is a meter that fills each time you cast 2 dodges in a row).Bosses are different EVERY SINGLE time.Because you know the tactic but each time the situations are changing cause of telegpraphs.
<br>
<br>Lore is good,not something great or awesome,but good.You read books,you learn about the habbits of people in nexus,the conflict about exile and dominion,the secrets of eldan(a mysterious ancient race).

<br>Questing is interesting,you have the usual quests of killing X number of bad soldiers but you also have path quests.There are 4 different paths and you can choose only one at the start.Path includes killing bad guys if you choose to be soldier,finding lore and investigating creatuers if you are scientist,explore mountains and valleys if you are explorer,building stations that gives buffs or building taxi stations if you are settler.Also each buff gives unique abilities,scientists for example can group summon,or make a portal to capital,settlers can summon a vending maching for repair etc or build a fire that gives buff.
<br>
<br>The true aspect that wildstar shines though is end game content.Dungeons are very very challening,since dungeon one you will find with the hard way the pain of wiping and dungeons themselves teaches you how to beat them though wiping.I have never,ever played so challening NORMAL  dungeons.In most mmos normal dungeons are a walk in the park,you even dont need to think what are you doing.Not in wildstar.In wildstar you must be focus 100%,have the right gear,use the interupts in time(sometimes to interupt an ability  needs 2 persons  and they must do it at the same time,otherwise you will fail in interupt and probably get killed).Also wildstar presents 20 man and 40 man(yes!)raiding.Pvp is crazy.You must be on your toes all the tme,you have to be very very careful,even an inch of an ability that drops right beside you can make the difference.Arenas,warplots,battleground.
<br>Wildstar has EVERYTHING.
<br>Also,there is housing.Customize your personal,not only house,but your own land.You can decorate your house,make it small,big,funny,serious,like a rocket or like a fruit.You can plant seeds,you can build fences,or plant trees,or change the color of the sky.You can do everyhting you want.Really.
<br>
<br>Wildstar is a game from gamers to gamers.Dont forget that carbine that made wildstar is infact 17 developers that were previously in vanilla wow.
<br>Give that game a chance.It really,really..but really..deserves this.
<br>Most of all,it respects the intelligence of the gamer.
<br>It respects you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4247092">Expand</a></span>

The boss mechanicss of the first 2 dungeons are easy to understand and comprehend and offer no real challege (after 2 deaths everybody should know what to do). The craftig and cooking systems are quite unique and offer a lot of experimentation possiblities.</span>

<br>What I was hoping for is a MMO to move the stagnating genre forward, and sadly this is not it. The game has been in development for 7 years and it shows. All of the concepts have been done before and I dont really see Wildstar adding to the genre at all.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for a MMO identical to all current MMOs but with a Sci-Fi Comic feel to it try this game, but if you are into a more serious MMO focusing on more than rushing to the end game there are better MMO&apos;s on the market.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4255911">Expand</a></span>

Its not just that most quests are grind this, click this, run there but the fact that you do nothing else with very little meaningful story.
<br>
<br>I really wish I could like this game and get to the fun part which I&apos;ve heard is after level 20. From level 13 to 16 I would log in, level for 20 minutes and log out again because I was bored senseless.
<br>
<br>To top this off I really dislike the UI and the lack of simple features that you are used to having in modern games.
<br>
<br>On the positive side the combat system did look promising and I liked the crafting system although this too suffered from UI problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4385728">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game was awesome for the first month. The honeymoon phase, afterwards though as the **** seeps through the cracks in the septic tank, the bugs and overall game design flaws come with it.
<br>
<br>The first issue I&apos;ll mention is the PVP, I am an avid PVP player and in most games that have solid PVP this is where you&apos;d find me. PVP in Wildstar is a **** joke and it makes me super sad. From the gear, faction population, to classes, the PVP side of the tracks is like **** 8-mile. Included in that is the Little Ricky crack dealers who sell rank boosting services to people who  are too terrible at PVP to legitimately secure their high tier weapon.
<br>
<br>I will not into detail at this point, all you have to do is google &quot;Wildstar PVP&quot; and check it&apos;s forums or subreddit to find out how abysmal it is. They&apos;ve lost some of the more well-known PVPers from other games like WoW already because of it.
<br>
<br>So if you&apos;re not gonna PVP, what else are you going to do?
<br>
<br>Well, you could definitely PVE, they actually spent some time on that side. Think of this side like silicon valley, this is where all the progress and hype is, and the player base is slowly leaning down to the PVE white meat. Provided that, you are a social butterfly or are coming over to this game with many friends, aound 20~ or so should do it. Don&apos;t forget if you&apos;re serious, you&apos;re gonna have to find another 20 all fully attuned and ran through the 20 man raids, to get into the 40 mans.  YOU WILL NOT SEE THE REAL END GAME WITHOUT ANY FRIENDS/GUILDS or even people you can get along with for 3+ hours at a time. Not to mention the attunement process, some people like it, others don&apos;t. Aside from the grindy nature of it, I am ambivalent.
<br>
<br>The (Vet)adventures are pretty boring and similar to GW2, the populace have streamlined the content and refuse to do anything but run the fastest finishing adventure, which sucks if you enjoy the journey and not the end goal. IMO they should just take the choices out, I think player mentality can be generalized at this point in the mmo genre to know designing anything with multiple paths (some of them being faster or easier) is going to be a waste of time on the developers part.
<br>
<br>The (Vet)dungeons, goddamn the (Vet)dungeons. They are an absolute blast. Hands down, the best part of the game ( I hear the Raids are fun too, you can find videos on them, google X-89 fight or someting similar). The dungeons are finely tuned, hard, unforgiving, and will keep you on your toes. They are probably some of the best dungeons I&apos;ve ever played in any game. Even in the lower level versions of the dungeons, test your ability to use your class effectively. Along with the trinity, you&apos;re still being tested as an individual player by A) avoiding the (buttload of) telegraphs and B) find the healer or positioning yourself in an advantageous position to the group. If you&apos;re a dungeon spelunker and looking for a challenging experience, this is 1 of 2 recommendations I&apos;ll give this game.
<br>
<br>A part of what make those dungeons great is the combat system. I want to say with about a 95% certainty, that this game&apos;s combat system has ruined every other games combat system for me. Which is why I am reluctant to move onto other mmos. The telegraphs (player and enemy alike) seems rather clunky and annoying at first, but after a little bit the benefits actually outweigh initial impressions and adds flavor to the combat rather than just standing still and taking auto-attacks to the face. The animations for all the abilities are rather plain to be honest, especially for a contemporary sci-fi mmo.
<br>
<br>Along with the bland visuals of the abilities, overall I think the character design and world designs are lacking. This is a **** space themed MMO. Where are all the non-bipedal creatures that would have evolved on vastly different environment. This game presents a false image of a whole new world, but really it&apos;s just dragons and fantasy characters in space. As far the the player characters go, the races aren&apos;t even varied enough to be considered interesting and really different. Really it&apos;s just different textures placed over the same models with different ears. That pretty much sums it up. There isn&apos;t really any incentive to pick a different faction, as the same archetype follows, 1 large, 2 medium, and one runt size class. On either side.
<br>
<br>The areas are very beautiful, but if you follow the quest you&apos;ll maybe be there for an hour or 2, then you&apos;re off to the next never to revisit them. Kind of a shame, they really are magnificent and beautiful.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is CoD advanced warfare to CoD Modern warefare with WoW. Nothing new and exciting, other than it is one of he most recent MMOs to come out.
<br>
<br>I gave this game a 5 because 1/3 to 1/2 of the game is effed. They could&apos;ve waited on the release and had some more betas to flush out some more of the prevalent bugs.
<br>
<br>I would not reccomend buying it at this time unless you are a slow level type.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4416863">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Quests are really generic and bland (AND THERE ARE TONS AND TONS OF QUESTS) and the mobs take a long time to die which adds a grindy feeling. Oh, and if by some force of will you have made it to level 50, guess what, EVEN MORE GRIND!
<br>
<br>Horrible UI, horrible **** battleground pvp and lacking any tactics, the classes have bugs that still stand to this day.
<br>
<br>The talent system is retarded. It seems some of the most important talents aren&apos;t gotten through leveling but through some low rate dropping items. Especially if you play a Spellslinger you will run into this: spellslingers have a really important talent called Trigger Fingers, now this thing is given by an item with a very low world drop rate and an insane price in the auctionhouse. Good luck with that.
<br>
<br>My highest character level is 22, it&apos;s the highest level I was able to reach in this horrible game. I just entered the Whitevale map, looked at it and said to myself &quot;You know what, **** this!&quot; and deleted the game.
<br>
<br>I see the servers went from heavy (the prime servers) to moderate and even low these days and I&apos;m expecting server mergers really soon. Yeah, there goes another &quot;wow killer&quot;. Too bad, the game did get a lot of the right ideas but the execution is poor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4296456">Expand</a></span>

Hopefully by this time all the haters have hated and the fanboys have spurted their collective juices all over the game so we can start getting more honest reviews.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with gameplay. Combat in the game is done through telegraphs so you can see where your attack will hit and just have to make sure the enemy is in that little cone/box/etc so they will receive damage. Healing tends to work the same way for most classes so just change &quot;enemy&quot; to friend and &quot;receive damage&quot; to healing. The combat isn&apos;t bad by any means. It can make for some really intense combat depending on your foe and each battle feels like it moves at a good pace. The problem for me was in PVP since you can see the enemy player&apos;s telegraphs you end up getting swamped with them. Battles tend to devolve into whoever can spam the most.

<br>In terms of the leveling up process, I felt this was one of Wildstar&apos;s weaker points. Quests are essentiallythe same fetch/kill x amount quests that we have seen from games like WoW. More so than that is though is that the storylines for each quest are pretty forgetable. You have some quest chains that can leave you with a smile but none of them were particularly memorable or felt really significant. Towards the end of my leveling I was pretty much just accepting and completing quests without really paying attention to the quest dialogue.
<br>
<br>Graphic wise the game has some really lovely visuals and landscapes. The characters have a cartoony look to them but I think that adds to the game&apos;s charm. Its a game that doesn&apos;t take itself to seriously in many aspects.The cartoony feel accentuates some of the whacky situations the player will get themselves in.
<br>
<br>End game was sort of the deal breaker for me. Needless to say, without a guild or at least some friends who are somewhat competent end game is a nightmare. If you want to raid you basically have to go on one huge grindfest. You can run the veteran dungeons (harder modes of each dungeon) with pugs but that gets pretty hit and miss since most players seem to leave after the first wipe. Another problem that Wildstar faces is that its overall playerbase has dwindled a bit since launch and servers aren&apos;t as full as they once were. This adds to the problem since it makes que times kinda long. Also it sucks if your faction doesn&apos;t happen to be the dominant one on your server.
<br>
<br>Carbine made it clear that Wildstar was going to cater more towards the hardcore playerbase and they have certainly kept their word. End game is challenging but as I said it can be a grind. So casual players steer clear of this one! I expect this game to pick up some steam again once balancing has been done and the inevitable server merges happen. Maybe then I&apos;ll check this game out again. Until then I&apos;ll stick to the &quot;filthy casual&quot; games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4392955">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1) The game is extremely poorly optimised. Even 3 months in, the games selling point - &quot;Raids!&quot; play at an excruciating 12 frames per second average on my machine (specs: Devils Canyon CPU running @ 4.6 Ghz, 16 gig of Ram, AMD R9 290 GPU, PCIE Plextor SSD&apos;s). The graphics are cartoony and well stylised but really shouldn&apos;t be grinding my system to a halt.
<br>
<br>2) Bugs, lots of them, game breaking ones too. The main Raid attunement questline has multiple bugs blocking progression. Every single adventure and Dungeon in the game has multiple boss bugs and exploits. Every class has bugged skills and abilities. The Medic class currently has an ability glitch allowing Medics to do double the damage of anyone else. This was introduced as a bug fix!
<br>
<br>3) All of the questing content is generic and well boring. The maps and UI are confusing and cluttered and the quests struggle to engage the player in a meaningful way. Most of the content consists of grindy daily quests.
<br>
<br>4) The path system lacks depth and balance across paths
<br>
<br>Part of the problem is that when Carbine have attempted to fix existing bugs and optimise the game the changes they make have made things progressively worse. The game is buggier now a few months on than it was on release.
<br>
<br>The only reason to play Wildstar is for dungeons content and raiding in my opinion. Currently while the Dungeons and Raids are very good and a lot of fun, progression is constantly frustrated by poor itemisation, lacklustre rewards, and bugged progression.
<br>
<br>This sadly isn&apos;t working for Carbine as servers are fast becoming ghost towns. They really need to review their Q&amp;A practices as the game is getting worse rather than better with every patch in terms of bugs and overall playability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4533193">Expand</a></span>

Think Guild Wars meets Star Wars meets Warcraft. Nothing new here, but if you want to play an MMO, you could do much worse.</span>

The game feels and seems cold and shallow when you start it up.. and it also is. The colors, world, interface.. everything seems to be a bit more repulsive than inviting in the game. There isn&apos;t anything really new there MMO wise. Even the sci-fi setting fails... you start in a space-ship and end up hunting rhinos on a savannah. Nothing interesting there for sci-fi lovers.
<br>
<br>I played it regularly with friends and even the co-op action didn&apos;t help. Maybe it&apos;s an MMO for action junkies and for Hardcore people. The dynamic action part is fluent and okay, but everything else is boring. Eventually I guess that the game works and that it has all the pieces a game needs but it&apos;s totally boring and disappointing nevertheless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4404163">Expand</a></span>

If you are lucky someone can give you a 7 day guest pass.
<br>I came into this game probably with too much expectation. Yes this game has some strengths that being an active combat system which is innovative. A skill talent system which allows you to really customise your character. The ability to double jump and sprint is a nice touch and a sense of humour.
<br>The graphics felt dated and the cartoony style isn&apos;t my cup of tea. I did get past my feelings on the graphics and the style grew on me.
<br>But at the end of the day as much as I tried I couldn&apos;t get excited about the game. It felt like I had done this or seen this before. This from someone who has played close to 350 days played or more  on the genre in the last 10 years in numerous games.
<br>In today&apos;s market a subscription based pricing model is very risky and I personally don&apos;t think you will see $180 per year value plus the original $60 for the base game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4263992">Expand</a></span>

But that is because the MMO market is bloated and about to die off. Wait a couple of months until it goes f2p. Even at that point you will probably be done with it within a week.
<br>
<br>Initially people were excited because of it&apos;s space theme, combat, sense of humor, new housing approach and paths.
<br>
<br>The space theme, and humor don&apos;t really translate in game.
<br>
<br>The new housing is okay. The paths were a great idea. I was interested in the settler as I like to help others. But after gathering mats, and finding out the areas to place things were shared with other Settlers, it got old fast.
<br>
<br>They tried with the combat system, but other MMO&apos;s have done the same system already. It&apos;s tough as they are trying to fix MMO&apos;s by adjusting the combat, but it just feels like rip offs of old console games. Just not nearly as well done. If your using a regular mouse it seemed way to click heavy. If you have a gamer mouse it will feel like a massive cheat.
<br>
<br>I found the game world to seem very small. Smaller than most of the new MMO&apos;s and that is small. And like most MMO&apos;s these days, you almost feel punished for grouping. Unless it is a raid or instance. You simply have to kill 100 times more mobs just to make the same amount of XP and money.
<br>
<br>In short there&apos;s nothing game breaking for me. It&apos;s just not good enough to keep my attention. And certainly nothing I would recommend to other MMO fans.
<br>
<br>I give it an average rating, but all the new MMO games, I&apos;ve tried just aren&apos;t that good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4295255">Expand</a></span>

On the plus side: the art and animation are good quality, but the designs tend to be goofy.  Housing is very nice, maybe the best part of the game, if you&apos;re into housing.
<br>
<br>On the minus side: Controls can be awkward, since there is no auto attack.  Multi-tap skills are just a bad idea.  Combat is repetitive and spammy, similar to the Secret World.  Some of the quests are just stupid, such as the initial Save the Sentient Vegetables quest in the game intro.  Paths aren&apos;t too in-depth, just a little bit of add-on skills and gameplay.  The UI is still a real mess and needs consolidation.  Challenges get annoying when already busy with another task, or even another challenge.  The game also gets boring in a hurry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4282103">Expand</a></span>

<br>The endgame is challenging and you&apos;re gonna need a guild to get through the attunement progress (pugging silver runs @ vet dungeons won&apos;t work).
<br>The game is very buggy which leads to support tickets. Don&apos;t be surprised if you buy a weapon or armor from the auction house and you equip it + zone to a different continent that it literally dissapears. That&apos;s frustrating to happen, but what&apos;s even more frustrating is the fact that customer support won&apos;t be answering your ticket any time soon.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d rate the game 9 out of 10 because of the &apos;new feel&apos;, it reminds me alot of World of Warcraft back at launch day. Sadly I&apos;ll have to take 2 points off because of the fact that it is very buggy and customer support is very slow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4338392">Expand</a></span>

That pretty much sums it up, it all boils down to wether you have the free time and are ready to endure the slow grind to level 50.
<br>
<br>Quests, setting &amp; story, graphics, everything ranges from forgetable to downright tedious. It has all been done before, even the suposedly novel telegraph-based combat gameplay which is nothing more than what all action-MMO (such as Neverwinter) have been doing for the past 3 years... Spells and abilities are remarkably scarce and generic. I appreciate their decision to grant two roles (from among dps, healer or tank) to every class, but the very reduced number of spells ends up negating any diversity : as role X, class Y will always be played the same.
<br>
<br>The passive (talent) system succeeds in being both ultra-generic (nodes are named &quot;Critical I, Critical II, Critical III&quot;, etc...) and grindy as some higher-tiered nodes can only be looted, or bought, or farmed. The UI for skills and their assignment to the action-bar is remarkably tedious. Oh and let&apos;s mention the crafting system : it tries to be original but manages to be unintuitive as hell, in addition to being of course much more expensive and time-consuming than it is rewarding.
<br>
<br>One of the game&apos;s arguably biggest strength is its dungeon-system. While very classical, the instances are indeed challenging. That&apos;s a good thing if you have a stable companion group, if you don&apos;t it also means you&apos;ll soon reconcile with every hazard you have known in pugs : leavers, whiners, ninja-looters, afkers, etc...
<br>
<br>It pains me to be so harsh as it&apos;s obvious a great deal of work has done into the making of Wildstar. The content is indeed plentiful, and the polish is undeniable. But at the end of the day, it&apos;s the same ol&apos; MMO stuff we have been fed for the last 10 years. Some players mention having felt the &quot;vanilla wow magic&quot; again, that&apos;s hardly surprising as, let&apos;s face it, despite a few ugrades, this is nothing more than &quot;Vanilla Wow in space&quot;, minus the well-known background.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4269678">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Carbine set out to create an experience similar to classic WoW and they have succeeded in doing just that, for good and for bad. The game requires a large time investment and a high degree of skill to reach the top levels. For a player whom may not fall into both of those categories there may not be much in the game that you enjoy.
<br>
<br>PvP is hard to follow as the screen is cluttered with red and green symbols from the telegraph system. On top of that, skills are unresponsive especially in melee, you may activate a skill with a player in your cross hairs and by the time it fires they may no longer be there.
<br>
<br>Dungeons and adventures are very well done. It will require full group coordination and everyone will have to able to execute their role. There is no being carried here as one inexperienced player will cause the group to die multiple times. There is also no easy mode offered, the dungeons range from very difficulty to near impossible.
<br>
<br>Questing is as generic as you can get. It follows the classic WoW system of moving from hub to hub around the map. You can differentiate the experience a bit with the Path system but missions of this type are very repetitive once you&apos;ve done a couple. Character skill customization is deep but at points seems irrelevant. A healer is going to use heal skills and a tank is going to use tank skills, there are a lot of choices but all of them more or less do the same thing.
<br>
<br>End game PvE experience is excellent and if that is the only thing you&apos;re interested in I would give this game a solid 10 and recommend it. But the questing is average and the PvP is bad so overall the game has to be given an average grade of 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4266074">Expand</a></span>

Now, this is a common complaint hoisted at RPGs, especially MMOs. It is an extremely subjective attack on the game- so I will break it down into its components. The story is, as is often the case in games using text in lieu of voiced dialogue, very weak. You choose a side, based on who wears the most stylish uniforms, and are soon dropped into the open world. Where you wander around, doing standard MMO quests- &quot;fetch ten bear&apos;s asses for a reward&quot;. I didn&apos;t play very far through the story, because it&apos;s boring and pointless.  I honestly don&apos;t believe anybody cared once about their story content. This brings me to the combat. The combat is smooth, with GW2-esque style. The combat, in PvE, at least, is passable. O.K. meh. However, after enough of it, it just feels like a grind. The animation style, which... ugh... looks pretty bad, reminds me of borderlands 2 in the worst ways. Come to think of it, it reminds me of BL2 in a lot of ways. Crappy art style, boring quests and garbage storytelling. Also, I didn&apos;t finish either.
<br>
<br>Interestingly, I never bought this game. I played about ten hours of it in the free &apos;beta&apos; about a week before release (IE, the full game, but just a trial). And that told me everything I needed to know. Including that there was no way in hell I would fork over $60 and a subscription fee for this. Funny, how this game has a higher rating than ESO, a superior MMO by all means.
<br>
<br>3/10
<br>-Lame story, bad graphics, meh combat. $60 bucks and sub fee.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4355772">Expand</a></span>

<br>Cons

1)Questing. Pure questing in the game is boring and it brings to my mind games of past decades or modern f2p ones.

<br>Cons
<br>
<br>1)Questing. Pure questing in the game is boring and it brings to my mind games of past decades or modern f2p ones. From the Age of Conan and beyond some mmorpg games tried to get rid of the endless fetch quests. Wildstar brings them back. Questing feels a lot like WoW so old school MMO players may dig it. ESO questing was a lot lot better
<br>
<br>2) Optimization : I could run games like Tomb Raider, Bioshock Infinite, ESO and many more at high settings with 40-60 fps. In Wildstar i run the game with an average of 20 FPS at medium. If i compare it with ESO which is a recent mmo, there i had around 40-50 at high settings in every area but crowded cities and mass pvp ( 100 people and more)
<br>
<br>3) Some major class bugs. Even though the game had quite a smooth launch there are quite a few bugs in the class i play. I play engineer. 20-30% of the skills are not working properly and tons of them have hit detection issues especially in pvp. I can&apos;t talk for the other classes though.
<br>
<br>4) Path system is weak. It&apos;s a good innovation but right now it adds almost nothing in the game.
<br>
<br>Good things
<br>
<br>1)Dungeons. If you like Dungeons this game is for you. By far the most satisfying dungeons you can find in an mmo game.
<br>
<br>2) Wonderful art direction.
<br>
<br>3)Interesting classes. Yes there are bugs, yes some of them luck visuals but at the end of the day you&apos;re gonna have trouble picking a class because almost all of them are fun. Even if i don&apos;t have a high level warrior, if you are into warrior dps wildstar managed to make the most dull class in MMO games actually FUN.
<br>
<br>4)Smooth launch at the part of pve content. Even though as i said there is poor optimization and some class bugs, pve content is really smooth.
<br>
<br>5) Housing is awesome
<br>
<br>Who should play this game? People who enjoy being in a guild  &apos;cause the quality content of the game is made for guilds. Old school mmorpg players who don&apos;t mind tons of fetch quests and people who enjoy dungeons and raids. If you plan to play solo you better stay away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4282036">Expand</a></span>

The bright world style and the full screen bloom effect doesn&apos;t help either.</span>

<br>
<br>BTW: don&apos;t get fooled thinking this game is somewhat more &quot;hardcore&quot; than anything else out there. It&apos;s not. Sure, you can die way faster in Wildstar due to many merciless, one-hit mechanics. But in the end it&apos;s the same **** like in any other MMO you&apos;ve played so far. If you don&apos;t have problems memorizing the movement in other games, there&apos;s really not much difference here. It&apos;s simply an annoyance thing, not an evolution in game mechanics ....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4325511">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Every person I know that got this game quit within the first month (I quit after a week and a half). Most got to max level to find that the only way to successfully complete a dungeon (with a decent ranking for good loot) was to run only with people from the guild. So unless you have a guild full of competent people that don&apos;t mind running some of the most boring content in an MMO there really isn&apos;t a reason to get this game.
<br>
<br>You can literally pick ANY other MMO on the market and they are better than this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4538696">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Original Review 6/23/14:
<br>I actually came to this site on a whim because a friend of mine bought me Wildstar because he wanted someone to jam with and I was wondering what score people were giving it. I have played many MMOs including: EQ, Asheron&apos;s Call, AC2(beta), WoW(beta), Eve, Rift(beta), Guild Wars 1 and 2(beta), DDO, SWTOR(beta), Planetside, Warhammer(beta), FF11, FF14(beta) and many others. Skip the next paragraph labelled &apos;RANT&apos; to start the review.
<br>
<br>RANT: Before I start I just have to say to all those &apos;rating a game lower just to balance out the score&apos;; Grow up. You are giving one rating for one game. If someone else feels the game/movie/show is the best thing ever, WHO CARES; Good for them they found their dream game/movie/show. When I see a review with a rating of &apos;0&apos; I don&apos;t even bother reading anymore. Giving a rating of &apos;0&apos; says you enjoyed NOTHING about the game and the game had NO merit. Which means one of two things A)You are a moron for picking up a game type you don&apos;t like so much that you would rather have your teeth pulled without meds or B) The game had so many flaws that you could not actually play it and neither could anyone else. As someone who has been part of team working to create a game I can tell you which is the more likely choice.
<br>
<br>Wildstar is the new MMORPG by the producers of the Guild Wars series, Lineage series, Aion, and other MMOs. Basically all they seem to do is make MMOs.
<br>
<br>MMORPG means you must expect rpg elements(character leveling, character stats, gear) in a massive environment filled with other people. `IF YOU CAME LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE YOU ARE IN THE WRONG PLACE.
<br>Every new MMO(that I&apos;ve tried) seems to try to add something new to the genre to get their own niche in the market(and attract those looking for a WoW slayer). Wildstar is not new in this, but they do have some interesting things that they bring to the table.
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>Voice Acting: I have never heard better voice acting in an MMO.
<br>Wildstar humor: They have their own edgy, odd, but fairly funny humor, Cupcake.(Watch a vid and see if you like the humor)
<br>Credd: I like subscription games that allow you to exchange ingame gold with subscription time with NO other benefits like pay-to-win.
<br>Housing: Odd how much time one is willing to spend at your own House running Challenges.
<br>Telegraph System(system showing area of ground that will be effected by a particular ability): Probably Wildstar&apos;s biggest niche MMO contribution. Player Telegraphs don&apos;t get too amazing but some of the bosses(and even regular npcs sometimes) get amazingly complex telegraphs.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>Minor annoying bugs- Opening up a &quot;Boom-Box&quot; gift one time didn&apos;t show the item(only an empty space) for about 10 minutes.
<br>I love to PvP in whatever MMO I play.  It&apos;s my favorite thing to do.  Healing in PvP is has now been broken(unplayable) for a week now.  You cannot keep yourself alive much less another person.  It&apos;s not a certain class or spec, but ALL HEALING.
<br>I  have dealt with minor class imbalances before in the variety of MMOs I have played.  I am likely using rosecolored glasses in looking back, but I don&apos;t ever remember it being this bad before.
<br>
<br>Neither a PRO or a CON, but just some things that need mentioning.
<br>The skill system doesn&apos;t really seem to pick up until about 25. So if the skills and amps seems boring up until there, thats why. They have the same type of skill limit that Guild Wars has. Some people love it, some people hate it.
<br>
<br>Total Points:
<br>Start with Average 5
<br>+1 Humor
<br>+1 Voice Acting
<br>+1 Credd
<br>+1 Housing
<br>+1 Telegraph System
<br>-2 Bugs(the amount of bugs is getting ridiculous)
<br>-1 PvP being unplayable for more than a week with no end still in sight.
<br>-1 Class imbalance getting further and further out of proportion.
<br>-1 Dev focus being to fix minor issues (fixed Chua-fatter-than-normal and fixed Aurin Males slack-jaw) before broken skills/amps/quests
<br>
<br>Overall:5
<br>
<br>I going to leave out the low population on many servers because that can actually being fixed by the players by switching to a different server.  Also going to leave out the caustic forum environments because you don&apos;t have to read player forums to gather info.
<br>
<br>Buy/Wait/Not Buy Suggestion- If you are looking for a new MMORPG, currently look elsewhere.  Maybe come back in 2-3 months.  Though I can&apos;t see myself giving it less than 5-6 months if I go back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4293432">Expand</a></span>

They have had combat like this in MMOs for a good 2-3 years.  PvE is the same old gather/kill/objective crap.  Just nothing new.  I tried it and I just couldn&apos;t get into it.  Nice try though.</span>

A zero would be a game that&apos;s so broken there is no way it could be played. If you just don&apos;t like a game but it functions then its maybe a five. Now on with it Wildstar is a blast, has a fast gameplay style for a MMO that&apos;s hard to be found. Fighting is a dance of skill,dodging, and timing. There is no simple auto attack you must aim watch your cool downs and time your attacks. The game has a very funny laid back vibe kinda has a borderlands feel. Crafting is a nice tight system that will be easy for anyone who play&apos;s MMO&apos;s to jump into. The housing system is top notch and I haven&apos;t had this much freedom since SWG you get your own plot of land in the sky you can build hundreds of things on your land. Want to garden got it personal mine got it, crafting table got it, a train full of hobo&apos;s got that to. If you like MMO&apos;s enjoy raiding, pvp, building your own place ine the world Wildstar will wrap you up in its arms and love you back. The game has some bug still they do updates and server maintenance almost daily and are working very hard to get the game at 100%. They have already had a much better launch then most MMO&apos;s and are doing large wave bans to get rid of bots and hackers. The game is top notch with your normal launch bugs but is fast on its way to a 10 in the MMO world. Do yourself a favor and get wildstar see you on Nexus.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4294923">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Apart from that the gameplay is OK, the quests are fairly interesting and slightly better than other games, the environment is different but I couldn&apos;t care less about it TBH, yes it&apos;s art style is nice but I mean there are so many games which use this &quot;cartoon art style&quot; it&apos;s starting to get boring. The combat is different enough and works well enough to class it as a refreshing change. The story again I couldn&apos;t care less about it, maybe that&apos;s because I play games like RuneScape and LOTRO which has amazing story content, but yeah the wildstar story never gripped me during my time with the game.
<br>
<br>Overall It&apos;s worth a look if you&apos;re an MMO player just to test it out, but I personally see Wildstar as a secondary MMO something I&apos;d turn to when I get bored of grinding in my main MMOs, it&apos;s like the Chromebook of the MMO world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4284896">Expand</a></span>

<br>Wildstar has a great dynamic combat system. You have to aim your abilities towards your targets. Enemies also utilize this system. They may throw out tornadoes, lightning, bananas, rising spikes, etc at you. This forces you to plan and position to overcome obstacles.
<br>
<br>The art and environment is simply beautiful and even dynamic. The art is somewhat cartoon-y, but it has various colors and lighting that immerses you in the world of Nexus. Also, all zones have hazards such as man-eating plants, sand tornadoes, toxicity clouds, falling meteors, etc.
<br>
<br>The dungeons are very challenging, but rewarding. The combat style is much more intense than that of open world combat. I have wiped many times on the first dungeon. There are bosses that require a different strategy for different parties. None of these dungeons are &quot;tank-n-spank&quot;. You simply cannot afk (idle) and expect someone to carry you to win the fight. Tanks cannot just tank, dps cannot just dps, and healers cannot just heal. They all have to learn to adapt to the enemy abilities and combat. If you lose one player, the fight becomes much more challenging.
<br>
<br>Housing. Housing is by far one of the best aspects of the game. I have never dug into housing before in other MMOs sans this one. The amount of customization is astounding. You can add air conditioning to your room,  open bars outside, and even change the sky and lighting of your very own plot of land in the sky. The cool part is that housing decorations give bonuses to your exp, known as rest exp.

Some are passive in that they don&apos;t require you to actively collect the materials (Yey no more skinning). Crafting materials are stored seperately from your bags with no limit, so no need to worry about conserving space. Each profession has &quot;achievements&quot; that build up to grant you talent points in that specific profession. These can consist of lowering failure rate, better chance of rune slots, etc.
<br>
<br>Combat : No more face rolling enemies. The telegraph system that highlights the range of their special abilities requires you to be reactive, and to try to avoid as much damage as possible. Most enemies will have a combo of sorts that do tremendous damage, but can easily be learned to be more efficient at defeating them.
<br>
<br>Dungeons/Adventures : Bored with 5 minute heroic runs like WoW? Then you are in for a treat. Bosses, and even some of the trash packs can be difficult to overcome. Adventures literally mean an adventure taking up to almost an hour to finish. Instead of a linear dungeon, you will have the chance to pick what scenario you want to pursue. A bunch of rebels are being held captive? Or some farms being terrorized? You get to vote amongst your 4 party members what you will do. Regular dungeons will scale you level down to when you first unlocked it. Think of this as challenge mode in WoW where all your gear is brought down to a 463 item level. No more power housing through with a level 50 player to carry you.
<br>
<br>Player Housing : I really didn&apos;t know what to think of it at first other than some random place you could visit at your leisure. As you progress and find new things to add to your decor, you will get certain benefits. You can have your own crafting station for your professions, a dedicated node for a particular profession, or just items that increase the amount of rested experience you accrue such as a bed, couch, etc. There are also mini-games that are associated with what you place on your land as well.
<br>
<br>Quests : It does have the standard kill this many, collect this much, or go here and there. The interesting part here is that it isn&apos;t based upon how many. Instead it is percentage based so that the harder difficulty the enemy is will give you a higher percentage of credit. You have your standard enemies, but there is also tough, and &quot;elite&quot; enemies. There are a handful of goofy quests for comic relief that lighten the atmosphere to show that the game is about having a good time.
<br>
<br>Abilities/Talents : Abilities come in 3 seperate categories depending on their function. These abilities can be further improved by allocating a point in them to make them more effective. At levels 25 and 45 you unlock a Tier for them that gives them a special benefit. Wildstar did make it a point at customization, and you can easily swap out your abilities and any points allocated to them by simply removing them from your bar. You just leveled and purchased a new ability that is more effective? Then go ahead and remove that starter spell and put all those awesome points to make that new ability that much stronger. The talent system (AMP) has 3 tiers. The 1st tier only requires one AMP point to allocate, but the 2nd tier requires 4, and the 3rd tier requires 6. Some are available immediately, but some require the use of an AMP that can be dropped by enemies, somewhat akin to Glyphs from WoW. Unlike WoW though, these can unlock profound abilities that can bolster your current role/play style immensely.
<br>
<br>Wildstar overall is not exactly innovative, but still a refreshing change of pace. One thing that many players miss is the sense of accomplishment when you get something done. If you have played WoW (Which who are we kidding is most of us), you could consider this an alternate universe of the Burning Crusade/Wrath of the Lich King era. The difficulty is there, the investment that is required pays off, and after it is said and done. You feel like a boss. In otherwords if you miss what WoW used to be, then I would strongly recommend giving it a chance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wildstar/user-reviews?user_review_id=4284697">Expand</a></span>
