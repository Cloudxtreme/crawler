Right out of the gate my hopes got a quick reality check.Darkest of Days tries to put you in the middle of the battle and does a good job when it forces you to play the part you&apos;ve &quot;jumped&quot; into. Most notably, the first Civil War mission really made me feel like I was blending in to not disrupt history and that I was really there. Unfortunately it goes down hill quickly from there. The plot begins to meander quickly with, and the level design becomes worse and worse. I found more invisible wall in DoD than in another game I&apos;ve played, often in areas that seemed to suffer from serious &quot;rail-shooter&quot;-itis. Darkest of Day&apos;s concept is there, but the writing (especially the dialogue) doesn&apos;t do it justice. When you are told by a mysterious stranger literally &quot;You are actually working for the bad guys&quot; you can&apos;t help but laugh. Your partner&apos;s quips are forgettable and his ever present Australian Boony cap is always out of place and almost stands out for everything wrong with DoD. Yeah you (the developer) may think its cool, but does it make sense? I wouldn&apos;t mind a DoD2, but put a bit more thought into the story and level design next time guys.<br><br>TLDR: If the concept of killing Prussians with a man portable MIRV launcher is your thing, its worth snagging if it ever goes on sale on steam. Bad level design and bad writing make DoD sadly forgettable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkest-of-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=1689364">Expand</a></span>

After playing a few levels I dreaded having to pick a Civil War mission. Last time I checked you shouldn&apos;t dread anything while playing a game. The story was uninspired and left little to no connection with either of the main characters. The icing on the cake was how short the game was, 5-6 hours of gameplay. Wait for this to hit the bargain bins or just skip it all together, you aren&apos;t missing anything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkest-of-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=84713">Expand</a></span>

The graphics were good, Story was very well done, Very high replay value, and the idea was played out spectacularly. I loved every moment playing this game as i went through different eras of time with guns from their appropriate time.  The critics must have been blind idiots when they played.</span>

I don&apos;t know why it go such a low rating. I just think its so cool how you get to go to the Civil War, WW1,WW2,  and back to ancient times!</span>

<br>
<br>Lets start with the story, I wont lie I didn&apos;t play past the first few levels because of this. From what I recall, you were a cow-boy in the frontier fighting off native warriors, but you are eventually pulled through a warp in time... yeah that makes complete sense, get pulled from your roughneck world to a futuristic world full of advanced technologies that you somehow know to use!
<br>
<br>Beyond this point it was full of story-breaking loopholes, and unanswered questions.
<br>
<br>The Story is bad, now they should redeem through game play right? Wrong, the game play is very stiff and not innovative at all compared to the ideas that were advertised with the games release.
<br>The enemy AI is a very sad thing to see, constantly getting stuck or glitching across the map into your face. While you are surrounded by allies that cannot do a thing, and I don&apos;t mean a small squad, no you are surrounded at some points by MASSIVE armies, that do nothing but stand in your way, blocking any action and causing incredible stress to the system. I hate to imagine how it would affect a computer.
<br>
<br>To call it short, the game play felt like I was playing call of duty but without good controlling.
<br>
<br>Well that is my rant for the day, sorry to ruin your day mate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkest-of-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=3361063">Expand</a></span>

Because it&apos;s from a poor unknown developer it gets slated for being a &apos;rehash of ideas&apos; from other shooters, while Call of Duty MW 2 gets praised despite being virtually a rehash of every COD game to date! The games graphics are good, the criticism of them is ridiculous and just goes to show the times we live in when unless everything is expertly shaded, textured to the max and runs on DX 22 etc. then it&apos;s instantly rubbish! The game still looks better than many out there. The voice acting is lackluster but it&apos;s hardly all about that. The important thing is that right from the start I really enjoyed playing the game! From the first night-time skirmish against Confederate forces, I enjoyed the reload mechanic of the game and using the old muzzle loader. Being a fan of the Call of Juarez games, I like games set in &apos;ye olden days&apos;! Makes a nice change. As others have said, gameplay matters, and this game despite it&apos;s quirks has it in spades. Just hope that little Monkeylabs sell enough despite the idiotic reviews to stay in business!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkest-of-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=740555">Expand</a></span>

Sure it&apos;s buggy and the AI is that of a margarita machine, but the idea was sound. My biggest regret was paying full price. If the game was launched with a 19.99 price point I think it would have done better.</span>

Even though it looked like it had low production value, I was intrigued enough to try the game based on it having a new backstory that wasn&apos;t a recycled &quot;evil men trying to conquer the world with a bomb/virus/etc.&quot; There are some very fun parts of the game (the shooting tutorial with the red simulated soldiers, the period-specific weapons) but I&apos;d have to say the laser guided 5-rocket launcher is some of the most fun I&apos;ve had with any shooter. Who hasn&apos;t thought about what would happen if you introduced modern weaponry into historical battles? Mowing down Confeds with an assault rifle is glorious indeed. However, the game still needs a lot of refinement and polish. I&apos;m willing to give the devs another chance; they clearly have good ideas. I hope they build upon them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkest-of-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=742128">Expand</a></span>

This game is quite original and so far quite fun. The graphics are very nice especially considering the VAST expanse of scenery and draw distance. I&apos;m playing in 7.1 surround sound and the positioning is SUPERB! I can&apos;t tell you the amount of times I&apos;ve had massive trouble getting 7.1 to work correctly in AAA games. This one worked right out of the box (or... more correctly... right of of the Steam since I downloaded it). The battles are vast and have a distinct feeling to them. I&apos;m amazed at the amount of NPC soldiers involved on the field. AI is as good as any AI I&apos;ve played on AAA games. The utilize cover and pop in and out. Devs like this should be encouraged. Sure there is no multiplayer... so what?! MOST of the time the multiplayer is same old, same old. Unless you are creating a TF2 or L4D, I prefer a great single-player experience. Only major drawback for me so far is the lack of SLI support. But running at 3840x1024 (Triplehead2Go over three monitors) with Medium Physics and 2x AA, 16XAF, I get steady 30-35 fps. One has to question the maturity or ethics of sites doling out scores that are equivalent to saying the game is literally garbage. Bottom line: it&apos;s fun to play.

I wouldn&apos;t even debate the flaws mentioned by other reviewers, both professional and amateur. What I enjoyed most about the game were the Civil War scenarios; in fact, I think the game would have been better overall if the plot had focused entirely on changing the outcome of the Civil War. For example, we know the North won, but what if they had actually lost &quot;the first time around&quot;, and the game detailed the exploits of various time-traveling factions tying to influence the outcome? I think that would have been great. Nonetheless, playing as a Civil War soldier with both period-appropriate weapons as well as a futuristic arsenal was a lot of fun. I could have done without the WWI missions, as they just didn&apos;t seem as interesting to me. Another thing the game does well is rendering large-scale battles that have one-hundred or more soldiers on the battlefield at one time. As I&apos;m sure other reviews have stated, the AI for all of those soldiers isn&apos;t all that great, but if it were, there&apos;s absolutely no way you&apos;d survive the thick of most of those battles. Another flaw: nobody seems to notice when you&apos;re using one of the futuristic weapons, and this bothers me only because I think it would have been humorous to hear some of the other soldiers comment about the weapon you&apos;re using, or to see them run away in fear or call you the devil or something along those lines. I wish I could argue against all of the negative comments people have made about DoD, but the fact is that the game does have it&apos;s issues. Somehow, I&apos;m just one of those people that managed to have fun playing the game despite those issues. If you ever see the game on sale, let&apos;s say around $10 or so, I&apos;d recommend giving it a shot. Otherwise, DoD is one of those &quot;love-it-or-leave-it&quot; games that you just have to play for yourself to see which camp you fall into. If you enjoy shooters, keep an eye out for this one to be on sale; at the regular price, it&apos;s difficult for me to recommend simply because I&apos;d hate to see someone spend that much money on a game that they may not like.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkest-of-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=1659404">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game engine is quite impressive with the amount of stuff than can be rendered on screen at once, and the physics and particle effects are particularly good...I was running a paltry 9600 GT when I played this with gpu physX at 1400 by 900 and the frame rate was pretty solid. The weapon models look authentic and the swirling gunsmoke is so realistic you could almost smell it. You can blow chunks out of the ground with cannons and other explosives, and the ragdolls that go flying in every direction is quite spectacular and the way they slump against tree stumps brings the realism further. The sci-fi aspect of the story is neat even if a bit unfocused but it brings rise to some cool laser weapons and there are the key figures to rescue in order to change history &amp; others to assassinate that have a purple glow around them...it makes for quite compelling stuff. The maps in the game can be quite large and you can wander a fair way off track, it sort of can feel like playing one of the alpha versions of s.t.a.l.k.e.r. in that respect. Something interesting, I just played Civil War Secret Missions the other day, and it is remarkably similar to this game but obviously it doesn&apos;t have the time travel fiction aspects which gives DoD an edge.
<br>
<br>If you are even remotely interested in Darkest of Days give it a go, I haven&apos;t finished it myself yet, maybe the Pompeii levels are completely awesome for all I know</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkest-of-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=5263690">Expand</a></span>
