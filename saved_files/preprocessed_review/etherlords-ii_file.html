But those become small details in front of the graphics and game concepts behind them. This is a real card game like MTG could be, with the benefit of great graphics during battles. It could seem difficult to play and learn... well, it is. I&apos;ve played this at the time of its first release and still now I desire to play it again. Once you finish the campaign you still have to master your deckbuildng skills, and THERE is where the game really shines. So many possibilities, so many strategies, so many level of customization. I&apos;ve enjoyed playing so many styles with this game I hardly found similar games with the same level of diversification between decks. I&apos;ve to admit there are a couple of &quot;unbeatable&quot; decks, but by the time you discover them you&apos;ll have played (and enjoyed) a ton of hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/etherlords-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4785415">Expand</a></span>

Graphics and animations are gorgeous. The different races have unique identity and capacities, allowing for different strategies for each of them. The combat system is solid and quite fun. However the campaign is a complete let down and has no re-playability value. You earn new cards and experice through combat, but the mobs become very hard almost immediately. Mobs do not spawn back, so earning the necessary experience to advance in the (non existent) plot is quite hard.
<br>A game worth playing once - to discover its mechanisms and for its beauty.
<br>I advise you to buy it on steam for a couple $$.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/etherlords-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3965125">Expand</a></span>
