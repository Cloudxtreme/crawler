The setting and atmosphere is truly unique and the game offers a tremendous challenge, and particularly the end boss who will wipe out your samurai permanently if he kills them. The design is very original too, which is both good and bad really. Some of the design decisions are somewhat weird and slow the game down a lot. Particularly this applies to the absence of a good way to replenish your chi. This leads to a lot of waiting, especially if you want your spell caster(s) to level up at the same speed as your other characters. And you really need him to if you want to use him. And you will because he becomes very powerful.
<br>Anyway, apart form this slightly tedious part of the game there is a novel and well implemented crafting system which never lets you have enough of anything really, except ingredients to use for it which can fill two full inventories after a while. But it means you have to make important decisions which is always good.
<br>If you can take the slightly dated graphics, which look pretty good still after 14 years, then Throne of Darkness is highly recommended. Make sure you can run it though. Compatibility issues abound with these old games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/throne-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=5094829">Expand</a></span>
