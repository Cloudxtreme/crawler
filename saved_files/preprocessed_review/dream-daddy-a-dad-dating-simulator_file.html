<br>This is a comfort food game. Filling, not extremely difficult but most importantly, wholesome. It&apos;s personally worth the pricetag currently but if you&apos;re still weary, wait until a steam sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415593">Expand</a></span>

As a trans person, the amount of attention and care the writers and creators took in creating a diverse environment is remarkable. For a game that could have easily been a joke, there is so much heart and depth to the lives of the characters. We learn about our daughter and grow so close to her through the very early parts of the game, and each character you engage with has their own little vibrant stories to tell. For a game with a very easily marketable tag to it (date the Dads! Daddy dating! haha etc.) family plays a significant part in the entire narrative. It&apos;s heartwarming and funny and absolutely worth your time. If you&apos;re a fan of the genre, this is a must have for your collection. I cannot sing this games praises enough at this point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415723">Expand</a></span>

First of all, the game looks and sounds beautiful I loved the design of the characters and backgrounds. I was also pleasantly surprised by the writing, dating sims sometimes have a tendency to be a little cringey I did not experience that with this game. There are so many times when this game is genuinely hilarious while still keeping with the theme of silly dad humor, and when it switches to the moments of seriousness it feels very genuine and not at all out of place. If I had any complaints at all it would be that I wish there were a few more options in character creation especially for eyes and mouths and I wish it was longer! But the game has so much replayability that it doesn&apos;t really matter if it&apos;s not super long. Overall this game is a lot of fun and if you like dating sims, visual novels or if you just love hot dads I highly recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415762">Expand</a></span>

Consent in games in this genre are not very clear so the fact that this is not only a gay dating simulator, which again not many realistic ones, BUT shows that consent should always be asked. There were no errors, besides one that was just an extra space in a sentence. I know, the end of the world? But have you seen my grammar.
<br>
<br>Sum it up, I played for 2 hours, cried about 5 times and love my Dadsona.
<br>
<br>Edit: I got carried away, but I need to add that the game will not be for people who like visual novels, but it&apos;s not only a visual novel. You can choose what to do and what routes you take. Plus being able to add dads with chest binders is a HUGE plus.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415745">Expand</a></span>

Choose your aesthetic and set out on a delightful journey with your very cool daughter Amanda. There are so many different dads you can date in the simulation, though it does tend to steer you towards certain dads depending on the choices you make. Some of the funniest parts are the mini-games, like the Pokemon styled Dad Brag Battle game.
<br>
<br>I am greatly enjoying the game and look forward to finishing it. I like that you can choose to be a naughty dad, a fun dad, or a shy dad. There&apos;s all kinds of characters, fun &quot;dad&quot; jokes, and hilarious interaction with townspeople. My favorite character is definitely the daughter, Amanda.
<br>
<br>The only critique I personally have is that the dialogue is a bit long from time to time. I know conversations are a huge part of dating simulators, but there are some scenes where I felt it could have been shorter than it was. That&apos;s pretty much it! Buy this game, it&apos;s totally fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415766">Expand</a></span>

<br>When dealing with topics that really matter, this game demonstrates more tact and depth than you&apos;d probably expect from something that sounds like a kinky novelty sim. Yet Dream Daddy somehow manages to not take itself very seriously-- without relying on cynical, &apos;ironic,&apos; or condescending treatment of the subject matter. This is just a very genuine, heartwarming little game about relationships-- both romantic and familial. You can tell that everyone involved cared about ensuring their audience would have a fun time.
<br>The writing charms your pants off at every turn, it shakes things up with the occasional silly minigame, and no character is completely irredeemable-- not even a certain housewife, which I appreciated. There&apos;s a lot of misogyny present in some gay-male-oriented spaces and it would&apos;ve been easy to just throw her under the bus as an antagonist.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>A bit buggy at launch-- a lot of folks still aren&apos;t 100% clear whether Joseph&apos;s good end is currently accessible at all. Hopefully this&apos;ll get addressed soon.
<br>A little short, but honestly not THAT short considering the conventions of the genre, and considering that enough routes should be humorous and enjoyable enough to spend time replaying the game.
<br>A little less spicy than some people on the internet were -probably- hoping, but hey. I can understand the choice to keep the tone light and wholesome. That&apos;s what fan works are for, after all ;)
<br>
<br>Overall, as long as you&apos;re not coming into this thing totally expecting it to be something it&apos;s not, I have no clue why anyone wouldn&apos;t have a good time. If you aren&apos;t a fan of cheesy dad humor or busting a gut the first time eggplant emojis fling themselves across a screen, then sorry, but you prooobably weren&apos;t actually paying attention to the game&apos;s marketing campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7416263">Expand</a></span>

You can tell so much heart and soul went into this, and I&apos;m so proud of Vernon Shaw and his team for putting this out as a first game.

<br>As a member of the LGBT community, this game is a fantastic representation, with multiple gay, bisexual, and transgender characters. It never feels like it&apos;s pandering to the LGBT community, and it DEFINITELY never plays off of typical gay stereotypes in an attempt to make a joke. Homophobia does not even seem to exist in this world, which is a fantastic change of pace for the community, which usually has to deal with homophobia in some form in almost everything else.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll be the first to admit it has a few flaws. The game feels very short, I&apos;ve romanced every Dad at least once in a little under 15 hours, but there is still replayability there due to there being multiple and &quot;secret&quot; endings for each Dad. Even so, it feels like it cuts off just as it starts getting really good. It&apos;s been two days since it released, so there are still a couple bugs and inconsistencies (especially in the minigames,) but I imagine these will be patched up fairly quickly.
<br>
<br>Is it worth $14.99? Depends. If you really enjoy the Game Grumps humor, fabulous LGBT representation, and a nice old-fashioned dating simulator, go for it! If you&apos;re like me, who spent weeks browsing fanart, counting down the days until the release date, and regularly checking the DDADDS Twitter page for updates, absolutely buy it. If you&apos;re not really a fan of dating simulators or the Game Grumps, maybe wait for a sale or a discount to hit it first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7418983">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, a queer game made it to the #1 top seller on Steam despite how toxic the internet can be towards queer topics and especially in games. In DDaDDS (Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator) you take on the role of a widowed father of one, Amanda. In this story-driven, choose-your-path simulator you end up moving into a Cul de Sac (Up until this point, I always thought it was Cul ve Sac! I learned something from a video game!). Your daughter Amanda is going off to college soon, and it seems like your only source of interaction are going to be all these hawt dads that coincidentally, live on the same Cul de Sac as you (Super convinced it&#x2019;s the Matrix for daddies)
<br>
<br>A Happy Ending?
<br>Dating is hard, and in a videogame, it&#x2019;s a lot harder. DDaDDS presents you with opportunities to make your own choice in decisions that will affect the outcome of the storylines you partake in. The stories I experienced were with my daughter Amanda, and Craig. Picking the &#x201C;right&#x201D; choices are very important if you&#x2019;re looking to romance your daddy, or have a good relationship with your daughter. At first, it felt like the game was giving me many choices, allowing me to continue with my &#x201C;own story&#x201D; However, when I got to the end of the third date with Craig, he ended up rejecting me. I had realized that on the 2nd date, I had to &#x201C;do better&#x201D; (Daddies will indicate with different &#x201C;glows&#x201D;, like Hearts, Dark Clouds, and of course, EGGPLANTS). It&#x2019;s a reminder that every decision you make in real life can affect outcomes. Luckily, in DDaDDs, you can easily rewind time by loading an auto-save from before the time you screwed up. In a weird way, this game has caused me to be more wary of my actions in any future friendships I&#x2019;ll have.
<br>
<br>If you&#x2019;re like me, you&#x2019;ll get swept away in the writing of this game. From the dad-jokes (Obama Jokes) that give you an honest chuckle, to the hypothetical scenarios where I&#x2019;d catch myself thinking &#x201C;How would I handle this with my child?&#x201D; (Oh honey, I&#x2019;ll never have one, I&#x2019;m too selfish and fabulous). The writing is so convincing, you may even fall for your digital daddy but then realize, oh he&#x2019;s just a hologram.
<br>
<br>The great things about this game, could go on and on. To sum it all up in a sentence: Streamer Mode to remove any non-royality free music, great customizable options for your Dadsona (though more outfits would be greatly appreciated!), and dare I say it: The Dad Tips during loading screens BEAT any Sims loading screen tips and will provide wise wisdom to last a lifetime.
<br>
<br>So, now that you&#x2019;ve read my recommendation, get your Dadsona on and date some dads!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7432021">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Each dad had a very unique story.  One I totally bombed, and plan on going back through to figure out where I went wrong.  The rest of the dads had very well rounded characters.  Each dad also had unique children to play by their side.  Your interactions with dads and children led to different pros and cons in each storyline.  It was really fun, and quite the challenge to chose the right answers.
<br>
<br>One of the very unique things about this game took me by surprise.  The visibility of transgendered people.  There was an option in the very beginning for you to be a female to male dad.  Never before have I encountered such an option in games I&apos;ve played.  So thank you, game designers.  You guys took a big leap, and I feel it&apos;s going to pay off.
<br>
<br>The minigames.  Talk about panic inducing.  I was taken off guard each time because they were not what I was expecting.  Was I mad that they were super hard?  No.  I was laughing every time because if their suddeness and their difficulty.  They were cheesy and fun.
<br>
<br>The voice acting?  I was expecting more.  But, just because my expectations were high, doesn&apos;t mean it had to be delivered.  There was enough to add simple elements to the game.  The end of date quotes also made me chuckle.
<br>
<br>Will I play this again?  Heck yeah.  I&apos;m not even done playing it yet.  I want to unlock all the secrets and dad endings.  Overall, this cute, short visual novel brought me much joy.  It gave me what I expected from a dad on dad dating game.  Humor, excitement, mystery, grunting, and realllly bad dad jokes.
<br>
<br>I look forward to these guys making another game.  As a gay dude, I really thank you guys for showing we&apos;re just like everyone else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7416024">Expand</a></span>

It makes you care about every single dad there is in the game. It&apos;s one of the best dating sims I&apos;ve ever played.

I don&apos;t wanna get too indepth with spoilers but every route I&apos;ve been on so far has been engaging and charming, even characters I thought I wouldn&apos;t like as much. The humor is just tonally perfect - it nails the groan-worthy dad jokes, and the punchlines are never cruel.
<br>The kids are written fantastically as well (especially Amanda, but also the other dads&apos; kids) - never super critical of them (even when they&apos;re jerks), sympathetic to the things they&apos;re going through while acknowledging, yeah, some kid drama is... kinda over the top.
<br>
<br>While I love regular visual novel mechanics on their own, the minigames add an extra layer of fun to it! I absolutely sucked at the golf minigame though and I refuse to git gud because I could feel my eye twitching IRL. Exception that proves the rule, though, y&apos;know? But at the end of every date, if I get an S-rank rating I&apos;m fist-pump levels of excited about it.
<br>Also, the skip-through-text function is done perfectly. I&apos;ve played VNs that just didn&apos;t have that, and others that had it but clumsy - this one give you the perfect amount of control over zooming through text you&apos;ve already read.
<br>
<br>And the queer rep in this is just so well done! From the offset you get the choice between being a cis or a trans guy, and you get to pick whether your ex-partner was your wife or your husband, and whether you adopted your daughter or not. Then, throughout, characters are just... nice to you. (Mostly.) That sounds like small stuff but, I&apos;m a bi NB-ish guy who&apos;s played a lot of gay VNs and I&apos;ve never yet encountered one that&apos;s actually treated us so well. When I told some of my trans guy friends that was an option they happily freaked out. It apparently makes no difference whatsoever to gameplay, but, I guess, why would it? It&apos;s nice having little details like that that let us all know, y&apos;know, we&apos;ve been thought about. We&apos;re not just the butt of a joke or a sexy commodity.
<br>
<br>Anyway I took like 5 minutes away from the game to write this and that&apos;s a tragedy and I&apos;m going right back to it immediately.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415703">Expand</a></span>

The dialogue is fun and honestly I feel more invested in the relationship with my in-game daughter than 80% of the people in my real life. The developers did a great job with building characters that feel like real people you care about.
<br>
<br>That said, the game isn&apos;t perfect. I do agree that it could stand to be longer. Three dates with each dad feels a little rushed making this connection with them. There are also some very minor graphics and audio issues which are overall easy to ignore. I will say that some of the mini games could use a little more explanation than they get. It can take a bit to understand what&apos;s happening.
<br>
<br>But overall, this game is just a fun feel good experience. You can tell that a lot of love went into it. It feels good. I laughed, I cried, I became attached to a daughter I don&apos;t really have. It&apos;s worth every penny and I cannot wait to see what else this team will do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415830">Expand</a></span>

The overwhelming number of &quot;10&quot;s came from one of the devs tweeting that people should come leave positive reviews to balance out the one negative review it had at the time.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I had a relatively fun few hours playing this game, but there were hard-to-miss errors left and right. Typos and improper grammar in nearly every other text box of a visual novel got extremely annoying after a while, but some of the humor made up for it some of the time. The mini-games have virtually no instruction. There are slight continuity errors in the story which, again, are annoying in a visual novel. The game is very, very short for the $15 you have to pay for it, though I am not familiar with dating sims or their average length-to-price ratio. One of the dads&apos; storylines is lazy, boring, and hard to enjoy, even during the third and final date. A lot of the humor panders to the tumblr crowd, even having some lines of dialogue closely resemble text posts from the site. Even as a tumblr user, this got on my nerves.
<br>
<br>All that being said, most of the storylines in the game are very touching and I enjoyed seeing the character/relationship development. There were moments that made me laugh out loud. The devs produced a game with characters that almost every player can relate to in one way or another, and I think it&apos;s great that this is an LGBT-driven game that literally captures every letter of that acronym (and maybe some of the other letters, just not as blatantly) in its story in some capacity. The focus on dadliness over gayness ensures that this game is not a mockery of the gay experience, but a fresh take on the never-before-seen &quot;dad who gets the chance to date 7 other hot dads and care for his daughter&quot; experience. And that&apos;s pretty cool, though the game, at this moment, still has problems I cannot overlook for the sake of a positive review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7422167">Expand</a></span>

Craig loses most of his charm without River, and that&apos;s really an attest to how bland these characters are without their gimmicks.
<br>
<br>Most of the voice acting is atrocious. Your highschool aged daughter is played by, what I can only image must be a middle aged woman. It really shows when she says &quot;I love you Dad&quot;. It sounds more like your daughter is pulling the plug on your life support than your daughter who&apos;s going to college. Hugo is perhaps the most un-listenable, the sound quality is just awful. Ray, from rooster teeth fame, should really be able to do better than something that sounds like it was recorded in a steel tube.
<br>
<br>The art direction really takes some turns for the worse. Most of it was good, and I was pleased with the character designs. But then looking at some backgrounds they just made zero sense. Joseph&apos;s backyard looks like an average house backyard in the neighborhood. But then Damien&apos;s house&apos;s backyard has mystical mountains/cypress trees that seem to go on forever. The colours on the background were rushed as well, some of the flower colour choices barely make sense. Blue, green, orange cosmos just brushed as if someone was blindfolded, not even getting into the rainbow coloured Delphinium.
<br>
<br>The minigames were buggy at best. The gargoyle head needed to be positioned just right. Btw its not a gargoyle if it doesn&apos;t spout rainwater, its called a grotesque. That&apos;s something Damien should know. More on topic, the story quests where you have to run around town are also not that fun. They&apos;re too vague about where you&apos;re supposed to look, and your end choice after scrambling around is all that matters.
<br>
<br>I was really excited for this game, but in the end it lacked focus and felt rushed. So much stuff needed to be redone before released and it just didn&apos;t happen.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s like every bad fanfiction you&apos;ve ever read.

The game looks great - kudos to the background and character artists. The writing was perfectly on par with a visual novel, albeit with a pleasant excess of dad jokes and puns. I ended up finding every dad quite likeable and a potential for romance. The music and mini games were a much appreciated addition to the game to put it on a different level compared to other dating sims. I found myself humming a lot of the tunes and wanting to go back and try mini games again.
<br>
<br>As for the negative - the character voices could be a little repetitive over time. Some characters would use the same voice line three times in a row. For instance, Brian had one that made him sound like Patrick Warburton and it kept playing over and over and made my husband and I laugh and lose focus on what was going on. Hugo sounded like he was recording from a phone and not a studio like the others. It kind of ruined the face-to-face dad dating immersion. However, everyone else was spot on, except for the occasional overused sound effect.
<br>
<br>The dad creator also caused some immersion issues - everyone you make doesn&apos;t fit into the game stylistically. They look like a web comic character compared to the wonderful designs you&apos;re interacting with. I&apos;m not sure if it was their intent to make the game more humorous, but I felt like I was looking at an Episodes app character from those ads you see on Tumblr. If this wasn&apos;t their intent, I believe the issue could&apos;ve been fixed by making the create-a-dad system have more shaded pieces to add more depth to the portraits.
<br>
<br>I am interested to see the Easter eggs people can find. There is an allegedly darker kind of ending floating around in the game files (with picture evidence and sources!) and that would add a very fun twist to such a sweet game.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving it a 9/10, deducting one point for the character audio issues I mentioned above. Overall, I felt this game was well worth the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415755">Expand</a></span>

Paired with beautiful music and art, great customization, this fun and charming game is one of the first games in a long time that I had actually waited for it to come out. As much as the dad puns dominate the dialogue, there are also a lot of diverse topics discussed. It doesn&apos;t poke fun at sexuality or the differences in all the people. At the beginning of the game when you customize your character, you&apos;re given the option of a dad with a binder. Carrying forward you can choose to make your dad gay or bisexual, and have your relationship with your daughter be biological or adoptive. This game not only has you building relationships with other dads, but with your daughter as well. It wouldn&apos;t be a dad dating sim without the kids, and all the other dads have their children, and even the children feel like they have their own fleshed out personalities. The game also deals with topics such as the death of a spouse, divorce, and even an unhealthy marriage. This game is wonderful and charming. It takes subjects seriously while also being extremely fun and comical and creative. Good job to the creators, and may many more great things come from them now that DDADDS has opened the door.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415767">Expand</a></span>

When I first saw the game announced I thought it was going to be a lot of goofs and laughs and while it does have that it also delves into very common issues many people go through. This game is extremely wholesome and the only quarrel I have with this game is that all the characters are so lovable but have fairly short routes, but I know a lot of time and dedication have been put into the characters and their stories to make them as amazing as they are. Not only does it have just well written characters, they&apos;re well written queer characters. As a bisexual it&apos;s so important and meaningful to see representation of the LGBT+ community in a non-sexualized manor in so many different ways by having bisexual/pansexual/homosexual and transgender characters, and giving options for your own character customization to give you the option to play as a transgender or cisgender dad. This game is extremely progressive and hilarious. I cannot say it enough; I. Love. This. Game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415748">Expand</a></span>

Everything felt fun and I could tell how much work was put into it! I really want to congratulate the whole DDADDS team for keeping their chins up even though people kept yelling at them for the delay in release. It was worth the wait.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m still playing through it myself to see all the outcomes, and eventually I know I&apos;ll have to get the bad Amanda ending, but... Well, hey. They even thought of bad endings! A lot of dating sims are all happy-go-lucky **** This is different. It&apos;s new, it&apos;s fun, it&apos;s powerful, (I cried a few times...) and it&apos;s just... I just love it! I recommended it to all my friends and they all enjoyed it as well.
<br>It&apos;s definitely one of the most fun games I&apos;ve played this year, and on top of it being entertaining as heck, it&apos;s LGBT inclusive. Obviously, with it being a Dad X Dad dating game, but there&apos;s more. Your &quot;Dadsona&quot; can be trans! That&apos;s! Really Cool!!!!
<br>I don&apos;t mean to sound so overly-positive, but I just really enjoyed this game, and I don&apos;t think it deserves all the backlash some people came up with. It does have problems, but what doesn&apos;t? Lighten up and enjoy the dad puns.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415646">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. The game is too short. You only get 3 dates per dad, and the pay off at the end is not very good. You end up feeling like there should be a lot more to their routes, but there isn&apos;t.

<br>
<br>2. Not all dads get a sex scene. It seems weird to include one for some, but not all.
<br>
<br>3. The &quot;voice acting&quot; in the game is low quality. Some sound clips are much louder than others, some sound like they were recorded with a bad mic.
<br>
<br>4. For what the game is, I think it&apos;s too expensive. Especially if they are truly planning on having paid DLC.
<br>
<br>Overall the game just feels incomplete. I don&apos;t think 3 dates per route is enough to really be satisfied with the outcome. I feel the developers should have taken their time to really flesh out a complete game, instead of literally rush to get it out ASAP.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7415660">Expand</a></span>

I have been a fan for a while now, and upon watching the trailer in the wee morning hour of 3 AM, I was already counting down the days til release. And then release day came, and I was still counting down the days. When I finally get the game I am excited and greeted by a pleasant menu screen and theme song. What I didn&apos;t know at the time is that... that&apos;s all I&apos;ll be getting from the game. A pleasant screen and some music. As I&apos;m clicking through the dialogue, I get slightly disappointed that it isn&apos;t fully voiced, (albeit the creators never implied that it would be, so it&apos;s my own expectation to be let down) but then as the game drags on... I understand why it&apos;s not fully voiced. The dialogue is... annoyingly dense. I haven&apos;t perused the dating sim genre all too much in my time, and what I&apos;ve read about them, it seems this is pretty much on brand for a game like this, but dense dialogue doesn&apos;t mean good dialogue. The rest of the game is beautifully done. The UI is simple and elegant, the art is above and beyond, the mini games (while not really that interesting to me) are equally as good. Sometimes the little grunty-reaction sounds from the characters don&apos;t make too much sense and are clipped at the end, but that&apos;s the worst thing about the bare bones of the game. It&apos;s just that when making a visual NOVEL, the dialogue is more important than good coding and art. It seems to me that the writing team&apos;s writing process was to sit and come up with dad jokes and references. And that&apos;s it. The writing feels like an interminable effort to seem quirky. The writing isn&apos;t confident that it can be witty in simplicity or innuendo, so it instead takes the route of beating the player over the head with a joke until the player isn&apos;t really able to determine if it was supposed to be a joke in the first place. It got to a point, for me, that I was so bored with the over the top cheeky dialogue trying desperately to convince me that it was clever that I just skipped on through. And I didn&apos;t miss any story whatsoever. Now the game may not be for me--which is understandable, I&apos;m hard to please--but I didn&apos;t even come close to relating the character that is supposedly me. Player characters are supposed to be bland so whoever&apos;s playing can insert their own personality into them. That&apos;s why Link is mute. With this player character, it feels more like instead of being able to insert myself into the story that I&#x2019;m just watching some guy go about his life. The player character has his own personality when you start the game, and only those who are as introverted and socially-awkward as him will relate at all. Which is the opposite of what the game was trying to achieve. I feel so little agency throughout that it feels like I&#x2019;m just clicking through a block of dialogue, waiting until I get to the next false choice option. If I pick any of the selections I&#x2019;m getting to the same place and no matter what I say or do the other characters will love me all the same. Nobody will hate you no matter how many times you deliberately try to make them.
<br>Overall, Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator, feels uninspired and bland. It tries to do more than it can and for those of us who enjoy writing the pitfalls are steep and unending. It had promise, but, in the end, promise does not a good game make.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dream-daddy-a-dad-dating-simulator/user-reviews?user_review_id=7414557">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Visual novels are the worst type of games. In fact - they&apos;re not games at all. Even tho, I can tolerate a visual novel if it has a good story, artwork and characters. Dream Daddy has none of it. It&apos;s lazy, cliche&apos; and extremely cringe inducing and forced.</span>
