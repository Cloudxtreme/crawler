As expected the X-Ray cam loses some of it&apos;s charm over time, but the timing is well chosen so it doesn&apos;t get drawn out unless one has to play the same passages over and over again.
<br>Speaking of the passages. I played the game solely on the authentic mode, because I tend to like a challenge, which is just nonexistent if one can save at any point in time. It took me a few tries to identify the games mechanics, especially when it comes to stealth. But in the end I liked it quite a lot. It is good when just by playing you start to understand how the rules of the game work and can immediately start to apply them and get feedback for your decisions.
<br>The AI is not very clever, predictable really, but I call that a plus for this kind of game. The view range in daylight is already quite a hassle if you try to go Ghost (never be seen at all). Especially in a game where you are supposed to be the lone incredibly skilled super soldier I want a certain predictability in order to plan out how to clear out an area and that satisfying feeling to have a plan work in the very end.
<br>Graphic is fine, the gory part (x-ray cam) has a lot of effort put into it, although I mostly only get to see the inside of the head, guess that is based on play style.
<br>Most enjoyable of all was the ability to play coop with one friend. Synchronized shots during noise to take out two people before either can react to the other&apos;s death, multi angle scouting of an area. Using one player as bait and having the other in a snipers nest pick of the baited enemies. If I was to judge just my coop experience so far I would give it a 9 out of 10 for the pure joy of it.
<br>Major flaw for me  is the wobbly responsiveness in using items and aiming them, especially when it comes to placing stuff on the ground.
<br>My final rating is based on my enjoyment of the game so far, which would encompass fifteen hours of play, half of it being in coop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4328676">Expand</a></span>

In this game, you can&apos;t run in guns blazing, because even though you can equip machine guns and pistols, you&apos;ll be dead in an instant. Instead, you have to be slow and careful. You have to snipe while loud noises are happening to avoid detection, or take enemies out up close with stealth takedowns or a silenced pistol.

<br>The stealthy approach</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Sniper Elite III is a thinking man&apos;s shooter. In this game, you can&apos;t run in guns blazing, because even though you can equip machine guns and pistols, you&apos;ll be dead in an instant. Instead, you have to be slow and careful. You have to snipe while loud noises are happening to avoid detection, or take enemies out up close with stealth takedowns or a silenced pistol.
<br>
<br>The stealthy approach is what makes this game stand out among other shooters on the market. Even with a sniper rifle in your hands, a good vantage point, and loud noises to mask your shots, you still have to steady your breathing and take wind and gravity into account when firing, so you&apos;re never firing off shots like crazy. Pressing the E key makes your character hold his breath and steady his aim, which causes a little red diamond to show you where the bullet will fall. Using this feature, you can make extremely accurate shots even from the greatest of distances. Kills are extremely satisfying too, thanks to the game&apos;s slow-motion X-ray kill cams, which let you see your bullets burst through skulls, lungs and other organs in a shower of gore.
<br>
<br>The single-player presents you with wide-open levels to explore, complete with optional objectives and collectibles. How you tackle these levels is completely up to you, and thanks to the great level design, being spotted doesn&apos;t mean you always have to restart from an older save. It&apos;s entirely possible to become hidden again, and resume your silent kill spree. The game&apos;s levels also strike a smart balance between quiet, stealthy operations, and loud, bombastic scenes wherein waves of enemies rush in just begging to be popped off.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s multiplayer mode incorporates all the elements of the single-player mode, and the leveling system works across both modes, so whether you&apos;re playing alone or online, you&apos;re constantly unlocking new weapons and equipment. There are also plenty of customization options for online games, so you can choose to make the sniping more or less realistic depending on your preference.
<br>
<br>The game includes standard game modes like Deathmatch, but the best modes are the ones that encourage long distance sniping. No Cross is easily the game&apos;s best mode, as there is a barrier in the center of the map, leaving players with no choice but to find a vantage point and snipe from across the level. The game&apos;s deliberate pace works well online, making for some really tense moments as you and a rival sniper try to line each other up in your sights. And although there is some occasional slowdown and lag, the multiplayer runs well most of the time.
<br>
<br>The story is hardly worth mentioning, as it&apos;s clearly just an excuse to get you into levels and killing people. The voice acting is decent, but the characters and the plot are both extremely barebones. Graphically, however, Sniper Elite III is beautiful. The African landscapes you&apos;ll find yourself battling in are all wonderfully realized, and they&apos;re helped by great lighting, detailed textures, and good character models. The sound design is wonderful as well, with great battlefield noises in the louder portions and subtle ambient sounds in the quieter parts. Guns are satisfying to fire, and the squishy sound of heads getting blasted is always a macabre delight.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t recommend this game enough. It&apos;s got a few issues here and there, such as texture pop-in, slowdown, and its weak story, but the core gameplay should be insanely fun and satisfying to anyone who&apos;s a fan of stealth. Even at full price it&apos;s absolutely worth the money, which isn&apos;t something I often say about games these days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4333947">Expand</a></span>

<br>Sniper Elite III is set several years prior to the events of Sniper Elite V2, following the exploits of Office of Strategic Services officer Karl Fairburne as he participates in the North African conflict during World War II, in which he learns of a secret wonder weapon programmed by the Nazi forces. Just like in V2, the story here is boring and uninteresting, and our protagonist is the same generic American hero from the 1st. Honestly, I could just paste my V2 review of the story here and no one would notice because of how bad both game&apos;s narratives are. 2/10
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>Everything returns from the 2nd game along with a few tweaks added. The awesome bullet-cam, smart A.I., hidden collectibles, good level design, and improved customization are here along with a weapon wheel, and a progressional system that applies to both single player and multiplayer. There are 8 missions in total, and each one will take around 20+ minutes if you take your time with each of them. Unfortunately, the bad combat also returns with the cross-hair still being a pain to use when spotted. In conclusion, the gameplay here is largely unchanged from the 2nd game. 6/10
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>The biggest change/improvement this game has is in its graphics department. The setting of Africa is a more interesting setting for the game than the generic Berlin setting in the 2nd game. Because of this, the colors and world design had to match the setting. There&apos;s more vibrant colors here than in the 2nd, the textures are better here, the particle effects are improved, and the facial models look more updated. So be happy you&apos;ll have a prettier game to look at when you&apos;re sniping some poor guy&apos;s testicles off. 9/10
<br>
<br>Sound:
<br>As with the 2nd game, the sound design is great with the sniper shots sounding excellent and realistic. The score also does a good job with sound ques when you get spotted. Everything else also sounds good. The sound here is essentially the same as with the 2nd. 8/10
<br>
<br>Multiplayer:
<br>The multiplayer is the same as in the 2nd game just with less buildings in some of the maps. Since you can use your single player loadouts in the multiplayer, that allows for more customization than in the 2nd. Everything else however, feels like the 2nd game all over again. 6/10
<br>
<br>Verdict:
<br>If you enjoyed V2, get this game. If you hated V2, skip this game. If you haven&apos;t played V2, I&apos;ll say get this at around $30 or lower. It&apos;s essentially Sniper Elite V2, but with more replay value. If you want more info on how this game is, just go to my profile, and look for my V2 review as this game feels a lot like the 2nd, just slightly improved.

The ending is very abrupt and not satisfying.
<br>
<br>I saw quite often enemy bodies flying in the air. One time I encountered an enemy in a ladder and he just went through me without even noticing me (no alarm). One time the objective marker did not even appear and I had to reload from last checkpoint to see it.
<br>
<br>Then the DLC **** 2 out of 5 guns (the best ones) in every categories are only available through DLC. If you don&apos;t have them you won&apos;t be able to play with them, and if you have you&apos;ll feel overpowered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4331741">Expand</a></span>

I mean I fell through the world three times, and you know your partner can&apos;t reach you and save you through the world so its an automatic failure. I also don&apos;t understand the point of the cut scenes either. At this point my friend and I are just playing this for laughs.

<br>it&apos;s definitely better than v2 and had a great potential and i i&apos;d say the developers kinda tried to put good effort on this game but in the end, it still doesn&apos;t worth your time. Play singleplayer for 5 hours and forget about this game, it&apos;s that average of a game.
<br>
<br>Gfx, sounds, game engine etc. are just ok.

You&apos;re constantly having to manage where is and where isn&apos;t a safe place to shoot from.  I recommend you play this game on Elite enemy difficulty and limited ballistics, it&apos;s only on elite that the enemies would function like a real soldier would when a sniper is around, when they know your location, they will actively sweep the area around you in a sequence, making it much more enjoyable to pick them off one by one while relocating around the map.  The reason I only recommend limited ballistics is because it adds that extra level of immersion and it&apos;s still easy to use.  Playing on the highest ballistic level makes it a bit too difficult, the wind seems to be blowing at 100 mph 24/7 on that difficulty, and it&apos;s near impossible to pull off a successful hit without steadying your aim.  The game also only has 8 missions,  they&apos;re all about an hour long and have plenty of different ways to go about them.  Oh, and I have noticed a few bugs here and there, most of which are not game breaking in any way except one.  Every now and then, there&apos;s a bug where your weapons won&apos;t damage enemies, it&apos;s very annoying, but easily fixable, just reload your last save, luckily it only occurs right after you save, so you won&apos;t have to work your way back to where you were.  If it happens, just quicksave and reload, problem solved(I have only noticed this bug in story mode).  The game does have some replablility for the completionist gamers. There are many collectibles scattered around every map containing various things like important information, letters from soldiers, etc.  As well as the story, there&apos;s also a multiplayer and a survival mode.  I played a bit of both and they both seem very fun.  Survival mode is the traditional horde mode, where you defend against wave after wave of enemies, and I will say, it&apos;s pretty tricky.  It takes some serious skill to complete survival mode, so it can keep you busy for awhile if that&apos;s your thing.  The multiplayer seemed very fun as well.  The maps are well designed for sniping and there can be some pretty intense counter-sniping battles to be had.  I think this game deserves at least a 7.  It is very fun and I do recommend it, but the fact that there are still a few bugs present, and there&apos;s only eight missions, makes it fall lower on my ranking as a whole.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4377847">Expand</a></span>

Of course they&apos;re stupid when you put it on easy...that&apos;s the point.

<br>Only thing that sucks is that the multiplayer crashes hard and often as of the first week.</span>

Bugs! and more Bugs! The game is a bug filled mess! Only the truly stupid would ever support this developer after this release. It spits in the pc gamers face and shows just how little respect this company has for it&apos;s customers.</span>

<br>At most settings; this game is a breeze to play - red indicator where to aim and then just shoot everything with little fear.
<br>Only the most realistic settings removes that &quot;aim cheat&quot; - but that removes all HUD - this game surely lack somewhere in between for those of us who don&apos;t want to loose the mini-map but still would like to avoid the aim help.
<br>
<br>Oh well, outside this - the game is average-ish.
<br>
<br>The maps are too small, too narrow and tunnels you in specific directions into positions where you can snipe almost with impunity. The AI is dumb, very dumb and although they somewhat react to dead comrades, they seem to be deaf and blind in most all other aspects. Nobody seems to react to an exploding trunk just 100m over, so unless the enemy is in the same &quot;pack&quot; as the ones tied to the truck area, they&apos;ll not react.
<br>And you can either stealth-takedown or shoot with your very quiet silenced gun as well without much reaction, crawl and prone movement is way too quiet and you can often move through line of sight of the enemy if you&apos;re just crawling.
<br>
<br>A good number of &apos;secondary&apos; objectives and the &apos;levelling&apos; is okay, but when the main gameplay lacks, it just feels tacked on.
<br>
<br>You have a number of weapons so you can &quot;deal with situations in many ways&quot;; but well - when the AI is as it is - there&apos;s rarely any need.
<br>Customization and loadout rarely seems to make much of a difference either, and it seems very much like a missed oppertunity.
<br>
<br>The game looks good though - not as great a some other - but it&apos;s good enough, although the desert gets dull fast.
<br>
<br>Only get it if you like sniping and want to play this game on easy-mode or very frustrating-mode</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4310738">Expand</a></span>

A good game. An improved product. levels are bigger and more interesting. Game play is less linear and gives the player far more sense of control. It&apos;s visually beautiful. Shooting compute based enemies in the nuts never gets old. Despite that I have to shave some score points of as a protest at the pricing of the day 1 DLC. $10 to get Hitler. $10 to open up a couple of different characters. Pretty rich for day 1. The game has a great engine. It makes sense then to wait a while and offer expansion-sized DLC, with new maps that EXPAND the core game. Instead Rebellion went down the path of cutting out core content to be resold with the rort of being a &apos;pre-order bonus&apos;. It&apos;s a putrid idea and it is pretty silly to be doing that right in the middle of the Steam summer sale.

<br>Yes the theme is annoyingly familiar. Yes the bullet cam is still there in bucketloads - which is kind of boring after a while (just space key out of it problem solved, but you don&apos;t see the guy drop at the end of it).
<br>The campaign is set around the time of Monty&apos;s Desert Rats (and the Desert Rats are still operational even to this day), only with very little mention of Monty, or his Rats, and more of Rommel and the Afrika Korps. It&apos;s definitely stuck to the theme as the title&apos;s logo would suggest (no, not the Eagle logo, but the actual palm tree logo - which is the actual logo for the Afrika Korps would you believe.
<br>This game doesn&apos;t &apos;wobble&apos; between easy and difficult, or at least I didn&apos;t think so. This is a variation on Splinter Cell, it&apos;s much less modern, very little spying involved - although gathering intelligence does make it into the gameplay in it&apos;s very basic form - just picking up papers or blueprints. It&apos;s not a bad game, the music may drive you potty, I don&apos;t really like the gurgling noise that you get from a lot of the bullet cam kills, and at times the game can be tricky as hell - also more than once I&apos;ve found myself getting shot through some walls, which is probably more down to bad mesh work than actual game play - although it would put the mesh work in Tom Clancy&apos;s Ghost Recon Phantoms to shame - so it&apos;s not THAT bad.
<br>It&apos;s a good effort, and it&apos;s nice to see they actually managed to mix it up a bit with day and night missions. It&apos;s only as short as you make it, and if you think it is short, I really do recommend playing on the authentic setting.
<br>Be prepared to refer to a map regularly in some cases (especially in the second mission - you&apos;ll run round in circles otherwise), and get a little pissed at the rare getting shot at through walls. It&apos;s still a decent attempt.
<br>It would be nice for Rebellion to release games in their entirety though - rather than charging ridiculous sums for little bits and pieces - which I simply won&apos;t buy no matter how good a game is.
<br>
<br>Not a bad effort overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4310626">Expand</a></span>

<br>Rebellion claims you can play this game any style you want but that is total BS!  If you dont use stealth for at least 90% of this game you will die everytime. I dont like any game that limits me to just sneaking around real slow and taking out the enemy with a POS pistol that does not kill unless you get the shot at a certain part of the head or using melee. I did not even finish this worthless game.
<br>Even though i liked V2 i can say anything good for this new version which is basically nothing more than a extended DLC to V2.  NOT RECOMMENDED at all!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4327424">Expand</a></span>

I keep coming back to redo missions cause the xray shots are just so fun to look at. Gotta agree that there is a couple missions too many with silenced pistol. These maps I found boring and tried using the sniper rifle but it makes the game extremely hard because enemies keep respawning.</span>

Some of the missions are monotonous like the third one with the tank you have to shoot in the same spot 3 times... It has it&apos;s fun moments but it&apos;s just too buggy and the day one DLC is ridiculous. The visuals are nice and i like the controls but they really should have polished it up more. I hope the next one is better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4900561">Expand</a></span>

I swear to god, I shot somebody in their foot, and when they gave up looking for me, he was walking around like all the other AI. It would make the game so much better if when you were using your rifle, all the AI would either die or become incapacitated in one shot. You might say that&apos;s unfair, or too easy, but I also think the player should die in one to two shots.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5199762">Expand</a></span>

The setting still feels so unexploited as if an entire arc was cut from the game to keep the attention away to mister sniper and his very uninteresting personality that doesn&apos;t seem to know whether to stick to the &quot;grizzled veteran&quot; archetype or not. Beyond that 2 major nuisances kept popping up. One is whether or not the Germans keep talking German. When the antagonist is taunting i can understand the English. but in a &quot;Eavesdrop&quot; cut-scene the Germans talk English again despite never talking English later or during combat. Make up your mind! The last nuisance where the &quot;Mini-boss&quot; battles where a tank suddenly arrives in the map and you MUST destroy it, which can be annoying and a pace-breaker. after the second it stopped being fun/sudden. In overall the game had plenty of room to move, but didn&apos;t. resulting in a bit of a dissapointment....Oh yeah and there is the kill-cam that gets boring fast and so forth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4370368">Expand</a></span>

<br>MP is fun but I wish there was a way to see the server settings in full detail before you enter it (maybe it&apos;s just me but I didn&apos;t find a way to do it)

<br>There are some aspects of the game that are unsatisfying or broken
- Sometimes the weapons do not fire. It&apos;s not a gameplay choice (like &quot;jammed&quot;) but more a controller issue. And it&apos;s deadly.

<br>There are some aspects of the game that are unsatisfying or broken

<br>- The camera has some follow through when you aim, so it doesn&apos;t stop where you want. You have to learn to compensate.
<br>- The end of the story is somewhat anti-climactic. I expected a final fight after blowing up the factory, but it never came.
<br>
<br>In spite of these, I found this third opus of Sniper Elite more engaging than the previous ones :
<br>- The rendering of Africa, both at day and night is beautiful
<br>- The levels layout offers many ways to approach your mission and take care of enemies
<br>- All the new features of the &quot;enemy radar&quot; (tagging with your binoculars, sensing where the enemies are, and being informed of their level of awareness) offers a new and refreshing game experience.
<br>
<br>Like previous Sniper Elite games, you&apos;ll have to switch between quiet approach + silent kills, long range kills and messy rifle shooting. Each one has advantages and disadvantages, a carries a specific risk / reward.

<br>I encourage you to play this game if you appreciate on-the-fly planning and careful execution !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5533722">Expand</a></span>

Previous versions have essentially been sniping simulators (in the same way that Goat Simulator doesn&apos;t actually simulate the life of a goat) - once you got past the trick shots, collectibles were one of the only things that kept the gameplay from becoming very &quot;rinse and repeat&quot;. This time round, they&apos;ve overlaid actual game elements and a more free-form approach to gameplay, even if it still tunnels you from objective to objective. This gives you a greater feeling of agency over your character - when you clear a room, it&apos;s not just, &quot;Wow, I made an awesome shot&quot;. It&apos;s also, &quot;Wow, that was quite cool how I approached that field full of enemies&quot;. It&apos;s not a detailed or authentic MilSim, featuring only a few &quot;real world&quot; conventions applied in a way that&apos;s typical of modern gaming - bullet drop, scope shake, breath holding. It&apos;s not going to be for everybody, but it&apos;s a big advancement for the series, and doesn&apos;t feel &quot;lazy&quot; or like a proof of concept like the previous versions sometimes did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4349094">Expand</a></span>

The bullet time is lovey, the graphics are really good, being able to sabotage generators to cover shot noise, set traps again, a fairly nice story line and good rifle mechanics.
<br>
<br>The issues though, the story is good however really short, if you want to extend your game play you need to folk over more money, with 2 extra chapters out so soon after on a &#xA3;40 game doesn&apos;t feel good to me. There are bugs too, skipping bullet time can sometimes cause shots to disappear, there are some visual issues, issues with planes going over making a louder audio noise that other planes but not enough to cover your shot. Being able to wipe out half a base undetected, with the other half wandering around not realizing or searching for you and giving up and going back to stand guard sometimes over their dead comrades was a frustration for a game aiming for realism.
<br>
<br>Over all I would say yes, this game is worth getting, however only, given it&apos;s lowish content, if you can pick the base game up for &#xA3;15-20. I haven&apos;t payed out for any of the DLC&apos;s yet so I can&apos;t comment on their value, but on the face of it I don&apos;t want to spend &#xA3;7 for a single extra mission.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4374744">Expand</a></span>

<br>-High violence during X-Ray but after the X-Ray effect, corpse has no bullet wounds. So X-Ray is just a visual deception. If the enemy&apos;s head exploded in X-Ray, you expect it to be exploded and want to see it in your non-X-ray eyes when you check the dead corpse, but no, what happens in X-Ray, stays in X-Ray.
<br>-Enemies are better snipers than you ! Yes, even in very long ranges, they shoot at you with submachine guns and almost all of the bullets hit you. So what&apos;s the point of being a sniper in long ranges ?
<br>-Enemies see you with their eagle eyes immediately, and instead of hiding, they are mostly rushing to your location because they know they have automatic sniper rifles (!) because of the developers.
<br>
<br>Could be much more better game, still, if you do not look at its bad sides, it&apos;s an enjoyable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6908054">Expand</a></span>

A lot of sniping if you want or you can be Sam Fisher ( but not that goo Sam Fisher ). Interestingly i did not use traps and improvisation as much as in its predecessor , somehow there was no need for it. My recommendation for this game definitely.

It deserves atleast a 8 recommend buying that you buy it on sale on consoles or just buy it for like 35 pounds on steam</span>

This game does not frown upon camping... only using sprint (Lmao) Which brings me to the miltiplayer section of the review first (That&apos;s a new one). The multiplayer is just basically what you have in the game EXCEPT it has no x-ray kills which makes it like any other third person shooter (it still has the slow-motion bullet coming out of your rifle thing).
<br>Now for the singleplayer. The gameplay is fun, you got your stealth and stuff which is pretty simple, now for the story. To be honest I found the story really- well, boring. I just didn&apos;t care about the story at all. I was to busy in stealth and killing people that I forgot that it had a story (I just remembered when I was writing this review). I think this is the reason I rated it 7/10.
<br>
<br>Friendly Advice for reviewers: Don&apos;t rate a game zero just because it has day one DLC, if you can&apos;t help it then just stop writing reviews because it just wastes people&apos;s time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4439405">Expand</a></span>

<br>Sniper Elite v3 is more for newbs cuz this def has a hold your hand feel to it like most games today, sadly enough.
<br>
<br>The graphics are okay nothing short of great.
<br>The sound seems repeated from v2
<br>The gameplay is def way to retarded. i could just walk up to them and stab em.. soo hard to sneek lol not really..
<br>
<br>The game is not worth an 8 it def deserves a 6 to a 5 for repeating v2 crap and not giving the player what they want. A great story line. Multiplayer is lame now adays with all the trolls and hackers and free hax sites out there for these games before they are even released!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4517592">Expand</a></span>

The stealth elements are much improved over previous versions which makes setting up a good shot all the more worthwhile. Later levels are a little disappointing as you are all too often forced into small environments where sniping becomes nigh on impossible. There are other way to get round these situations but it does rather take away from the point of it being a game about sniping. I mean seriously; why would you get a sniper to infiltrate a bunker... flat answer is you wouldn&apos;t. You&apos;d stick him on the hill and bung the master chief in the bunker. Which brings me on to the story... its sucks. I can&apos;t even recall what it is about, something to do with some Germans in Africa. But then this game isn&apos;t really about the story, its about the sniping, which is why its a bit disappointing flailing around in a bunker shooting inappropriately placed gas containers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5501628">Expand</a></span>

Sniper Elite 3 is way too continuist with its predecesor when we talk about game mechanics or how the story is told, although the story is just an excuse for killing nazis rather than telling a good story. The kill-camera has been improved and polished making it a really stunning feature of the game, but after playing a couple of missions this hype about the bullet camera disappears and you will find yourself struggling in a game where player physics and mechanics dont work as well as expected.
<br>The IA is fine but kind of simple, defeating mechanical enemies becames the real challenge in this game due to its pretty limited (and small) critical points making you think about your strategy and I kinda liked it but I missed the sniper thing of the second release of the franchise. But there is something that this game misses and I cannot recommend it because of it, the sniper. This game focusses way too much in stealth and gathering data rather of having a real target to kill in each map, the need of an audio source to keep being quiet makes you struggle in a way that if you want to complete the game in stealth mode you will end using your basic pistol and nothing more. This will cause you to get bored as you will realise you can only complete the mission by pressing Y to stealth-melee-kill or close stealth kill with your pistol.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7523120">Expand</a></span>
