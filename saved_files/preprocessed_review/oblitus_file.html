<br>Wielding a spear that you can jab and throw and a shield to defend yourself, you set off on your great mini-adventure. Progressing from area to area you discover scrolls that give your character differing abilities such as higher jumping, dodge rolling, poison spear, or heavy armor. There are 22 scrolls and armor variations total in the game and these create the differing game play styles in the game. You may end up getting &quot;heavy armor&quot; and &quot;bigger&quot; and withstand your enemies blows or you may get &quot;dodge rolling, higher jumping, gliding, and light armor&quot; and be quick agile and jump all around the screen. The terrain consists of quite a bit of platforming.
<br>
<br>-Combat-
<br>Easily the best facet of this game is how responsive and accurate the combat is. Your character reacts for the most part in the ways that you would expect and if you get stabbed it is many times because you misjudged the encounter. The harbinger wields the spear accurately and spear throwing is a large dynamic part of the game. One thing to note is when you throw your spear it follows the trajectory of the harbingers arm in an overhand throw, this creates scenarios in which you may hide behind a rock and throw the spear over the rock without leaving cover.
<br>Dodging is quick and responsive with blocking working as intended. There is even a parry (though there is little use for it.)
<br>With combat being such a strong asset to this game its a shame there is not more engaging enemies and boss fights.
<br>
<br>-Boss Fights-
<br>One of the most disappointing aspects of Oblitus. With a total of 4 bosses that appear in every play through, there is not a lot of variety. Each boss fight follows the idea of hit the enemy in their exposed weak spot and depending on what scrolls you found throughout the level the bosses may be dispatched with as little as 2 hits to said weak spot. Each boss follows the same movement every time and has almost no variation in their attacks. While you may die the first time you face each of the bosses, I doubt you will find your demise at their hands very often at all.
<br>
<br>-Difficulty-
<br>This game does not have the intense difficulty that it states. While combat is fun and engaging it is not challenging. Enemies die after just a few hits and due to the fact all character progression comes from finding scrolls in the world there is no need to fight any creatures in the game besides the bosses.... Yea... Enemies are easily skipped by pole vaulting over them and because they do not drop experience only health after a few runs you come to realize enemies and 95% of the combat in the game is decoration. Because of this lack of need to fight any enemies in the game it really ends up turning into a pole vaulting simulator the more you play.
<br>
<br>-&quot;Procedural-generated realms&quot;-
<br>Oblitus while trying to catch the rogue-like wave states they have procedural generated levels and while technically this may be true it is not by any means a selling point for the game. The procedural generation simply sets upgrades in one of three different spots on a static level. For each run there will be minor changes such as go over the boulder or go through the boulder. The largest change in each run is where the guide Mud is found. Do not try and sell me on procedural generated levels when after playing the game just a few times I can mentally walk through every step of the journey in my head.
<br>
<br>-Unlockables-
<br>Finally Oblitus keeps you coming back for more with the collection of a single artifact piece on each run. The game gives you a teaser of this awesome boss fight after every time you complete the game and you slowly build this mask. Once the mask is completed you start a new run and are super pumped to fight the final boss. THERE IS NO FINAL BOSS! You give the mask to Mud and he goes good job dude way to waste all your time.
<br>
<br>-Verdict-
<br>While combat is good there is no need to fight any enemies, bosses are easily dispatched and eventually you feel as if you waste your time run in and run out. So much potential but this game is a huge let down, I cant recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oblitus/user-reviews?user_review_id=5068978">Expand</a></span>
