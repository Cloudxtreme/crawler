<br>
<br>I started with the second worst team, because I like the idea of making it from the bottom to the top, even though this may take some time. The missing license of original teams and drivers is not a big deal and once this game gets modding support, thanks to Steam Workshop, this may change.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d like to create a Pro/Cons list, but even without wearing fanboy glasses, I don&apos;t have any Cons in mind so far. But this could change over time. Maybe the game gets boring fast or hilariously unrealistic. Who knows. If that&apos;s the case, I&apos;ll edit this review.
<br>
<br>But for now, the game runs perfectly fine for me without any issues on max details with locked 60fps (no need to cry here. You seriously don&apos;t need those 200fps). You can really feel polish under your nails when scratching over the games surface. The overview doesn&apos;t suffer from all those menues like in EAs FM games (at least for beginners). The &quot;controls&quot; in a live race are pretty simple and easy to understand. Graphics look great for this a simulator game.
<br>
<br>I love it so far and will hopefully be able to make enough money to build a wall in front of Mexi.. to beat &quot;Mercedes&quot;!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/motorsport-manager/user-reviews?user_review_id=6803114">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On the one hand this game is *finally* done professionally from the ground up, it has a decent publisher with manager-game experience and it&apos;s not merely a rip-off and money-grab like so many other formula racing managers have been in the past decade. The on-track graphics are beyond lovely for a manager game and the player can really immerse him/herself and feel at home watching the cars race across the screen.
<br>
<br>The foundation this game is built on can be considered excellent, but what about the meat and bones, the managing aspect? There it gets more difficult, because I have seen some obvious up- and downsides to Motorsport Manager.
<br>
<br>Part of the problem comes from the question of how close the game should imitate the real sport of monoposto racing, more specifically Formula 1 and its two feeder series GP2 and GP3. Motorsport Manager comes without a license, but even a quick glance can tell you that an Italian team called Scuderia Rossini with a German and a Finnish driver are in truth Ferrari, Vettel and R&#xE4;ikk&#xF6;nen. It is that way with many other teams and people as well, just like many tracks are created in a spiritual similarity to their real-life counterparts. While that is quite nice, there is no easily accessible way to change the names database to your liking, which is a feature the developers had mentioned to be included in the game. It is no surprise that the Steam Workshop isn&apos;t activated/available for the game either as of yet, because so far the game does not appear to have any modding capability whatsoever unless one is willing to edit the original game files with third party tools.
<br>
<br>So far my experience in the game consists of one season at the highest tier, trying to win the world championship with Ferrari and two seasons trying to build a third tier team from the bottom up. Not the strongest team, but I would have won the first race of the season if not for an unlucky parts failure. Sadly it only went downhill from there and neither of my drivers finished in the top three at the end of the season. Some of those races manage to tell thrilling, harrowing and unbelievable tales and in my opinion they&apos;re a lot more interesting than watching Formula 1 on TV.
<br>
<br>Now the start in the third and lowest tier was a real challenge. If you have chosen the weakest team as I did, then trying to make it competitive (without being fired in the second season) is a hell of a job, but at least so far I have had fun trying to beat the challenge I set myself. I fear it&apos;ll take too long to get anywhere.
<br>
<br>That doesn&apos;t sound so bad, but there are sadly a number of minor and some major issues with the game, but let me explain:
<br>
<br>x) When you sign a driver, lead engineer or race mechanic you cannot do so for any time in the future. Either you sign an unemployed character after the current employee contract has run out, or you end up replacing your current employee in that spot with someone else, paying either one or two release fees for the person you&apos;re getting rid off and the one you hired. There is no so-called &quot;silly season&quot; in the game, where you&apos;re able to get a new driver for next year at all. This is a fatal oversight in a manager game!
<br>
<br>x) The way overtaking is solved in the game is quite horrible. I don&apos;t know how often it has happened to me that my driver was lapping someone else and instead of losing at most 2 seconds of lap-time the other driver was slower than mine, the lap-time dropped by 5-8 seconds. In nine out of ten times your driver will fall out of the &quot;blue flag zone&quot; again, because he&apos;s apparently not capable of following a much slower car close enough. This also has the aggravating side-effect of making you lose positions against your opponents often. Of course, this happens the other way around too, with you benefiting from it once in a while, but it&apos;s annoying and unrealistic.
<br>
<br>x) The 12 minute free practice in the third tier is way too short to actually get a setup going, which the AI seems to be able to cheat with as well. The 20 minutes in the highest tier is better, but by no means perfect.
<br>
<br>x) This brings me to my last major issue, the evolving rules of the racing series. If you want to play a game with your favorite series rules (such as race length, qualifying &amp; practice session length, points distribution, refueling, two/three dry tyre compounds) you will inevitable need to play with the politician bonus of 4 extra votes/season. Otherwise you&apos;re going to end up being outvoted on some rule you desperately want to keep. Sadly there is no way to suggest a change yourself, so you end up voting a few times per year on random rule changes.
<br>
<br>There is a lot more I could mention, but compared to what was listed above it is only minor details. To make a long story short, the game is far from perfect, but it is quite decent and it will hopefully become better after a patch or two.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/motorsport-manager/user-reviews?user_review_id=6809456">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>O melhor jogo manager de automobilismo dos &#xFA;ltimos anos! Eu e tantos outros est&#xE1;vamos a espera de um jogo como esse, o &#xFA;ltimo bom era de 2000, 16 anos de espera, uma vida. Agora eu espero que possam dar continuidade a este magnifico game. Parab&#xE9;ns aos desenvolvedores.
<br>
<br>I LOVE THIS GAME!</span>

<br>
<br>You can&apos;t extend the contract of your current staff properly because they just disregard the terms of the current contract while the new one overrides it. Plus you can&apos;t set a contract start date for any of the staff so you need to pray someone you want doesn&apos;t auto resign with a team after their current contract ends or you need terminate a contract (IRL you&apos;d not have an pleasant time finding work if you did that!). While on the topic of staff how worthless is the scouting department. Their is absolutely no search and sort function forcing the player to tediously click through the dossier of each person in order to find the info they are looking for, wtf!?!
<br>
<br>Onto the financial side it is just as bad. The end of the year prize pool remains unchanged no matter how many years pass (same with sponsor deals) which leads to over priced contract fees as staff and driver wages continue to get bid up whilst you&apos;re stuck with the now woefully stagnant income you had 5 or 10 years ago! Talking about income their is no way to raise the marketability and thus the sponsorship values of your driver despite if they won back to back championships or not it still remains the same. Than their is the total lack of ways to get money other than the sponsor/end of year. Why can&apos;t staff be traded/sold to other teams and why isn&apos;t their a bank/loan option available?
<br>
<br>Bottom line is maybe the game might grab a few hours for casual race fans but if you were hoping the game had a in depth management side you&apos;ll be sorely disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/motorsport-manager/user-reviews?user_review_id=6933394">Expand</a></span>

So far I have played about 25 hours and have not come across any bugs which is impressive for a game made by such a small team.

<br>
<br>1) It is not an expensive game. It is reasonable and affordable price.
<br>2) Graphics... It is a manager-like game but you can watch the entire competition between teams and drivers.
<br>3) It is player based game. That means, you can control everything what you want, e.g. fuel, tires, morals, contracts, buildings, cars, design, etc.
<br>
<br>I would like to write more things about the game but I am tired to write due to there are a lot of things that should be written.
<br>
<br>If you like motor sports, you are not going to be regret to play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/motorsport-manager/user-reviews?user_review_id=7200629">Expand</a></span>
