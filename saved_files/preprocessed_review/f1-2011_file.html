Overall the handling is far better, the weather system now works properly and looks slightly better. Could have been done as a DLC TBH.</span>

In the driving aspect the game is realistic, of course, but in general it is shallow. You don&apos;t get the feeling of a story running on.</span>

Force Feedback has been utilized really well. Going over any bump or kurb is felt through the wheel. Xbox360 controller works just as fine. Found no problem using the controller. This is one game I will be recommending to anyone that has any interest in racing sims. The PC version is obviously going to be the pinnacle of all the formats available. Having it released on pretty much all of the formats brings the game to a wide gaming audience and leaves no reason not to have this in anyone&apos;s collection.

I will make it short and plain: F1 2011 is a game with a lot of potential, and it widely keeps its promises.<br><br>What will impress you most is the challenging gameplay: F1 2011 is a hard and over demanding game. It will keep you busy for hours and hours in an attempt to become the very expert pilot. You have been warned: you won&apos;t have an easy ride. Opponents are merciless drivers, you will have to master ang go around deadly bends, avoid going off the rails and keeping a dangerous driving (otherwise you will be heavily punished by umpires). Some tracks could be frustrating even in beginner&apos;s mode and...if you play in higher difficulty levels you will have to struggle a lot (a prolonged pit &apos;rest&apos; could mean you to topple from 1st to 24th position in a couple of seconds). The positive news is that car handling is not as frustrating as in other racing games (take the pitiless Need for Speed Shift 2 or even F1 2010 to give you an example).<br><br>As about visuals, the game is pretty functional. You won&apos;t hail it as a miracle but weather effects are well done, some tracks are superb and with lots of details...some other tracks are bare and blank. The cars look awesome at the beginning of the race. Human characters should have deserved more attention (stiff animations here around) but they&apos;re passable as well.<br><br>F1 2011 features some really good soundtracks, especially during loading screens, which I found to be very suitable and catchy. Sound effects are good but not exceptional.<br><br>Lasting appeal is noteworthy: the numerous tracks will keep you busy for many hours and higher difficulty levels will hold your interest unaltered all over the game.<br><br>As far as concerns negative aspects, I can&apos;t help but to mention the very frequent and interminable loading screens (+ 1 min and not only between one track and another), the quagmire menus and - generally speaking - a too much attention to simulative aspects that can cutt off some of the fun from your gaming experience. Surely, that is not a game for everyone: it requires you a lot of patience, the learning curve is long and hard, forget about immediate and arcade fun. But you will be enormously rewarded.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/f1-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1762478">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not a simulator, you can plant your foot on the throttle during the starts and still have a good start. If you&apos;re not really a quick driver you can get good challenge from the AI but if you&apos;re good the AI, even on the highest level of difficulty, are still darn slow and on practice they&apos;re really stupid. Since they fixed the 11-11 springs bug the handling is fantastic though.<br><br>So that leaves you with coop and online racing... but those two are broken. Aside from the lack of stuff to deter wreckers, any online mode is bugged. Months ago they&apos;re claiming that they&apos;ll be focusing on the online part but even with its second patch that&apos;s supposed to fix lots of online problems a lot of them are still there. This is NOT a good online racing game. Not even leagues can save it because the problems are with the game.<br><br>Graphics, well, it&apos;s good... BEFORE THE SECOND PATCH. After it, the game now has this very annoying crowd popup even on the highest settings and it now performs poorer on the same settings. The annoying pixelated drying line is also still there. Still, it looks better than some racers but it&apos;s not the best looking either. To be honest, F1 2010 looks better.<br><br>Then we got the issues. Ever since the second patch, we now have the tire wear bug wherein the game applies the wrong wear levels to tires. You can turn off tire wear but then the game loses its charm. There&apos;s a workaround but I find it hard to accept that for everything you have to do in the game you have to remember some workarounds. In this game if you don&apos;t do workarounds you get tires that have wear on them when they should be fresh, or you get to fail an R&amp;D even if you were successful on it. The worst is you&apos;ll get your save game corrupted and you won&apos;t even be able to load the game unless you manually fix your save game data.<br><br>Two F1 games in a row, Codemasters Birmingham have produced an unfinished game and the worse part is their patches leave the game in an even more broken state. Sure, the patches fixed some but in turn broke other parts which are equally critical. The nail in the coffin is CM seems to be planning on leaving it broken. To be honest, this is a game which is hard to recommend. It&apos;s a shame because CM&apos;s DiRT series, even if they&apos;re simpler in comparison, are miles ahead in quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/f1-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1981602">Expand</a></span>
