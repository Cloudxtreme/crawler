<br>
<br>The steam forums have an alarmingly high amount of complaints about such bugs, and today I was victim to one of those. The game always closes silently wihout any error messages whenever I finish the first chase stage.
<br>
<br>Not all people are affected by these bugs, and many will tell you that this is a fun game. But be warned, if you buy this game for PC, at this stage, you have a considerable chance of not being able to get past the first few stages. Good luck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lego-jurassic-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=5328042">Expand</a></span>
