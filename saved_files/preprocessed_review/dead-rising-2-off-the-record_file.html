This game however is strictly a RE-IMAGINING of Dead Rising 2, with a new area which is home to a few more bits and pieces.    The story is almost identical to Dead Rising 2, except this time with the protagonist of the first game (Who I prefered) who has his own opinions and dialogue, which may seem interesting if you are a die hard fan of the series, however, keep in mind since this is a RE-IMAGINING, most of the story will be identical say for a few parts of dialogue.    The combat is as fun as ever, taking the combo weapons and adding a few more to the mix to add more variety to killing the hordes of the undead which are in Fortune City. The new weapons added for this edition are not as interesting as the ones added for the base second game when compared to the first, as they are generally just variations on some of the already existing items with say more/less damage, different noises, ect.    The game lasted me around the same time as Dead Rising 2 did, which was around twelve hours with side missions I chose to perform along the way, which are often a lot of fun when involving Psychopaths and help to break up the regular zombie killing experience. If you haven&apos;t played the second game, or loved Frank West, then I would reccomend this game if you could find it on sale, full price is a bit steep for a very similar experience when you can find the second one often a lot cheaper.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2-off-the-record/user-reviews?user_review_id=2505961">Expand</a></span>

It is something that the Dead Rising series should have had from the start and in a game where exploration is rewarded, but time is limited Sandbox Mode is perfect! I&apos;ve read a lot of reviews that say &quot;killing zombies gets old,&quot; and that&apos;s why this mix of Story and Sandbox is so great. The level up, inventory, and skills systems are all well executed. The story is gritty without taking itself too seriously and the main characters are very interesting. My only complaint is that sometimes actions take a little too long to perform, which can mess up your timing in tense situations. If you haven&apos;t played Dead Rising 2 or always wanted to explore Fortune City without restrictions I highly recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2-off-the-record/user-reviews?user_review_id=2515803">Expand</a></span>

I never got around to it, but even still Off the Record has its flaws. The story is pretty nice, but from what I understand it simply inserts Frank West in Chuck&apos;s old scenes (I&apos;m not sure though, so I won&apos;t hold it against the game just in case). The gameplay, however, has a few problems which will annoy people to varying degrees. Weapons still degrade very quickly, which isn&apos;t a huge issue but it can lead to some saving your best weapon for when you really need it or you think it will be most fun. It&apos;s still a minor annoyance to me that you can&apos;t hold more ammo for a gun than what comes with it. If you empty the gun, you need to go find another gun somewhere. The game has long animations typical of some of Capcom&apos;s games, which may annoy some people but it&apos;s not really a big deal for me. Just beware if you&apos;re being crowded by zombies (or swamped by hostile humans) and you&apos;re low on health, it&apos;s unlikely you will be able to quickly eat something or pick up a new weapon to save yourself. These dire situations are rare though and I&apos;d say they&apos;re more often the fault of the player than the game. And of course, escorting survivors is still a big part of the game since it gives such a huge PP (experience) boost. Escorting people is never fun and it&apos;s not different in this game. Be warned that you do have to walk them back to and actually enter the safehouse to rescue them. Capcom did not update the game to use DR2: Case West&apos;s hostage rescuing system.<br><br>There&apos;s a sandbox mode now, which removes the &quot;missions&quot; of the game. This leaves it pretty empty feeling. What you can do amounts to killing zombies and doing some timed challenges that have so far been all about killing zombies. There&apos;s leaderboards for this stuff, if that interests you. The sandbox stuff would be better if the world was more open and had no loading times, but that would be more work than is worth doing on Capcom&apos;s part I guess.<br><br>The game is a definite improvement over DR2 but the improvements aren&apos;t worth $40 if you&apos;ve played DR2 already. It&apos;s probably worth your time and money if you enjoyed the original DR, Case Zero or Case West though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2-off-the-record/user-reviews?user_review_id=1792295">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a &#x201C;feel&#x201D; for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.
<br>
<br>The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no &#x201C;half&#x201D; or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.
<br>
<br>The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.
<br>
<br>Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, if a game has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a &#x201C;feature quota&#x201D;. Games that excel in both areas of a section don&#x2019;t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section
<br>
<br>The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; section. This section is for how the reviewer &#x201C;feels&#x201D; about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2-off-the-record/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797134">Expand</a></span>

This game is just genuinely ridiculous and playing around in the city is just a load of fun. The number of things that you can use or interact with is simply bizarre. The crafting system is also a load of fun and you can craft both useful and wacky weapons. The story is for the most time alright but it is the side characters and side missions that really shines storywise. The combat works nicely against zombies despite some annoying quicktime events and the zombies feels just threatening enough. The game is however by no means perfect. It has in fact quite a lot of faults. The (semi)boss-battles are just terrible and a chore to complete on the lower difficulties. Which is a shame since these events are presented very well. A lot of the sidequest  in the game is simply no more than escort-missions in the end which gets a bit repetitive to say the least. The AI for you allies is competent enough but escorting and protecting AI companions are never really any fun. The game do also have a few shooting-sections which are kind of awful since the shooting mechanic is no where as good as the melee-mechanics. Fighting humans are overall a bit of a pain in the ass in the game. The fact that most animations forces you to stand still one or two seconds can also be really annoying when you are in a tight spot. The checkpoint system could also be improved since it sometimes forced me to replay boring and easy sections over and over again. I dont wanna sound too negative considering that i quite enjoyed the 22 hours i spent to complete the main campaign. The game do however have plenty of flaws that shouldn&apos;t be overlooked and might annoy other more than me. I would still however recommend this game since the games core gameplay is pure fun and quite unique. You should definitely pick this game up if you find it available for a cheap price. I should mention that i didn&apos;t play Dead Rising 2 so i cant compare the two of them. And that the game uses games for windows live which is a bit annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2-off-the-record/user-reviews?user_review_id=2967381">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Sandbox mode, anyone? YES!
<br>+ In all there are 3 new psychopaths though 2 of these replace previous encounters, and one of the replacement psychopaths is essentially a cut-copy-paste job. So there&apos;s only 1 entirely new, added encounter
<br>+ Frank&apos;s Dialogue is golden, he makes hilarious remarks on everything around him; he&apos;s always had the best voice actor and lines in the series
<br>+ Frank uses weapons in the same manner as he did in DR1 and his unlockable moves are different from Chuck&apos;s, setting the characters apart and giving more depth to co-op
<br>+ A fully developed added area dubbed, &apos;Uranus Zone&apos;. It&apos;s a fun theme-park with plenty of toys and places to explore
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Too similar to Dead Rising 2 to be released at near full price
<br>- No real graphical improvements
<br>- Not enough added content
<br>- Very poor textures on PC, I don&apos;t remember the game looking as bad on the PS3 (I own DR2 on Playstation 3)
<br>
<br>Pro/Cons:
<br>+/- Non-Canon. What happens in this game isn&apos;t considered to have actually happened in the main storyline of Dead Rising. Which is, to be honest, kind of depressing because what happens in this game is pretty awesome. Of course if this was canon it would completely ruin the storyline, also, the ending boss fight is a tad goofy I&apos;m not gonna lie.
<br>
<br>Summary: An enhanced version of Dead Rising 2 with a (in my opinion) more likeable and interesting protagonist. It has enough content added to be fresh and original, while still retaining the feel of Dead Rising 2.
<br>
<br>Who should buy this game:
<br>* Those who enjoyed Dead Rising 2 and are willing to pay 30 bucks to experience it again from a different perspective
<br>* Those who have never played Dead Rising 2 but wish to; Off the Record is essentially an improved version of DR 2
<br>* Those who have fond memories of Frank in the first game; he is very much the star here, and his one-liners, dialogue and several references to the original are very much appreciated and used in good taste
<br>* Those who like zombie games
<br>
<br>Who shouldn&apos;t play this game:
<br>* Those who didn&apos;t like Dead Rising 1 or 2
<br>* Those who don&apos;t like buying revamped versions of existing games for higher prices
<br>* Those who really, really like Chuck Greene and hate Frank West (I don&apos;t think these people exist, but whatever)
<br>
<br>Giving it an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2-off-the-record/user-reviews?user_review_id=3766302">Expand</a></span>
