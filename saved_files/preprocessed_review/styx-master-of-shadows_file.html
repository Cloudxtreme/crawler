<br>
<br>Pros: You get to be a Goblin assassin. The best kind of assassin.
<br>Expansive and creative level design offers a multitude of paths for your creative enjoyment.
<br>The controls work well and I have had no problem with &quot;ledge detection&quot; like other people have stated.
<br>Movement animations are nimble and feel right. Kill animations make you feel powerful and gritty.
<br>Beautiful graphics especially the lighting and main character, Styx.
<br>Good story and a cool way of telling it as far as I&apos;m concerned.
<br>
<br>Cons: Sub par voice acting. I really feel like this is the only thing keeping it from a 10/10 to me. If I had to rate the voice acting it would be a 6/10, not horrible but it could have been better.
<br>
<br>All in all, this is a great game for about 25$. I&apos;ve enjoyed it more than most games I&apos;ve bought this year for over twice that price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4579040">Expand</a></span>

With only little imperfections here and there it&apos;s an unforgetable ride. No nursing, lots of freedom, outstanding level (or should I say - world) and sound design, solid graphics*.
<br>
<br>Controls:
<br>Smooth, precise, no automation allowing a great deal of freedom of movement. People complaining about it are usually accustomed to Assassin&apos;s Creed type of aids or plainly didn&apos;t grasp the introductory tutorial of Styx. After few hours I&apos;m looking like a Quasimodo returning from a ballet lessons!
<br>Good camera movement BTW. I&apos;ve never seen a serious clipping or obstruction problems with it.
<br>
<br>Story/world:
<br>Mature fantasy world with interesting, original twists. Again, mature and non-trivial!
<br>
<br>AI:
<br>A little bit short-sighted and quickly dropping the hunt for you if you manage to run away after being detected but aside from it. A solid work.
<br>
<br>Game mechanics:
<br>Like a well-selected orchestra!
<br>Initially I thought that some elements I&apos;ve seen in the trailer are misplaced and that I won&apos;t use them. So wrong. Everything has its place and purpose and everything has its limitations, avoiding boredom and making a specific item too commonly used during gameplay. A stealthy run through a guard-crawling level on the highest difficulty level will leave you thinking you&apos;re a god :) It&apos;s all hard work, patience, planning and execution all put together.
<br>
<br>Good representation of Styx&apos;s limitations. A jump 15 meters down and you&apos;re a goner. It&apos;s not anime...
<br>
<br>Audio:
<br>One of the biggest selling points of the game. Apart from repetitive dialogues of the guards that is. The soundtrack should be sold separately! Well done and, as with the story and world design, a great deal of originality.
<br>
<br>* very well optimised! Radeon 6850 allows for perfectly smooth maxed-out gameplay at 1080p.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4580453">Expand</a></span>

To keep it short, combat is a bit clunky and I accept that. Styx is a Goblin with a dagger. He&apos;s not Styx: The Green Barbarian but  Styx: Master of Shadows. If you accept the fact that you&apos;re not Drizz&apos;t do Urden, you&apos;re in for a ride! Use your strengths which are sneaking, backstabbing and agile climbing.
<br>
<br>While playing this game you&apos;ll do yourself a huge favor by being patient. Observe and look for opportunities and turn off on-screen objectives. They will only draw you too quickly to the next level, explore instead and use the crude in game map. You&apos;re probably in those locations for the first time anyway, so it&apos;s only realistic to not know exactly where to go. Also, when playing on &quot;Goblin&quot; difficulty the AI ain&apos;t so dumb as some people would have it. The AI is pretty aware of its surroundings and it will be a challenge to remain undetected, while making combat fairly hard as you&apos;ll die in one sword hit.
<br>
<br>The graphics are nice, it sets the right mood and Styx is an enjoyable character to play. The graphics isn&apos;t particularly demanding, nicely optimized and gets the job done perfectly. Anyone complaining about it should get a proper spanking as there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.
<br>
<br>Styx: MoS is a proper &quot;Thief game&quot;. Much more so than, for example, Thief III. Styx follows a tried and tested formula and adds freedom of movement and many paths from A to B both in playstyle (Skill choices) and more literally the route through each zone. Each path with some difficulties, unlike Deus Ex HR, for example (vent routes were almost equal to no challenge). Styx also adds &quot;accidents&quot; which can be triggered mainly by unfastening chandeliers but also by poisoning fruit bowls that the AI guards eats from. A nice little addition to the already diverse choice of more up close and personal assassination techniques. I advice people to unlock the 4 &quot;Kill&quot; skills as quickly as possible. They are, in my opinion, vital to get the most out of the assassination part of the game and I do enjoy that part very much.
<br>
<br>The game gets 8 for product quality ( technical, visual and creative presentation) and 10 for fun rating which ends up with a smashing average of 9!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4581784">Expand</a></span>

<br>Overall I&apos;ll too rate this 8/10 lie Vanaran did - if you&apos;re a fan of stealth games and you don&apos;t mind a few quirks here and there, there is a lot to be liked about this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4576316">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t name better stealth game for past 5 years where you can&apos;t just ragekill everybody without hiding. Mechanics are working pretty good and armor design of enemies is really cool.

With only little imperfections here and there it&apos;s an unforgetable ride. No nursing, lots of freedom, outstanding level (or should I say - world) and sound design, solid graphics*.
<br>
<br>Controls:
<br>Smooth, precise, no automation allowing a great deal of freedom of movement. People complaining about it are usually accustomed to Assassin&apos;s Creed type of aids or plainly didn&apos;t grasp the introductory tutorial of Styx. After few hours I&apos;m looking like a Quasimodo returning from a ballet lessons!
<br>Good camera movement BTW. I&apos;ve never seen a serious clipping or obstruction problems with it.
<br>
<br>Story/world:
<br>Mature fantasy world with interesting, original twists. Again, mature and non-trivial!
<br>
<br>AI:
<br>A little bit short-sighted and quickly dropping the hunt for you if you manage to run away after being detected but aside from it. A solid work.
<br>
<br>Game mechanics:
<br>Like a well-selected orchestra!
<br>Initially I thought that some elements I&apos;ve seen in the trailer are misplaced and that I won&apos;t use them. So wrong. Everything has its place and purpose and everything has its limitations, avoiding boredom and making a specific item too commonly used during gameplay. A stealthy run through a guard-crawling level on the highest difficulty level will leave you thinking you&apos;re a god :) It&apos;s all hard work, patience, planning and execution all put together.
<br>
<br>Good representation of Styx&apos;s limitations. A jump 15 meters down and you&apos;re a goner. It&apos;s not anime...
<br>
<br>Audio:
<br>One of the biggest selling points of the game. Apart from repetitive dialogues of the guards that is. The soundtrack should be sold separately! Well done and, as with the story and world design, a great deal of originality.
<br>
<br>* very well optimised! Radeon 6850 allows for perfectly smooth maxed-out gameplay at 1080p.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4578669">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. Main character. Biggest. Badass. Ever. I love him. I didn&apos;t liked main character in any game that much, from the times of first Max Payne.
<br>2. Story. It is good. This is reason enough to get this game - you see good story in gaming industry very rarely in these times. Especially in stealth games.
<br>3. Atmosphere. Story is in this game is good. Atmosphere is **** great.
<br>4. Suprisingly good graphics, especially in game with such low system requirements.
<br>
<br>I still don&apos;t like gameplay. Because I just don&apos;t like stealth in general. But if someone like me, finished it and had fun,  even when not liking gameplay, thanks only to atmoshpere, story and characters, well, I think it says pretty much about how good this game is.
<br>
<br>I liked it. If you&apos;re stealth games fan, you&apos;ll probably love it.

Hell even veteran stealth gamers will have a hard time on the first level. The maps in each level are HUGE. With many guards and hidden guards you will feel at times you are backed into a corner because of a lack of abilities and supplies, which is what makes the game feel so good.There is a surprising amount of ways to handle missions. Many places to to hide are scattered around the area. like his name, Styx uses the shadows to stay hidden, taking out torches and using balls of sand to take them out from a distance if needed.Many hidden collectibles and really cool &quot;amber powers&quot; . Many items like balls of sand, bottles of acid, throwing knives  and more to give you more options in your environment.Satisfying stealth,  great setting and soundtrack and sound effects with interesting visuals and odd but bad ass goblin protagonist makes this game feel unique.
<br>
<br>At least that&apos;s what it tries to be. One huge flaw the this game suffers from is its no different from anything you&apos;ve probably played. It doesn&apos;t try to be unique of different, at all. Game play is exactly as what you would expect from a stealth game.  The game also pretty much makes you have to go stealthy if you want to feel the full experience from the game. The combat is terrible. when you fight a guard the camera auto locks onto him, which means you cant turn the camera away unless you roll away, which leaves you open to attack from other guards. There&apos;s no blocking, just keep pressing the right button at the right time to parry then kill him when he stumbles. Hit detection is horrible as well so good luck on either of you landing a hit. AI is retarded unless you play on the hardest difficulty. Many abilities like overhead assassinations or cover kills and locked away abilities unless you buy them with SP that you earn when you beat a mission. And Some of the cute scenes are drawn by hand and repeat as well which is an odd choice since the game had a strong opening cut scene. A lack of variety in enemies as well until far into the game. Overall this is a good but unremarkable stealth game that just aims for the bare minimum. Its $30 price tag is nice, since most &quot;next gen&quot; games ask for $60.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=5241367">Expand</a></span>

<br>Styx is an excellent stealth game with lots of appeal and with an unusual, but actually very likable, main character. Can be pretty challenging but it&apos;s always fair, and often lets you have different approaches at the various challenges thanks to the main character&apos;s many abilities and skills. Great map design and interesting story too.</span>

<br>
<br>The jumping mechanics are broken on the PC version. You click jump and there&apos;s a pretty decent lag after which he will jump. Meanwhile the jump momentum is weird as hell. There is a standing jump which is higher with lesser distance and a running jump which hardly has any height but an okay distance. All this is fine until you come to know that when you jump you need to land at an exact spot. You need to leave the forward key mid-air. Failing to do that you will overshoot the platform. If you leave it too early you will reach too early and fall down. You need to jump+W. Time W just right.
<br>
<br>Graphics are good in teh sense you can stop and admire what is it. But the color combination makes everything camouflage. Just check a YouTube gameplay video to see it for yourself.
<br>
<br>As for the stealth mechanics. I foundthem horrible. There are too many flaws. The sudden camera turns when you get caught (thus making invisibility useless), the guards being faster than you, colliding into items, not being able to see the camera properly, clumsy jumps - all these combined up made for a bad experience.
<br>
<br>Summary: Try out a demo first (haven&apos;t checked whether it&apos;s available or not). If you&apos;re okay with clumsy controls and don&apos;t mind F5+F9 every 1-2 mins then go ahead with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=5980997">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Firstly, the graphics are running on Unreal Engine 3 which already look terrible, muddy and washed out, only to be hampered by flat textures and poor graphical implementation of most of the existing tech available.
<br>
<br>A notable example is how Anisotropic Filtering doesn&apos;t change regardless of which setting is selected. But there&apos;s still plenty more broken with the game.
<br>
<br>The animations are one of the worst you will ever see. The take-down animations are jerky and finicky, as soon as you take-down a guard, his ragdoll will shake uncontrollably. The platform sequences accompanied do not help the fact that jumping is completely broken, and your character will not grab onto the platform unless you angle him in a very specific position, so that the game registers your input onto that very small hit-box.
<br>
<br>Of course, there are the usual clipping issues, bugged movements where your character will get stuck in the ground with the &quot;falling animation&quot; as he flails his arms around in the air, forcing you to reload your previous save game. Did I forget to mention that this games load times vary anywhere between 10-50 seconds on loads running on an SSD? Well, yes it does, and no, 50 second save load times are not normal.
<br>
<br>Then there&apos;s the atrocious voice acting, laughable story and juvenile writing in the mix. It desperately tries to be funny and witty by adding immature, crude humor with a fart joke here and another one about &quot;peeling balls&quot; there. But it ultimately fails and falls flat right on it&apos;s face.
<br>
<br>The game-play itself is weak considering the stealth is a joke and the A.I. is laughably stupid as they collide into walls and spin in circles. The developers also ran out of ideas on how to make the stealth system more difficult, so they figure forcing you into a QTE sequence whenever you are spotted, and locking you in it by restricting any input until it is completed is much more logical than allowing you to use your invisibility power to escape.
<br>
<br>Guards will constantly draw their swords upon finding a corpse and sheathe them right after the cool-down period, only to repeat the exact same thing after walking into a second corpse 5 feet away. This is how bad the A.I. is.
<br>
<br>And of course, people will still try to defend the game and justify all the bugs and nonsense because it&apos;s $30.
<br>
<br>+1 for the effort.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4581158">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The levels claustrophobic and difficult to navigate, let alone memorize. First missions consist of multiple levels, utterly useless and fake paths that lead nowhere, nor are needed on any occasion and i have yet to find how to lunge onto someone from a higher position. Right now you could stand behind someone, but if he is like 5cm higher or lower, you cant execute him.
<br>
<br>Looking through stuff you can acquire with skillpoints, there is nothing worth playing for. No cool, extra abilities, no game-changing mechanics. If you release a game that attempts to combine goblins, ass-creed and dishonored, but have only a stinking goblin who can puke out an another stinking goblin, you get Styx. And its bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4586066">Expand</a></span>

<br>The AI is simply not immersive and quite &quot;basic&quot; (not to say down right dumb). AI will simply forget you ever existed as you turn a corner and/or reach an area he cannot access. There is only one faction so you will see guards coexist with &quot;monsters&quot; that should exterminate them just as much they do to you. Very, very often patrols will bump in one another as soon as you disturb one; often resulting in them being stuck and breaking the level.
<br>There is to say; no &quot;fighting&quot; gameplay/chances (ala Thief from Eidos) and dying is extremely painful as savepoints are scarse (you can lose easily up to 20-30min of progression later on).
<br>The Gameplay per-se and story are not bad; but nothing stand out as new / extraordinary and the voice acting is not that great.
<br>The climbing system feels restricted compared to Assassin&apos;s Creed or Shadow of Mordor; and trying to ledge grab downward can be a real pain in the a** which will kill you / alert the enemies A LOT.
<br>
<br>If you like the genre; try out Thief (Eidos Montreal).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4581297">Expand</a></span>

I wasnt expected anything special, considering the fact i didnt like previous Cyanide games. But this time they delivered, oh yes they did. Previous games had nice story but kinda bad and clunky gameplay, this time it changed and gameplay is strongest part of this game.
<br>Its a stealth game, we play as goblin Styx. We are small and weak, and every enemy can kill us within seconds (and they will trust me :) ), so it encourages us to stay in shadows. But we are not completely defenseless, Styx is very agile, can climb some walls, can fit into air duct tunnels etc. We can also kill enemies, but in melee range only from behind when we are not seen, or we can jump on them from above, when we have special skill. Other ways of killing them is to throw knives at them (powerful, but knives are rare resource) or drop chandelier on their ugly human faces. That leads us to level design, and it is fantastic. It put to shame all these bad stealthy games released for last few years, like Thief4 or last Hitman. Levels can be traversed in multiple ways, they are very &quot;vertical&quot;, usually you can take different paths to destination- go above, below or around, or just use invisibility and through room. Options are few and thats what i really love in a good stealth game.
<br>Styx has some nice skills, we can upgrade them between missions in hideout by using point we get from completing main and secondary objectives (finding special loot, killing certain character etc.). There are also special insignias- rewards for completing level in certain way- no kills, all items collected etc. Upgrades initially dont seem to be very strong, but some of them are really very helpful. Especially 4/4 stealth is very useful, and additional knives/vials of amber (mana).
<br>Game can be hard and challenging (in a good way), so f5 is your best friend (quicksave).
<br>Graphics are ok- its not AAA with huge budget, sometimes its rough on edges and it seems, but it doesnt matter as long as you dont expect Crysis here. Controls is something what i personally like. I know people complain theres no free roam parkour-key like in AC game, but i dont think its necessary, tbh i hated it in every game using it i played. Every action you want to do- you have to press button. And thats why i love it. No casual **** no climbing million walls without using buttons, no accidental climbing when i wanted something else, just full control over your character. Controls are smooth and responsible. You want to jump? Press **** space, you have hands, you can do it. I admit edge detection could be better- few times i fell to death because Styx didnt grab ledge, but thats minor annoyance. Also dropping from ledges (when you are standing on them) could have a key. But thats fine.
<br>Story is ok, maybe somewhat confusing at first, but the world is interesting. Its fantasy, but not another lame high fantasy we are used to. Its original, mature, and Styx is cool as a character. Audio is very good, especially music. Guards dialogues should be less repetitive though.
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>Gameplay and levels are top-notch, and i would recommend this game to any fan of stealth. But rather old school stealth (Thief1-3, Splinter cell 1-3) than recent action-stealth-wannabies (like Assassins creed, Thief4 or Mordor). If you want to sneak around but then kill enemies when they discover you- its not game for you, better pick Mordor.
<br>Conclusion- Styx is a great game, its best true stealth game since Mark of ninja, period. If you like stealth- buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4607354">Expand</a></span>

Most fantasy games have goblins as mean, vicious, sneaky, roguish little devils, so how come no one though of this game before? If you don&apos;t discard it in the first hour, then prepare to be unwilling to put it down.
<br>
<br>THE GOOD
<br>- Good stealth feeling with the unique approach of you being an assassin Goblin, in a creative (albeit too Dishonouredish) setting.
<br>- Fluid nice animations of the main character (not so much of all other cast).
<br>- The size of the world is massive.
<br>- Approaches to goals are multiple and allow for every play style.
<br>- Most missions make sense from the narrative&apos;s stance and are good, with some being very entertaining and imaginative (not all, but some).
<br>- Length of game is solid at 15-20 hrs (unless speedrunning).
<br>- Replay-ability is dependant on immersion and personal play style, but can also be very high. Completionists will enjoy the challenges while others may skip them for unpractical and, in game effects, somewhat unrewarding. Solving the riddles to find the Relics is a nice addition although not exactly challenging.
<br>- Music score reminiscent of Apocalyptica will enthral those with such musical tastebuds.
<br>- Camera is spectacular. Never ever in your way.
<br>- CHaracter design and visuals in general are effective and well crafted.
<br>- Voice acting, specially the main character Styx (voiced by Saul Jephcott), is enjoyable and well executed.
<br>- The game is almost bug-free (except for the mutant ticks :D). Only one crash on my play-through at the very end, and I think it was my fault for much Ctrl+Alt+Tabbing.
<br>
<br>THE SO-SO
<br>- Guard pathfinding sees them stuck a bit.
<br>- Lacklustre skills, so no enticement to get them all (which is possible). I had 850 Skill Points left when I finished the game (for comparison, a skill costs 30-90).
<br>- Story in general is not quite novel, although one twist at the middle makes a hiccup of medium originality. Story logic is marred by holes.
<br>- Lacklustre recompenses for earning any of 4 types of insignias (only about 20 SP each, in most cases), making it somewhat unattractive to risk a perfect mission just to get a particularly tricky item or avoid killing an annoyingly placed guard.
<br>- Cutscenes vary in quality, specially mediocre are the reminiscences of Styx.
<br>- You cannot back-stab enemies if you are not exactly at the same level they are (for example from the top of a small crate).
<br>
<br>THE BAD
<br>- Inconsistent reality. What you can do and what actually happens is not entirely constant, therefor seriously limiting your problem-solving. E.G. Sometimes your Noise-making goes unheard if the game needs to ignore it, or a clone-ambush trap does not trigger by the proximity of a guard only because he is looking for you (he is not looking for your clone!), or when your clone is found you are also found automatically in some instances. Getting behind an elf while it is distracted choking your clone still doesn&apos;t allow you to back-stab them just because the game has that as a prohibition, apparently.
<br>- Controls are whimsical. The same button push will have you jump different distances. Also the contextual menus (which allow you to interact with objects near you) don&apos;t show in a trustworthy way, which commonly leads to horribly botching missions or to the ever frightening possibility of a contextual-menu-nightmare when you are in a hurry and many interactive things are close together and ledges are also involved.
<br>- Guards&apos; casual dialogue is very repetitive and can get stuck in an eternal loop.
<br>- Edge finding. You fall many times when you shouldn&apos;t or stick magnetically to borders you don&apos;t want to.
<br>- Guards turn to formidable marksmen guiding their missiles with the power of thought as soon as you are discovered.
<br>- Environmental enemies, such as giant ticks and slave Orcs, work in tandem with their human tormentors against you, when there is no reason why they should. This detracts from wonderful strategic possibilities for the more creative players to set traps using them to foil the humans efforts to kill you.
<br>- In such a huge city full of potential, the re-use of 50% of the maps going backwards is unforgivable, even if you admire the design it took to make them challenging on both directions.
<br>- Ending is limp and uninspired, when it needed grandeur to close what had been an exciting adventure.
<br>
<br>-MINOR SPOILERS START-
<br>By tradition the weakest part of a stealth game is combat (for reasons that should be obvious) and Styx: Master of Shadows is no exception, so the lamentable choice of an ending focused on action and duelling in a tiny, fully lit, boring arena is ever more poignant.
<br>-MINOR SPOILERS END-
<br>
<br>CONCLUSION
<br>A well made, exciting and absorbing game, much better than many similar titles and surely better than Thief that sad, sad remake. If you have ever enjoyed a stealth game, buy Styx.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4696864">Expand</a></span>

Huge levels reminded me of Blades of Darkness, still it gets old after few hours at best, and minimalistic RPG elements, together with Relics Collection (1 relic each level) are hardly enough to keep you going. Plays alright on a gamepad but is lacking a tiny bit in edge detection department. Gameplay is slow and repetitive, with a slow, dull story, fights consist mostly from dodging and parrying as you can&apos;t really attack the big stupid humans. Character are alright, but definitely not from a catwalk.The best part of this game is the level design and some scenery from time to time. I&apos;ll give it 7 but it&apos;s 6.5 really. Especially that it came out recently and not around 2005-10. I couldn&apos;t bring myself to complete the whole story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=6888973">Expand</a></span>

This is also one of the few games in recent times to have a decent optional quicksave system instead of just the dumbed down hyper-consolized &quot;checkpoint only&quot; system, so another +1 for that.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d give it 8.5/10, unfortunately it gets downgraded to a 5 due to a common serious game-breaking bug that&apos;s still unfixed +18 months after being acknowledged. If you replay missions (which you&apos;re encouraged to do by the nature of the game design), you can end up stuck and unable to proceed. There&apos;s a large thread on the Steam forums on this topic. In fact there are several other highly annoying bugs that appear to be unfixed and abandoned by the developers. Eg, Renaissance 1/4&apos;s end of sub-mission cutscene sometimes doesn&apos;t trigger leaving you stuck and unable to move forward, some chars get stuck after their conversation ends leaving a cluster of 3-5 enemies standing in one spot, enemies will sometimes walk off ledges and get stuck standing on nothing in mid-air, enemy alert states randomly jump one state higher than when you saved upon loading a game, etc. It&apos;s a shame because if they patched this stuff properly, I&apos;d give it a much higher score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604636">Expand</a></span>

<br>He kills by stealth, he doesn&apos;t scrap with armoured swordsmen twice his size as they can chop him up. It is the opposite of the empowerment fantasy of Shadows of Mordor, there you can race straight at enemies facing you and still qualify as a stealth kill, fun but not stealth at all. Here knock over a mop, chair or bucker while you are just behind someone and that&apos;s that over. If you see how that makes success more rewarding then try it, if not then it&apos;s not for you. Which would be  a shame as the level design is beautiful, hugely vertical, multi layer, multi path, a proper lovingly crafted playground. Also a fantasy game that feels like a distinct place and atmosphere all it&apos;s own.
<br>
<br>The only thing that has really felt like Tenchu 1 and 2 did in the day. Though now the poison rice ball is goblin bile spat in the drinking water, and if they have been just slightly put on alert once but spotted nothing they won&apos;t be stupid enough to risk eating or drinking food that could have been tampered with ever.
<br>(Oh and don&apos;t forget to save as you go as doing half an enormous maze of death and then missing a jump is a harsh reminder to press a button :) )</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=6797186">Expand</a></span>

<br>Hardcore Stealth
<br>In Master of Shadows you&#x2019;re on your own, no more giant orc by your side...
<br>You&#x2019;re Styx after the heart of the world tree
<br>If this is your introduction to Styx He&#x2019;s a stealthy goblin and easily the best part of Of Orcs and Men
<br>Despite your initial thoughts that this game is just assassins creed with a goblin&#x2026; it&#x2019;s much more on the hitman meets dishonored side with the verticality of assassins creed and is easily the hardest stealth game I&#x2019;ve ever played&#x2026;
<br>|As the name suggests you have to master the shadows&#x2026;
<br>Enemies can still see and detect you as you move through the shadows and they&#x2019;ll even check hiding spots&#x2026;
<br>it&#x2019;s your job to find the best route through the 8 missions of this game..
<br>Each mission lasting easily 2-3 hours each because of how difficulty the stealth gameplay is&#x2026;
<br>You have at your disposal, 2 throwing knifes, throwable sand to put out torches and the ability to create a clone of yourself... getting to your objective is reliant on your ability to sneak past guards and distract them
<br>You can get into hand to hand combat, but it&#x2019;s hardly ever worth it as areas are crawling with enemies that will surround you and kill you while you&#x2019;re locked into a garbage combat system parrying 1-5 times to be able to kill your enemy&#x2026;
<br>The being locked in part is the worst&#x2026;
<br>you&#x2019;re able to roll away if you try hard enough.. But the camera stays locked on your alerted enemy trying to kill you... making it almost impossible to run most of the time&#x2026;
<br>Unfortunately the game also spoon feeds you abilities&#x2026;
<br>As you complete missions and side objectives within mission you&#x2019;re awarded skill points to buff your agility, stealth, and combat to name a few to be able to hold more items and do new assassinations&#x2026;
<br>You have to earn your way up to an air assassination which is annoying&#x2026; but it&#x2019;s the games way of teaching you the shadows... so slightly forgivable...
<br>The game also constantly introduces new enemies with new rules...
<br>some of them feel cheap though, to prevent spoilers ill just say by the end you&#x2019;ll be using your clone more than the shadows to distract and lure instead of just as a switch thrower like you&#x2019;ve been doing&#x2026;
<br>I wasn&#x2019;t a fan of the exploding skills or annoying beetles&#x2026; but I did appreciate the fact that they were always changing the gameplay making the game just as hard throughout your journey as it is from the start&#x2026; it never gets easy.. You never feel like you&#x2019;re a master assassin...
<br>constant vulnerability... which makes for very tense moments&#x2026;
<br>Completing these mission are genuinely satisfying because of this&#x2026;
<br>But sadly the 2nd half of the game is really just doing the first half of the game backwards this time with harder enemies which is a bit of a disappointment&#x2026; it felt like the game was dragging itself out just for the sake of it.. there&#x2019;s no shame in a game being 10 hours long&#x2026;
<br>Doubling your length be reusing levels just feels lazy
<br>And the game drags on for so long that your start to see massive flaws in the ai..
<br>They don&#x2019;t act natural... they seemingly always know where you are, just waiting for you to get into their line of sight to make you restart from a checkpoint&#x2026;
<br>you can&#x2019;t confuse them which breaks immersion and kind of makes you feel like you&#x2019;re getting lucky at times instead of outsmarting them&#x2026;
<br>Which brings me to the biggest issue this game has&#x2026;
<br>Its checkpoints and load times..
<br>You can save this game at any time... do it... don&#x2019;t rely on the games auto save because it&#x2019;s horrible and even corrupted on me in the final boss fight&#x2026;
<br>When you feel you&#x2019;ve made progress, save the game&#x2026;
<br>But since this game is so difficulty and since stealth games are so much about trial and error.. it&#x2019;s inexcusable to have load times as long as these are&#x2026;
<br>I&#x2019;m convinced half of my time was spent waiting for the game to load after messing up and dying&#x2026;
<br>Master of Shadows
<br>Is a really good and a really challenging stealth game&#x2026;
<br>But its clock in combat systems, magnet headed ai, repeat levels, and painfully long load times stop it from reaching the status of greatness&#x2026;
<br>But if you&#x2019;re a stealth fan definitely still play it.
<br>I give Styx:</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=6968470">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I had this game on my radar for a while mostly due to the fact that it looked good and featured a goblin like main character in a Thief like world. Didn&apos;t know too much about the gameplay before diving in but I&apos;ve seen mixed reviews. In the end I must admit I very much enjoyed the game despite some flaws and a bit hard difficulty level.
<br>
<br>Styx: Master of Shadows is a third person stealth game. Set in a world that reminds the one in the Thief series but a bit more fantasy and bright. But the general feel is pretty similar - at least for me.
<br>
<br>The story starts a bit slow and is a bit confusing at first. It&apos;s hard to make out exactly what&apos;s going on. But it comes around somewhere mid-game and when it starts making sense it starts to reel you in. And despite the rough start of &quot;ok, this one is not for the story&quot; I must admit it hooked me. Without giving anything away - you play as a goblin like creature trying to infiltrate Akenash tower in order to steal the heart of the tree. An amber producing tree. The amber in this world is a sort of drug and an extremely valuable thing. The story follows your journey through the tower while you seek to access it.
<br>
<br>The visuals are pretty nice. Levels are well designed with a multitude ways you can approach certain objectives. Sometimes you get to travel the same area twice and doing so from different starting points is a very unique experience not often found in other games.
<br>
<br>Audio layer is also well designed - the voice actors did pretty decent job and the soundtrack fits with the gameplay. Nothing breath taking but absolutely fine.
<br>
<br>One thing to note about the gameplay is that it&apos;s pretty hard. I&apos;ve struggled with first levels before figuring out there is quick save functionality which I would strongly advise to use. Without it - the auto-save spots are so rare that getting trough meant replaying up to half an hour of level progress. On the other hand learning the level layout made travelling through it all that much easier and satisfying. Even with the quick save - the game is still pretty challenging and though. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve achieved a &quot;no alarm&quot; or &quot;no kill&quot; or any other of the achievements for a single level of the game. It&apos;s not hard enough to discourage from playing though.
<br>
<br>The game gives at your disposal a set of abilities. You can upgrade them between missions through experience points. You get them by completing secondary objectives and getting achievements. From the lot the most notable are amber vision - which is sort of night vision with benefits, invisibility - though for painfully short time and clones - can be useful at times although didn&apos;t find all that much use for them. Overall they&apos;re a nice addition though I&apos;ve relied mostly on sneaking, moving between covers and quietly killing off guards.
<br>
<br>Aside from that you have to manage your consumables - you get two health potions, two amber bottles - which are used for the above abilities and two throwing knives - probably most useful thing in the game. You can replenish them between levels or sometimes pick up along the way though they&apos;re all pretty scarce commodity and thus so much more valuable.
<br>
<br>The game is fun. Although being very difficult it&apos;s really fun to play.
<br>
<br>It has some flaws as mentioned in the beginning - of which two are most note worthy. First is the ledge detection and jumping. It takes time getting used to it. It&apos;s not very polished and can lead to a lot of trouble while trying to perform a tricky jump. The second problem lies with AI. While the enemies behave quite good and pose a challenge - the NPCs are terrible. Most of what they do is stand and shout. Even if no one is coming and you&apos;re murdering one of them just in front of the other. Makes up for a silly moments.
<br>
<br>Overall I really did enjoy the game and would really recommend it to any stealth loving gamer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/styx-master-of-shadows/user-reviews?user_review_id=7360977">Expand</a></span>
