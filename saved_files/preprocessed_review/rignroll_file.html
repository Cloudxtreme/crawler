This game sucks compared to any other semi truck game. Why? Well, for one the graphics are terrible. I understand this isn&apos;t the newest game, nor is it a high income game, but come on, we don&apos;t need N64 block graphics. Second is the game play itself. The trucks don&apos;t mimic a truck for squat. Hell, the trailer doesn&apos;t even swing. It&apos;s like a single solid movement. The controls aren&apos;t listed if you buy this on steam so have fun figuring them all out, and even when you do, they make absolutely no sense. When you&apos;re driving down the highway, it&apos;s damn near impossible to keep the truck in the lane, which leads to multiple visits by the cops. (Yes, you can get pulled over and issued tickets in this game) Other things you can&apos;t do: You can&apos;t back up to the trailer itself, the game does it for you. Same goes for unloading the cargo, you don&apos;t control it. The shifting is completely out of whack, and anyone with any knowledge of trucks knows this.
<br>
<br>All in all, if you want a good semi truck game, go check out euro truck simulator. Million times better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rignroll/user-reviews?user_review_id=3487870">Expand</a></span>

Before I played it, I thought they just drove from one warehouse to the other lining their pockets with cash. But once I found out that every time they bump into something, drive slightly off the road, or go ten miles over the speed limit they have cops trying to run them down to arrest them, that changed everything. I know this game is supposed to be a simulator, and I&apos;m sure from time to time truckers do get arrested, especially coming back from Mexico, but did they really have to put that aspect into the game?
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played a few trucking simulators before and none of them had me getting ripped out of my cab, thrown to the hood of a car, and arrested for &quot;assaulting a police officer&quot;. Seriously, I got arrested for that. When the heck did I assault a police officer? I haven&apos;t even gotten out of my truck! And why the heck does it always look like it&apos;s raining on my windshield, even when it isn&apos;t? Ugh. Okay, fine, whatever, that doesn&apos;t sound SO bad, right? Okay, but since when do truckers have to compete with one another to get their load to the warehouse first so they can get paid? Yep, this game makes delivering cargo into a race to the finish line with three other hungry truckers. Oh, you want money for food and other living expenses? Better get here first! What the heck is this, the Hunger Games? But what else did I expect from a 1C Racing game? I should have known better.
<br>
<br>Aside from the ridiculousness though, this game has some decent views, not such awful graphics, and once you get it configured with a controller (which is a massive pain in the butt), it isn&apos;t a complete mess. But don&apos;t get me wrong, this game should be avoided. Stay far, far away from this game. And if you actually want a good trucking simulator, pick up a copy of Euro Truck Simulator 2, that game is amazing. Unless you wanna pretend that in this game you&apos;re smuggling around a truckload of drugs to make it more believable. But who wants to use their imagination? We bought the game specifically so that we didn&apos;t have to do that!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rignroll/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920754">Expand</a></span>

Yes, game, not quite a simulator. It could be named Need For Speed: Trucks. Although the graphics are definitely not the greatest, they look like the real world locations.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>-A pretty large scale map with OK graphics (it takes 45 minutes to drive from San Jose to Los Angeles, whereas in other truck games/sims like ATS, it would take 15-20 mins to drive the same distance).
<br>-Truck damage!
<br>-Cop chases! (An easy way to get the cops in your rear view mirror is trying to run random people off the road) The cop AI is not too dumb, when you fail to stop they speed up and attempt to stop you by brake checking you from the front.
<br>-Realistic road placement and good city density for the scale
<br>-About 9-10 trucks, a good number for this type of game
<br>-The awfully narrow angle camera CAN be zoomed out.
<br>-A nice variety of AI cars, and you can even choose how much traffic you want.
<br>-Lifelike AI; I forced a cop car to a different lane and the truck in that lane swerved to avoid the car.
<br>-HILARIOUS crashes, I once sideswiped a cop car and it flew into the oncoming side of the freeway, never to be seen again.
<br>Cons
<br>-If you thought this was a simulator, it&apos;s not QUITE one.
<br>-When you are scraping against a guardrail, the spark particles are so big it looks like fire.
<br>-Collision physics are a little wonky but they still work (when rear ending a normal AI car, their behaviour makes them seem unrealistically light, and when sideswiping cars, it looks like they are lagging really badly as if they were real players and had a high ping)
<br>
<br>If you like both truck simulators and Need For Speed, this game is a must buy. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rignroll/user-reviews?user_review_id=6516040">Expand</a></span>
