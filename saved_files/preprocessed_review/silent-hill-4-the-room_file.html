Not sure if I could say it&apos;s a great story but original at least Story 8/10  Music and sounds including voice acting are great, the music as always is excellent, the sounds right on and the voice acting is a huge improvement Sound 10/10  Controls and gameplay are fine too but they are really different and not in a good way, the gameplay is really awkward too and sometimes it just doesn&apos;t feel like a silent hill game Controls and gameplay 7/10 The graphics are fine and can look ok all maxed out in PC version, but the game doesn&apos;t really scare that much and the otherworld doesn&apos;t look all that great either, Graphics 9/10. FInal veredict 8/10 this game tried something new and it just felt like something totally different than a SH game, not a bad game at all just really different, the story was ok but strange and the fear factor was lacking alot but it was there too. Overall a good SH game but far from being the best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-4-the-room/user-reviews?user_review_id=5569054">Expand</a></span>

Soundtrack is great but audio is poorly utilized so it is barely recognizable. Visuals are a disgrace compared to the earlier Silent Hill games.  The horror elements have no meaning but are simply there to make you see horror. Rather replay an earlier Silent Hill games so you never have to witness this ****</span>

Oh yes, they screwed up the save feature, too. This is a Konami console port. Moral? NEVER buy a Konami port--they&apos;ve done this with their other games as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-4-the-room/user-reviews?user_review_id=70293">Expand</a></span>

That said, every other aspect is fantastic. Captivating story that takes its time to develop which leads to an engrossing experience. The combat is refined from the previous installments. A great game that any horror fan should play. Quite humorous that a majority of the complaints here are controls and story.
