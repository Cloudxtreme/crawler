It looks like a 2007 video game, the first ever Assassin&apos;s Creed looked better than this **** And the requirements to max it out are insane! With my Geforce GTX 980ti it uses all the video memory at 1080p Ultra settings but it looks like **** This is ridiculous!</span>

I dont usually play my games as soon as I get  them because there are always updates coming etc etc. I have dont this with all the newest AC games. Well after I heard there was a big update for Syn I went in to check it out and I have to say the game is beautiful looking and it pulled me right in before I knew it I was at level 3 ready to play memory 4 so I had to stop myself. I came here to leave my 2cents and after reading these reviews about how ugly the game is and how it looks bad all i have to say is if you have a cheap PC you will have a cheap looking game.  I have gtx 980ti, 32gb memory, Sandisk 980gb SSD drive, on a Asrock Z98 MB with i7-4790k, with Benq 120hz monitor and this runs beautifully. I will admit it is demanding I can not max out the graphics and keep good game play but its almost there. It is at a point where it looks beautiful and plays well. Everyone is so stuck on FPS? during my game my FPS is around 50FPS and I play with no stuttering or anything bad graphically. Stop watching the FPS and look at the game and how it is playing folks. Lower FPS does not necessarily mean bad gaming. In the end the game is working and playing beautifully. Like everything else in life you get what you pay for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=6020468">Expand</a></span>

A solid 9/10. No technical issues whatsoever throughout 40+ hours spent playing the game. In addition to the mentioned upsides, one gets two beautifully crafted protagonist characters with slightly different skillsets to use and an ability to extensively customize their looks and weapons of choice (besides the standard hidden blade). The only downside was a few cheesy side quest characters.

The quests are too repetitive and slow, its cool that you can be both boy or girl but who cares when you&apos;re doing the exact same thing over and over again</span>

I didn&apos;t really give a **** about any of the characters in the game; Jacob and evie frye were the only ones I cared about in the game, but the rest goes to **** the main villain in this game didn&apos;t seem that really...evil.. he did a couple **** up things in the game, but then again... so was everyone else... the main villain didn&apos;t really stand out from the rest and I didn&apos;t feel much a of reason to &quot;stop&quot; him when the whole city was pretty much jacked up. you don&apos;t really see your actions impact the game. by the end of the game, there are still people starving and dying in the streets, gang fights, child workers, etc. the children I liberated from a factory were still working there a couple missions later! wtf! overall, a fair game at best, with fun combat. I really did wish they gave me the option to use fists as a weapon again...combat styles are limited in this game compared to other assassin&apos;s creed games.
<br>
<br>what killed the game for me was...the missions... the missions are simply just...not fun. tailing people was not fun. kidnapping gang members was not fun. taxi driving people to destinations was not fun. I had to force myself to play through some missions because they were so un-fun. there are a couple varied missions here and there which are fun. most missions are boring, dull, repetitive, unadventurous, unsurprising, missions.
<br>
<br>I had to force myself through the game, just to see the ending. the game&apos;s only saving grace is the fun combat, the somewhat decent story, and upgrading your character&apos;s gear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5948621">Expand</a></span>

I like the story better here however since it includes a male and female protagonist, but it still falls short of AC3 by a country mile. As for the game on a whole i&apos;d give this a 7, however the poor port forces me to give it a 6. Clearly people have not learnt from most games ported poorly to PC this year.</span>

But somehow I ended up playing Unity for ~30 hrs once it had been &apos;fixed.&apos; I told myself I was done with the series but here I am with just shy of 16 hours on record. My experience thus far as been mixed.
<br>
<br>Assassin&apos;s Creed Syndicate has the best ambient feel of the franchise yet. London is full of people and the city feels alive with the hustle and bustle of the time. However, this seems to be the second year straight for poor PC ports. While I do not have the &quot;recommended&quot; hardware specs (have you seen them? Jesus) I easily meet the minimum requirements and come close to hitting the recommended specs as well. I&apos;m not on a super computer; I have a decent machine with a GeForce GTX 760, Intel i5-3570K @ 3.40GHz, with 16 GB RAM, and I struggle to run this.
<br>
<br>While the story has been decent so far I do find myself really loving the Frye twins, in fact I haven&apos;t liked the character this much since Ezio. I want to say the gameplay (ie. how you traverse the map, and interact with walls during free-running, etc.) has improved but only marginally. The &quot;hook shot&quot; (because Zelda) is a huge improvement for getting around London and hope to see more of this in future games.
<br>
<br>What constantly baffles me is the terrible ports for PC games. And you would think after Unity they would learn their lesson. Back to the graphics, where do I begin? Forgive my less than technical jargon here as I was not a C.S. major at university. Nothing is smooth, the lines are so jagged. Textures lag on buildings and the ground even as you approach. My graphics card (2gb of dedicated ram) is completely used when I&apos;m running this, which is fine, I get that it&apos;s demanding, but come on! Using the recommended settings provided by the NVIDIA GeForce Experience still yields a less than optimal gameplay experience.
<br>
<br>Unless you&apos;re a huge fan of the series, or have a serious gaming PC, I cannot recommend this game in the current state nor at the current price. (Why can&apos;t PC get a decent port this year?)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5854455">Expand</a></span>

THIS GAME IS FULL PRICE! And still it has both season pass and **** piece of **** microtransactions. With real money you can buy resource and IN-GAME money. I think i know why it is this way, it&apos;s because ubisoft has a good game development team, but when the game is done they look at it and think &apos;&apos;Wow we just made a descent game, what should we do now?, Oh right put microtransactions in it and a season pass&apos;&apos; The season pass gives you OVERPOWERED gear too, way too overpowered. You need to be lvl 7 to equip and it&apos;s quality is the best ones in the game if you upgrade it.
<br>THE ACTUAL GAME: 7/10 It is a good game.
<br>THE BULL**** **** PUT IN THE GAME: 0/10, **** you all!
<br>The only reason i buy these games is because i love the assassin&apos;s creed franchise, so please ubisoft, just please don&apos;t kill it with your greedy **** minds!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5873371">Expand</a></span>

Now, I have played Unity on PS4, and the choppy framerate and huge pop-ins issue, along with very imprecise controls, made the game almost unplayable to me.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t judge exactly how much Syndicate improves on that, because I am playing this on the PC, not PS4. The game runs well on a GTX 980 Ti with max settings, but then again, it&apos;s the top of the line video card. The graphics look pretty good, although they are sometimes dull and still not free of pop-ins issues. London feels alive and I think they have captured the vibe of those times well enough. I have to admit this is the only reason I still play AC games, the possibility of seeing various cities at various important periods in history (well, as long as the producers do their historical research well enough).
<br>
<br>The controls continue to be a hassle to work with.. I appreciate that they&apos;ve implemented the &quot;free run up&quot; and &quot;free run down&quot; mechanics, to maybe help a little with navigating the world, but the control is still imprecise and more often than not, you are fighting against it.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t have much to say about the story &amp; characters. I don&apos;t feel very connected to the siblings and I often feel like this has been done just because it worked really well in GTA V... The implementation is far from the beautiful way this is being handled in GTA.. Anyway, I realise that out of the whole AC series, I only cared for Ezio&apos;s story, especially the way it was done in AC2.
<br>
<br>My main gripe is actually with the gameplay. Due to bad controls, and the way your character seems to have less ways to actually be a GHOST ASSASSIN, I feel like the whole game is mainly played as a fighting game. Not that AC ever excelled at stealth assassinations, but I just can&apos;t play this game in a stealthy manner. The missions seem to always turn into a &quot;f.. this, I&apos;m killing everybody&quot; situation.
<br>
<br>Combat is clunky and boring, the only thing I find satisfying about it are the multi-kill animations, where you can execute several &quot;near death&quot; enemies instantly, in a spectacular fashion. Animations are kinda stiff though.
<br>
<br>All in all, this is probably the last AC game I&apos;ll play. Thankfully, I got it for free in the &quot;Bullets or Blades&quot; promotion with GTX cards... Overall, I think the game deserves a 6/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5813510">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I started playing this game feeling like Ubisoft was moving in the right direction in the aftermath of Unity. That was until I reached England.
<br>
<br>While the story is interesting enough for me to play through it, Ubisoft has made it so that you will spend maybe about 20% of your time on the game playing the story, 30% on some arbitrary side missions, and 50% collecting the sheer amount of random collectible scattered about England. But what makes it incredibly annoying is that these collectibles are pointless to the story. Just busy work to ensure that you don&apos;t realize the game is incredibly short.
<br>
<br>And while they offer maps to ensure you don&apos;t miss the collectibles (which if you&apos;re a completionist like myself, you will want those), they made sure that 2 collectibles - i.e the secrets of London and random &quot;helix glitches&quot; - do not have maps, so you need to come across them by chance or spend a torturous amount of time on game guides looking at maps. And the helixes are rather pointless - just in game money or Intel to give you hints as to what the Templars are doing in the present, but I&apos;m sure these hints that will go completely forgotten about after this game. Its kind of like a &quot;don&apos;t forget! these 2 factions are still fighting it out in the present - here&apos;s info on it!&quot; but then you&apos;ll never hear about it again and I know this because they did the same bloody thing in Unity
<br>
<br>The completionist in me is raging and tearing for me to finish every. single. collectible. But I&apos;m so done with it. I just don&apos;t want to and its annoying because there&apos;s a part of me that DOES want to but I&apos;m sitting here thinking &quot;for me to enjoy doing this i need to put on something to watch&quot;. Imagine that. For me to enjoy an aspect of the game, I need a show playing in the background so as to not kill myself from the absolute tediousness of collecting.
<br>
<br>As someone who&apos;s played the AC series since the first game, it&apos;s actually kind of sad that I&apos;ve come to this point. I really REALLY wanted to like Syndicate but Ubisoft, it seems, is just offering methods of distraction before they can bleed me of another 80$-90$ next year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5859640">Expand</a></span>

<br>I received it via a gift, hopefully, I don&apos;t spend my money on this version.
<br>Don&apos;t waste your money and return to the unity, it&apos;s just a &quot;London DLC&quot;, beautiful DLC, but nothing new

The overall graphic result of that effort is spotless, but with a flat palette. Vista shots are rare and the environment quickly becomes repetative and a bit boring with such a narrow color palette. Gameplay can be summed up as a flood of frustration. Gameplay is also really repetative. Previous installations had repeating objectives, and that is swapped with repeating gameplay and a repearing reminder of the poor controls. With a game that designs its gameplay around fluidity of movement and the controls of your character, its an obvious problem when those two are among the weakest parts of the game and source of frustration. Hard to understand why Ubisoft chose to release the game with such major flaws in gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5953541">Expand</a></span>

London is extremely well done with lots of water effects and it currently runs buttery smooth on my PC.

<br>Total: 6/10. -2 for having the worst gameplay design in the entire assassin&apos;s creed series.
<br>
<br>Gameplay problems: it has one of the most restrictive mechanic in an AC game, you can&apos;t jump when you want. You can only jump when there is somewhere to land. What this does is: you can&apos;t jump to your death. You can&apos;t make a dangerous jump to trade in your health for some distance or save time. You can&apos;t jump off most roofs. A game that doesn&apos;t allow you to fail is just a bad game.
<br>
<br>It has one of the worst parkor in the series. Running is very slow and flows poorly. In addition, the controls are very unintuitive, alot of time you have to make several attempts to perform a simple maneuver like drop down the ledge or climb up that waist high ledge.
<br>
<br>It has one of the worst combat in the series, you repeatedly press one button and occasionally press the counter button when you see an enemy hp bar flash yellow. The counter window is HUGE, as long as the counter button is pressed once during the yellow flash, no matter what other buttons you press after or anything else you do, you&apos;ll still counter.
<br>
<br>And that is one of the biggest problem in the game: the game play, AC 3 had one of the worst story in the series but it was still fun because of the gameplay. Syndicate takes all the progress and lessons learn from previous series and unlearn them all.
<br>
<br>It will give you one of the most restrictive feeling you ever had in a sandbox game, do NOT buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5840950">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I really do not know why people are so much complaining about the graphics.
<br>Indeed, the graphics of Unity looked better but they still look quite nice. I think the industrial settings makes it look a little bit less bright than the previous episodes. Frame rates are very good with a I5-6400 and GTX970 card on 1080p. In my opinion, UbiSoft did a good job by downgrading the graphics a bit so the game can run smoothly. And you only have to take a look at Fallout 4 to see that graphics do not make a great game....
<br>
<br>The story so far (after about 10 hours) is ok but not a great one. It is nice to play with two characters.
<br>I liked Evy a bit more because of the stealthy play type..
<br>
<br>Gameplay is good. Free running is better than in Unity. Fighting is a little bit too much of button bashing. The finish moves are very nice! The side missions are nice with fun and recognizable characters. Looking for chests etc. is still repetitive however...
<br>
<br>If you enjoyed the previous Assassins Creed games, I think you will enjoy this one too if you can look beyond the &quot;dirty look&quot; of the industrial age.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5822361">Expand</a></span>

<br>The whole game is way too flashy and doesn&apos;t really impress any true gamer. It gets boring right from the start.
<br>It feels like it was purposely made for casuals and kids who are easily impressed by CGI trailers.
<br>There is a trend nowadays and it goes like this: the bigger the marketing campaign and the more hype it creates, the more the game is gonna suck.
<br>It has literally become the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; of Ubisoft.

<br>
<br>When I look at Unity now and Syndicate.. I can tell only one thing about this game: HUGE step backwards.
<br>Everything was (Literally) downgraded and optimization is still bad.
<br>
<br>Graphics - Downgraded, Despite running this game on High settings (No Gameworks which slaughter FPS even on GTX Titan) it looks far worse than Unity or any other AAA game that came out in previous years, hell even dated Crysis 1 which is 8+ years old looks far better than Syndicate maxed out on PC.
<br>
<br>I see this only this way; Ubisoft desperately tried to pump as much performance as possible at a cost of the graphics which resulted in; Terrible distant textures, terrible render distance, terrible NPC models.
<br>
<br>Here are example how bad this game looks on High settings with FXAA:
<br>
<br>Example 1: http://i.imgur.com/rpmcsL1.jpg
<br>Example 2: http://i.imgur.com/IKSlPof.jpg
<br>Example 3: http://i.imgur.com/KJDNkDM.jpg (Notice: NPC&apos;s in front on the left side, closest carriage textures, street textures right in front of the carriage)
<br>
<br>The best part of this? Those &quot;High&quot; textures require 4GB Vram according to Ubisoft.
<br>
<br>NPC Density - Downgraded.
<br>
<br>Open World Enviroment - Downgraded, One thing I loved in Unity was the freedom to move between one buildings interior to another, in Syndicate almost all of this is gone.
<br>
<br>Character customization - This part of the game was also heavily downgraded, it doesn&apos;t even have 50% of customization content that Unity had.
<br>
<br>OPTIMIZATION - It&apos;s way better than Unity and a lot less buggy than Unity (In around 10 hours in-game time I only had 2 minor bugs that fixed themselves almost instantly) but this game still leaves a lot to desire.
<br>Despite being heavily downgraded prior to Unity in order to run better, IT DOES NOT.
<br>FPS drops are still present here and there (Especially in cutscenes where they tend to drop to 22-29 FPS for no particular reason) riding a carriage at very high speed is the worst idea you could possibly get; game tends to do not load another part of map fast enough which results in 1-2s freezes, FPS drops when sitting on top of moving train.

<br>Great engine, Anvil Improved a lot - great lighting ,reflection ,weather and  day night circles - rope/hook launcher is fun and useful - jumping  between moving vehicles ,carts and boats  seems fun. Victorian London is Pictured well - the historical research team done a tremendous job - as usual...
<br>
<br>The Bad :
<br>-----------------------
<br>Though well portrayed , London city is ugly, grimy and disgusting . You may argue that it&apos;s pictured as it was,  , but we players come to play for some good times - the sad dull looking London only fells depressive  - Lack of color and low res /dull textures everywhere. Devs should have chosen some different city on a different timeline .
<br>The new style of  Key mapping which is introduced in Unity is going in a totally wrong direction. I think the black flag had &quot;last good likable control system&quot;.
<br>The story - intro feels plain flat -- too flat .
<br>
<br>The Ugly :
<br>---------------------
<br>Gameplay is boring and repetitive - Weapons and Character customization reduced  to oblivion . Batman type button mashing combat -- like it&apos;s designed for two year olds. Sometimes you need to hit an enemy ( read &quot;hit the attack button&quot; ) 20 times before they goes down. Combat system took a major step backwards . Everything feels scripted. Stealth system is nerfed  . Stealth_mode_switching_animation (Hat --&gt; Hood ) is laughable .  And this games System Requirements are ridiculous at best - though it runs somewhat better than unity.
<br>
<br>Last Words:
<br>-------------------------------
<br>It&apos;s a disappointment seeing such good engine capabilities went to vain.  Devs need to break the yearly release cycle and take time to address all gameplay issues - A new combat system (PoP:WW ? anyone?)  and improved button mapping should be their topmost priority.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5805120">Expand</a></span>

Ubisoft took an extra bit of time to release the PC port but it was all for nought as the port is sub-par and does not stand up to games like the Witcher 3. After re-dedicating itself to the PC platform one again this year, Ubisoft has not lived up to its promise. Assassins&apos;s Creed Syndicate is just another forgettable entry into a series and it certainly is not worth the price tag. I recommend you pick it up a little later when its had a price cut.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5805726">Expand</a></span>

First off I should say that I have never played an Assassin&apos;s Creed game and had never planned to until I got this game for free. Okay, the good: The graphics, art design, and atmosphere are really spectacular and definitely qualify as next-gen or whatever term we&apos;re using these days. The story is beyond me because I&apos;ve never played an assassin&apos;s Creed game so it feels like watching the latest season of a long running TV show on its last legs and it really is not engaging for me in the slightest. Okay, the bad: The controls in this game are so bad, this may be the first game I uninstall without playing it all the way through. Oh, you want to aim? Too bad! The game does that for you, poorly. Oh, you want to jump? Screw you idiot, I&apos;m going to grapple this wall and not let go until your head explodes in a mist of rage, skull, blood and viscera. Oh, you wanted to jump off this building to escape? Too bad! You&apos;re going to dangle helplessly jamming the E button while the idiot AI shoots you and you fall to your death. This game is so bad I think it really reveals how corrupt the gaming review industry has become. Screw those sexist gamergaters, let&apos;s go after the reviewers accepting bribes to get the hapless consumer to buy this awful, awful game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5910746">Expand</a></span>

The combat style is annoying and the missions are all the same stuff. After 10 hours of gameplay I am already bored.</span>

Beautiful visuals - Victorian London is really really well made. the lighting effects are superb -Yesterday , while playing - I remember I was in an ally - sunny weather , suddenly it started raining - the sun rays and rain dropping looked so beautiful in that ally - I just stood there for minutes .
<br>2. Rope launcher attachment is nice.
<br>3. You can cross Thames without getting your foot wet . :P
<br>
<br>Now Cons :
<br>---------------------
<br>1. Though well made -Victorian London is (was) an utterly ugly ugly ugly  city.
<br>2. Combat is really really unsatisfying . It&apos;s becoming more and more like batman style button mash combat (Which I absolutely hate) . For a couple of weeks I was playing old assassins creed games - And combat is so so so much better there - lot&apos;s of option to choose from . And since Combat is such a big part is assassins creed - the whole game feels boring and repetitive after a while.
<br>3.  Lack of choice of weapons.
<br>4. Story  : Not interesting at all.
<br>5. Gameplay : Beautiful visuals doesn&apos;t makes a great game - gameplay does - and Syndicate failed miserably is this aspect .
<br>6. System requirement and performance : Though better performing than unity - this games V-RAM Requirements are ridiculous.
<br>----------------TLDR--------------------------
<br>Good graphics wasted creating an ugly city. Combat and gameplay boring and repetitive. Uninteresting story.
<br>Verdict : FLOP - Biggest disappointment of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5803957">Expand</a></span>

Turning AC into and online shopping type game has really made it stale. We had a great layered approach to the games in the past now its just bash and dash with in game purchasing to boost the bash..
<br>
<br>We have gone from multi faceted beautiful games from Ubisoft to a bland cheese sandwich. My guess is they just cant create those games anymore, when you employ monkeys you get peanuts.
<br>
<br>Really unhappy but we as consumers can do NOTHING except not buy the games, cant see that happening as Ubisoft tempt us with a promise of the past but deliver dust.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5840883">Expand</a></span>

<br>that.
<br>the mechanics of the game has changed a bit. the combat is much for faster and rhythmical and feels good. bugs that happens during combat has been decreased to.
<br>the side missions which is about taking back London from the blighters, might feel repetitive but still fun to play. the main assassination missions are pretty big, and also very fun.
<br>oh yeah and the rope launcher. it&apos;s great.
<br>overall. not a masterpiece. but decent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5807051">Expand</a></span>

If you want to play it at low settings it runs well and smoothly but graphics is ugly. If you want to play it at high settings prepare to buy a Titan X with 12GB Vram because your GTX 980ti won&apos;t be enough. Thanks Ubisoft for having cheated pc gamers again!</span>

In order to make it run with older graphics cards you ruined its graphics, you eliminated lots and lots of details. I think it&apos;s not a good thing. As for the gameplay the game is uninspired and flat. No emotional feelings in playing it at all.</span>

                                        <span>Ubisoft sacrificed graphics quality in the name of non-sense framerate. I have never seen such ugly textures in an Assassin&apos;s Creed game before. Even AC Brotherhood looked better with my Geforce GTX 260 four years ago! AC Syndicate also requires you lot of graphics card memory to run at high settings and what you get is lower than any other game that you can play this year.</span>

<br>the pc port is way better than unity in term of perfomance i didnt have any stuttering or fps dropped below the 20s it played very smoothly but the physics seems to be capped at 30fps which makes the gameplay seem slow no matter what fps u r running on.
<br>the graphics are meh inferior to unity but when i add SweetFx with increased LumaSharpen it looks way better, but seriously this game will take up to 8gb of VRAM if you want to run it at High what the hell i dont know if it&apos;s the engine &amp; game design fault or AMD &amp; Nvidia Fault for making us stuck on the same VRAM sizes for years now, im no expert im certainly going to search in how games use vram.
<br>the combat &amp; the ai are terrible, &amp; there&apos;s only 3 types of weapons which none of them are swords or axes or any **** useful weapons you&apos;d expect to find in ac game
<br>the point is this franchise is getting worse every sequel
<br>by the way i downloaded the pirated copy, i will keep doing so to bad games like this i hope this game sell poorly, if the next ac game is still bad i will not even bother downloading the pirated copy in the 1st place
<br>i still didnt complete the game &amp; i wont complete it cuz i lost interest</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5805034">Expand</a></span>

Absolutely nothing. The same people who constantly complain about a game&apos;s graphics not being good enough are still complaining that the graphics aren&apos;t good enough. Meanwhile, those that play the game for the actual gameplay and story are left out in the cold or facing the need to spend a thousand dollars on a new computer or, at best, half a grand on a new graphics card.
<br>
<br>My advice to Ubisoft, stop chasing the approval of players that care more about graphics than actually playing the game and, perhaps more importantly, stop incorporating NVIDIA&apos;s new technologies if you aren&apos;t going to provide an ability to disable them. There is no reason a person should have to drop 600+ dollars on a new graphics card when the graphics of the previous Assassin&apos;s Creed games were completely sufficient to tell the story and provide the game&apos;s standard gameplay elements.
<br>
<br>In short, graphics are the least important part of making a good game. Stop focusing so much on them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5812511">Expand</a></span>

He asks me to fetch for him today&apos;s paper, even though the newsboy is 10 meters away. Alright... I go there, and suddenly someone steals a (one, single, solitary) newspaper from the guy. So the game tells me to tackle him. Okay, although I could&apos;ve just picked up one of the 100 other newspapers, but whatever, I oblige in the game&apos;s boring and already overused mechanic of &quot;run after someone and tackle them&quot;. So I run after the guy, thinking I could catch him... but oh, no.no.no, tells me the game, you won&apos;t catch him until we allow you to catch him at this scripted pre-determined location. You ran ahead of him and cut him off? Really? Then we&apos;ll just disable the tackle button for a moment. We told you very clearly, you won&apos;t catch him unt..... &quot;Desynchronized: The Target Died&quot;. Oops... it appears, dear player, that our game bugged out for a moment, and you&apos;ll have to do it all over again, even though, you did kind of catch the guy, if we would&apos;ve allowed it.
<br>
<br>So I restart 3 times because the mission&apos;s scripted sections involved some carriages going off the road and they kept killing the guy I was supposed to follow aroun... I mean catch. Then I finally arrive at the scripted event where I&apos;m supposed to tackle the chap. It turns out that the guy stops on the train tracks for no reason at all, and a train is going to hit him in 10 seconds, and I&apos;m supposed to tackle him out of the way. Even though he ran a goddamn mile perfectly fine before and could&apos;ve easily walked, at a slow pace, out of the way of train on his own.
<br>
<br>So after I tackle him I find out what this was all about. The guy had in his possession a caricature of Darwin as an ape.
<br>
<br>And then the game crashed.

<br>F**k this game. Just f**k this game. And f**k Ubisoft. F**k everything and everyone involved in this game.

<br>
<br>graphics
<br>somehow this game manages to outdo the disastrous batman: arkham knight in  requirements, even on lowest settings it sucks out more of my PC than fallout 4 or the witcher 3 on high settings. that said, i could play it and even on the lowest settings you could functionally see and recognize anything of importance.
<br>
<br>difficulty
<br>assassins creed has been ridiculously easy since they introduced ranged silenced weapons.
<br>
<br>innovation
<br>none
<br>
<br>buy if:
<br>you need something do to but you don&apos;t care what or really like grinding for collectibles, upgrades and xp</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5805693">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is repetitive and not very engaging. The only advantage is that it runs better than Unity and with fewer bugs.
<br>
<br>Detail:
<br>You play as Jacob and Evie Frye, twin brothers in the Assassin Order that decide to go to Victorian London in 1868 - Jacob simply wants to kill every Templar and clear the city of the Blighters while Evie is more interested in finding the Piece of Eden and prevent the Templars from having it it. Supposedly Jacob is more combat thirsty and Evie more stealth oriented, but there&apos;s actually only 3 unique perks to each of them, and only Evie&apos;s camouflage perk (go invisible while standing for about 2 secs) is really noticeable. While you can do side activities with either of them, main story missions are locked to either Jacob or Evie. Also, I found it baffling that some Jacob missions&apos; optional objectives involved stealth, while Evie could kill everyone with no penalty - so what&apos;s the point of making a character supposedly more combat focused, and another more stealth focus?
<br>
<br>There&apos;s an overall feeling of &quot;quantity over quality&quot;, superficiality, shallowness to the open-world and its characters, events and missions. There&apos;s a million collectibles lying about, London is huge, but it feels populated rather than &quot;alive&quot;. Supposedly there&apos;s background to the Conquest Activities that involve minor characters with a description in the database, but their description is so short and doing said activities them feels so inconsequential that you don&apos;t really care. Also, you do one the Conquest Activities, you&apos;ve seen them all, really, and there&apos;s dozens of them. The grapling hook looks cool, but you&apos;ll realize the real reason you use it is that you want to get about and get things done as fast as possible, since there&apos;s little story and value to be had from them, except money and XP. There&apos;s hardly any crossing between the missions and historical events and the cameo appearances of Darwin, Dickens, Marx, etc. are little more than that, their missions boil down to the same elements.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is the same of Unity, except for the addition of the grappling hook and the removal of the ability to distract guards with objects you can pick up. In the combat department, I feel like it&apos;s even easier, even with the fact you have weaker melee weapons (no swords, just canes, knuckles, knives) and with the addition of enemies&apos; ability to block, which you can simply use the &quot;stun&quot; button to counter it. I never felt like it was actually really helpful and &quot;cool&quot; to go stealth or non-lethal, mostly it was less hassle just to go in, kill everyone in combat and get to my objective. I hardly get the feeling I am an assassin, rather I felt like being a murderer. There&apos;s only a few instances that you&apos;ll want to kill a few enemies stealthily, in particular when you need to kidnap one enemy alive. Unless you don&apos;t care, since that is optional... Other than that you can pretty much just wreck and murder about it London with wild abandon without consequences other than alerting police and enemies nearby, that you can promptly kill. Civilians&apos; reaction is mostly to scatter, if even that, but don&apos;t call the police. You can go on roofs and kill dozens of enemies on the ground with throwing knives right in front of each other, but they&apos;ll just look to the dead bodies wondering what happened... Oh, and the introduction of carriages and riding them is hilarious, they take little damage, horses don&apos;t mind collisions at all, you can drift around corners and pretty much lay untold wreckage in London like it&apos;s an everyday commonplace thing. The main story missions are just a minor step-up in mechanics and settings than the optional ones. Murder mysteries are PS4 time-exclusives, and co-op and heist missions are missing from Unity, and those were some of the best actual missions in Unity.
<br>
<br>The story is not very rich, there&apos;s not a lot of characters or character development. Who are the Assassins, 3 guys in London? The main antagonist mostly sits about the whole game, philosophizing, until you fight him in the last mission. The story dances around conflict between Evie&apos;s and Jacob&apos;s different methods on how to accomplish Assassins&apos; goals, but there&apos;s little actual development of that, you just keep on playing. There&apos;s hardly any memorable moments, like in Unity&apos;s Versailles Ball, Notre Dame assassination, hot air balloon... Historical themes introduced like child labor, votes for women, working class vs high society are just superficially addressed, with little more than mentioning them here and there while you play the same mission types over and over.
<br>
<br>I suppose I should mention that the game looks and sounds impressive, but that&apos;s it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=6021747">Expand</a></span>

Some **** cutscene&apos;s that try to make you care, a story about stopping such and such from doing such and such. It&apos;s a joke. The entire Assassins creed series has been about taking money off suckers, not making good games, something I realized about after my millionth bloody hour of climbing walls and stabbing people.
<br>Who&apos;s doing what this time? Who cares? It&apos;s like ad-libs, change the names, the places, the time period, and feed us back the exact same game they&apos;ve given us what, nearly a dozen times already.
<br>To boot, this game lacks even the tantalizing qualities that made me even somewhat interested in Black Flag, it looks like crap, it runs like crap, it&apos;s crap
<br>As a person who plays every released title, this deserves to be singled out for one of the worst in 2015.

<br>Graphically amazing and well voice acted. Nice story and cool interesting characters and it has even better side quests than the ones before. I Totally recommend this and you have to give it a chance because they did well.</span>

<br>DISCLAIMER: This is my first AC game ever. Keep that in mind while reading this review
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>AC: Syndicate throws you right in the middle of the industrial revolution. It covers the story of Jacob and Evie Frye, two sibling assassins that work together yet they have different methods, ideologies and goals. The both have interesting personalities (especially Jacob) making it the average story more enjoyable. Evie leans towards stealth and planning every move while Jacob is more of an anarchist that relies on brutal force to get his way. The story isn&#x2019;t the highlight of this game, it&#x2019;s not bad at all, but it&#x2019;s also nothing to brag about so I won&#x2019;t dwell on it at all.
<br>
<br>The Positives:
<br>AC: Syndicate is great stealth game, but it&#x2019;s also a great action/adventure game as well. Mechanics like the zip line and kidnapping impressed me the most. The skill tree was also very diverse and useful. The game has a great sense of freedom making you able to do whatever you feel like. The open world is simply astonishing; it&#x2019;s as if the developers used to live in that era. The building look wonderful and so does the scenery. It&#x2019;s just splendid.
<br>The stealth aspect revolves around the use of Eagle Vision to spot enemies through walls and mark them on the map before picking them off one by one. Basic stealth mechanics (i.e. whistling to attract enemies) are present in the game. You can hide in haystacks and cloakrooms to prevent detection and best of all kidnap enemies to access to restricted areas without drawing attention. You can perform hanging ledge, death from above, zip line, double and regular assassinations on enemies. You can also use the wide array of gadgets at your disposal like throwing knives smoke bombs and best of all the hallucinogenic darts to be as efficient as possible.
<br>The action sections are just as fun in the game. The hand to hand combat is very robust and well done, stringing different combos, using gadgets and performing multi takedowns is a blast. The carriage battles with the opposing gang/Templars are a ton of fun. You can recruit some of your own gang members to follow you and provide protection which is extremely enjoyable.
<br>
<br>The Negatives:
<br>The parkour in this game was a definite let down; I was expecting more from a game that requires so much of it. There is no sense of freedom in it and I my character was constantly jumping to the wrong platform, it was a very tedious issue.
<br>The AI of the enemies is average at best, often laughable. I expected more of a challenge from the game and was disappointed to find none. I wish there was an option to adjust the difficulty.
<br>The fact that both Jacob and Evie have the same skill tree with just 3 perks changed is a huge let down. But that&#x2019;s the penalty of having a one year development cycle for your game.
<br>The game suffers from some bugs and glitches that affect it negatively but don&#x2019;t break it, though I did experience the occasional crash it wasn&#x2019;t a menace. The optimization could have been a lot better. I see no reason why 4Gbs of Vram, 8Gbs of ram, and 3.4 Hz of processing power was quite a ways away from maxing this game out at 1080p 60FPS, but I digress.
<br>
<br>Final Verdict:
<br>This game is an absolute blast. Despite the technical issues and the subpar story, I had so much fun with it and I can confidently recommend it to anyone who&#x2019;s interested in this kind of game. If I had to give it a score it would get a nice 9/10. It&#x2019;s absolutely worth a buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=6015447">Expand</a></span>

Now that I&apos;ve completed the game, I can honestly say that this is the best AC so far in my opinion for number of reasons. Firstly, devs now finally realize that sandbox levels are the way to go with AC, and they have made the stealth mechanics fast paced and less frustrating from the previous games. You have number of methods to dispatch your enemy and all of the mechanics are cool. The setting is very immersive and possibly my favorite one in the series. The characters are all memorable and show wide range of emotions from the emotionally disturbed past protagonists. Finally, the game is just a blast - there are plenty of side missions and all are fun, and the story missions are all varied and offer player freedom. I think this game is the biggest surprise of 2015 for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=6025372">Expand</a></span>

<br>La historia no me llama nada, y han elegido una &#xE9;poca muy ..... para hacer un Assassin&apos;s Creed.
<br>En este Assassin&apos;s Creed no existe ninguna necesidad de escalar por los edificios para ir a ninguna parte, ya que si te quieres desplazar puedes ir en el tren o en un maravilloso carruaje que, adem&#xE1;s, no puedes conducir por la derecha porque est&#xE1;s en Londres jejj. Adem&#xE1;s que el juego no est&#xE1; hecho para ir entre edificios, ya que hay una distancia de 46 millas entre edificio y edificio.
<br>Adem&#xE1;s no entiendo que tiene que ver el credo con peleas callejeras entre bandas. Esto es un Assassin&apos;s Creed, no es The Warriors.
<br>En fin, repetitivo, m&#xE1;s aburrido que irte a una casa de campo donde no hay internet y apenas tienes se&#xF1;al, y adem&#xE1;s muy simple.
<br>Si quieres jugar a un Assassin&apos;s Creed  recomiendo el 2 y la Hermandad, que son muy buenos y MIS favoritos. (El 1 tambi&#xE9;n me gust&#xF3; m&#xE1;s que nada por la ubicaci&#xF3;n y la &#xE9;poca aunque era bastante repetitivo) Un saludo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=6294417">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+ Graphics and animations are top quality (on GTX 970 never dropped below 60fps on very high/FXAA)
<br>+ Enviroment detail, London looks beatiful and feels alive
<br>+ Characters are well-written and feel more alive than ever (I especially liked the characters based on their real-life counterparts)
<br>+ New mission types and especially racing with the horse carriages is surprisingly fun
<br>
<br>- Overall lack of polish in many areas. Dead NPCs twitching on the floor or floating around, animations or movement bugging or out of place and once HUD disappearead and I ended up having to reboot the game. These kind of break immersion, but nothing game-breaking
<br>- System requirements are high because of the new game engine, and there is still some texture-popping and some silly things such as cloth physics being locked to 30fps, witch you can fix by editing the .ini file)
<br>- There are some improvements to the parkour-system, but you still sometimes get frustrated when trying to simply get through a window and you end out launching yourself on top of a tower with the grappling hook
<br>
<br>If you are a fan of Assassin&apos;s Creed games you wont be disappointed, the gameplay is still the same (wether you think it&apos;s good or bad) and the story and characters are well-written. London is tons of fun to explore and the main characters are one ofthe best in the series. If only they had polished it properly and got rid of the few bugs, it would be a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=6340310">Expand</a></span>

The game constantly freezes and plays like crap compared to every other game I play on my system.   The game is totally unoptimized for the PC.   Add to that the lame, disjointed story and the ridiculously repetitive side missions and you would be wise to skip this embarrassment of a game.</span>

I can only run it at medium settings with my GTX 780 which has 3GB of memory. This is unacceptable for a game that has worse visuals than AC Unity.</span>

                                        <span>London looks disgusting and flat in this cheap PC port. I bought the game today and after spending 8 hours on it I&apos;m absolutely let down. How could Ubisoft downgrade its graphics to such a rubbish? This is intolerable for a game published in 2015. Moreover, the game is boring and uninspired. The quests are not involving, you do always the same things.</span>

Although, I still believe Ubisoft should give the series a couple of years off! The games is demanding you need a very decent hardware to unlock its potential. Runs great on my R9 290x few nods down from maxed out!</span>

<br>The Bad:</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The Good: The gameplay in AC:S is significantly improved over its recent predecessor games. The developers have managed to keep the overall feel of the Assassin&apos;s Creed series while simultaneously adding enough new gameplay features to keep the game fun. I found combat in this game, for example, to be pretty enjoyable. The voice acting is decent and the graphics were good.
<br>
<br>The Bad: Everything else about the game is pretty bad. Although it performs out of the box better than AC:U did, it&apos;s still pretty choppy on high settings, even on high end computers. Moreover, the game is buggy (crashes or locks up frequently) and the controls are still garbage. The storyline is mediocre and the characters aren&apos;t well developed.
<br>
<br>The Really Bad: What I find most obnoxious about this game and what&apos;s probably permanently driven me away from the series is the way the developers push their identity politics in your face at every turn and in the most ham-fisted of ways. For instance, although the previous startup disclaimer was more than adequately inclusive, the game&apos;s designers inexplicably modified it to now include &quot;sexual orientations&quot; and &quot;gender identities&quot; while removing the previous acknowledgement of their &quot;various religious faiths.&quot;  The inclusion of an openly transgender character in Victorian England of all places was equally laughable, and one character&apos;s delivery of a snarky line in which she demands the right to vote was cringeworthy. Overall, this comes across as a game that was designed by a bunch of delusional Tumblr users who don&apos;t have any idea what the loyal fanbase of the game really wants and honestly doesn&apos;t care either way. The whole mess comes across is an obvious attempt to win over the vocal minority of SJWs at the expense of those of us who just want to enjoy our games without getting drawn into annoying political debates.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5960117">Expand</a></span>

London looks dull and textures have terribly low resolutions. When you tune up the settings even to medium or high then you need a beast to run the game. AC Syndicate is another ambitious project. At ultra settings the game looks great but it takes a lot of VRAM. It&apos;s really ridiculous. Unity looked way better and more alive but it didn&apos;t need more than 2 or 3GB of VRAM and I played it at medium to high.. I don&apos;t call this a good port. The Witcher 3 is a good port. MGSV: Phantom Pain is a good port. They look great and you don&apos;t need a beastly rig to run them. I played The Witcher 3 at medium to high but Syndicate is unplayable even at the lowest settings. Why make great graphics when not many people can afford to play the game and enjoy those graphics?! Make games that are fun and have great stories and gameplay. You don&apos;t need graphics for that. Graphics don&apos;t make a game. Story and gameplay do. MGSV and Fallout4 prove this point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5814529">Expand</a></span>

I heard people talking about bad graphics, dated engine, bad performances, low res texture and impossible requirements for very high settings. Those ARE PLAIN LIES: This the most optimized AC ever. Graphics are shining, textures as high res as a texture can be. On my 780ti runs at Very High with just 3 Gb of Vram, and it&apos;s always smooth as butter. The game is incredibly varied, setting is fascinating, two main characters adds even more diversity to the game.
<br>So, if you just want to bash a famous game for the sake of it (and I fully understand that Metacritic User Score has been inventend with that specific aim in mind) just choose a more suitable victim.
<br>This game is great, and it&apos;s the best AC ever published.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5846786">Expand</a></span>

<br>But let&apos;s get back to Assassin&apos;s  Creed Syndicate. It has tons of different missions, so there&apos;s no chance it gets boring. I even think of buying the Season Pass for extra missions.
<br>All in all it&apos;s a great game, which you should definitely buy, if you&apos;re into stealth and action games.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 8/10 - Looks worse than Unity, but still great.
<br>Gameplay: 10/10 - Finally good stealth mechanics. The combat is great, too.
<br>Story: 9/10 - Simple, but good. But without big plot twists.
<br>Port 7/10 - Runs with 60 fps without Gameworks on GTX 980. With Gameworks it&apos;s about 40 to 50 fps.

You can&apos;t jump when you want, you can&apos;t climb when you want, and the rope launcher (grapple hook) is VERY selective. 0/10 AC4 was better.

<br>The main characters in Assassin&apos;s Creed Syndicate are fantastic! I absolutely love their personalities, and they are defiantly competitors to the character we all know and love, Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. Jacob and Evie Frye have a houmoristic and great relationship, which makes it fun to watch every cut-scene.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is something different from the other Assassin&apos;s Creed games, but I like it. It is nice too see that Ubisoft take chances by changing the gameplay of the series, which makes it more fun for us to play the new game. Ubisoft has taken a step away from the usage of swords in combat, which makes the combat in this game feel fresh and new. They have also added the new &quot;hookshot&quot;, which gives the game an even more fresh feeling, bcs it gives you a new way of traveling around.
<br>
<br>I could write about this game the whole day, but I think you guys get the point by now. I completely love this game! 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5814181">Expand</a></span>

<br>Syndicate looks better than Unity but I miss the mass of NPCs on the streets. The Frye twins are great for both the story and varied gameplay. I personally like this new combat system better.</span>

<br>
<br>Please note, that the games graphic requirements are a little strenuous, so if your not running a decently high end Nvidia card than you can expect to run into issues running ACS. In addition, the game is not optimized for AMD cards. When running the game on a 380x the experience was laughable unless played at lower settings. The 390 provided a bit better experience but again still nothing compared to the experience on the 970 gtx.

<br>I&apos;m running this game on 20fps average on my i5-5200u and GT830M and I&apos;m totally find with that. I had to play the game on 1024x768 40Hz, all low except texture quality on medium and anti-aliasing on FXAA. I&apos;m actually surprised that it ran better on launch day than Unity but enough of performance.
<br>
<br>Performance : 9.5/10
<br>
<br>Gameplay was good, I like the return of the whistle and the fact that you can whistle anytime and anywhere. The addition of the rope launcher felt required as the roads were wider and the buildings were further apart. The animations in this was similar to Unity but had some of it&apos;s own animations, my favourite animations were the new assassination ones and also the combat finishers. Combat felt fast paced, though a little unrealistic, it was fun. Parkour controls were a little clunky at first, but I got used to it and just 4 hours prior to this review, patch 1.21 was released and downloaded, the controls were better now after the patch. The boss fight was pretty intense if you ask me.
<br>
<br>Gameplay : 9/10
<br>
<br>The story was a little dull in my opinion, it introduced us to Jacob and Evie Frye, twin Assassins which I already liked after the first 2 missions/sequences, I also like the different personalities between the two of them. The story then continues in London where Crawford Starrick and his Blighters has taken over and God damn it is huge. As to character progression, we get to see little progress with bigger impacts. For example, Evie who at first was faithful to Ethan&apos;s quotes and teachings began to see them only as quotes which although has meanings but that doesn&apos;t mean she has to live by them. A better example for me would be Jacob who became more rational and realize his mistakes. Modern day story continues in this and has more... depth.. than Unity did, I really liked it. Both Modern and Historical endings were different in their own way yet satisfying if you think like me.(Some people disliked the endings for some reason)
<br>
<br>Story : 8.5/10
<br>
<br>Graphics, now this I can&apos;t say much due to the fact that I ran on low qualities the entire game but it still looks great to me.
<br>
<br>Graphics : 9/10
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a great game and quite a step up from Unity, now don&apos;t get me wrong, I enjoyed Unity(as you can see in my Unity review) but this game was a better one game. There have been some things that I have not mentioned like the side-missions, gang wars, etc. That is mainly because I haven&apos;t finished them, I&apos;m more story-driven so I tend to push them aside first. I&apos;m eagerly waiting for the Jack The Ripper DLC, I have a theory of my own for the DLC.
<br>
<br>Post Scriptum:(Don&apos;t read it if you get butthurt easily)
<br>However, I would like to address that most people that gave this game a 0 or a 1 out of 10 care more about the graphics and..uhh... well complain about stuff. I remember when at Unity, the cloth physics wasn&apos;t capped and there were bugs and glitches and people complained about the bugs and glitches, now when it is capped, people go crazy about it too, I understand that it hurts your eyes when you&apos;re running at 60fps and the cape runs at 30fps and that is an acceptable complaint. What isn&apos;t acceptable is people calling the game repetitive, I mentioned this in my Unity review where Assassin&apos;s Creed is a franchise which tries new things but keeps the main core aspects of the games. There are also people who just want to shame this game/franchise where they just give it a 0/10 even though they like some parts of the game(performance,gameplay,etc), honestly I have no comment for them, but those who at least gave a 1 or 3, I&apos;d like to say thank you for your honesty. Most 0/10 reviews even make me wonder if they have even played the game yet. I do in fact, respect everybody&apos;s opinions but sometimes it just doesn&apos;t make sense. There were bugs in the game, yes but honestly, they&apos;re not game-breaking now are they? Some of them are funny(well to me), I even had bugs and glitches which made me laugh(rarely get bugs though). I like to think that most people who gave a really low rating get influenced by the haters or comparing it with a game that they actually liked. This may sound like a rant and even make me look like i&apos;m butthurt and well, I am, a little. I apologize if I offended you in any way but such is my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-syndicate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5850569">Expand</a></span>
