<br>
<br>Being a huge fan of old Genesis/NES games along with Contra, Megaman, Aladdin and Metal Slug this brings back nostalgy so hard that keeps me playing continuously. Lately very often we get release which is supposed to get those effects on players with retro-arcade style and Gryphon Knight Epic is definitely one of them with a bit more of something.
<br>
<br>You are taking role of Sir Oliver who retired from his adventures after slaying dragons and winning heart of princess. He is forced into adventures again with his loyal gryphon Aquila once when his &#x201C;bad side&#x201D; presented as spirit separate from Sir Oliver and confront him in battle where he win but with luck and brave soldiers our beloved knight get saved along with new chance to make things right. All allies and friends are now enemies, creatures, plants, bird even people will stay in front of your way but you need to fight and get answers on easier or harder way since before every mission you will be able to pick difficulty which will suit your abilities and skills in these kind of games.
<br>
<br>Unlike many other retro games you have ability to shift forward or backwards along with moving and collecting or killing what you missed which makes you feel a bit more exploratory oriented. Sure with that being said you do have freedom of shooting but not being able to do actions diagonal or use analog feature fully makes this adventure a bit harder and sometimes unfair.
<br>
<br>Along with simple 2D Shoot-everything element style there are slight RPG roots. Through levels you can find variety of gems for healing, buffing shield or ability to destroy everything on screen including small menu to switch weapons, shields or potions which will greatly help you on harder difficulty. In between levels you have a map where you make progress through, along with Market where you can buy potions and many other features including Magic Shop for some abilities as mentioned before and weapon upgrades which cost is increasing with further progress. You are getting coins for every kill or extra moves which you do through level so eventually getting upgrades is possible without harder effort. For fans and players who like more info about enemies, locations, characters and cutscenes there is Compendium aswel which will provide more details about this adventure.
<br>
<br>Level design is simple as you could expect with auto checkpoints which are placed on locations where you can choose in what direction you want to explore once when you get to the end of that &#x201C;road&#x201D;, which makes thing a bit harder since you cant stop slow-moving camera once when you pick direction. Deaths are not that annoying or irritating as they are in some games so you will definitely relax your nerves and look forward to whats going to happen instead how are you dealing current situation. Pretty much all levels contain two boss fights where second one is main fight and a bit more harder sometimes. There are also hidden paths and potential to farm continuously if you want all upgrades on your shiny knight and you are chasing achievements.
<br>
<br>At the end this game is perfectly priced and can offer from 6 up to 18 hours of gametime if you are completionist along with positive retro-shaking memories on old times when we used to enjoy in these 2D Adventures and nothing more. Will Sir Oliver make things right ? Most importantly HOW will he make that ? It&#x2019;s up to you !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gryphon-knight-epic/user-reviews?user_review_id=5827715">Expand</a></span>
