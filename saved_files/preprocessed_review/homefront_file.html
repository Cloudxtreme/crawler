This is a console game, not meant to be played on the PC.  Basic features like aiming with the mouse have bugs.  You&apos;ll get low FPS in even the lowest visual setting and all eye candy off.  There are invisible walls that you can&apos;t shoot through.  No bullet penetration through any material.  Broken spawn points.   Game modes with pointless objectives.  Last but not least, the first hour I played I ran into a autoaim cheater, and just about everyone who&apos;s played MP has as well.  If you want a good overview of the problems people are having, take a look at the homefront forums.  If you want a better game similar to this one, go with a Battlefield game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1538167">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m mostly a PC gamer when it comes to shooters, and I&apos;m not all that hardcore. This review is only about the single player campaign because I really care little for modern FPS multiplayer games.<br>Homefront feels like another COD clone, because nowadays everything is a &quot;COD clone&quot;, as if COD was the first ever FPS. However the singleplayer campaign is much more exciting and appealing than any crappy iteration of the aforementioned franchise. There are some awkward lines of dialogue, especially when the line is spoken out of cue. For instance, at one point the leader tells the girl to kill a guy, and she heads over to the person to be killed and halfway there she yells that she &quot;didn&apos;t sign up for this **** This is followed by the leader telling her to grow a pair and the almost immediate execution of the guy. Mind you, this was in the middle of a &quot;stealth&quot; segment. Because apparently deranged American killers with trigger happy fingers don&apos;t see or hear you (or your squad) in broad daylight as you prance around their base and scream at each other. Then there&apos;s the matter that the leader himself is a weird obstinate guy that is not very likeable. Your squad also has a Korean tech geek that no one really likes. And then there&apos;s the chick, who has amazing hips. There was also a previous leader, but he was black and was therefore shot and hanged early on in the game. Oh, and there&apos;s this super awesome cannon on wheels thing that you can use to blow **** up by pointing at your target with a monocle.<br>The gameplay itself is lots of fun, though. Guns feel amazing, and some of the scopes are super epic. There&apos;s not that much variety of weaponry in the game, mostly the same 6 or so guns with different attachments. I didn&apos;t find a way to decide what attachments I wanted and I feel that this was absolutely lame. Sure, you&apos;re a freedom fighter and have to use what you can grab, but what would stop me from taking a scope from X gun and putting it on X other one? Regardless, it&apos;s not that hard to find a nice suitable setup. Now, something that is really awkward is equipment usage. To swap between your two guns, you press 1. To throw a grenade you press G. Then I can&apos;t remember how the **** to throw C4, nor how to use a grenade launcher attachment, because it just wasn&apos;t intuitive.<br>Enough about combat, what about pacing and missions? Missions are paced well. There are times when a tank will appear after obliterating a house next to you and you run away screaming like a little girl (I know I did) and then there&apos;s times when you&apos;re &quot;sneaking&quot; around. There&apos;s also lots of chest high walls, but there&apos;s no way to stick to them, which I like. Then there&apos;s also a segment where you fly a chopper and have to get your team to highjack some trucks. This part is very easy, slightly very unrealistic, but very fun nonetheless. It is worthy to note that this segment, which is, by the way, over way too soon, is the reason why these freedom fighters wanted you: you&apos;re a pilot. And you&apos;re really only useful those 5-10 minutes.<br>Actually, that&apos;s an understatement, because as in many other shooters, your squad is a bunch of brain-dead morons. Upon occasion I would get shot from behind, only to turn around and see &quot;nice hips&quot; chick standing there staring at the guy.<br>There&apos;s also an issue with the AI always wanting to kill YOU. For instance, an RPG dude on a tower: you haven&apos;t messed with him and for all intents and purposes he is blissfully ignorant of your existence; until you pop your head out of a window (a window on his blind side) and aim at him, then he figures out your location, intent, name, date of birth, sexual inclinations, how hot your sister is, etc., and lands a rocket straight down your throat. I guess some Koreans just have a bit of a David Copperfield thing going on.<br>As far as rewards go, there are very little. Remember, you&apos;re struggling to fight some crazy asian people, seeing another day is your reward. Also, forget about saving Americans, because you pretty much doomed every single civilian you met.<br>There is one really big problem I have with this game, and it&apos;s the fact that the ending was rushed and uninspired. Almost as if the devs thought: &quot;hmmmm, I don&apos;t feel like writing more story, let&apos;s just have the leader kill-errrmm sacrifice himself and end it there.&quot;<br>In conclusion, Homefront is a solid gameplay experience that will keep you on your toes. And, even though I find it to be better than COD, it just isn&apos;t too high a praise, it&apos;s just an alright game. In fact, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever touch it again. So, if you&apos;d like something tastier than COD, and happen to see Homefront on a Steam sale, by all means go ahead and grab it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1687152">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay was fast and furious and more realistic than any other fps I&apos;ve played to date, but the limitations hurt even more too. Creative solutions are a no-no here, since the literally endless supply of enemies and horribly cramped level boundaries mean you&apos;ve gotta play it their way, plus with no real control over your weaponry, mods, or knowing anything about how good one is versus the other, you&apos;ve got a looooot of trial and error ahead of you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1693771">Expand</a></span>

<br>( seriously i finished it really fast and this is the actual time it took me). its shortness also makes the characters forgetable, and i didnt care for them. the storys concept is cool, and the game started good but from there it slowed a bit, and changed focus.. the story overall was mediocore, which is really dissapointing because it has so much potential. the graphics are old and inconsistent. some of the graphics are good while some are old. your friendly npcs are annoying and they shout on you all the time and repeat everything. even when you do what they told you they still tell you to do it. the shooting mechanics in the game are overall good, though i seen better. also some guns barely have recoil. the gun sound is pretty good. the last mission is really good.
<br>overall a HUGE dissapointment. its really short and not worth your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=3283342">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The single player campaign may be short, but it has a fun storyline and is one of the cooler concepts or a guerilla war where you&apos;re basically the badass who&apos;s the first step in igniting a full on assault against the Korean invaders. The Guerilla difficulty is incredibly difficult, and challenges me to this day. I&apos;ve played the campaign around ten times because it&apos;s a ton of fun for me, especially feeling like the weapons are super powerful.
<br>
<br>The multi-player is fairly good, but it is limited to only two modes with very little information on how to use the various battle points you acquire, and it also lags a lot even with a good connection. But when it works, it&apos;s great fun, with some large maps to boot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=4486854">Expand</a></span>

The story is completely different than that of Call of Duty or Medal of Honor and it was believable (though improbable). I immediately got sucked into the story and connected with the characters and what they were trying to do. I ran through the suburb blasting badguys and trying to escape through the wall. The most awe inspiring part of the game was when we discovered the mass grave, and then had to hide in it. It was shocking. When we finally made it to San Francisco we helped our military take back the Golden Gate bridge and I watched my friend make the ultimate sacrifice so that we could succeed. And then... the game ended. The credits rolled and I was left with a look on my face that I&apos;ve only had once before; at the ending of Borderlands. I don&apos;t play multiplayer fps games, so this game had to stand on singleplayer alone. This game was sprinting for a 10 but tripped and fell flat on its face at a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1698062">Expand</a></span>

Then that picture in your mind is of more value than the actual game. The graphics are quite nice, although somehow disjointing. The sound is messy and taxing on the ears. The controls are finkey, lax, and don&apos;t feel that great, and the engine is unoptimized. Something I have rarely seen on ue3. There is a big idea and political undertones in the game, but it&apos;s about 15 minutes worth of content. You get about 10 minutes of well made scripted content. The rest is just action pop-out-and-shoot gameplay, with a few variety sections. One slightly good thing is that some of the areas are a little more open than the cod series, but not open enough to take note as a bold move. The multiplayer is mostly pretty good. I will rank this on a &quot;us dollar scale&quot; although I live in Australia. And I hope you found this helpful. ((How much would I pay for homefront = $10, go for a steam sale, and only if you are a ---strait---line---fps fan)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1548454">Expand</a></span>

<br>Story - The story is so bad it makes my me want to go play a casual game like peggle for the simple pleasure of having NO story. Using a very linear story with no surprises this also pushes how &quot;great&quot; americans are. Very tiresome.
<br>
<br>I bought this game based on magazine reviews that seemed quit glowing. It&apos;s sad to see how far &quot;professional&quot; critics have fallen on the standards of goods out now days. Not only was my pre-order of the game a large waste of money but I think Chaos Studios deserved to be liquidated for their failure on producing something this bad. If it was a lawn mower it would have had a sized engine in the 1st hour... AFTER throwing part of the blade at your dog.
<br>
<br>Skip it... go play Duke Nukem Forever instead. Yes it&apos;s about the same but at least you go in expecting it &amp; there&apos;s humor, bad humor, some advanced mechanics (unlike Homefront) &amp; nudity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1531182">Expand</a></span>

Second, the scripted sequences force you down one path only, so you will die a LOT until you do things exactly as the game wants you to. Third, the ridiculous premise. The game never explains how America could be taken over by the Koreans. Fourth, the environment: they do create a fairly oppressive mood but I found it too unbelievable and too serious given the low quality nature of the game-play. They want me to care about the characters, but I can&apos;t feel much for stupid, wooden, NPCs who get stuck on walls and constantly walk into me. Overall, this is one of the worst FPS games I&apos;ve played in recent memory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1556552">Expand</a></span>

There are so many more opportunities for tales to tell!<br><br>I did try to jump into multi-player and, as usual (this is why I don&apos;t play mind you) I found myself dying before I could even get my bearings.  It did seem like the game favored the winning team - once you lost the first map the winning team had more points to buy vehicles which they then used to roll over you.  And if I survived the air strikes and tanks I usually ended up being sniped.  *shrug*  Not my thing, for sure.<br><br>It&apos;s another game using multi-player as an excuse to skimp on single player content.  Which is too bad because what little single player content was there was really interesting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1537850">Expand</a></span>

Shoot those guys!&quot; moments.<br><br>The multiplayer is okay, but not enough to pull me away from Bad Company 2. Weapons are very powerful, with 2-3 shots enough to kill with a rifle. The sniper rifle is a semi-automatic lazer beam, so you&apos;ll get sniped ALL THE TIME. Battle points are an interesting idea, but I wish there was more incentive to play as a team. Right now it encourages Rambo-style play, and though there is a squad feature, it seems to be of absolutely no use in the game. The Battle commander is actually very well done, where killstreaks mean more people are gunning for you to get extra points and experience. Mediocre at full price, but the multiplayer is interesting enough if you can pick it up on sale</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1534844">Expand</a></span>

With the expectation of little more than a highly linear campaign which most would attribute to Call of Duty, and a multiplayer which is much the same I wasn&apos;t hoping for a modern masterpiece, nor was I expecting what I would find. The easiest way to break this down would be to follow a chronological order. Firstly, the game isn&apos;t all on the DVD. You&apos;ll find only one DVD in the case and several GB will need to be downloaded from Steam. Secondly, the game is artistically bland, graphically poor, and performs equally horribly. With screen tear, stuttering frame rates and some atrocious textures the game runs inexcusably poorly on an HD6950, i5 2500k and 4gig of RAM. As poor as the graphics in general may be, they&apos;re not nearly as bad as the effects used - gunfire is weak and bullets will totally disappear if shot at allies or nearby walls or doors and as far as hits on soldiers go, they&apos;re alike to being hit with an exploding jar of jam. With the likes of Crysis running at a steady 60FPS it&apos;s safe to assume something went horribly wrong during development and optimization. The gameplay itself has horrible and unexplainable imbalances, two shots from any gun seems to kill an enemy on the default difficulty if you shoot them in the chest, that means two single bullets kills an enemy, but it takes two bursts from rifles which have burst fire 90% of the time. Meanwhile, looking down whatever site every weapon has attached grants 100% accuracy, while hip firing means only one in 10 shots will hit an enemy. The game also has a totally linear path which is set up by invisible walls, I&apos;m the last person to complain about linearity but then the invisible walls are on top of a tomato plant or absolutely nothing at all blocking your path, as if often the case, then I have cause to complain. As for the story and writing, &quot;from the writer of Apocalypse Now&quot;, I would have hoped for something more engaging. I very quickly grew to dislike the main cast (Connor particularly, who is a typical brutish hothead marine type) who stumbled along from checkpoint to checkpoint causing the slaughter of dozens upon dozens of people. Pacing was also a big issue, as there was nothing at all to develop. The KPA were immediately set up as a 2D enemy who were there as fodder and not to develop, as in the first 2 minutes they manage to commit every war crime known to man.

They claimed this game would have an emotional impact on the player... what a load of faeces. Singleplayer was boring, multiplayer was crap, numerous problems i wont even bother to mention because other people have mentioned them in their reviews. I just had to vent my frustration about this game and state the obvious, the games industry is crumbling yet people still buy trash like this. I can&apos;t believe they had the gall to announce a sequel even before the original was released! Dont bother with this game! Should i check the box that says &quot;contains spoilers&quot;? The only spoiler i&apos;m going to reveal is the utter disappointment you will experience after playing this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1571057">Expand</a></span>

It seems as if the developers tried to copy COD, but failed at making anything unique to the game.  The perks system was boring and graphics were mediocre (for both SP and MP).  If you are still considering buying this title, PLEASE DON&apos;T!!  This game is no good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1636942">Expand</a></span>

Except it did suprise me. With all the hype, i expected it to be another COD clone, but i was going to get it for it&apos;s single player. The surprise was how terrible a COD clone could possibly be. I thank the piratebay, for allowing me to sample the SP before i poured my money into it for the  full game. Because i dont know what i could possibly do with the Disc and case that wouldve been worth the 60 dollars i wouldve paid. setting a disc and case on fire isnt something id pay 60 bucks for.<br><br>But heres WHY. Its the same old shallow gameplay mechanics from COD, once they and most of the FPS genre adopted it, in the worst format ive seen, it has the shortest campaign ive ever seen on a FPS.....or ANY game for that matter, it has bugs bursting from the seams, and its a wonderful thing this game didnt sell well. THQ lost BIG bucks on this game, and rightfully so. With that ad campaign that showed it as another best seller, then delivering this worthless pile of super-discount-bin material, they deserve it. its not all bad though. At least it will show companies what churning out something as awful as this will end up earning them, especially after that phony ad campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1710592">Expand</a></span>

Most annoying would be the Unmanned vehicle, seems smart enough to shoot infantry, but u still have to designate targets urself ? Can&apos;t the vehicle do it itself since it&apos;s so smart?<br>Have I mentioned u cant go through openings or exits without the NPCs going first ? even when there&apos;s millions of enemy troops shooting at you ?<br><br>Characters<br>2. The characters are not lovable, in fact my favorite from this story was actually the guy who died in the intro, the rest of them are rather annoying, sometimes u wish they would shut up. NPCs fail to convey emotions or urgency in achieving an objective but rather makes u wanna shoot them<br><br>Weapons<br>3. If North Korea invaded any country, wont they use their arms to do so ? All the weapons in this game looks like a derivative of the M16 and they all feel the same with the exception of the sniper rifle which still looks like a M16 and the M249 which is....used by the North Koreas as well for strange reasons,<br>Even the vehicles used by the North Koreans all seem strangely american, except for the Tank and that&apos;s all..............<br><br><br>Graphics<br>4. For the amount of juice it sucks, the game does look pretty awful, I honestly think the graphics in Valve&apos;s Left 4 Dead 2 is much better, I still cant believe Bad Company 2 looks better than this game, while they&apos;re both set to the same settings and my system hitting the same frame rate, BC2 feels smoother too.<br>BTW, I run a Radeon 6950 with I5-2500K.<br><br>Multiplayer<br>5. Didnt bother to try since the single player was so terrible.<br><br><br><br>Weird:<br>1. North Korea invading America? How the hell they do that? would be more plausible if it was a pack of nations like China+ Russia .........then North Korea.....<br>2. Like some posters have said, those 10 point reviews seem suspicious as they do not comment much on the game and are from 1 post only posters.<br><br><br>Conclusion: Not really a bad PC port, just a bad game itself</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1719182">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are good (nothing new or earth shattering), but good. I did notice differences in graphics when I used different computers. So, if you want it to look good, you&apos;ll need an updated graphic card, and a good Flat screen HD monitor/TV. You&apos;ll also want to customize your settings. That&apos;s what I did anyway, and finally the MP mode is addictive and different. Sometimes you feel rewarded and sometimes frustrated. It will depend on how adaptable you are to different playing styles. You will still find some campers here and there, but at least you have a good shot at squashing them. The game is mostly balanced. It feels good to be able to knife a sniper, who just shot up your team mates, and not see hackers jumping 2-3 stories high in one jump onto a place that  no one else can climb up to  like in COD. I&apos;m enjoying the MP. So, I really can&apos;t complain.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1549649">Expand</a></span>

Its single player is very short - even on the highest difficulty on you first playthrough, it will likely take you only six hours to beat, and that&apos;s if you look for the collectibles - and the gameplay is cookie cutter, taken from every other FPS ever. Health regeneration is ridiculously fast and really makes it difficult to feel threatened by anything other than rocket launchers and one really neat sequence where you only start out with a pistol to fight back with (which was easily the best part of the game). The plot itself does little to help you feel complete - it felt a bit trite, and I would have liked to have actually done more to liberate America in that world rather than it simply ending with a single battle.<br><br>If it was cheaper, say, $20, it would be an okay buy (I picked it up as part of the THQ collector&apos;s pack; I didn&apos;t even buy it for the game, but I figured, why not play it?) but for $50 you&apos;re setting your money on fire. Even so, though, the price isn&apos;t all that relevant; the gameplay experience isn&apos;t all that enthralling, so basically the only reason to play the game is if you find the premise interesting - there isn&apos;t anything else to it which will interest you.<br><br>Perhaps the most offensive thing about the single player campaign is how you are led by your nose throughout the game - you basically have someone yell at you what to do, and there is only one way to do it, and only one path forward for a great deal of the game. The most decision making you make is whether to take cover on the left side of the street or the right side of the street - and at many points in the game you do not even have THAT much choice.<br><br>It did well on establishing atmosphere, but there is nothing else to recommend it and a great deal to say that you should pass this by and purchase a better title. If you want an interesting FPS, I&apos;d recommend Crysis 2, which has some neat stuff in it and is a lot more fun to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1723055">Expand</a></span>

When i first heard the premise i found it kind of ridiculous, but after seeing the lead in news beats, and picking up the collectible newspapers, it sounds more and more plausible. its easy for me to suspend my disbelief and buy into this story. The graphics aren&apos;t tier 1 for 2011, but i think that was expected. But it looks good. The style is gritty and run down, but not too brown as many &quot;realistic&quot; shooters seem to be getting. It doesnt have as much eye candy but it looks good, and I&apos;ll get my sugar fix with Crysis 2 next week. The combat is solid, but it might be a little easy. I started the game 1 setting down from the highest, but i think I&apos;m going to max it. the only time i died was when i went somewhere i wasn&apos;t supposed to to look for a newspaper and a tank we were supposed to be sneaking past killed me. So far the only vehicle i used was the Goliath. Its a 6 wheeled vehicle with guns and missiles that you control by locking on to enemies with binocs (like air strikes in other games). you aim at an enemy, wait for lock, and fire. And the Goliath goes nuts on em. its really visceral and a lot of fun to watch. He feels like a big brother that&apos;s kicking your bullies ass. I thought the use of real brands for stores and stuff would bother me (like it usually does) but not so much. Somehow the fact that they wanted these brands here to add a sense of reality, and not just for more ad dollars makes it feel different. The characters are ok, a little cookie cutter maybe, but i don&apos;t really know them yet. So, so far I&apos;m really enjoying it. I have heard that the campaign is very short. This is disappointing considering how hard they pushed the story aspect of this game. But that seems to be par for the course these days. I enjoy MP, but I really go for a nice deep immersive single-player shooter experience. Hopefully, now that they have a great game, and hopefully some serious income, now they&apos;ll have the resources to pour into a tier 1 shooter with a campaign of some length. I bought this day one because I wanted to support the fact that they were pushing a different angle on shooters. and they were pushing the story. Hopefully they&apos;ll hear my dollars asking for more of that when it comes time for Homefront 2. But until then, I&apos;m really enjoying this one...while it lasts. Oh and lastly. Way to go THQ for FINALLY allowing Steam to give us a midnight release! So many publishers wont even let us preload the game at midnight, never mind letting us play it. THQ let us preload, and i was able to install the game at midnite! love it, wish more publishers would do it.

When I heard THQ was developing another game I was hoping for a sequel without the glitches, lag, etc. Like many of you I was checking the status of this greatly anticipated game on youtube and various other websites for all the information I could get. When the release date was set I began counting down the days only to have it pushed back again and again. &quot;Okay&quot; I thought, I&apos;d rather see a delay then for them to release a game of poor quality. I was wrong, regrettably very wrong! Homefront could have been great; Homefront could have been ground breaking both in premise and game play. Like I said earlier; Frontlines was fantastic, so good in fact the &quot;Big Guys&quot;copied ideas from it such as drones etc. The battle point system was a welcome addition instead of kill streaks which more than likely will and should be copied by other developers. The single player is way to short, the graphics are average to say the least while the movement of your character is like he has a twenty pound dump in his pants! His movements are slow, methodical not at all crisp or sharp like other FPS games. Multiplayer is a joke, that&apos;s if you can get in a game at all, joining friends is virtually impossible. It went from dedicated servers to P2P because they underestimated the online attraction; they&apos;re in the gaming industry right? MP is what many people play day in and day out and these guys are not prepared? All 16 player games will now be hosted on P2P not dedicated. Make no mistake; multiplayer is a camper / sniper haven which kills it right off the bat, the weapon selection is poor and the fact you can&apos;t add more than one attachment to your weapon is a joke. No sight and silencer combo WTF? Why Not? All the while your character is still running around with that dump in his pants! Overall this game is a failure in every way possible, with such high hopes it pales in comparison to other FPS games past or present. I mean really THQ what were you thinking? To add insult to injury if you buy used or rent you have to pay 10 bucks to play online past level 5! This was done of course to prevent people from just renting the game and also brings in a few extra bucks to boot. Like paying 60 dollars for this crap wasn&apos;t enough THQ. Put your greedy little hands back in your pockets and try developing a game we were all hoping you would! Save your money and rent if you must. Don&apos;t spend 60.00 or even 20.00 for this game, soon enough it will be in the bargain bin or on ebay for 8.00 to 10.00 dollars. Complete and utter fail THQ you should be embarrassed and ashamed! The gamers have spoken and we&apos;re not going to take this anymore it&apos;s unacceptable, a patch for this, a download for that, a quick fix for the other thing. When are you developers going to get it right? Its no wonder your stock dropped 25 percent the day of release! Thats our way of saying &quot;Congratulations on a job well done&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1538811">Expand</a></span>

I really wanted to like this one, so I preordered 2 copies for my 2 gaming PC, thinking they did something good before, they&apos;ll do it again, and I think they deserve my money right off the bat, a show of trust. I am disappointed.<br><br>MULTIPLAYER: I was expecting the battle points system to fix the &quot;ME&quot; player that wrecks teamwork in so many other games. Well, the BP system does more than that, it also ensures that actual coordination between teammates becomes unnecessary and useless. That&apos;s right, instead of making the game MORE team-based, they turned it into a solo player&apos;s dream by giving the team coordination over to the Battle Commander when there is one, and nonexistent when there isn&apos;t. So if you are a fan of strong team coordination, there is nothing for you here.<br><br>The game is a huge snipefest, but that is to be expected given the utter lack of ballistics. Every weapon seems to fire the same as any other, negating the need for weapon variety - and there is very little - and of course snipers have a field day with instant hit right in the middle of the crosshairs no matter what, where, when, or how. Of course, every other gun behaves nearly identical. Again I fondly remember Frontlines where you had to compensate for recoil yourself. They took that OUT, what a shame, probably to please the console kiddos. Also, the maps are too small for vehicle combat.<br><br>GRAPHICS: They are OK, no complaints from me.<br><br>SINGLE-PLAYER: I enjoyed it, but it was ridiculously short.<br><br>PRODUCT QUALITY: MP bugs abound, making it an iffy proposition at best.<br><br>OVERALL SCORE 4/10 - IT IS FAIL. DO NOT BUY.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1555743">Expand</a></span>

I only play objective mode and I like how they spiced up the multiplayer with little purchases and marking priority targets. Also the hit detection seems much better to me than in Black Ops for some reason.<br>I do have one complaint. The game is quite the hardware hog compared to how it looks. I have a i7 2600k running at 4.4GHz, 16GB ram and an ATI HD6950. It&apos;s not enough to run the game at 1920x1200 with antialiasing smoothly. To me anything below 50 FPS in unacceptable and I don&apos;t like playing without AA (yeck!) so I kept textures at maximum and turned shadows and special effects down a bit and that helped enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1551912">Expand</a></span>

I was let down.<br>The single player is moderately engaging with a decent plot, but ultimately is short and unremarkable.<br>This games bread and butter was to be the multiplayer aspect.  However, the game falls short in this category as well.  Let me start with the fact that KAOS felt it necessary to not put on any anti-cheat systems, so every game has at least one blatantly obvious hacker.  The official Homefront forum moderators delete any posts regarding this topic.  So, basically, that makes the multiplayer absolutely unplayable, and there are no repercussions for cheaters at all.<br>There are problems with invisible barriers, basically you can see someone, and more than once we would fire at each other, and our bullets would hit this invisible barrier and do nothing.<br>Bullets do not go through thin walls or fences.  Hell, even some weeds are bulletproof in this game.<br>Vehicles are hard to kill and overly dominate a game.<br>The sound effects are ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  Will the people that make these FPS games PLEASE get real sound effects?  I feel like I am playing a paintball match, not fighting a war.<br><br>There are no absolutely major flaws in the gameplay itself.  It&apos;s just all the little annoyances and the lack of an anti-cheat system compounds into an unplayable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1541678">Expand</a></span>

Homefront main selling point was supposedly the campaign being written by the great John Milius (Red dawn, Apocalypse now), but it seriously falls short both in content and overall feel. You&apos;re supposed to be a guerrilla fighter against insurmountable odds, but often you mow down loads of enemy forces with ease and we reach the common place CoD style objectives and run through of the campaign saturating the market. If you can appreciate what they try to do both story and game wise, you&apos;ll enjoy the campaign. Multiplayer is where the title shines boasting both common and new ways to dominate online. Think Battlefield feeling like Call of Duty and that&apos;s what you get with the multiplayer component. Expect a balanced and great multiplayer that draws a lot from modern shooters, while taking out the negative aspects. It&apos;s worth picking up based on the multiplayer alone if you&apos;re that kind of customer, but if you plan on picking it up for the singleplayer expect to be disappointed by its length and depth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1533190">Expand</a></span>

It does feel a bit like HL2 but not as much as I was hoping for. MW2 obvious.  I&apos;m a bit over 3 hours into the story line and an hour into MP.  The single player is fun! It looks great and the best modded Unreal 3 Engine I&apos;ve seen so far. The physics in the game are very nice and entertaining. Explosions look great and if timed well will send bodies flying a good distance. The level design is done well. Subtle hints here and there to guide you and to catch your attention.  The atmosphere is pretty creepy and embodies what an occupation may be like. You can see LOTS of time was put into the environments. Good attention to detail which most games out at the moment don&apos;t seem to be doing. The weapons sound punchy and satisfying. The same with ambient sounds. Nice looking blood splatter and animation. No dismemberment though... Why can&apos;t more games have this? It made Soldier of Fortune and COD World at War much more entertaining right?!  The dialogue has given me a laugh here and there so far, but over all OK. On the other hand though 95% of all First Person Shooter game dialogue is garbage. When will decent writers start on video games? MP is a nice cross between Battle Field and COD World At War (ever notice how much more open the maps in World At War were?)  And maybe a nod to counter-strike when purchasing a flak jacket after a re-spawn? The re-spawning is much better than COD, where as it makes sense and not just a blind spot.  Not as much running and gunning compared to cod. Group re-spawn like BF a nice thing.   Nothing groundbreaking but they have a decent mix of features from other popular MP games. it would be nice to see some more game modes though. The Game for me so far (3 1/4 hours in) is pretty sweet! It&apos;s not genre changing but delivers on everything it should just fine and is quite entertaining. I don&apos;t understand most of the negative things i read about it. What games are those guys playing that make them feel the need to condescend to most other games? Over all, the game for me is a solid B when most shooters I&apos;ve played lately are a C+ at best. Thank God it&apos;s not like there PR red balloon stunt. LOL<br>If the game keeps going like this, it&apos;s worth the $50 and you get to help support new games on PC at $50 and not starting at $60.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1535983">Expand</a></span>

Battle Commander and battle-points are really unique and give some rejuvenation to an old FPS formula. I will definitely be playing this for a while, and this game will be up there with Battlefield 3 and Red Orchestra 2 as the best FPS PC releases for this year.</span>

I played about 5 MP matches first, then the entire first SP level.<br><br>In MP I went 34-16 in those matches and ranked up to lvl. 6.<br>SP was engaging and fun.<br>MP was a blast. Played 4 on 4 for a bit then 16 on 16. Only tried assault kit. But used perks like BMP, HUMVEE and my favorite, Hellfire missiles. Once you save up 1100 Battle points you get 2 shots with the Hellfire. I only missed twice and say I&apos;m about 8/10 with it.<br><br>There is a comma rose for spotting and stuff, there are squads but I couldn&apos;t see how to spawn on the squad. Maps are a mix of big and small, most cool thing about them is tons of cover, in and outside of buildings and tons of ladders to climb and get elevated positions.<br><br>Graphics look great, I&apos;m running all on medium at 1440x900 10:9 aspect.<br><br>Set up my controls exactly like BC2. Prone and crouch sprint and knife are all the same.<br><br>I was typically in the top 2-5 on the server. I saw many clans already turning up their servers. But most were like KAOS #101 etc.<br><br>What else? There&apos;s no destruction, but considering how softly and thoughtfully you want to move around in this game, that is cool. Most of my kills came from finding a good cover spot with my back protected and just killing idiots who ran runnin&apos; and gunnin&apos; like they were playing COD.<br><br>I really liked the fact that in TDM and BattleGround you never had to worry about a guy spawning behind you, it kept the maps separated by troop concentration for safe spawning.<br><br>I never got spawn camped, and almost always knew what and who killed me and why.<br><br>First 3 hours impression.... I want to play more, but gotta get to work soon.<br><br>I found nothing too odd or glitchey. At one point in MP my controls went screwy, like my crosshairs kept wanting to point in the air on their own, so I restarted the game and it was fine. At another point in one map i couldn&apos;t jump up a little one foot step like it was a map error or something.<br><br>Overall I&apos;d find it hard to comparing it to BC2, BF2 or COD. It&apos;s kinda it&apos;s own thing, a little bit of all of them. Collecting those points and spending them on cool **** is easy, just watch the little meter on the right and when you get 1100 press 4 for Hellfire, or if you want to spend 250 you get 3 AT rockets. They suck vs. infantry though, or I don&apos;t know how to shoot them. Of course all that is cutomizable, I unlocked other things like flack jackets and UAV drones that I didn&apos;t even load out with yet. I&apos;d say at 4am there was about 600 to 1000 people playing online. I am ranked 1256th on the leader board.<br><br>Anyway ramble complete. If U get the game, you&apos;ll likely enjoy it. At least the first 3 hours. Who knows where it goes from here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1527949">Expand</a></span>

First off just to let you know, I am going out of my way, MADE AN ACCOUNT ON HERE just to warn you how horrible and just down right poor this game is. it has no demo or beta (i can see why now) so it kinda forces you to put your hard earned $60 on that game and pray to god that its worth it. The beginning is uncreative, just casually showing you what happened in the last 30 years as if your watching the history channel. the game does a poor job introducing the main character of the story, and quickly nudges you through until out of no where some unknown rebels help you, and drag you to a secret base, so basically the game doesnt give any detail or background to any of the characters. the game is also extremely predictable. Its pretty bad when your 5 year old cousin knows whats coming up next. rpg explodes here, trigger happy guy goes crazy there, grenade flies in and kills half your guys here...very little creativity went into this game, period. also did i mention that it looks like a 8 year old made the graphics of this thing? seriously, the graphics in mario are better. And finally, IT ONLY HAS ABOUT 3 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY....WHAT!! i feel like i was playing the demo instead of playing the game. overall, homefront is one of the worst games ive played in awhile, possibly that i have ever played. the only reason i am even giving it a point is i like the concept, too bad it was horribly executed..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1538869">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately what I got was a mediocre game at absolute best.<br><br>The single player puts you in the roles of an American citizen during the Korean occupation of America. The opening scene was actually fairly well done. However, everything after that was nothing more than random gun battles with no real storyline. You meet characters and they die before you even get a chance to start to bond with them. There was no emotional attachment to the story whatsoever. Everything they did has been done before in books, films, and even video games but Homefront lacks all sense of pacing and storytelling making these elements pointless. If there is a silver lining to the storyline it&apos;s that it&apos;s painfully short. I completed it in just over three and a half hours. There&apos;s honestly not much else I can say about this because it was so short.<br><br>The multiplayer is rough around the edges to put it lightly. Again they borrowed a lot of unnecessary things from other games even though there was no compelling reason to do so. I had hoped that this was a good cross between the face paced action of Call of Duty and the slower, vehicular team based combat of Battlefield. Well it is to an extent. This game leans more heavily towards the Call of Duty style of FPS games. It even has a similar oblivious spawning system and poor map design which will get you spawn killed time after time.<br><br>Most of the maps are quite open which is actually a problem. Most people will opt to use the sniper class killing people on the other side of the map as they spawn. I&apos;m not sure whether or not this was ever play tested, and I&apos;m leaning towards no, but some of the mechanics make absolutely no sense. For instance the AQ-11 Buzzard is a drone which fires two rockets before having to reload. Inexplicably if you directly hit a person with both of these they will not die. Further their blast radius is somewhere in the range of 10cm. However, a person will usually die in one hit from a sniper rifle making the AQ-11 Buzzard seem like a terrible thing to buy. Similarly the Humvee can take a direct hit from an RPG without being destroyed. In fact if a Humvee takes a hit from an RPG the driver will likely switch to the gunner position and kill you before you even have a chance to fire a second rocket. So apparently bullets are better than explosives in this game.<br><br>Balancing in multiplayer seems to be non-existent as alluded before. However, what&apos;s even worse than the atrocious balancing are the bugs. I&apos;ve come onto the battlefield with a helicopter only to be permanently marked out of bounds and destroyed. I&apos;ve even accidentally clipped the out of bounds area and returned only to find that I was still somehow out of bounds when clearly I was not. Server disconnects are also quite frequently, and of course whatever XP you&apos;ve earned is lost when this happens. One more point of contention is the sheer size of the hit boxes for objects in the world. I know hit boxes can&apos;t be exact, but there are plenty of instances where it&apos;s amazing just how large the hit boxes are relative to the actual object, generally with trees, rocks, and vehicles. Prepare for an invisible hit box to take the bullet rather than your opponent many times.<br><br>Their much touted Ground Control game type is a cross between the Rush, Domination/Conquest/Sector Control, and push-pull. I was hoping this would lead to large, epic battles. Unfortunately it&apos;s incredibly limited. Whereas in Bad Company 2 you have multiple stages within each Rush map, in Homefront you have two stages. Coupled with the bugs and balancing issues this makes the game type fairly uninteresting. The only other real game type is team deathmatch, which is just what you&apos;d expect. There are a total of six maps, so prepare to get bored quickly.<br><br>In summary I think this game could have been much better. I won&apos;t say this game is horrible since it&apos;s at least playable, but I won&apos;t say it&apos;s good either. It&apos;s wholly mediocre. If you&apos;re only interesting in the single player then I suggest renting it. If you&apos;re more interested in the multiplayer then I&apos;d advise you wait until there&apos;s been a good deal of post launch support, or until it&apos;s in the bargain bin. Whichever comes first. Kaos Studios should have spent more time working on the game than promoting it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1531141">Expand</a></span>

Never thought anyone would recreate the classic gameplay of Half-Life and give it a new twist. Despite the graphics not being competitive with Battlefield and COD, it was the least of my concerns since the campaign was so unique and inspiring with multiplayer features topping recent FPS games.</span>

Homefront took the time to make an incredibly immersive, powerful story that, while being much too short, brought emotions out that no game has before. The entire time playing the game, I felt like I really was the character, while dashing between cover when facing that first sentry, while assisting your team in the raids, while fighting every last KOR soldier, I felt immersed in the game. The graphics and AI are a little dated, with other minor issues, but overall the singleplayer was very well done. The multiplayer added a few fresh things to the genre as well. The &quot;killstreak&quot; system of high priority targets in Commander mode was a nice twist, and generally gameplay was crisp and rewarding. Overall, despite a few flaws in the design and engine, the stylistic environment of the game, great story, and fresh gameplay make Homefront worth checking out if you appreciate good story and atmosphere over &quot;prestige.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1534368">Expand</a></span>

I got to play it right at midnight. Multiplayer is a blast. This game takes the best of Call of Duty and Battlefield and tweaks it enough to differentiate itself from them, but at the same time is familiar enough for fans of those series to immediately enjoy. Battlepoints are an amazing feature of the game and are way better than the kill streaks in Call of Duty. They are much more fair for all players and are balanced very well. In fact, just about everything about the multiplayer game is balanced.That&apos;s quite a feat. Vehicle control is very well done and can be customized to your liking. None of the vehicles are overpowered, but they still contribute to the battlefield and should be feared. The guns are all unique and can be customized with a ton of different scopes, etc. A lot of the multiplayer has your typical fanfare like experience, challenges, etc. The maps are fantastic. There is a ton of &quot;stuff&quot; to hide in and take cover with. One thing that I think this game doesn&apos;t get enough credit for is the sound. This game sounds like war! Everything from the muffling when a grenade goes off near by to the distant sounds of gunfire are done very well.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere in this game is top notch. I&apos;ve only gotten about 30 minutes into the singleplayer, but so far that is very engaging and I can see myself being driven through it because of the backstory even though I usually enjoy multiplayer more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1535336">Expand</a></span>

It appeared to have an amazing plotline, and interesting multiplayer. The idea of &quot;war isn&apos;t fun or pretty&quot; was what really hooked me on it. I downloaded it from Steam and at once had an issue: no sound. I eventually found a fix that required editing a game .ini file. Games should not be released with these types of bugs... Anyways, after fixing the sound, I started the campaign. It looked interesting at first. At the beginning, a kid watches his parents die by firing squad right in front of his eyes. I thought the game was going to be filled with these gut-wrenching, emotional moments... I was wrong. The game is almost an exact clone of Call Of Duty. The game is constant action with things exploding all around you and countless numbers of enemies coming at you from all directions. The so-called &quot;emotional&quot; aspect is either totally screwed up at times, or non-existent at others. The only reason I give this game a 5 is because of the multiplayer. I&apos;d give it a six if the multiplayer wasn&apos;t EXACTLY like CoD. A note to developers out there: STOP MAKING CALL OF DUTY GAMES AND CALL OF DUTY CLONES. After you make the exact same game SEVEN times it&apos;s not fun anymore, I promise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1531191">Expand</a></span>

TLDR: Worse graphics than Crysis with worse performance.<br><br>Single player: Story started out boring but was strangely reminiscent of Half Life 2.  Playing through on normal only took four hours.  I&apos;m sure it will take longer on harder difficulties, but it&apos;s still a very short single player.  When the game ended I was like, &quot;whoo let&apos;s do this!! Oh, that was the last mission? Okay...&quot;  Just when things were really picking up emotionally and gameplay wise the game just ends. They obviously did this so they can make a sequel, but I felt that single player could have benefited from another segment or two.  The story was decent but nothing amazing. Newspaper articles laying on the ground and radio transmissions between missions were a nice touch, though. It was nice  to not be in the middle east or Eurasia.  They made the story believable.<br>TLDR: Decent story, reminiscent of Half-Life 2, but too short.<br><br>Gameplay:  Almost the exact same as Modern Warfare; everything from the feel of weapons, HUD, melee animations, and cross-hairs.  The only difference is vehicles are a lot more prevalent than in COD which  I feel is a plus.<br>TLDR: Modern Warfare with vehicles.<br><br>Multiplayer: I haven&apos;t touched it and don&apos;t really plan to.  I&apos;m not terribly into COD style shooters&apos; multiplayers, although player controlled vehicles could mix things up.<br><br><br>Overall:  If you like Call of Duty you should like this game.  If you don&apos;t like Call of Duty very much, wait until it&apos;s on sale.  If it was long I would have given it a better score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1531021">Expand</a></span>

The game certainly has its flaws, but bottom line: I had a blast playing it and I will likely continue to do so for a long time... that to me is well worth the $60 I paid for it. The multiplayer is as good if not better than any of its competitors, and the story was (short but) brilliant.</span>

These ideals are no longer popular among many gamers who are used to &quot;sandbox&quot; elements that allow to make &quot;interactive&quot; and potentially unique decisions in games that they are playing. In comparison to other FPS games, I would more closely compare this game to Half Life 2 than Modern Warefare series games. There is a distinct storyline that is potently available to players who take the time to collect and read the newpapers laying around in the single player. If you only want to play Multiplayer, then it is a best case marriagse between the Modern Warfare genres and Battlefield 2. The decisions to build your character make sense, they are balanced, and they are FUN.  My only warning to anyone who is considering buying this game is that this game is mean to be enjoyed like a good meal- you dont wolf it down. Peers of mine have blown through the single player only to realize that they missed critical ambiance that lies in the smaller details. To tell you what that would be in this thread would be akin to a spoiler, so I will avoid describing it and just say- take your time, there is no hurry.  In regards to getting to &quot;know &quot; your character, this is a new concept in gaming that has only become relevant in recent years, but being that I dont like to &quot;play house&quot; and &quot;dress my paper dolls&quot; in the game, it has been a very pleasing experience so far. I&apos;m half way through the game and I cant wait to see what happens next. The cities I have fought in are realistically detailed, and being from one locale in the game, I was shocked and excited when I realized that I understood the EXACT location I was in. This game is a buy and only recieves a 9 because the linear model could be a smidge wider to allow for exploration and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1536425">Expand</a></span>

Alot like the latest MoH and I expect its support will be dropped just as fast. A four hour single player???Really?? All this talk of a great storyline and it being penned by John Milius, what a gimmick seems more likely that he wrote a paragraph on a napkin and these monkeys tried to turn it into a game. There was also alot of talk about how the vehicle controls are going to be with beginner, intermediate, and ace settings. Novel idea except when you can somehow throw away all decent helicopter physics, last time I checked choppers didn&apos;t have a forward and reverse gear as well as an up and down. Not to mention the rudder and strafe are mixed up and the tilt of the helicopter has literally nothing to do with movement. Gotta love it when they can take a vehicle that operates off a stick, and consolize so much that its completely useless to use a stick. Seems as if  Kaos failed physics class as there is no decent physics work to be seen. Multiplayer is pretty generic nothing groundbreaking except the amount of invisible walls or the fact the server browser is one of the worst I&apos;ve ever had the displeasure to use. Nothing like joining a server with 24 people only to find out the server is actually empty. These high reviews seem to come from the ones who will buy whatever comes out next because its put in-front of them, with no real expectations of improvement. I wanted this game to be great but sad to say it wasn&apos;t even close to what was hyped. Maybe buy it if its under $5 buy it, but then again you&apos;d get more out of the dollar menu.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1541677">Expand</a></span>

The problem on why it&apos;s getting bad reviews is becuase Call of Duty of Duty players simply can&apos;t play this game becuase they are not skilled enough to play on bigger maps and not use lag to move around. Homefront has no lag you shoot the guy and he&apos;s DEAD! Where as call of duty it takes you a whole clip to kill someone. COD players can&apos;t play on anything bigger then a sardine can for a map Homefronts maps are a perfect size not to big and nto to small! I have been playing FPS since the days of Novalogics Delta Force and watched the FPS games dwindle down to small map games and bunny hopping losers playing on small maps. If you are a COD players who likes to run around like a fool and use lag to win this game is not for you. This game is for the skilled FPS who knows their awereness on the battlefield and knows how to shoot and survive. Thank you Homefront for finally making a great game. I for one am dead tired of the crap COD series and it&apos;s community and the sardine size maps! Don&apos;t get this game if you can&apos;t stay alive without lag. Do get this game if you want great size maps, no lag and a TON OF FUN! People need to learn that the COD series is dead and the reason you buy it is because of the marketing, adds, and the name brand!  Think outside the box, just because you didn&apos;t see Homefront on TV or you didn&apos;t see alot of adds doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s bad.  COD has all of you sucked in with their makreting skills and puts out a worse and worse product every time cuz they already have you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1552691">Expand</a></span>

I have been waiting for a game like this for over 6 years. This game takes skill, actually all the skills that were needed for OLD-SKool games like DeltaFocre. I assume that non-skilled gammers that compare a game to Blackops etc will not like this game cause they are n00bs and do not have the gamming skills that old-skool gamers have. They need lag and tin can maps to try to win. This game is OLD-SKOOL BABY!!!! IF you have no skill don&apos;t bother getting it. Granted it is a bit buggy it is 100% better that Blackops and battlefield bad company 2. The people that give this game a bad review are children that base there gamming experience on the call of duty franchise. This game will go far..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1552690">Expand</a></span>

Having a firefight in a TigerDirect store while it&apos;s burning down is quite exhilarating. I disliked multiplayer for Call of Duty: MW2 but actually enjoy the combat system in Homefront&apos;s multiplayer.</span>

I thought the premise might be interesting, but it turned out to be totally ridiculous.  The game is totally scripted, you cant even open a door on your own.  The dialogue is terrible, I found myself constantly yelling at the characters to shut up. If i ever get stuck in behind enemy lines with these Conner and the rest I will be turning myself in. The game looks good at times, but that is little consolation. This game feels like it is ten years old and it plays like it too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1570228">Expand</a></span>

If you have played any decent FPS games in the last decade, you&apos;ve probably seen all there is in Homefront, and seen it done better. Quite disappointing, honestly. Single player is an interactive movie, and a weak one at that. You constantly lack control and mobility, just so they can show you a specific story piece from a specific angle. It would be better with a cutscene, since it would have more dramatic angles, and the scenes would possibly be SKIPPABLE! It&apos;s not so bad the first time, but replaying the game is so frustrating to sit through. There is only about 2 hours of real gameplay, lengthened by extraneous story scripting. Modern Warfare 1 had compelling and intense scripted events; Homefront lacks the heart and adrenaline to compare.<br>On to multiplayer. It was great the first day, but after time the level imbalances became more apparent. The Battle Points seemed original at first, but then I realized it&apos;s CounterStrike with vehicles and without the strategy. Helicopters are near-impossible to fly and shoot accurately, and cost far more than the drones that can get far more kills more easily. The perks are mostly minor, and mostly focused on buffing drones. Combat can quickly turn into camping, spawning drones, and killing without dieing, and repeat. With enough kills by drones, you can afford another, and simply repeat the process without ever putting yourself in danger. There are only 2 modes in the game, team deathmatch and capture the point (with a ground control option on both that makes small changes). Ground control does help the game by giving incentive to kill spree-owners, and to defend your kill leader. Still, teamwork is mixed and many times the spawn system doesn&apos;t protect you from enemies. Most maps have many camping spots and mistakes. Maps also don&apos;t allow for easy travel of the bigger vehicles, reinforcing the usefulness of drones. In a fight between any human and a camper with drones, the drones win almost always. The fun is slowly bleeding out of this game, online and off, and I completely intend to beat it and delete it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606395">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;M A GENIUS!! Yes - Homefront. Well the idea was for Homefront to be different, and believe me - its anything BUT different. The crooks of the game is that America gets invaded - stop me if this sounds familiar, don&apos;t confuse it with MW2 where America gets invaded, or the end of BFBC2 where Russia gets invaded, or Command and Conquer where Russia is invaded, or Turning Point: Fall of Liberty where Nazis invade or even Fallout where China Invades Alaska which technically was America being invaded!! But feel free to get confused with Freedom Fighters because it&apos;s the SAME DAMN GAME!!!<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong in the run up it looked the part, it looked like the writers ate babies for breakfast without any milk, the intro movie was cool too (I watched it twice). It genuinely looked like a good game with a great single-player and story. So I ordered it and sat down for an evening of Homefront....and stood up 3 hours later because I was done. Yes. 3 HOURS! 3 BORING, TERRIBLY SLOW, CRAP 3 HOURS WHICH I WON&apos;T GET BACK EVER! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I&apos;ll keep the overview as brief as the game, it&apos;s REALLY, REALLY, REALLY REALLY BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD! Save your money for something else like food, shelter and breathing - not this load of rubbish<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The basic story is that the US goes into crisis due to some middle east wars and Korea decides to invade for very poorly justified reasons - using a cool space program which wasn&apos;t as cool as Star Trek but enough to overthrow a world super-power, and then you get taken by the resistance and then steal an oil tank drive from the Koreans (dunno why nothing I own that says &quot;made in Korea&quot; on it works, but hey) and take the oil tanker it to California to fuel the US and steal back some city I don&apos;t know I got bored with the story. It tries to be a HL2 knock off with the mute protagonist and the characters it has based itself on and the whole invasion suppression thing, but it fails to copy HL2 in the way of a long well written story or good game-play or being...GOOD!<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The characters are a big rip-off from HL2 and are all about as warmable as a day in the arctic - especially Conner (who is the biggest prick this side of the occupied border) and made me not care about them to the point that when Boon or Broon or the black guy got tortured (SPOILER ALERT) the game assumed I&apos;d made a bond where the worst I felt was that&apos;s one less character to open doors for me for all the scripted events the game has, and then I realised the AI wouldn&apos;t push me out of cover again for their stupid scripted events - seriously, I got killed twice - TWICE! All because the AI had pushed me out of cover into the line of the enemy so that Conner T*at could yell at some civilians he was &quot;trying&quot; to liberate.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Remember when I said that the game was like Freedom Fighters, well it looks like Freedom Fighters too, it&apos;s graphically dated - and when I say dated, it&apos;s so ugly the game would have to rape it&apos;s own hand. Now usually people say eye-candy doesn&apos;t matter in a game and usually I&apos;d agree with them provided the game can stand up on something else like story or game-play. For example, Homefront looks like it was beaten with the ugly stick, whereas Half-Life 1 looks like it was gang-raped by the ugly forest - the distinction is Half Life 1 was good. Homefront looks ugly on modern consoles, which is really hard to pull off, but is just plain bad. Now don&apos;t get me wrong there were some good bits like the whole first chapter, the helicopter bit and hiding in a pile of corpses but those bits were few and far between and the game isn&apos;t special, really.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Now everyone says the multiplayer makes up for it. It doesn&apos;t. I tried joining a game and after 10 minutes the game told me there was no mother playing it, so after another 10 minutes of waiting to find someone the game descended into tedium and boredom. Good multiplayer my arse!, and it doesn&apos;t excuse such a terribly short and bad campaign, no where near as good as TF2 or CoD4.<br>Bottom line: AVOID THIS GAME, do not buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1704717">Expand</a></span>

Do not go with critics over here, they are mostly Americans who don&apos;t want to see America losing in any war it&apos;s typical with them. Give this game a good try and you will really enjoy it. It&apos;s better than what Activision Call of duty offers now years.</span>

<br>
<br>Runs Terrible on Mid-High range PC-Struggle to get more than 50FPS on Medium Settings-I&apos;ve played FPS Games on the PS2 which are better than this junk.,
<br>
<br>I Paid &#xA3;3 for it on steam and even I felt ripped off, Don&apos;t ever try this game, their are enough reviews on here to prove my point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=2492371">Expand</a></span>

At launch it looked crap and dated.  Bad textures and generally poor graphics. Characters that although made to look like grown ups had the dialogue and wit of a bullied 13 year old.  Definately an xbox special. What an utter,utter waste of money.  Seriously made me question buying games anymore and pat myself on the back for ignoring the xbox I bought since I got the first 2 games for it.  However, also scared the crap out of me that this is the future of PC gaming too, locked into being limited by the lowest common denominator and games written only to last a single weekend. Fine for the xbox crowd (they can rent this trash) not so great for if you actually paid for it. particular if your used to state of the art pc gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1621225">Expand</a></span>

At this point all I can say is I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t pick up an additional copy for my son(s) to play...I always get extra copies as I am a gaming dad, but not going to waste my money on this one. Final thoughts are...I really hope they can polish/tweak things a little better or they won&apos;t be seeing any more cashflow from this particular gaming consumer. Please, Homefront devs...read these reviews and fix things. Better still...maybe play some BC2 and COD games and get a feel for what works in them and maybe repeat it...yeah you might not want to copy them but they did something RIGHT that us gamers keep going back to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1533355">Expand</a></span>

The scenes in the game are very intense, it&apos;s the first game i can call an anti-war game, but as I just said, the action in the mid-lategame ruins the plot. The graphics are quite nice, but not for a game in 2011. The A.I. is just silly, just like targets in a shooting range. The scripted events like in the Call of Duty series are too sloppy. After five hours, the game ends ... very disappointing. I think, they just cut the whole story.

This offered so much and really has some great ideas, but it was executed poorly in some areas. Let us discuss the Single Player first: It has a great story idea and something that not many games have: The reality of what war REALLY looks like. Its brutal, dark, and heartbreaking and it just states facts. Some titles like the recent &apos;Call of Duty&apos; shows war like if it was a action packed movie where the good guy always wins. While the story was good and the idea was excellent, it was excited poorly. This game is very VERY scripted. You cant do anything unless the game tells lets you, so it limits the player very much on what they want to do. The game is basically fool proof, which is boring. They do show the brutality of war in this game, but the game shoves it in your face. They show it like &quot;LOOK AT THIS, LOOK HOW BAD WAR IS, LOOK AT THOSE CIVILIANS DYING&quot; which you do want to feel bad, but you cant cause you really cant take it seriously. There are parts where the game makes you gasp, but very few scenes do that. The guns are limited. The game does not give you a whole not of choices which disappoints me, I like variety and so do many other players. The Recoil in the guns is limited, which takes off the realism in the game. The Single Player promised alot, but didnt excite it properly. The NPCs are almost useless, but The story is also very VERY VERY short, expect it to finish it in about 4-6 hours, depends on what difficulty. Now the Multiplayer is where the game shows itself fully. The multiplayer is alot of fun and has a combination of Battlefield games and CoD4. It has something for everyone who enjoys killing players or vehicles. The implementation of BP (Battle Points) was a unite idea, rewarding players who capture points, killing high value targets,  destroying tanks, and just killing players. With those Battle Points, you can purchase tanks, helicopters, drones, or other perks that can benefit the player on the battlefield. Parks are in this game, but the perks you get are worth Points. Every player starts with 4 points and are offered a number of perks that are worth  different number of points. For example, The Quick reload only costs one point, and the &quot;From the Hip&quot; perk costs 3 points, after that you cannot select anymore perks for that loadout. Progressively, you will get more points for each loadout the player has later in levels. The Gametypes are &quot;Ground Control&quot; which is like Bad Company 2&apos;s Rush and Conquest combined together. Theres also Team Deathmatch and in TDM and GC there is another gametype that is allowed in same games: Battle Commander. BC is basically a lone wolf  type of gameplay. Should you go out and go on a killing spree, you are awarded BC. You gain perks the more you kill, but then sends a signal to the opposing team that you are a threat and must be eliminated. The more players you kill, the more are notified and the higher your rank becomes. If a player kills the BC, then he is awarded BP, depending how many stars the BC had. The only complaint I have for the multiplayer, is the recoil on guns and snipers, which is not a problem, but again sniper rifles DO NOT have recoil so they can recover much faster. The multiplayer is alot of fun and is definately worth it.<br><br>In Summary: The SP story is good, but was executed poorly. The Multiplayer is alot of fun and will keep you playing for hours. This is a definite buy for the Multiplayer and a bit for the SP.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1548437">Expand</a></span>

I prefer servers of 20 players or less, the maps feel better with less players. Im runing this game at 1680x1050 very high-motion blur-vsync with an AMD X3 720 8GB of ram and an Nvidia gts460. I dont plan to go back to COD.</span>

Its buggy, incredibly short, full of plot holes and has some pretty bad AI. But I was never buying it for the campaign, I always thought of it as a mp game with some sp tacked which it was. So now, the Multiplayer!<br>This is where the game claims everything back. The graphics are fantastic, which meant nothing to the campaign but makes the mp alot more enjoyable. The game had a pretty trouble free release, when compared with Crytek and Crysis 2, Homefronts release was very good for a new non AAA IP. The multiplayer is very fun, it is very much a cross between COD and Battlefield drawing inspiration from both but really making it its own game. The maps vary in size, some feel very COD like and others are more Battlefield size, the bigger ones allow you to purchase vehicles whereas the smaller ones don&apos;t. There aren&apos;t many game modes just Team Deathmatch and one akin to Domination in COD. But Domination retains the fun with an advance retreat system whereby the starting 3 control points are in the middle of the map. The team who reaches the intial score limit first advances and the others retreat you then play another round  in the losing teams area with 3 new control points, then if the same team wins its over, if the other team wins you then advance back to the centre, its a very nice system and keeps the games fun. The game skeep going if its a close battle and end quickly if its an annihilation.<br>It also means that maps stay interesting, I have been playing for many hours and around my 20th hour still advanced to an area I had never seen before. The weapons handle nicely, the upgarde system is very good, similar to cod but your money isn&apos;t permanent and you have to buy uavs/armor/rpgs/airstrikes with money earnt on a game by game basis. There are many other unique homefront features to this game all add a little bit more to it then either COD or Battlefield.<br>Overall this game is a great mp game and I am enjoying it alot, its a reliable game that seems to have good connectivity. The icing on the cake would be dlc that adds some more maps and maybe more game modes! But for now its still loads of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1562798">Expand</a></span>

In this game it all comes down to who is working harder and your KDR does not take the hit it did in BF2 for doing so. It rewards in battle heroics with points used to buy assets (GENIUS!) in a more team oriented fashion than CoD and let&apos;s not even get started with hacks and hit detection. This game beats the other titles HANDS DOWN! I&apos;ve seen little hacker and even then, they were not the god&apos;s the hacks allow in other games. Singleplayer sucks but if you are buying a FPS for single, you&apos;re either 9 or incredibly stupid.<br>Remember, BF2 was the greatest of all time and they had NO single. Just bots that did nothing to prepare you for what was coming. BC2, MoH, CoD do not hold a candle to this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=1570146">Expand</a></span>
