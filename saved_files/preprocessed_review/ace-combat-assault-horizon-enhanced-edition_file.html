Wish I hadn&apos;t bothered. The inclusion of other vehicles such as bombers and helicopters was a good idea, but poorly executed. Controls are clunky at best, imprecise and frustrating. Meanwhile air combat has taken giant leaps backwards, with semi quick-time events apparently passing as &apos;dogfights&apos;. The old thrill of chasing and gunning down enemies has been cast aside. 50% of your enemies possess near infinite supplies of flares to render missiles useless, forcing you into &apos;DFM&apos; quick-time events along pre-scripted flight paths, automatically flown while you aim an awkward reticule to gun and shoot your enemy. Refusal to conform to this &apos;DFM&apos; mode is punished by almost every enemy in the sky locking on you with DFM themselves in what is only describable as &apos;exaggerated&apos; flight maneuvers, in which all previous plane handling mechanics are now cast aside. Enemies miraculously remain locked 200m from your tail, no matter what, unless you conform once more to the rather awkward &apos;counter-maneuver&apos; system, as missiles chase you in a similar fashion. I could go on but I think the impression comes across. Worth buying? For anyone who&apos;s ever enjoyed a true Ace Combat game - no. Not unless you want to see a good example of what NOT to include in an Ace Combat game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2920602">Expand</a></span>

Ace Combat has been around for a long time, they must know what they are doing! Wrong.
<br>
<br>DFM takes control away from you.  In the game, there are &apos;normal&apos; enemies, and than there are &apos;leader&apos;, otherwise known as &apos;aces&apos; in all the other games.  The tough guys that took a bit more maneuvering and skill to take down in all the other games.  In this game, the only way to defeat these guys is to enter DFM.  Once you get close enough to them, you press a button, and your plane automatically starts tailing them.   You have some control; your speed and limited movement.  Just enough for you have to aim, but not enough to feel like you are flying.   The only purpose for this is to make it look a bit flashier, but it wears off really quickly.  Its poorly executed mechanics to excite children and CoD jocks. (which is probably the only reason there are some good reviews of this game)
<br>
<br>The enemy also has the opportunity to initiate DFM with you as well.  Once again, it misses the mark.  It consists of speeding up, slowing down, and hitting a button.
<br>
<br>The skill of this game has been replaced by cheap parlor tricks to make it look flashy.  They dropped the focus on a great story, and put their efforts into changing the game so its not even recognizable a Ace Combat game.  They changed the way the game is played after multiple titles, so its now just a shell of its former self that is riding on the coat tails of the franchise name.  Its not the Ace Combat you grew to love.  Its a cheap air combat simulator that stole the name of a great series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4377850">Expand</a></span>

<br>The DFM</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">A disappointing watered down version of Ace Combat, dog fighting has been reduced to a rail shooter set up, planes can &apos;Heal&apos; Damage. And a series that was once famous for a relatively realistic depiction of modern fighter combat now has me watching in wonder as a plane continually fires 6 missiles at me while I sit on its tail hitting it over and over to seemingly no effect.
<br>
<br>The DFM mechanic was an unnecessary and unwelcome addition to the game that left me with headaches and no small amount of frustration, I am armed with heat seeking and radar guided missiles, why am I forced to continually close to guns range, this isn&apos;t exciting its tedious, there is no variation in the battles I found myself in. Be warned, there is no real control of your fighter in this game, there is no XYZ axis controls, you will be taking massive loops if you ever miss anything, there is no rudder or aileron control, you will be flying in straight lines until you get to the rail shooting and only the most basic moves will be available to you.
<br>
<br>The quick time event DFM creates also seems a little buggy, sometimes it works, and sometimes I&apos;ll be hammering the button while my fighter gets shot to pieces. Some missions contain frustrating beginners traps forcing you to wade through it again and again until you figure out what you are supposed to be doing.
<br>
<br>Story is lackluster and predictable, the Unsung War this is not not, the narrative is broken and disjointed, the characters are generally flat, and you know nothing about them. The attempt to build up the main villain is silly, either the main character is an honest to god psychic, or his opponent is beaming it into his mind. Otherwise this match up makes no sense, they have no reason to personally hate each other, they&apos;ve never met. The final boss fight is a giant disappointment, teeth grindingly frustrating due to the forced DFM usage, there is no real climax, the plot just kind of meanders with no rhyme or reason.
<br>
<br>Overall: Play the Unsung War if you want to play a good Ace combat game, leave this in the bargin bin</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4388626">Expand</a></span>

<br>A real Ace Combat fan would delete this piece of **** from their hard drives and play the PS2 games over it.
<br>It&apos;s sad that a more recent, amazing looking game could have such a terrible story, terrible characters and overall poor quality. This game used to have a niche appeal and now they&apos;re trying to spread it out. It&apos;s not like I don&apos;t understand, I honestly do. You just did a very poor job with it.
<br>
<br>I wouldn&apos;t give it a 1. I wouldn&apos;t give it a 6. The graphics make up a lot for the ****ness of the story campaign but it&apos;s still pathetic, mostly because dogfight mode takes away control of your flying so you can&apos;t even look at the nice scenery! That is its biggest problem... taking control away from the player.
<br>
<br>Stick to the formula, guys. It&apos;s best to have a dedicated following than no following at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4108368">Expand</a></span>

<br>Not set in the AC universe - instead you play as variety of American pilots and consequently character development suffers.

<br>I&apos;ll start by stating that I didn&apos;t play any other installment of Ace Combat and therefore I don&apos;t look at this game as a fan of the series, but simply gave this specific installment a try. I&apos;m also not too experienced with flight games in general.
<br>Horizon Assault is a very arcadic game in almost every sense of the word.
<br>The story is, as you&apos;d expect from this type of games, very predictable, generic, unsurprising, and not that vital for the game.
<br>
<br>For a moment the game may seem like a flight simulator but it&apos;s definitely not, It&apos;s good at making you feel AS IF you&apos;re flying an aircraft, AS IF you&apos;re doing big stuff with the scripted explosions everywhere.
<br>And that&apos;s actually one of the strong points of the game, it&apos;s very good with BOOMING stuff, with making you feel that YOU are booming stuff, and it gives you an addicting sense of action and thrill, although with completely unrealistic mechanics at times (e.g. aircraft &quot;heals&quot; itself automatically while flying), but who cares, it&apos;s a video game.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s soundtrack also adds a LOT to the game, and as one who really cares about music in video games and is giving it a lot of attention, this game has one of the best tracks in video game soundtracks, in my opinion, with a combination of symphonic music with some electronicrock touches every once in a while. Splendid, really!
<br>
<br>Unfortunately there are also reasons for you to stay away from Horizon Assault. Controls aren&apos;t most comfortable ever&#x2026; Binding different keys won&apos;t help much. It can get confusing at times and at the beginning of the game I felt like quitting because I simply couldn&apos;t get hold of this DAMN helicopter. As soon as I got the hang of it, it started to get fun, though, but fun it really different and is a matter of perspective. And many people won&apos;t find this game fun at all.
<br>
<br>The gameplay can get extremely repetitive and frustrating. The developers tried to keep it varied and in a way they succeeded in it, but it&apos;s still starting to feel generic and monotonous at times. Another thing which many people would hate is the Dog-Fight System, which is presented as an optional way to hunt your enemies but is actually your only way of getting through this game. And it can be horribly frustrating as well.
<br>
<br>So, are you going to enjoy this game? That&apos;s really a matter of one&apos;s taste and expectations.
<br>I enjoyed it, mostly, and if you can enjoy some intense action sequences with things getting blown away with dramatic music in the background and some clich&#xE9;d &quot;saving America&quot; story, it&apos;s possible you&apos;d enjoy this as well.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s possible you&apos;d hate it, if that&apos;s not your kind &#x2026;
<br>
<br>Another note, out of the three times I&apos;ve tried playing this game in multiplayer mode, I&apos;ve managed to find other players to play with only once. So, my guess is that the multiplayer scene of Horizon Assault isn&apos;t very active. There&apos;s also no way to play over LAN, so, I could be wrong but I believe Horizon Assault pretty much leaves you with solely the single player missions. You should keep that in mind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5634831">Expand</a></span>

Here&apos;s my take.
<br>
<br>This is a shockingly bad game. To call it a game is being generous, it is an insult to my intelligence. The missions are entirely scripted, checkpoints are bafflingly placed at times, and I found myself repeatedly having to turn all sound off, because hearing the same bad Russian accent shout the same tired line for the 30th time was really getting on my nerves. The game&apos;s script faults lie in a number of places - events you only get one shot at, like doing a bombing run flawlessly first try, otherwise you have to reload checkpoints and do all the other bombing runs prior to it, over and over and over. Other areas are even worse, the final mission has you in dogfight mode until a certain number of scripted events happen. The enemy you are dogfighting is invulnerable, but you are not. Missiles come at you from all sides, but missiles you shoot at him will not hit until the whole script is over. I will not spoil the mechanic for how this happens, but I can assure you, actually outplaying the games AI only to have it cheat is immensely frustrating. I never finished the final mission as I just couldn&apos;t stand to repeat that script any longer. Frequently, enemies would double back and fly directly through my plane, probably breaking a couple rules of physics. This frustrated me for two reasons, some of the scripts are reliant on you remaining in dogfight mode, and I occasionally used one of my few special weapons, only to have the enemy double back immediately and pass right through them.
<br>
<br>Sound is good. That&apos;s about the only thing that is, however. My graphics card is currently experiencing overheating issues, this game did not give me any problems. Why? Well, the game&apos;s not very pretty. It isn&apos;t very ugly, but it&apos;s not pretty. For some people who play action games on the PC, this matters. For me, I prefer the narratives and gameplay, gameplay we&apos;ve covered. Well, the narrative. The narrative isn&apos;t bad. It isn&apos;t good. It&apos;s forgettable, which is arguably worse. Many missions I just tuned out the scripted voices of my &apos;co-pilot&apos;s. Some aspects are so cliche they made me cringe - low grade machismo underscored with cold war era racism and predictable twists. You get given control of your characters head in most areas, so you can look around, during some of the more cinematic moments but nothing more. It doesn&apos;t impact the game in any way and as pretty much everything is taking place in grey military bases, there isn&apos;t a lot to see to begin with.
<br>
<br>I experienced an occasional crash to desktop, but the game is pretty good at returning you to your last checkpoint. I feel like this has been a waste of a couple days, and I did not pay money for the product. I would not recommend anybody else do so. If you do, play it on easy, because you really don&apos;t want to be playing this game for its aerial combat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4386311">Expand</a></span>

<br>The flight model is a joke, the jets bend the laws of physics to their will a stupid amount. Missiles target you out of nowhere. The final mission is one jet shooting missiles backwards into you. Jets take a stupid amount of missiles to takes down, and it must all be done in DFM mode.
<br>
<br>The story is   me it&apos;s awful. Here&apos;s the entire storyline  &quot;YOU THE MAN NOW&quot; followed by some russian chirping in &quot;hue hue hue vodka&quot;.
<br>
<br>If you consider this an anywhere near reflection of real flying just please kill yourself now and do the rest of the human race a favour, the game is a joke. Honestly it&apos;s not even worth the time to play it, I wouldn&apos;t even bother pirating it.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re willing to put aside it&apos;s flaws and just have fun, I doubt you will have even that. Honestly I would prefer my time back as opposed to playing this game. It will frustrate you to incredible heights as missiles from not existant enemies shoot you down for not using DFM. I have seen enemy planes literally warp in behind me, and ground units not appearing on the map, even though there&apos;s a green target reticle.
<br>
<br>Ignore the marketers and other members of the team giving it 10s and 9s. The game is a joke, paying money for it would be even more laughable</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2942231">Expand</a></span>

I have no idea why they decided to put on that stuff. Plus the cut scenes of chase are absolutely linear and boring. Exciting in the first time but on the second time you go through the same chase cut scenes, it definitely bores me off. Ace Combat has always been known to me as a casual arcade air combat game where missiles can be fired off a distance at any styles or stunt but this new DRM feature, it certainly throws them off. I just can&apos;t seem to think how after I&apos;ve gone all through the loops and stunts to shoot an enemy in DRM mode, the plane simply levels off perfectly flat as if there were no sense of logic at all. Totally ridiculous. And by the way, the story line sucks. I prefer to stick to the former story line of Ace Combat featuring the fictional continents. I find AC5&apos;s story line to be much better than this one. There are fewer missions in this game than previous one &amp; again, it stresses me out having to use DRM all the time. That&apos;s the feature that threw me off this game. I gave a point for the graphics though. No doubt it&apos;s much better but the rest 9 points are lost due to game mechanics and story line.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3058812">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now for the review:
<br>Comparing this one to previous ace combat titles I have to admit this one pushed it to another level with DFM (I played almost all titles in multiplayer).
<br>Simply put, DFM makes this title much more intense and gives you some nice adrenaline injections in multiplayer and in some missions  last missions are much harder and enjoyable because of it) where previous ace combat titles all you needed to do was lock at 2.5k-4k kilometers behind target and fire double missiles with rails being unplayable at ranges less than 750 kilometers, and it was pretty much the same in competitive online.
<br>NOTE: Campaign wise, this game does NOT forces you to DFM all targets!! You can dispose of most of the targets in the campaign while not using DFM. However, some targets that have a &quot;TGT_LEAD&quot; mark on them most be disposed off using DFM because they are relevant to the overall feel of the campaign progression and these count as 5% (at most!) of all targets in the campaign. So you can still enjoy yourself striking some targets down the old Ace Combat way. Needed to clarify that.
<br>
<br>Difficulty:
<br>- If you are a casual gamer (previous ace combat titles were more casual friendly) you will find it very hard (and frustrating) to beat certain missions in the difficulties Elite and Ace if you do not force yourself to learn the hard way, which is being persistent and be whiling to learn, not just give up and trash the game as most of the people that downgrade this game usually do. Harder difficulties in this game (Elite and Ace, specially Ace) live up to their word, unlike previous ace combat titles where the harder difficulty was not hard at all and it didn&apos;t require that much skill or practice.
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>- As for story, if you are that type of player that values skill,ace pilots and drama, you will love the antagonist and the setting that pans out at the end. You will not like the protagonist that much and the ending itself. They should have made more content story wise in the later half of the campaign. It just feels a little bit rushed over &amp;/or they ran out of ideas.
<br>- The helicopter, bomber and gun additions were good but not necessary, that&apos;s why I really appreciate they still focusing more on the Jet aspect. After all, Its Ace Combat, helicopters and gunships are welcome only if they come and go fast.
<br>
<br>Mechanics:
<br>- They should have made the DFM circles shorter and longer to charge at very close range to add up more skill and difficulty in both single and multiplayer.
<br>- Counter maneuvers are hard to execute if you don&apos;t understand its mechanics at all. I&apos;ve seen people complaining and trashing this game just because they don&apos;t bother to think and practice its functionality, and it pretty much sums up most of all the DFM hate.
<br>- About flares, players and NPCs DON&apos;T have an infinite amount of flares, if anyone fails to realize this is because they are just bad or incredibly frustrated for reasons I mentioned above.
<br>
<br>So all in all, its a very fun and somewhat demanding game that makes your adrenaline rush and damages your controller, specially in multiplayer</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3901097">Expand</a></span>

You will be bombarded with missiles and bullets until you evade the enemy, meaning you will lose track of your target and it&apos;s game over.
<br>
<br>And the worst thing about the game is, leaders of enemy squads cant be taken out in the old Ace Combat style, now you have to use a stupid dog fight mode. Another series ruined because people want more arcade hollywood action in their game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2925969">Expand</a></span>

I will first start by saying the positive and that this game is pretty solid and bug free, runs well, even for a console port. However my gripe is with the god awful gameplay. This whole game is on rails. Not sure how you can manage to put a aircraft game on rails, but they do. First off the mission maps are small (The ones where you can actually fly around.) I am not expecting a flight Sim, this is Ace Combat, but basic flight characteristic should be present as in other Ace Combats. 2 speeds, Stall and afterburners. Oh you think you can fly and dog fighting using your own tactics like in other ace combats??? LOL No. Everything forces you to use this stupid (DFM) mode. Which is pretty much a roller coast auto pilot, where your airplane pulls UFO maneuvers as you try to try to shoot down the enemy... and your pretty much not even flying the plane. So you can fly through Hollywood explosions... Plus for some reason some targets dont even die and 8 direct hits unless you enter Rollercoaster on rails Mode. So  stupid! Think you can fly a stealth aircraft and fly through radar undetected? lol... According to Ace Combat you need to fly at low altitude through a radar screen.... Why? I have a B-2 that can fly through it at high altitude. In fact, you would be more vulnerable to be detected from your engines being heard from that low... I dont mind Arcade aircraft games, but that DFM Rollercoaster-cant-kill-anything-without-using-it mode is by far the worst idea to be used in a aircraft game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3645774">Expand</a></span>

Great music, dynamic gameplay, nice graphic. I scored this game at 10/10, but multiplayer is not playable. Lags, hight ping, sometimes not find anyone.</span>

The controls are awesome I love the lock on mechanic it really sets it apart from other flight games and I&apos;ve played a lot of them.  The only complaint that I have is that the missions can seem kind of long and this is the only reason I did not give it a 10. To me this is the next step in arcade flight games. I feel like racing games have come a long way over the years and now developers know how to fine tune the mechanics in the game to give the player the best experience and I believe that that is what this game has done for arcade flight games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2927667">Expand</a></span>

I love how this time it is in real settings and not a fantasy world. Graphics on the pc are stunning. I have seen no lag or any issues what so ever so far.

                                        <span>I am a huge fan of the Ace Combat series. This installment was a step in the wrong direction. I am really disappointed by DFM. Seriously, what is the point? Dog fighting with machine guns like we are flying biplanes. Where is the fun in that? If I wanted to play a WW2 pilot game I would do that.</span>

<br>Graphics struck in 2008, controls....forgot about controls, plot is look&apos;s like composed out of mental clinic patients graphomany attempts. Require Windows Live.

In this game you start off as a Colonel and you play other roles also during the game.
<br>I haven&apos;t completed the game so won&apos;t comment on the story yet but so far it looks good to me and to be honest you don&apos;t need a story to play a aerial combat game anyway. Its always the same, kill that, protect that and all so story is irrelevant really in these games, however gameplay matters a lot and this is where this game really shines. Yes the controls are sometimes awkward to me, I mean I have wasted many Flares because of weird controls but still the game offers you so much variety that you&apos;ll play the game anyway. You can kill the enemy from behind, enter Dogfight mode or Counter the missiles, all are there and enemies does that too so you have to be on edge specially on hard difficulty. I have a compaint that I am unable to roll my plane and do my favorite maneuvers   but still I can&apos;t take away from this game that this game is darn good Arcade Aerial combat I have seen.
<br>
<br>Graphics are top notch and damage details of the planes are amazing. When you shoot down a plane then you&apos;ll really think that yes I have nailed him. Although Buildings looks nice but damage details on them in not very good To be honest, also the ground doesn&apos;t look that good as compared to other details but be rest assured that it would be much better than HAW 2 or anything for that matter.
<br>
<br>Talking about sound, I have nothing to complaint about and nothing to praise about also, I would say its nice and good but not that good that it would give you OMG or WTF feeling but visuals would for sure.
<br>
<br>Also the game is very well optimized for PC and runs fine without lags which is a big relief considering some console ports being terribly bad lately, kudos to developers for achieving that.
<br>
<br>All in all a very nice game which you should not miss by any chance if you like Aerial Combat games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3293192">Expand</a></span>

Ace combat is a fighter simulator.... stop trying to be everything else. It isn&apos;t working. I gave up halfway; the helicopter controls are unplayable on a joystick.</span>

It has variety of aircraft, missiles and other weapons. The multiplayer has more problems(connection problems) than the campaign. if you like simulation games the pick one.

Personally, I had a blast, but I did miss the more hands-on approach of its predecessors. Everything is geared toward delivering frantic in-your-face moments, a la Call of Dookie, so realism takes a backseat. With a blistering sense of speed and copious amounts of explosions, smoke, and shrapnel flying your way, it does manage to deliver its fair share of white-knuckle moments. So, if casual arcade shooting and blowing s**t up sounds like your cup of tea, then look no further. Assult Horizon is shallow, but also happens to be fairly pretty and fun to hang out with--so it&apos;s good for at least one date. It&apos;s also dirt cheap.

I can understand why hardcore fans didn&apos;t like this game due to DMR and other unrealistic features.
<br>Personally I liked the game.. Alot! We already have MANY jet simulators so why not some AAA arcade games too. The game is really action packed and with DMR, that works really well by the way keeps the gameplay intense. The game also features a wide variety of high detailed jet fighters. The soundtracks are also good.
<br>
<br>I think it isnt fair to vote down this game only because it is &quot;too unrealistic&quot;. I don&apos;t think the developers actually wanted to create a simulator of this concept. They clearly wanted to create an arcade game wich everyone could enjoy. And for you who actually played the game: THIS PARTICULARY GAME IS NOT AN SIMULATOR IT IS AN ARCADE GAME. I would call this one a spinoff from the original games!
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>The gameplay was fun and intense, and if you like mindless action and badass jet fights this is the game to get.

<br>
<br>Anyways, don&apos;t buy this piece of crap. There&apos;s ZERO gameplay in this game. You just to a cleck, select a enemy and the game kills it for you. Really, the game locks on the enemy and that&apos;s it, you got you kill.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s pretty much an unplayable game in the sense that you don&apos;t play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6021951">Expand</a></span>

It is an arcade, nervous, pick and play, flight combat game that I really enjoyed playing. It is clear that the game makers were trying to mirror the Call of Duty&apos;s campaign mode strengths. In other words, the campaign is explosive, very intense, nervous, and chaotic at moments, as if you are part of a Michael Bay movie. I personally found it very refreshing and I hope that future sequels will keep this vision. Finally keep in mind that this is not a hardcore/realistic flight simulator. Below are my pros and cons :
<br>
<br>Positives:
<br>* Awesome campaign mode.
<br>* Easy gameplay (with depth at high levels)
<br>* Nervous (dog)fights.
<br>* Great music and sounds (The japanese voices are outstanding. The english ones are not so good/bad).
<br>* Pick and play (meaning you don&apos;t need to know who is who, or what is what, or what combination of buttons you need to press to make X or Y spell, or when you need to meet Z person at N&apos;s location, etc... Just relax, pick your pad, get in this explosive universe, and enjoy yourself).
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>* The scenario is a very &quot;japanese&quot; take on US politics/conflicts.
<br>* Short campaign (but very intense and fun).
<br>
<br>Thanks to the developers for the enjoyable experience!
<br>

Glad I hesitated when I heard about the quicktime-like events. Now it&apos;s free-weekend on Steam, so I gave it a try. Sadly, it turns out to be as disappointing as everyone says. At first the assisted dog-fighting was somewhat fun, but it got boring and then annoying very fast. I tried to like it, but I just couldn&apos;t. Worst of all, it&apos;s pretty much mandatory to use, unlike the assistance-off &amp; ERS modes in HAWX for example (which were actually fun to use). The sad thing is, the game is fine in every other way and deserves a much better grade for everything else. It&apos;s just the dogfight-assist that breaks the most important/fun part of the whole game: the one-on-one fights with skilled enemies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4384809">Expand</a></span>

That is because it sort of plays itself ... either that.. or it runs on rails ( semi rails ). It felt much like a Call of Duty in the skies - and hardly ever did the sky feel ... that small.
<br>
<br>Watching it is like watching an action movie - and like many action movies - they became a bit stale and repetitive. After the first excitement wears off though... one spots muddy ground textures under rather sparse enviromental modelling. In fact the places look like an older flight simulator.
<br>
<br>The plane models are ok, but also do lack detail.
<br>
<br>What bothers me the most is the flight models. - NEVER did it feel like flying a plane; there is no weight - and the agility of the jets is ridiculously over the top.
<br>
<br>to top it even more - those &quot;lead&quot; planes can only be taken down in the dogfight mode - and while that mode spices the monotony up every now and then - there are simply too many lead planes - making that chase mode very very stale - very quickly.
<br>
<br>to close that review - the story and characters are quite forgettable. It is sad that there are only really two games of that genre on PC - HAWX and this - and they are both fairly bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4705487">Expand</a></span>

My biggest gripe with the game is the fact that often, when you are chasing a high-ranking bad-guy, he will become unkillable until he leads you to a certain location, just so a cool killcam can occur. This bothered me because I feel it stifles your freedom as a pilot and negatively effects gameplay, just for the sake of showing off the visuals (which are fantastic btw). The controls take a little getting used to, especially if you&apos;ve played past Ace Combat titles on the playstation, but should be no problem after a few hours of gameplay.

The series is an awesome one, but the last two titles they released have been the worst of the series by far. I wouldn&apos;t play this game if it was given to me for free, unfortunately I wasted money buying it without doing some researching before hand. Shame on me for assuming this game would of been great, since the graphic advancement I wanted so badly to play this game on PC.
<br>
<br>The horrible thing is the DFM(Dog fighting mode) which on bosses means you have to get close to them to enter this mode and it just ruined it. I mean why would you tamper with a game which has been dominating flight games since PS1. I just don&apos;t get it, and for that I&apos;d honestly have to say don&apos;t even bother playing this game. While the graphics are amazing, the game just is crap and they shouldn&apos;t of introduced that into a game, or rather they should of at least given an option to disable it if you didn&apos;t want to play with it on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4655830">Expand</a></span>

Aproach this one with caution.
<br>
<br>well,it feels like ace combat,plays for the most part like ace combat, but it has one mechanic that Kills it,DFM and ASM. those sections,when Scripted are Terrible,and makes the fights with aces,Especially the one with a certain shark nosed Plane Pilot, Unfufilling. At First,they are cool,but repeat them,over,and over,and over again,and you&apos;ll see what i mean. and this is agravated if you played other Ace Combat games on the consoles, that really demanded skills from you.
<br>
<br>so,it&apos;s a Hard game?! Far from it. Easy,even on the Ace Difficulty,but it has it&apos;s B*SH*T moments.
<br>Is a Bad Ace combat game?! by my standards,Yes. Namco has done better with its franchises.
<br>But it&apos;s a Bad game?! HELL NO.
<br>
<br>The better pros i gotta say is: the cutscenes that are awesomely made, the Aircraft Collor editor that even to this date i revisit, and the Awesome models,beautifull with full interiors made by Project aces.
<br>
<br>But the Unforgivable Cons i gotta repeat: The DFM and ASM are not good systems when done Scripted like 60% of the game. some sections are not,but they fell a bit cluncky to control,and i tend to lose control quickly. another Con is that the control on this game is very sensitive,even on the most Non-Sensitive setting,so it doesn&apos;t feel like Ace 5,6,or Cross Rumble,and you get to have tighter reflexes to adapt on how the Jets fly on this game. they feel different,but horrible?! no... just,worse. and those aspects i&apos;m glad that namcobandai got right on the next games of the franchise,that can and MUST keep going in the direction it was since Ace Combat 3 (jp)... that by the way i still wait for a remake of that game... but let&apos;s not get out of the tangent.
<br>
<br>My final Veredict: 7/10. Is not a Bad game, i can recomend for you who want a Different Experience all togheter.
<br>But if you are a Ace fan,as a said Aproach with caution or Don&apos;t go for it.(or at least,wait untill the price drop if you want to experiment with this beast).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4692887">Expand</a></span>

Story first of all is just obnoxious with the dead worn Russia is the bad guy setting and simply cringe worthy dialogue, characters are also insanely stereo typical. Gameplay was disappointing aswell, while planes control well enough, the awfully scripted dog fights took away all the fun and introducing helicopter warfare was a monumental mistake. AC 130 and Blackhawk gunner missions felt also out of place and werent done that well at all.

<br>Graphics wise game looked fairly good as long you were high in skies dog fithing fighting with nice weather and could effects, once you got closer to the ground, huge buldings or water you could be fooled by thinking youre playing a PlayStation 2 game. Jet fighters and 2 bombers were modeled excellent tho, but helis felt lacking.
<br>
<br>Also if youre planning getting this on PC, BE SURE to have a Xbox 360 controller, game plays abysmaly on mouse and kboard, but thats understandable cuz game was designed for it. Its also clear this game a console port, a decent one at that, but dont expect lots of graphics options, game itself runs excellent with 60 fps all the way thru.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-combat-assault-horizon-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6787854">Expand</a></span>
