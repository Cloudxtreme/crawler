Home is reminiscent of 2D adventure games where the player navigates the main character through a series of pixelated homes, caves, and woods.  Along the way, he finds clues to recovering his memory about the events leading up to the present situation.  The problem is, by the time you finish this short hour to two hour game, you are left with so many unanswered questions that even if you wanted to pretend the game had a certain narrative you would have no foundation to support it.  Without any other sustaining gameplay to speak of, Home is the worst $2 I ever spent.  The game seems to be an exercise in allowing players to forge their own narratives, one that Home executes poorly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/home/user-reviews?user_review_id=2974186">Expand</a></span>

I am not a point and click kind of person, I got about 30 minutes-an hour into the game and I completely got bored with it, there was no more reasons to play. I thank the lord that game was only two dollars, because trust me, it was not worth it whatsoever. You want a real, atmospheric, hands-on game? Get Amnesia: The Dark Decent. I will put a review up of it once I get into the game a little more than I have. But, for this game, I&apos;m sorry but I just can&apos;t continue to play this game. I immediately uninstalled it after playing it. I found it fun at first, than I noticed all you did was hit a button and something happened. It was a bore.

Unfortunately, this aspect is seriously buggy and ultimately amounts to little more than your character offering tiny little blurbs that affirm &quot;Yes, I did that/saw that.&quot; The game is basically set up as a mystery, presented in a side-scrolling perspective with a few agonizingly simple puzzles (one &quot;puzzle&quot; essentially being realizing that your character is too dumb to complete a task in one attempt without goading from the player). The mystery itself, however, is the biggest disappointment. It&apos;s one of those stories that uses the &quot;open to interpretation&quot; cop-out to get by with presenting questions and never having to come up with answers  what I call the &quot;Lost&quot; school of writing. There&apos;s some okay brooding atmosphere at first, but it becomes obvious very, very quickly that your character is in absolutely no danger, so the only tension you&apos;re left with is the fear that you might hear a creak or footstep or ambient noise somewhere. It&apos;s a single novel concept (of very flawed execution), namely the adaptive narrative, buried in nonexistent gameplay and a completely absent plot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3722798">Expand</a></span>

There is no ultimate objective, no invulnerable horror chasing you down, no health or numbers to gauge your success or failure. Instead, Home offers a plodding journey for answers in a dank world of numerous questions. Who did what? Am I the evil or the oppressed? Is everything as straightforward as it seems or convoluted as I fear? If these questions intrigue you, and if the opportunity to shape their answers by your choices is an equally appealing concept, I wholeheartedly recommend this short but fascinating adventure. Just don&apos;t expect your trip home to leave you entirely fulfilled; not all questions have answers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/home/user-reviews?user_review_id=2602036">Expand</a></span>

For 3 dollars however this game doesn&apos;t put you much in the whole however, so if you are into these sorts of games get it. Just a little notice. This is not a horror game You will never be scared, you cannot lose. While it is eerie you never are fearful. Either way, it is an interesting game, take a look at it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/home/user-reviews?user_review_id=2615299">Expand</a></span>

This game obviously has a positive nostalgic factor to me being from the &quot;old school&quot; days of PC gaming but that&apos;s not what I appreciate the most. The fact is this game is what you make of it, in some ways it&apos;s a very organic collision of literature and video games, which is something that I&apos;ve never seen quite captured they way Home does. What stands out to me is this game respects the person playing it. We&apos;ve all played games that have multiple endings, evolving story-lines, whatever you care to call it however this, IMHO, is different in the fact part of the game plays out partially in your mind, not in the games code. While playing &quot;through&quot; this a couple times I never once felt like I was being pandered to or sold short. In the end, this game represents what I consider positive about PC gaming: An independent creator giving gamers something that respects their intellect and is fun and honestly a bit weird and creepy. I&apos;m giving this 10/10 based on creativity, atmosphere, the fact I&apos;m willing to pay attention and even play it multiple times and finally gratitude for not creating just another game that assumes we&apos;re all drooling idiots.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/home/user-reviews?user_review_id=2608323">Expand</a></span>

This Game is not perfect but really deserves a good Score, and my Money too. It was just 2 Dollars on Steam. And i have to say, i don&apos;t feel guilty that i purchased this Game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/home/user-reviews?user_review_id=2721878">Expand</a></span>

This game obviously has a positive nostalgic factor to me being from the &quot;old school&quot; days of PC gaming but that&apos;s not what I appreciate the most. The fact is this game is what you make of it, in some ways it&apos;s a very organic collision of literature and video games, which is something that I&apos;ve never seen quite captured they way Home does. What stands out to me is this game respects the person playing it. We&apos;ve all played games that have multiple endings, evolving story-lines, whatever you care to call it however this, IMHO, is different in the fact part of the game plays out partially in your mind, not in the games code. While playing &quot;through&quot; this a couple times I never once felt like I was being pandered to or sold short. In the end, this game represents what I consider positive about PC gaming: An independent creator giving gamers something that respects their intellect and is fun and honestly a bit weird and creepy. I&apos;m giving this 10/10 based on creativity, atmosphere, the fact I&apos;m willing to pay attention and even play it multiple times and finally gratitude for not creating just another game that assumes we&apos;re all drooling idiots.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3088737">Expand</a></span>

You make choices, many choices may I add, that ACTUALLY CHANGE THE STORY. It takes about one hour and a half to complete the game, however the game is only 2 pounds (sometimes less). The game has lots of replayability and it is very enjoyable to watch other people, such as your friends, play it and see which choices they make. The story is intriguing, and there are literally HUNDREDS OF ENDINGS. This isn&apos;t a game for everyone, but if you like making choices and don&apos;t judge games by their graphics, you might want to check &apos;Home&apos; out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3165371">Expand</a></span>

This game has so many possible endings that i have tried to uncover and yet, i still get more. It has a great plotline that anyone can interpret. there are conspiracies behind everything. It has unlimited replay value and i highly recommend it.</span>

<br>I like the stylized graphics but that is about it. SpaceBar  Down Arrow key is pretty much all you need to remember when playing the game. Because there is no danger of dying in this game, the horror element pretty much disappears. At that point you say, why am I playing it? The story of course right? Well, the story is a bit of a mess. I won&apos;t mention anything but lets just say it tries to make connections to stuff that really just doesn&apos;t mesh together. The game goes pretty much something like this, Pick up a Note  Read, Pick up another note   Read. Look at a monitor  Read. At this point I should really just ask for a book because the designer apparently wrote one and could have saved me the motions of using action keys SpaceBar+Down Arrow Key. &quot;You see a dead body&quot; appears on the screen but instead of seeing a Dead body you are reading it. I want to see a Dead Body!
<br>I gave this game a 1 due to its interesting graphics that reminded me of older Sierra Online games like Kings Quest or Space Quest. However those games were much better than this by a long shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3412971">Expand</a></span>

Play it the same way you would watch a pilot TV show for one hour, hopefully it&apos;ll keep you interested to the end. It lacks a high score because: * The storyline really isn&apos;t that deep, requiring your imagination to make it so and fill the gaps. * I&apos;m not a huge fan of these retro basic graphics that are going around. * If you take the recommendation of playing in the dark, reduce screen gamma, it is not so easy on the eye. * And finally, the storyline simply isn&apos;t strange enough to really ignite your imagination (e.g. as in The Path). It gets the 6/10 for the hour of entertainment it was, for $2, with nice sound effects, a nice concept that could be built upon, and you mildly wonder what it was all about. I like games that try new things. This one is in the right direction, but needs more strangeness, real interaction with consequences, scary moments, and a decent voiceover might be good.

<br>If you&apos;re looking for a game with a big story (e.g. Gemini Rue), you will be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/home/user-reviews?user_review_id=2806132">Expand</a></span>

We start with our nameless protagonist in an unknown house in the middle of the night with no memories how or why he got there. The story gets more interesting when he finds a dead body in the next room.
<br>
<br>The most engaging aspects of this game are how the story is told and the atmosphere. First, the story is never complete. As you make your way from the house to your home you can find clues about the events that have happened and piece together the murders. How much you find and how much you progress in being &apos;Sherlock&apos; is completely up to the player. This ambiguity is the most sparkling and the most trembling part of the game at the same time. The conclusion of the game will vary based on what you discovered and what choices you have made throughout the game. This undoubtedly will leave many frustrated and with a lot of questions after finishing the game. In this case a replay of the game is needed, but unfortunately it might not bring the resolutions players want to see.
<br>
<br>While the graphics and the music (there is no music) aren&apos;t the strongest parts of the game, the atmosphere is. It is highly recommended to play this game in one sitting, at night, with headphones on. The crackling wood, loud thunders, footsteps with the visuals will pull the player in searching for answers. You will never be frightened, but you will always be wondering: &quot;what&apos;s in this next room?&quot;
<br>
<br>Home is a very special meta-game, where its uniqueness derive from not what&apos;s happening on screen, but what is in the mind of the player. The story of the game might not get complete after several playthrough, because the events of the game have already happened, the murders too. It is not really important what happened, the important thing is how much you know about it and the ultimate goal is to know everything of course.
