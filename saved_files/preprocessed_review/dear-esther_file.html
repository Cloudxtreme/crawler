I like games with a good story but this is more like an interactive picture book. Exploration is hardly awarded with extra depth in the story and it takes far to long to walk back to the right path however there are some very nice places to see. One more minor thing that annoyed me were the plants, because once you notice they keep staring at you it can&apos;t be unseen. Because they are 2d and thus have no sides it makes sense that they did it this way but it still feels a bit awkward. In conclusion I&apos;d say that this is a pretty good story but I don&apos;t think it should be placed in the game category. If it wasn&apos;t marked as a game I would definitely have rated it with an 8 or more. But if I had to recommend a storytelling game that actually feels like your part of the story I would pick either Amnesia, Penumbra or Bastion these are all completely different game as well from each other as from Dear Esther but the thing they all have in common is that they are all heavily based on their story however my examples are far more interactive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2161984">Expand</a></span>

As an advocate for games as art, this is my new &quot;exhibit A&quot;. The visuals, the weather, the sounds, the music, and the narration all came together to give me an experience that was as immerse and gratifying as the best of more hardcore genres. I am personally terrified of heights, and there were certain moments in this game that put that fear into practice for me, and most games don&apos;t do that. It was a unique journey and I know that I will play it again someday, and again after that. But I don&apos;t know when.

I certainly enjoyed it, and would definitely play through multiple times, just to get a better grasp on the big picture that the plot constantly alludes to. That said, the ending is... remarkably intense, and the last action that you take really makes you think. Not enough games are willing to take existentialism and the strangeness of the unknown into their plot, and it definitely pays off in this one. This is the kind of plot that keeps you awake at night, thinking of actions and consequences, as well as how all things must end.<br><br>Gameplay 5/10<br>Atmosphere 9/10<br>Plot 10/10<br>Execution 10/10<br><br>Excellent Game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2140653">Expand</a></span>

The story behind it is actually fairly good, however. The best part of this game for me was the gorgeous environments. The caves in particular were stunning. That being said, they basically have to be to balance out the actual amount of time it takes to beat, which is about an hour. Overall this game was interesting, and it was worth the $2 I spent on it. $10 is just insane for this game. I would recommend this to anyone who likes art for its own sake, because that&apos;s really all I can consider this game to be. Just make sure you get it on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=4807327">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t regret the purchase, but I&apos;m reluctant to call the &apos;game&apos; enjoyable. If anything, it felt more like a spiritual journey in a sense; a journey that sometimes overextended itself in the more bland and empty sections of the game. This is primarily due to the lack of gameplay mechanics, so Dear Esther must rely heavily on the following three things - story, visuals and sound.
<br>
<br>Of those three, the visuals and sound are of great quality, imbuing a satisfying sense of tranquility, which sometimes shifted to a more haunting tone. The caves section in particular demonstrated excellent use of colour and was probably the only chapter in which I was fully engaged due to the constant change in the rock formations and scenery. Unfortunately, pretty rocks and water can only get you so far. It&apos;s ultimately up to the game&apos;s narrative that determines whether Dear Esther offers something more meaningful, and while it did, the delivery had more than a few flaws.
<br>
<br>Dear Esther&apos;s story relies heavily on the player&apos;s ability to interpret symbols and metaphors. It&apos;s like high school English class all over again, like analyzing a text but in digital form. There&apos;s nothing inherently wrong with this, but the dialogue is in my opinion far too convoluted and too full of purple prose for this interpretation to be done in an accessible manner. The fact that dialogue is randomly generated in this game also means that the player&apos;s interpretation is incomplete, they&apos;re not getting the full picture regardless of whether they explore the map or not. I think it&apos;s also unrealistic for a player to fully analyze and understand a paragraph of text that is read out with no more than 20 seconds of screen time and then never to be seen or heard of again, especially with the kind of writing that&apos;s presented in this game.
<br>
<br>Most players will end up floundering in confusion, and I suspect that for most of those who&apos;ve played Dear Esther, the main reason they understood the story is because they read a wikipedia entry on the plot after they finished the game. That&apos;s what I did too, and when I consulted other wikis and read other people&apos;s interpretations, it was only then that things started to really make sense. Upon playing the game again, it was only then that I understood the various obscure references that formed the story. There&apos;s power in simplicity, and I feel that the Chinese Room made their writing too complex for the sake of sounding poetic. In the end, it becomes something that detracts from a potentially unique and unforgettable experience.

<br>
<br>The only thing that is good in the entire &quot;multi-angle&quot; movie is the scenery.
<br>
<br>The scenery looks amazing, however I&apos;m quite sure you could see better with a cheap blender file rendering.  Thankfully Steam had this game on offer when I bought it  and I can see why, had I paid full price I&apos;d have been taking it up with trading standards for false advertising.
<br>
<br>The game is advertised as an &quot;adventure game&quot;  when I think of an adventure game I think of games like maybe text adventure games  Behind Closed Doors, Very Big Cave Adventure, or point and click adventures  like Secret of Monkey Island, Flight of the Amazon Queen, Grim Fandango, or puzzle adventure games like Myst or Dark Fall, or finally adventure/action games like Tomb Raider, or Uncharted.
<br>
<br>This game doesn&apos;t fit into any of these categories.  This game is a very bad and very cheap effort at the games company trying to make a quick buck.
<br>
<br>The thing that makes the game so poor is that in the game the end user has absolutely nothing to do, other than admire the scenery and move the character around the island.
<br>
<br>Yes really that is it.  It&apos;s like reading a Choose Your Own Adventure book without any turn to this page, or turn to that page.
<br>
<br>You have absolutely nothing to do within the game  other than follow the path round  try and veer off the path to look at something you quickly find yourself stuck on a rock unable to go any further, at most if you get bored there is a really big chasm that you can throw yourself into or drown yourself in the sea  but unfortunately that just leads to a message stating &quot;come back&quot; and then a regeneration on the nearest land.
<br>
<br>There are no puzzles whatsoever in this game, there is stuff scrawled on walls like science symbols which you would have thought maybe used later in some kind of puzzle or something, but no they aren&apos;t used for anything.
<br>
<br>The scenery is stunning, especially when your in the cave, but other than that it is nothing more than just an interactive multi-angle movie which is something DVD&apos;s did years ago and is nothing new.
<br>
<br>As for it&apos;s definition as a game  I&apos;d actually question as to whether that is actually accurate the definition of game is as follows
<br>
<br>&quot;A form of play or sport, esp. a competitive one played according to rules and decided by skill, strength, or luck.&quot;.
<br>
<br>There is no skill, strength or luck and I don&apos;t think just following a path around an island constitutes playing either, so it is more an interactive movie than a game.
<br>
<br>In addition to this the story line is just as bad.  The entire story seems to depict the lives of a number of people 2 of them ended their lives on the island, whilst another 2 managed to kill themselves on the M5 motorway  the scene of which is re-built in a pool, and finally you end up being another victim of the island  or do you turn into a gull at the end and fly over the island??  Very bizarre story line.
<br>
<br>If you ever played Myst or Dark Fall and thought you might like it if they removed all the puzzles then you&apos;d like this, but if you like the puzzles and at least some kind of a challenge then this is not the game for you.
<br>
<br>The game took me about 30 minutes to complete this morning, but now knowing how it works I could probably whizz round that island in about 10-15 minutes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2976759">Expand</a></span>

I liked Penumbra, and I liked Amnesia even more; those games struck a nice balance with atmosphere and gameplay while being different from almost everything I had played before. This game, however, offers no such balance since it abandoned any semblance of gameplay altogether. It&apos;s been said here by other reviewers and I&apos;ll say it again, just to reinforce the notion: there is no interactivity to speak of and no real gameplay whatsoever.  There are no meaningful choices to make, no consequences, no inventory to manage, no characters to interact with, no enemies to defeat or evade, no objectives to complete; you can&apos;t even control when your flashlight turns on and off (this feature is automanaged for you as you enter and leave unlit areas).  It is a game that dared to be so different that it actually stopped being a game. Moving on, I don&apos;t want to obsess over what Dear Esther IS NOT this whole review, so I will talk about what it IS.  As others here have pointed out, it is simply a different way of telling a story... a visual metaphor, if you will. In my opinion, it is an unsuccessful way of telling a story, and I wont be paying for any other &quot;games&quot; that may appear in this &quot;genre&quot;. As a game, story, and movie respectively, it was boring and un-entertaining. Dear Esther&apos;s soundtrack is quite good, and it is visually is nice to look at, especially in the caves chapter; I will award a couple points for those qualities, even though I want to give it a flat zero. I&apos;ll award one more point to the fact that the developers had the balls think out side the box... in fact, they stepped outside the box, picked it up, folded it, put it in the recycle bin, went to the nearest Blockbuster Video and rented What Dreams May Come. So that&apos;s it, a generous 3 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2608808">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re going in to it expecting it to be a game, you&apos;re gonna have a bad time.

It fails, in my estimation, a failed experiment. If you&apos;ve played the free &quot;Stanley Parable&quot; mod for Half-Life 2, you will have at least an inkling of what kind of template Dear Esther uses (though clearly, the former is more lighthearted than the latter). Let&apos;s throw some complements about this title out there first. It does have some nice graphics and the environmental design is striking at times and...umm...well, I&apos;m sadly out of good things to say. The next nicest thing I have to say is at least it only lasts about an hour. You start the game with no idea how or why you are there, nor any instructions. So, inevitably you begin to walk around. And I hope you enjoy walking around, because that is the only action that you, as the player, get to do. As you amble onward, every 5 or so minutes the game spits a bit narrative at you. Unlike the Stanley Parable, none of Dear Esther is particularly interesting or well written, and it most definitely isn&apos;t cohesive. I believe that lack of cohesion was done unwittingly, rather it was used as a mechanic by the game&apos;s designers to give the paper thin prose an air of mystery...being obtuse makes things hard to understand and, when done right, makes you work to follow the thread and give you a sense of accomplishment or reward once you start piecing things together. Problem being on this breadcrumb laden story&apos;s path, there is no thread. You come across bits of narrative slowly (and I do mean slowly - you walk at the pace of a geriatric snail, mash the Shift key all you&apos;d like), and over time you realize none of them really connect. There is just random narrative, islands of text that refuse to work together in harmony to create an overarching story. Little things that do start to have any kind of meaning or interest or appear to be revealed in interesting ways end up being things that are already explained to you in the synopsis of the game. If you want a mild surprise, read as little about this game as you can - including, and especially, it&apos;s own synopsis. In the end, you might as well just fire up Skyrim, start wandering aimlessly, and play a 15 second clip from a different book-on-tape every 5 or so minutes. It&apos;ll be just as interesting. All I can say is I&apos;m glad I was able to get the game on sale for $1.39.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2562268">Expand</a></span>

<br>Its kinda like a book with a great cover and blurb....but was never finished, and somehow is being sold in stores...

If this was actually art, as some would like to believe, you would see at least some creative use of the possibilities of videogames at work, but no, let&apos;s just walk around while hearing a story.

<br>Art can explore new ways to use a particular media, and the greatest works of art may change the way we see that media in a permanent way. This game doesn&apos;t even try to explore the possibilities of gaming. If this was a movie there would literally be no difference, except you wouldn&apos;t be pressing W. It is not fun, it is not creative, it is not an interesting story, but you can still buy it and tell everybody who says it isn&apos;t good that the game is just to deep for them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=3412520">Expand</a></span>

The scenery is breathtaking, the music is spectacular, and the story is eerie. A lot of people won&apos;t see this for what it is simply b/c there is little to do except walk around. This is the type of game that you lock the doors and turn off all lights, and sounds and just experience it. Experience the history, the serenity, the loneliness, the sorrow or an island world and a mans story. I found the game to be like a good book with the pieces of the narrator slowly filling in the gaps to find out just what has happening, is going to happen, and what once was happening. Though it was short, I felt it was worth every penny of the sale price, and has replay value on the living and breathing world alone. I can&apos;t imagine if skyrim had had a world so alive, bright, dark, and dead such as this. What an amazing time for video games we live in. If you play consoles and Call of Duty, you won&apos;t be able to appreciate this sort of artwork most likely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=3660869">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dear Esther is an artistic work, I cannot deny that, but the creator lost all right for respect and credit when putting this up for sale. There are many modders out there who contribute much greater, albeit different, efforts for free. Whether intentional or not, putting it up here on steam was awfully misleading and tricked many into buying it, believing it is an actual adventure game. At least everyone I know who bought the game, including myself, sprung that trap.
<br>
<br>It is an insult to all modders out there that this &quot;game&quot; is being sold. The developers of Dear Esther were thrown a lot of money that others deserve more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=4862874">Expand</a></span>

People complain about video games becoming movies, then talk about this game as if it is something unique or game changing.  This game is an interactive island walking simulator that tells you bits of story every now.  The people telling you that it is an &quot;interactive fiction narrative&quot; or &quot;interactive story&quot; are misleading you.  It is no more an interactive story than a book is an interactive story.  The story is partially randomized at the very start of the game and it is set in stone at that point.  You must then walk through the island, discovering fragments of the story, and have the game tell the story to you.  There is nothing intellectual, artsy, or deep about this game.  The game is stunningly lackluster in everything that makes it a game.  This game comes across as being made by a company that wanted to do a 1 hour cinematic, but knew that moviegoers wouldn&apos;t care for this narcissistic, pretentious drivel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2524083">Expand</a></span>

I would not be nearly as upset if this game was touted as including &quot;Exploration&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot; there is nothing.  It is a straight line experience with zero interactivity.  Art hanging on a wall is more enticing and engaging then this piece.  Do NOT buy this &quot;game&quot;.

<br>Honestly I&apos;m considering not buying any game that gets recommended to me if I &quot;Liked&quot; this game.  I would not trust their content at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2524338">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s hardly anything in the game, I beat it it under an hour (or finished it I should say, like I said there are no gameplay elements whatsoever).  Apparently there is supposed to be a story here but it&apos;s so unintelligible that by the end you&apos;ll be left scratching your head as to why you wasted all this time thinking the story would tie together somehow.
<br>
<br>The creator of this game must think he&apos;s a real Stanley Kubrick, but in the end it just reaks of Uwe Bol.  Trash trash trash... just utter trash, don&apos;t waste your money on this.  It&apos;s not even a good looking game, the island is bland as hell and aside from a grant total of 3 or 4 structures and some meaningless paintings on the walls every now and then - the level design is literally just bland rock.  The only reason I even give it a 1 and not a 0 is because I guess at least they spent a long time building their boring bland island, and I suppose there were 1 or 2 views that looked decent.  In the end though avoid this game like the plague, it isn&apos;t even a game, nor is it art.  It&apos;s utter **** seriously **** this bull**** I expected more from a game receiving such good ratings, you all make me sick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2525089">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;d be OK &quot;playing&quot; this if I got it in some Humble Indie Bundle but $10 for a remake of a 1 hour mod using the Source engine is ridiculous. The only reason this game isn&apos;t being slammed as being pretentious hipster garbage is because of the subject matter at hand. Otherwise this game would be totally overlooked and reveiled for being what it is: another overpriced, misleading, pretentious &quot;indie&quot; game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822761">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_2481269"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This &quot;game&quot; is pathetic and horribly disappointing. I&apos;m very much looking forward to the sequel to Amnesia by thechineseroom, so I decided to play this first. Sadly, it was terrible.
<br>
<br>There is no option to run, so you have to maintain a very slow walking pace. If you try to swim around and &apos;explore&apos; (as the game was advertised to be about) then you will drown, and a man will say &quot;Come back.&quot; (which I&apos;ll get to in a minute.) Tiny rocks are impossible to traverse, and there is no jump button. This game is about exploration, but exploring is hardly rewarded at all--you may get a slight hint about the extremely obvious &apos;twist&apos; in the storyline, such as finding a picture of Esther, or some medical bags, or seeing ghosts in the distance wandering the island, however very rarely do you actually get to hear extra dialogue as a result, and when you do it is usually extremely limited, and then you have to make the long, arduous walk back.
<br>
<br>Before this seems like a complete rant, I&apos;d like to point out that the music and graphics are fantastic. The graphics are probably the best I&apos;ve ever seen in a Source title, and the caves in particularl looked beautiful (plenty looked like they would make perfect backgrounds, and some of the outdoors environments looked great too...) but... you&apos;re better off just googling &quot;pretty landscapes,&quot; and then playing some beethoven on youtube while you look at them than playing this &quot;game.&quot;
<br>
<br>This game lasted me a total of forty five minutes, and I never see myself going back to it. It cost me 10 bucks... 2 dollars is the most this should reasonably cost. I don&apos;t understand how this game took other people 2 hours.. I looked all around the island, found many hidden things, read the paper boats in the water, and read all the text on the walls... but it still lasted me forty five minutes and felt like an eternity. That being said, after the ending, I thought it was the end of chapter one (especially without the credits playing... or anything happening, it just stayed on a black screen.)
<br>
<br>People seem to ignorantly praise this game for the fact that it tried somethign new, which, I disagree with. This isn&apos;t new. There are many games that favor exploration and storyline over gameplay (look at Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, or Penumbra.) The ideal is to have excellent gameplay, but also to have excellent exploration and storyline, like my all time favorite game Zelda: Majora&apos;s Mask. They also praise it for its storyline... oh, my, no.
<br>
<br>The storyline is undeniably poor. I&apos;m going to spoil it in this paragraph, so if you still want to play this game for some reason, don&apos;t read this. Over and over, incessently the narrator keeps talking about the car crash, the drunk driver, and the road to Damascus. It never ends. There are medical bags laying on the floor. There is a point where you&apos;re on the road where the car crash happened, and instead of the car crash there&apos;s a medical bed. Everytime you almost die from drowning or falling, a heartbeat rises, and the narrator says &quot;Come back.&quot; And the game ends with him saying &quot;Esther, come back, come back..&quot; Do I even need to say it? Its so painfully obvious and not at all clever.. the narrator is a man next to Esther, and he is talking to her in her dreams/coma after the car crash. She&apos;s coming to terms with what happened to her, and eventually dying (the ending.) Its not exactly difficult to piece together, and calling it clever is just silly.
<br>
<br>This game was a horrible disappointment, and I wish I had a refund.
<br>+ Graphics
<br>+ Sound
<br>- &apos;Gameplay&apos;
<br>- Story
<br>- Absolutely no fun at all.
<br>
<br>This &apos;game&apos; probably deserves a one or two out of 10, or, understandably, an aggregate of about 4 to 4.5... but seeing how inexplicably people like this and the aggregate is 6.5, I&apos;m going to try to do my part to pull it down so other people won&apos;t waste their money like I did.
<br>
<br>Thanks for reading! Don&apos;t make the same mistake I did!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2481269">Expand</a></span>

The story is really really uninteresting, this game is the equivelent of watching a **** film major&apos;s indie film that he couldn&apos;t get funded so he put it onto a game instead, easy to understand but arrogant and pretentious enough to believe it self to be otherwise, you will simply rather early begin to wonder when will the narrator shut up since you already got the idea of what occur a while back.
<br>
<br>So yeah, if you wanna spend 10 bucks like I did to see nice graphics go ahead or just you know....buy a GAME with good graphics rather than this......thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2644561">Expand</a></span>

Interactive fiction is fine, but this is bad fiction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2805611">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>this is really not a game. there is not gameplay to be had. no exploring to do. in fact you really dont do anything. you just walk in a straight line from point a to point b. then its over. took me about 10 minutes to beat the &quot;game&quot;. there is no content. no story. nothing.
<br>
<br>really poor.</span>

<br>Somebody said it is a piece of work. A pile of crap would be the most accurate definition.
<br>You wander two hours on a very beautiful island, guided by an high quality atmosphere blending soundtrack. The purpose of Dear Esther is telling a good story in a different way. Unluckily, the story is crap. Random monologues, representing character letter to a dead girl are heard from time to time. The fact is, they don&apos;t make sense. And the story, if there&apos;s one behind this letters, is a crappy pile of cliches.
<br>As many suggested, a short film would have made more sense. If I knew, I would have refused Dear Esther even if it was for free. There are tons of things you could enjoy more, including being raped by a gorilla.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2535478">Expand</a></span>

The story is amazing, but so is the beautiful environment. I have never seen a source game (let alone with any game) with such a stunning, visually pleasing  environment. The beginning is quite beautiful, but once you hit the caves, you will be taken back by the beauty. All in all I would say this has to be one of my favorite releases in the last two years. I really hope that games like this will make their way to the spotlight.

You roam around this island with basically the same type of background replicated repeatedly..  There seems to be no point to any of it.

That is, the island appears to be a representation of masculine Inner Space, haunted by loverghosts and cryptic prose. Cool. But the developers never push the human element or the weirdness far enough, leaving us with a lavishly detailed but paradoxically empty experience.</span>

The biggest problem is the dialogue doesn&apos;t match up with where you are in the game, which makes the whole thing feel pointless.  Also, there is no interaction of any sort.  The best part was the scenery and the music score, but one can only stare at the weeds and flowers blow in the wind for so long.  Sad to say, holding down mouse1 to zoom in 3 inches is about as interactive as it gets.  Do yourself a favor and put your money toward another game.  You will be happy you did.  It took 75 minutes to complete, and at the end could not believe what I had just played.  Two thumbs way down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2381083">Expand</a></span>

I said &quot;thing&quot; because I can&apos;t really talk about game because it has almost no game elements in it except, maybe, for the menus, but I can see why people are both discouraged and impressed by this: the first thing that actually disappointed me is that the story itself is very slow and sometimes very confusing...but that is actually one of the main points of the story, and at each playthrough the lines change among them, making the story more or less clear; however I can see people having issues with the story and even I had some issues to understand, at least in the beginning. Also, the fact that there is no exploration can be a little frustrating, because there&apos;s isn&apos;t much else to see and, unfortunely, you can&apos;t even run. Another flaw maybe is the length: it lasts only 1-2 hours tops and I can see why people are discouraged to pay (not a lot at least), for a game that don&apos;t even last  like a movie. But with that said, this story is actually a good one, even if it&apos;s confusing: even if the lines and the descriptions takes a little to understand, once you get it you see that it&apos;s extremely touching and very deep, because it&apos;s basically a travel in the mind of a man and his thoughts about things around him and his past, and all of this has a reasonable but also a more confusing ending, after you have seen all of the places... and about these places, I must say this: even though I&apos;m not a graphic lover, the scenery in this game are simply beautiful. I honestly never seen such beautiful scenery put in games: it looked like I was in a real place! And even though graphics alone are never worth the price in ANY game, this game showed that graphics can create a great scenery and beautiful places, and not only make a game more realistic.  I can&apos;t say to give it a try mainly because, as I said, it&apos;s short and there is almost no gaming elements, but if you are interested in something different, in a different story, and in a different yet beautiful scenery, this is a ticket for a graphical museum that will accompany you together with a good, but also confusing, story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544963">Expand</a></span>

For the first 45 minutes you will feel like a sucker duped into paying for nothing more than a tech demo.  You will be walking around in a snail paced first person camera, unable to interact with even the most basic of objects, such as books or papers strewn about in a room. It would have been nice to be able to pick them up and read them as is common in adventure games, but apparently that was asking too much.  In fact, the only controls in this title are move forward, back, left, right, and swim up (which is used sparingly if at all).  Your purpose is to wander - wander aimlessly hoping beyond hope that you will stumble upon the imaginary trip wires placed around the world that trigger the narrator and bring some purpose to this dull experience. And I say dull not because of the pacing, or the lack of interactivity, or a graphically hideous engine (as in fact its quite beautiful when maxed out), but rather the lack of imagination that went into the world as the island is nothing but the same bland repeating rock, ground, and grass textures over and over.  As for your lone companion, the narrator (whose voice is exceptionally well done), he rambles incoherently. Its as if he walked into a book store, picked up a random book, flipped through the pages, and just started reading obscure passages out loud. The whole experience is a disjointed mess. Oh and it got worse; the island which at first felt like a sandbox you could freely wander in is soon to be revealed as being a closed one-way track. When it does fork you are quickly led to a dead-end, with no narration, no purpose, only a few rocks that a newborn toddler could conquer, but yet you somehow are unable to step over.  All that is left is to backtrack - backtrack with a slow moving camera only adding to the frustration.  Troubles continued.  As I approached the first interesting thing in this game, a half sunken ship submerged in shallow water, I like any normal person had the urge to swim to it.  Well, I drowned in about 4 feet of water, &quot;come back...&quot; the narrator says, as I am transported back to land and free to continue on. Only I wasn&apos;t. I could look around, but I could not move. Nothing is blocking my way I&apos;m just stuck. So this thing is bugged too? .  In a blood boiling move I had no choice but to restart from the beginning and re-walk the whole bleh experience up to this point (interestingly however was the fact that some of the narration had changed).  So, if you do decide to try Dear Esther do yourself a favour and quick-save before jumping off any cliffs or swimming in any water.  I might have fallen victim to a rare bug, but no point in risking it yourself.  Anyways, out of sheer stubbornness, I continued on from the start, mere inches away from bursting out in profanities condemning Dear Esther to the 9th levels of Hell.  But, see... this is where the hate ends and the love begins. For the cave - the blue cave is where Dear Esther grabbed me and didn&apos;t let go. From here till the end I was captivated by the world. Long gone is the bland island and instead is a wondrous cave of waterfalls, streams, smoke-effects, creative lighting, and emotion inspiring environments ranging from psychosis to tranquillity.  This was the experience I was hoping for when I bought Dear Esther. The story comes together, the narrator&apos;s incoherent ramblings start to actually make sense, and your purpose takes shape (which of course I won&apos;t spoil).  I still don&apos;t know whether Dear Esther can be categorized as a game - and having only lasted 85 minutes in length (including my restart) I&apos;m not sure its really worth the $9.99 price tag being sold for.  However, if you wait and buy it on a Steam sale like I did for 75% off its hard to argue its not worth $2.50.  Despite the slow starter it did come on strong and its unusual epistolary style of story telling will leave just enough holes to give you plenty to think about even after Dear Esther is long over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570758">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s an okayish mind-teaser, but it is even below low-quality visual novels and doesn&apos;t deserve being paid for. As a free mod or video, this would be nice.</span>

Why couldn&apos;t Skyrim have these deep colours and graphics? I&apos;ll be honest, for &#xA3;6 it&apos;s worth the investment. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll play it again, but as others have said, it&apos;s quite an emotional experience than a game. I felt a little strange after finishing the story.</span>

I would call it an interactive visual-auditory poem.<br>The visuals and sounds and music are astonishing and create an atmosphere unlike any I&apos;ve ever witnessed in a computer game. The story is intriguing; it&apos;s certainly very enigmatic and confusing, but this is exactly what makes this game so intellectually engaging. The world around you and the narration are full of complex metaphors, symbols and allusions, and you will discover new facets, new angles to view and interpret the story and the world it creates if you have the patience to play the game a second, or maybe even third time.<br>Dear Esther is a successful experiment and a singular experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2276827">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve waited a long time for something like it to come along. Having created game levels in the Source engine myself its clear how much care and attention went into creating the environment, I&apos;m sincerely impressed by what the developers have been able to build. The visuals are simply stunning and the eerie soundscape is wonderful too.<br><br>The pace of movement is slow, but that is just right for the experience this game was designed to provide. It allows the mind to slide into a more contemplative mode as you explore and I found my thoughts wandering just as they would on a long walk.<br><br>Overall I felt like I was trespassing on somebody else&apos;s dream. I realised as soon as I launched the game that it deserved to be played in a dimly lit room with the sound turned up, and found that once I allowed myself to become absorbed by the surroundings, it triggered unusual feelings of trepidation, loss, and a strong sense of &apos;l&apos;appel du vide&apos;. It brought Iain Banks&apos; story The Bridge to mind.<br><br>I would rank the journey through the second &apos;level&apos; of Dear Esther alongside the end credits of Portal, the final scene of HL2 Ep2, and the first nightfall in Minecraft, as one of the great &apos;moments&apos; in gaming.<br><br>I really look forward to seeing more games that build on what Dear Esther has achieved, and extend that in different and unexpected ways.<br><br>If you&apos;re someone who likes Iain Banks, &apos;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&apos;, Wes Anderson films, Sigur Ros, Laura Marling or Lisa Hannigan, I think you&apos;ll enjoy Dear Esther.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2382445">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I very much like Dear Ester. When playing a FPS I will often clear a level of monsters and enemies so I can spend some time just wandering around and explore the environment, looking at the details. My only disappointment with Esther came when it ended. I wanted more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2561227">Expand</a></span>

Personally, I was expecting something along the lines of Amnesia: puzzle solving while unraveling a mysterious story. This is not what Dear Esther is. The simplest way to describe this game is an interactive movie. Not to say that there&apos;s something wrong with an interactive movie. The artistic gamers will light up at the mentioning of this game, whereas those who see video games strictly as constant stimulation will feel as though they wasted their money.<br><br>You begin on an unknown island that you must explore. However, there is nothing to do in this game except to press &quot;W&quot; with an occasional &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; and perhaps an &quot;S&quot; if you&apos;re feeling up to it. You follow a linear path with branching paths that all lead to dead ends. This isn&apos;t as negative as I make it out to be; the enjoyment you get out of this game depends on how much you&apos;re willing to get involved in it. Taking the side paths and listening to the narrator&apos;s dialogue you might otherwise miss only adds to the immersion.<br><br>Don&apos;t expect a very long experience, either. If you take every possible path and enjoy every scene this game has to offer, you&apos;re looking at 1-2 hours. Dear Esther boasts having replayability through the changing dialogue, but the ending and paths you take will be the same, questioning the definition of &quot;replayability&quot;.<br><br>Overall, don&apos;t expect a game, but rather a story. Setting your own pace and really exploring the island down to every nook-and-cranny will allow for a much better story and deeper immersion, but many will find this to be boring and a waste of time / money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2140391">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed making up my own theories to supplement the story, as opposed to the spoon-feeding I get when I play anything else.  The caves were fantastic.  Whoever wrote Skyrim had better caves needs a side-by-side comparison of the two.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, I loved and still love Skyrim, bu just because a game costs more or sells more copies doesn&apos;t mean its better in any way shape or form.    Then, I checked the forums.  This game would&apos;ve gotten an 8 out of 10 had I not read the forums.  Those of you who have only played this game once are doing a HUGE disservice to yourself.  You&apos;re missing half the content.  Set pieces and dialogue are semi-randomized, and there are hidden things (I&apos;m trying my hardest not to give it away) that will blow your MIND upon discovering them.  Not to mention give you nightmares.  If this game takes you an hour to complete, you&apos;re trying to beat it too hard.    The only reason I docked this a point is because of the lack of choice at the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2240614">Expand</a></span>

The beauty of Dear Esther is that part of the narrative must come from the player... impressions formed in the art, exploration of the countryside. It is up to you how much of this story you will experience, how far into the depths of its fever-dreams you will wade. Will you struggle to interpret what is scrawled upon the ground, etched into the hills, carved like lines of white chalk that alienate all help even as they cry distress? How much empathy will you feel, and for whom, and what will you make of the person whose voice comes echoing through your head, whispering to you to come back when you wander too far? How will you interpret a world which all at once gives you its narrative and yet leaves you with all the options as to what any of it means? I played Dear Esther with my partner, and I recommend doing that, because we discussed what we saw along the way, reacted to the narrator, and the experience each of us drew from the game was tinted by our own backgrounds, our own points of reference. Where I saw chemistry, she saw art, where I saw delirium, she saw verse. Together we made it something even more-- and when we&apos;ve had time for the memory to fade, when the chalk lines etched across our brains have grown over and been erased, we&apos;ll walk again along that shore and perhaps take a different path, perhaps feel another way, or perhaps relive our first discovery. We will haunt that beach, now and then, and to me, that is enough, especially for the price. But, I cannot give it a perfect score when it is somewhat inaccessible and I wish it would have yielded up just a little bit more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2271179">Expand</a></span>

And to kids the only piece of art they&apos;ve seen is located in a bathroom saying this is art, replicating reality with photo-realism and nothing else in mind is not ART, it&apos;s just mere artisan&apos;s work, and not even the best attempt at. The narration is even worse than the visuals, enough said.</span>

A waste of time and money. If you are going to have me push forward for an hour to hear a story then please just put the camera on rails and save me the boring journey. The slow trek up the rocks did feel like passing kidney stones. By the end you just want the guy to jump off the tower to end this miserable experience. The graphics looks great but that&apos;s about it. The menu says &quot;Resume Game&quot; What game?? there is no game. Moving a crawling camera through a level with no object interaction and listen to a block of text every now and then is NOT a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2236311">Expand</a></span>

It is so beautiful and well done. I absolutely adore the concept of this game. I&apos;m usually a big fan of less interaction to focus on the narrative. I even think the story is great, and combined with the scenery, the game is pretty haunting and emotional. The problem is that the story is so vague, it almost makes no sense at all. All I&apos;m really sure of is that a woman named Esther  died in a car accident. It is implied that maybe the narrator is her husband. It is implied that he was the drunk driver. Was he the drunk driver and her husband and they were in the same car? He makes it sound at one point as if Jackobson and such are brands of liquor he had been drinking, and he also refers to these names (one of which is Esther&apos;s last) as actual people. I understand that the point is to be vague, but how far can you go towards vague before you stop making sense at all and start being overly frustrating? I could very well just be too stupid to understand symbolism in words, but I think they could have made the narrative a little more coherent. Had they done that, I&apos;d be happy with the gameplay just the way it is. However, since the story doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense, you&apos;re left with walking around an Island (a *beautiful* island, so it is hard to complain) and bits of story that at some points seem to contradict each other. I was left wishing I could care, but not knowing/understanding enough to do so. Too much symbolism and not enough fact make it impossible for me to have a real emotional response. My experience is my own and you may feel differently. It&apos;s a beautiful word of art and I recommend it on that alone. If you get something out of the narrative, then even better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2701951">Expand</a></span>

You are somehow automatically expected to care about the wife or his plight and are subjected to 45 minutes of gripping.... holding down the W button. You walk painfully slowly through the island, often being encouraged to take a wrong turn to try and find additional dialogue. The problem is the dialogue just isn&apos;t interesting or rewarding. The whole piece is neither emotionally gripping nor philosophically gripping, so I honestly don&apos;t know what it is aiming for.
<br>What Dear Esther needed was dynamic content and emotion. What it has is neither.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2983752">Expand</a></span>

It is more like reading a short story. It want&apos;s to leave an impression and with this it succeeds. Sounds, music, and visuals are perfectly arranged around the narration. Everything feels perfectly polished. An artistic masterpiece with lasting appeal.</span>

Simply put, it is missing any element that would qualify it as one.<br><br>In games, there is a challenge. In games, your choices and actions have an effect on the outcome. In games, there is the possibility of success or failure. However, in Dear Esther, there is only observation. You walk through a world that you have no influence over, an audience rather than a player. Nothing you do will have any influence on the story. In fact, there is nothing you can do. You walk. You observe. You listen. The story is spoon-fed to you, but without context and requiring your own interpretation.<br><br>In essence, Dear Esther bares more in common to a painting than a videogame. Look at it from any angle you like. Take as long as you want to study it, or see it all quickly. These are the kinds of choices that Dear Esther offers. It invites you to admire its beauty...to look but not touch. The result is a very moving experience, but not a very entertaining one. It feels very much like seeing an exhibit in a museum. Indeed, artistically it is excellent. However, as I said at the beginning, Dear Esther is presented as being a game, and it is nothing of the kind. It must be scored as a game, and not as art.<br><br>Dear Esther is not a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2317452">Expand</a></span>

The actual environments are incredibly beautiful and extremely detailed, one of the most beautiful I&apos;ve seen in a video game. Graphically, it is excellent. Some of the minor details (such as the twinkling stars and foliage that blows in the wind) really make the game. I paid &#xC2;&#xA3;3.50 for the game on Steam, half its normal selling price. At it&apos;s normal selling price, it honestly wouldn&apos;t be worth the price at all, for the amount of gameplay in it. I have heard that some of the dialogue is different when you play the game again, but it&apos;s probably not enough to reel me in for another go, not immediately anyway. I thought the storyline was great too, and the ending I could not have predicted. I would recommend the game, if even just to sample this unique storytelling experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2410543">Expand</a></span>

All the thing is about exploring an abandoned island and listening to The Narrators monologues, uncovering pieces of story. You don&apos;t need to fight, you don&apos;t even need to pick up/collect items. All you can do is go and watch around. The story is pretty abstract and most of it you should think out by yourself (to be honest, I&apos;m not a fan of this kind of stories), so you can get more details by replays (some of the monologue parts are selected randomly) and also you can explore different routes across the island to get some extra ins and food for your thought. So the main things here are the storyline and the atmosphere. The atmosphere is fantastic, the depressive loneliness, feeling loss and unwilling to live. The visuals and locations design are great. And so is the perfect soundtrack (violins, cellos, piano) + The Narrator&apos;s voice fits nice. Overall, trying this was an awesome and unique experience and I&apos;ll be looking forward to check thechineseroom&apos;s new products!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2850085">Expand</a></span>

Probably scarier but still... the story is very similar to his movies concept-wise. Well, a character introduction, which even Lynch usually has, is missing. So the chaos that only starts after a while in Lynch movies starts right at the beginning in Dear Esther. You don&apos;t know anything about the people the text is talking about as if you would already know them. But after a while, a picture begins to form. Much like with the typical Lynch chaos. You start to think you know what it&apos;s about. And you probably really do get parts of it right. But aside from personal interpretitions... from an objective point of view, it will never be complete. Unless you can put it together from multiple playthroughs. I have only one behind me so far and that is the impression I got of the story. I don&apos;t think I have to say anything about how stunningly beautiful the game is, many others have done that already. And as much I would like to join the hype, I &quot;only&quot; rate it 9/10 for the following reasons: Content-related: It&apos;s a shame one doesn&apos;t have some sort of &quot;diary&quot; where one can read texts that one has already heard. Especially because of the sophisticated language involved that will be hard to understand for people who don&apos;t read English literature regularly. It often sounds more like pieces of poetry of the 19th century than a modern novel. Plus, saving only via hotkey is really a shame. They should have at least made that quick save functionality accessible through the menu. Technically: I HATE vegetation on planes always facing the player. That was probably the thing I loved most about The Witcher 2, visually - dense vegetation that didn&apos;t rotate around. Also, they could&apos;ve used more polygons on some of those rocks and the textures are occasionally really low-res. Maybe partly engine limitations. It is quite ancient... And for a game that is a lot about it&apos;s visual beauty, it is a shame that it doesn&apos;t use SLI by default and does very badly with it if you force it. I&apos;m also not sure how easy it is to put transparency AA settings into the menu but because of all the vegetation it would have been great if people could just enable all kinds of settings there. Overall, even though there are plenty of AA settings to choose from, I still find it lacking. It was clearly not made to take advantage of the most recent graphics cards. So overall... with a modern engine taking advantage of SLI, smoother geometry, consistently hi-res textures and all the settings I&apos;ve talked about available, this would&apos;ve been a 10 for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2141393">Expand</a></span>

Anyone could quite easily take a screenshot of anything in a play-through of this vivid setting and frame it, because it is so wonderfully crafted.   For a game developed on a comparatively old engine the setting is truly stunning and brilliantly structured - The transition between each chapter is totally seamless and adds to the depth of the game.  The carefully timed and sporadic ambiance of the music really adds to the atmosphere created by this game - one of isolation, loss and borderline insanity.  You feel what the character feels as you piece together the shards of their tale.  Appreciate the art of this piece as it is unlike no other game released at this moment in time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2142161">Expand</a></span>

Still, the game centers itself in two aspects: 1 - Story, 2 - Graphics. The story is nice, sometimes you wish you could just press shift so the character would go a bit faster... The graphical part is really good, if you ignore completely all the plants on the ground. They are all camera-aligned billboards and, as you pass near them, makes the game look synthetic, killing part of the immersion (and immersion is really important to it, more than to most games). In fact, it&apos;s not really a game, it&apos;s an interactive narrative that is not really interactive at all (sometimes you&apos;ll wish you had an auto-walk button or something to keep the W button down). Have to say that the title is pretentious, that&apos;s a fact.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2143637">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_2405920"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This game is visually beautiful, audibly intriguing yet because of the content of the story I find it actually let me down like a falling stone. This contains spoilers so stop reading NOW! Due to the fact that I have actually experienced a &quot;suicide&quot; personally pretty recently in my &quot;own&quot; family, I see absolutely no value on the subject of death for &quot;entertainment&apos;s&quot; sake. But rather it&apos;s a harsh reality that we all have to succumb to one day, in our own lives. Because life is already very difficult at times, it sincerely pissed me off to see me investing 3-5 hours of my own life&apos;s time, to see the outcome of some unfortunate soul commit such a tragedy at the end of this short story. I will share a pure truth with anyone that&apos;s just curious enough to ponder suicide. I personally feel that if you are &quot;brave&quot; enough to end your own life? Then you are &quot;brave&quot; enough to face any problem that comes your way. And in closing, this game really made me furious when they tried to &quot;incorporate&quot;  Christianity within the madness of this story. Trying to fuse the logic of ending one&apos;s life, to make it just ok with God that&apos;s I &quot;offed&quot; myself? Doubtful...very doubtful...It had a lot more promise, yet miserably failed with such a bad ending.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dear-esther/user-reviews?user_review_id=2405920">Expand</a></span>
