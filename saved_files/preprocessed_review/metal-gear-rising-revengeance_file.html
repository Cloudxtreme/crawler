Fun game play, great graphics, and something different than all the other games I&apos;ve been playing lately. 23 bucks for this gem? I&apos;m all over it.</span>

Second, the cutscenes are those annoying video clips again, low pixel, colors look like 16bit, I wish they could done this better (Like Resident 5, DMC or Tomb Raider), using the engine graphic cutscene. Third, the Low Res Texture really bug me, worse than the console (hope it will have a HD texture patch). And that is all i can complaint about this port. Now for the good. As I said it&apos;s well optimized with fully supported Mouse and Keyboard, hell yeah! The story is good, the cutscenes are very interesting, the gameplay is Amazing and the soundtrack is fantastic. Overall a good port, worth buying.

If you want something different, just stop whining and play something different, don&apos;t be a jerk. It&apos;s hack and slash (&quot;DmC&quot; like) type of the game. Period.
<br>
<br>At first I must say that the port is more than great, it&apos;s polished to the very end and it&apos;s a real pleasure. Game graphics are more then enough for today standards and looks really fantastic to me (tons of particles and some really cool flashes and etc. effects). Gameplay is mostly fast and accurate, where you can cut things just like in &quot;Tiny and Big: Grandpa&apos;s Leftovers&quot; game and the whole game based on these cuts, which says about great game design for itself. It also has really great, natural animations as well (motion capture ftw). The story looks pretty simple (super hero saves the world from bad guys), but it also has its moments, like: really-really great unique characters, philosophy things, different mood and some really nice little jokes from time to time. Controls are okay as well, but if you&apos;re going to argue because of using keyboard and mouse, you&apos;re an idiot. Games like these should be played using gamepads only, where keyboard and mouse just some poor alternative for people who don&apos;t own any controllers. Enemies are different, but some of them really overpowered, so it makes hard to defeat them even on &quot;Easy&quot; difficulty (which also has auto-parry system, btw, which is great for people who use keyboard and mouse to play this game). I beat the game on &quot;Hard&quot;, including bonus missions and I must say it was more then fair enough. The game also has &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; like score system, where the highest you get is &quot;S&quot; score (at least I couldn&apos;t get higher than that). Tons of bonuses awaits you (also some fun eastereggs from developers, I also found some really cool hidden secret places in game where additional enemies awaits you) if you&apos;re a that type of player, who digs through all the game to achieve everything, completely. Fighting is simple and pure fun, there&apos;s some space for really amazing combos. To players who say there&apos;s no any, check &quot;Help&quot; option in game, also buy all upgrades and then try &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; like moves (back, forward, button; clockwise, button; etc), check firstly, then say ****
<br>
<br>Online security system was a bad move, but you must understand that&apos;s not the fault of game developers or publishers, it&apos;s a fault of hackers and pirates, so stop whining, it has nothing to do with the game itself, kids.
<br>
<br>The game is made with a soul and definitely a work of some real professionals. I beat the game on a single breath and now I&apos;m doing that again and probably going to ride it one more time after that, that&apos;s how awesome it is. Music is just freaking amazing and fits the game really nice (thank God I bought some really expensive headphones a while ago and can hear it all exactly as it should be heard).
<br>
<br>Also I can&apos;t believe that this game is so freaking cheap. I think it&apos;s a steal.
<br>
<br>Played on maxed out settings using:
<br>LG 27&quot; (60Hz)
<br>1920x1080
<br>NVIDIA GTX 660
<br>Windows 8.1 Pro (x64)
<br>
<br>Not a single lag, bug or anything, such a smooth riding here. (&quot;DmC&quot; like) game. Period.
<br>I think I&apos;m done with my opinion here.
<br>
<br>Goodluck, Reapers!

<br>
<br>Forget Metal Gear. I started this game with an open mind, knowing it wasn&apos;t the tactical game other MGs are, but I immediately felt a disturbance in the force. Let&apos;s begin...
<br>
<br>PC PORT
<br>When the game opened, a window greeted me. &quot;Oh, it must be 1999,&quot; I thought, &quot;maybe I opened my SNES emulator!&quot;.
<br>Then I realized it was my latest purchase, and I hurried to the customize menu.
<br>That&apos;s when things began to go wrong.
<br>It doesn&apos;t feature the resolution I play with, which is 1920x1200, so I had to play a 1920x1080 windowed. There are indie games that are more flexible than this one.
<br>In pain and hurt by this, I start the game.
<br>
<br>FIRST BLOOD
<br>After a slow tutorial you learn the game has basically two buttons you must smash to go ahead, plus an &quot;activate for effortless movements&quot; button where you don&apos;t have to do **** to go over obstacles and a &quot;stop time and cut sh*t&quot; button that lets you sushi up your enemies.
<br>I was thinking &quot;This game f-ing plays itself&quot;. But I didn&apos;t know it got worse.
<br>
<br>I started a mission and - behold! - smashing buttons on my controller got the job done.
<br>I tried to parry, but it was the same key as the hit button. I have a xBox controller: I have 10 keys I can press and you force me to use the same button for hitting and parrying. Nice job! I don&apos;t feel like an idiot at all, having to use just a couple of buttons to play the game.
<br>
<br>THE F- YOU CAMERA
<br>The camera earned its own section. You can rotate it BUT IT ALSO FOLLOWS YOU.
<br>That means that if you are trying to fight, let&apos;s say, a boss that moves fast, you may center the camera on him while you dodge his attacks just to see it move away, pointing to you.
<br>It doesn&apos;t care if you need to know where your deadly enemy is, why would you?
<br>
<br>Dark Souls has been out for so much time one would hope people learned how to do a decent third person action game.
<br>
<br>LEVEL DESIGN
<br>The level design is plain. Just plain. Follow the road, don&apos;t explore too much (or we will put an invisible wall, just to remind 2014 is here but nothing changed, mofo), just go straight ahead.
<br>Really nothing to say here.
<br>
<br>CUTSCENES
<br>When you realize how many cutscenes there are just in the first hour of game you&apos;ll  this game plays itself.
<br>That&apos;s the pattern: go ahead, kill a couple of minions, now kill a bigger one, CUTSCENE, walk 20 meters, CUTSCENE, ninjarun 40 meters, hit a guy, CUTSCENE.
<br>It&apos;s worse than the other Metal Gear games. Kojima, write a movie already!
<br>
<br>THIS GAME PLAYS ITSELF
<br>Under 3 combat buttons - check!
<br>&quot;Press me to do everything while chasing enemies&quot; button - check!
<br>Refill life when killing even stupid minion - check!
<br>
<br>And just when you think it can&apos;t get worse, someone over your codec goes &quot;Yo Raiden, did you know you can SCAN THE AREA AND KNOW WHERE ENEMIES ARE, EVEN BEHIND WALLS? AND DID YOU KNOW THAT SCAN REVEALS WHAT YOU CAN CUT?&quot; and just surprises you. The game just stopped being a game and started being a... don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t really know.
<br>
<br>IS THERE ANYTHING GOOD?
<br>The graphics are great, sounds are great as well.
<br>
<br>CONCLUSION
<br>DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I bought it because I wanted to let Kojima &amp; Co. know there is a market for pc games, and because I&apos;m a Metal Gear **** But if I could travel back in time, instead of killing Hitler or warn my young self about that motorbike accident that would shatter my arm I would slap myself every time I was thinking about buying it.
<br>
<br>Seriously guys, go do drugs instead, it&apos;s a more intelligent choice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3922792">Expand</a></span>

If they keep up this positive thinking I will buy Ground Zeroes and Phantom Pain for PC as well once they release MGS:V for PC. Don&apos;t forget that gaming started on Amiga, C64, ZX Spectrum which are all PCs.</span>

This is giving a new character a new world to play in and it is not a bad thing. It has some of the best hack and slash gameplay I have seen to date. It feels so amazing to unleash a devastating combo on your enemy and then slow down time to slice them into tiny little pieces. I am not joking here, you can cut them up into hundreds of pieces, it is amazing.
<br>
<br>The writing is a little cheesy, and there is some sketchy voice acting, but overall this was an AMAZING game. The PC version also has 2 short DLC stories, one where you get to actually play as one of the boss characters. Seeing how they eventually came into play and ended up being on the wrong side. The game is amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3922982">Expand</a></span>

<br>I felt while playing that the developper were unhappy to kill MGS style, and where going to give player what they actually enjoy in a game that is not what they were use to. I played on Pc with an Xbox controller, and had actually issue with it right at the start, This game has been port but not intended to feel like a beat them all to met.
<br>
<br>Fighting has actually been the first issue, you are not playing an agile character, so you need to be sure of what you intend to do in any situation because there&apos;s not much movement option you can use to move your ass out of a bad situation.
<br>
<br>Camera has been the second one, the camera is actually too close of your character which will make you loose him in close space and make you unable to look around you when you switch to blade mode. Obligation for you to use target mode to set this to a better level.
<br>
<br>To complete, this game has some nice feature and some great idea had been re-use from MGS but the gameplay really put this game way down in my list of favorite beat-them-all, Even if the game is affordable, really feel like a bad one.... Can&apos;t exit while on Title Screen...

This also makes balance an issue as well, since it is just way too difficult to take on more than 2 enemies with minimal defense.
<br>Also I am pretty sure blade mode is broken for pc because at points I saw the sword not doing anything up close.
<br>Story is decent, dialogue isn&apos;t so much.
<br>I guess I should give this more of a chance, but at this stage I wouldn&apos;t say its great, yet not terrible either.

There&apos;s no capability to lock on to the enemies and it can be difficult to tell where they are in the heat of combat, especially since a lot of them have abilities which allow them to dash around.  I don&apos;t know how many times I cursed because I was against a wall and all of a sudden the camera decided to face the wall so I couldn&apos;t see who or what was attacking me.  This becomes more important later on as you&apos;re expected to block or dodge attacks but you can&apos;t see the visual cues.
<br>
<br>Boss fights are pretty easy up until the last couple of them.  When they start to become more difficult it can be very frustrating.  For example, you can get through most of the game while just ignoring the parry mechanic for the most part but one of the later bosses basically requires you to be proficient with it.
<br>
<br>There are a lot of times also when you are basically going to take a lot of damage and there&apos;s nothing you can do about it.  Attacks can line up in such a way that there is no ability to avoid them so you parry a couple of attacks and then eat an attack that can&apos;t be parried.  And then two more while you&apos;re on the ground.  And now you&apos;re dazed.
<br>
<br>The story is okay (but not great) to start, but when it attempts to delve into Jack&apos;s past it becomes laughable.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s flaws are few, imho, but they are so critical that it really made me dislike it at the end.  If you&apos;re considering this game, you&apos;re better off with God of War, Devil May Cry, or Darksiders.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4320947">Expand</a></span>

The final boss fight involves a series of QTEs to kill him once and for all, and they absolutely *must* be done within a fraction of a second to do it properly.  Even when I pressed Shift to use Blade Mode correctly and on time, the game still punished me as being not quick enough and I lose 25% of my HP.  The camera hardly faces the direction you want to, making the fight even more difficult to go through.  I could tolerate the level of unfairness in the combat mechanics to a certain degree but the final boss fight was the last straw.  The game worked and the story was okay at best, but the QTEs and sloppy camera really put me off.  I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth checking out if you&apos;re a fan of Metal Gear and/or Devil May Cry, but ultimately the issues with this game will piss you off as much as it has done to me (and I was playing on Normal).  Otherwise, I recommend skipping it altogether.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3994970">Expand</a></span>

But there is one thing i loved the most its the BOSS FIGHTS. they are one of the best i have ever played for a very long time . Every boss is truly memorable.  especially
<br>Mistral for her design and for having the best theme song of the game. and
<br>Monsoon for being the best  over the top boss fight of the game .
<br>Kudos to the developers for a pc port. hope to see more such ports in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3934133">Expand</a></span>

Camera has negative acceleration for no reason whatsoever.
<br>Parrying mechanic completely counter-intuitive. It requires conscious effort to wait for attack and then release direction keys, press them again and press attack button to parry, which can&apos;t be performed by reflexes and breaks the flow of the game.
<br>What made me drop this game is difficulty spike at blade wolf and complete lack of checkpoints in that fight on top of that.
<br>Then, blade mode. Why do I have to use WASD to aim? Well, because with gamepads you can&apos;t use right stick and attack at the same time. BUT I&apos;M PLAYING ON PC WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE.
<br>This game screws over so many important details that it negates anything good that there is about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3913657">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Revengeance is all about wanting to do something outrageous and being consistently slapped on the wrist. You can&apos;t do great damage until you have blocked, dodged and jumped your way through a preset sequence of attacks from the enemy that will severely hurt you unless you block/dodge/jump. And if you&apos;ve been a good dog you&apos;ll be allowed to engage in the iconic Blade Mode&#x2122;. For a few seconds.
<br>
<br>Of course, that only applies to bosses. Slicing through the lesser enemies is quite easy. Slicing a VIP in two before you have the chance to cut off the Oh So Important Left Hand&#x2122; is quite easy too. Can&apos;t cut that hand off a corpse, obviously.
<br>
<br>Quite an enjoyable grindfest that keeps reminding you that you are merely a cyborg, not an Enemy Cyborg&#x2122;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3944957">Expand</a></span>

<br>The plot is pretty immature and the voice acting is not the best, but there is something so charming about these type of Japanese games that they can get away with it.
<br>Oh, and unlike other games, when you hack and slash, this game really means it! You literally cut your enemies to pieces! In fact, is an integral part of combat. A novel and entertaining game mechanic.
<br>
<br>If this game was $60-$70, I would have scored this a 7 or 8, as it is at $30, it is an absolute bargain!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3913749">Expand</a></span>

A bit short (~7 hours), and there&apos;s not a lot of room for character personalization. Raiden only has two weapons with full sets of combos, and another two that only have a couple of 1-hit attacks that are not particularly useful. The camera is also a bit annoying and difficult to control, which is desperate in an action game, and the &quot;katana mode&quot; is impossible to perform with a keyboard and a mouse. The &quot;normal&quot; difficulty level is ridiculously easy, with the &quot;hard&quot; level being a bit more of a challenge. The &quot;very hard&quot; mode unlocked when finishing the first playtrough, is the one I really enjoyed. Still with all those errors, the sense of playing like a samurai is very well captured.
<br>
<br>About the graphics and music, I only have to say that they aren&apos;t particularly bright. The story is OK, and the ending does not disappoint, but Raiden is not very well written, and you will find him going from being too superficial, to pedantically deep and very overacted. Other characters of the story, like Sam Rodrigues, are much better handled.
<br>
<br>This is a good buy if it is at a reduced price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3918687">Expand</a></span>

Plot centers on the morality of war, which is in line with the other games in the Metal Gear series, but it is almost pure action throughout, like most of Platinum&apos;s games. The DRM issue was a day one bug that has since been fixed, so ignore the crybabies. This game is great at any price, but sub $30 is just too good to pass up.</span>

<br>They&apos;ve given us PC players a good well optimised port, we don&apos;t get many games like this, so quit complaining and enjoy the game, or would you rather not have it released at all?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3930351">Expand</a></span>

Os combates s&#xE3;o muito bons, com uma variedade boa de inimigos com t&#xE1;ticas diferentes para derrotar cada um.
<br>
<br>Os gr&#xE1;ficos do jogo s&#xE3;o bons, ainda mais se levado em considera&#xE7;&#xE3;o que o jogo foi feito para console e da&#xED; lan&#xE7;ado no PC (geralmente quando isso ocorre os gr&#xE1;ficos n&#xE3;o ficam bons no PC). No meu caso n&#xE3;o houve quedas bruscas de FPS, rodando a 60 FPS na resolu&#xE7;&#xE3;o em Full HD (1080p) e com a configura&#xE7;&#xE3;o no m&#xE1;ximo. Os filtros presentes no jogo s&#xE3;o bons, com um bom antialising, a filtragem de textura deixa o jogo ainda mais bonito e com boas sombras durante o jogo.
<br>
<br>A hist&#xF3;ria do jogo tamb&#xE9;m &#xE9; interessante, confesso que n&#xE3;o muito empolgante, mas inda sim boa. A hist&#xF3;ria ocorre de forma linear, e &#xE0; medida que avan&#xE7;amos na hist&#xF3;rias novos elementos v&#xE3;o aparecendo explicando um pouco das coisas.
<br>
<br>No entanto o jogo n&#xE3;o &#xE9; tudo maravilha, e umas das coisas que mais atrapalha s&#xE3;o os combates, na verdade a frequ&#xEA;ncia dos combates, que chega a enjoar um pouco.
<br>
<br>Por fim, levando em considera&#xE7;&#xE3;o o pre&#xE7;o do jogo, &#xE9; um &#xF3;timo custo benef&#xED;cio. Vale a pena ter esse jogo e recomendo ele para os usu&#xE1;rios de PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3920418">Expand</a></span>

Of course, since they design console games, playing this game with a controller is a must to get the full experience the developers wanted us to have. But it is still amazing that we can have this console experience without having to buy a console. If less people complain and see how awesome this is, then we could get more PC ports in the future, like Metal Gear Solid V.
<br>
<br>Anyways, about the game itself, the combat is great. My favourite aspect is the balance of making you feel challeneged while also making you feel powerful. I would compare this a lot to the Batman games where you are given a set of basic maneuvers (more unlock with XP) which the player learns to master as the game continues while always upping the challenge. Replaying earlier levels after finishing the game makes you feel unstoppable. You never feel frustrated (aside from maybe the final boss battle) since you  know you have the tools to defeat whatever obstacle comes your way.
<br>
<br>The combat is fluid, fast, smooth and tight. I have never experienced anything like this on PC and I really hope this is the start to more console exclusives coming our way. The pacing is also great.  Everytime you feel actions are repetitive, a new enemy typ comes along, or better yet, you are treated to a boss fight. And these are METAL GEAR Boss Fights, so get ready for some epic stuff. The bosses remind me a bit of the ones in MGS 3 where they all have a particular ability and are a clan with a past that is never fully adressed, standing in your way one by one to stop you.
<br>
<br>Another aspect I like is that the game still retains it&apos;s Metal Gear charms, like the sound the codec makes, the radar and the alert system which functions like the other metal gear games, giving you the option to be stealthy on several occasions. You probably wont be becuase this is an action game where any enemy presented to you can be stopped (though you are told to run and avoid enemies a few times) but if you so choose to, you can play this game in stealth. Awesome stealth kill options are given to you too and I would recomend trying this style a few times just for fun and to see the extra work that was put into the game.
<br>
<br>For the cons, the camera does get in the way on several occasions. The story and how it relates to the metal gear lore is not great either. Also, there seem to be a few glitches here and there and the prompts during the final boss fight are downright unfair (unless it&apos;s another bug).
<br>
<br>In conclusion, this is a great achievement for PC gaming, making the gap between the console experience that much smaller. As long as you accept the fact that this was a console game and thus requires a controller, you will have a bunch of fun. Easily the best hack and slash action game on PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3920461">Expand</a></span>

My only real complaint is that the campaign is so short (totaling at roughly seven missions, counting one that is merely a short boss fight), but you can replay chapters of your choice to unlock all of the swords and abilities and etc. But if you are a fan of outlandishly amazing boss battles (throwing giant robots across cities and jumping across missiles to chop them in half) or any video game with fun swordplay, this is definitely worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3921425">Expand</a></span>

As for the 24hz issues, I had the same issue but lowering the resolution to the previous 16:9 shouldn&apos;t degrade too much of the experience since the game doesn&apos;t have much focus on graphics. I&apos;m playing the game on my TV with 1366x768, it&apos;s actually not too bad (better than 720p).

<br>
<br>Gameplay: 9
<br>What can I say... I&apos;m a fan of hack &apos;n&apos; slash type games. It&apos;s more fun than DmC in terms of boss battles and would be similar to God of War. The gameplay is quite fast paced and refreshing for a slasher, a mix of Devil May Cry and God of War, like Castlevania:LoS. I do not recommend playing any hack &apos;n&apos; slash games with keyboard and mouse. Negative reviewers regarding bad controls shouldn&apos;t be playing hack&apos;n&apos;slash games. For some people using the gamepad and still find issues, the right analog stick is used by pushing and pulling in the directions you want the blade to strike. E.G. you want to raise your blade and strike downwards, push the right stick up then let go or bring back down and ready the upper slash position. Using the right stick allows you to slice at more accurate angles and greater speed depending on your thumbs&apos; ability to move.
<br>
<br>Story: 6
<br>It doesn&apos;t seem too interesting but the fun in the game lies more in the combat. If you&apos;re a fan of hack&apos;n slash type games, then an &apos;ok&apos; story shouldn&apos;t bother you. I haven&apos;t finished the game yet and will come back to re-rate the story when I&apos;m done but where I&apos;m at, it doesn&apos;t seem that great.
<br>[UPDATE]
<br>I&apos;ve finished it today and I&apos;m sticking to my main point. The story is not so great and the voice acting gets really cheesy the longer you play it and have more conversations with the crew. Albeit, some topics are quite funny like the classic MGS games.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 6
<br>I expect better than this especially when the game was a 23GB download on steam. The only positives I would give this game is the art because I am a nerd in robotics. If robotics or art design doesn&apos;t trigger your interests, then it would be a 3-4/10 because the textures look low res and character models aren&apos;t detailed. The physics is pretty cool in my opinion; you can run up to most objects and chop them up to pieces with quite high precision (e.g. the giant, fat tree in the first level could be cut up even though it looked like it couldn&apos;t). For graphics, I&apos;d blame the xbox 360 constraints during development because if this had been a PS3 focused title, the character models and textures would be many times better as can be seen in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. The addition of particles is a fairly nice addition to the game. I&apos;ve an Nvidia card so I don&apos;t know if the particle effects are tied to physx or not.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m currently using a PS3 controller using Motionjoy drivers combo with Better DS3 with the xbox profile setting (google for them if you have a ps3 controller or intend to get one since they are cheap now that PS4 is out). The bluetooth adapter I&apos;m using to play wireless PS3 controller is a generic one that was recommended by other Motionjoy users and devs ($10 including shipping overseas). If you have an xbox360 controller, then it should be easier from what I&apos;ve heard. Other than those technicalities, God of War III gameplay remains king for me but this game isn&apos;t too far off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3912085">Expand</a></span>

<br>But even that was not the worst part for me. What made me quit this game is that I had to kite mad kicking cow-robots in the very beginning of the first chapter, 5 minutes each. Is it a fighting or what? I always thought that fightings are about doing combos and dodging enemy attacks, not running around enemies and hitting them from time to time for hours. This is not interesting at all!
<br>The only good thing about this game are cutscenes. They are really cool. But this is a game, not a movie. So IMHO it&apos;s not worth wasting time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3911907">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are surprisingly good for a console port, and soundtrack is just awesome. If you wanna feel yourself as a hi-tech ninja with sharp blade, dismembering enemies and environment, Metal Gear Rising is your type of game.</span>

I was thinking that I have Snake, why I have to play with this damn **** But in this game, Raiden pushes the limits, drives to insanity. He faces with himself and battles against powerful villains. He becomes more mature.
<br>
<br>But this game is way easier than older games. You just slice your enemies with your goddamn cool sword. And you are a super bad ass cyborg samurai. It doesn&apos;t feel like a MGS game. Still it&apos;s quite entertaining to use Blade Mode and trying cool combos. Game play is comfortable but parry has the same button with light attack, it&apos;s just too easy. Just press light attack steady and pushing your left stick towards to enemy. You will be invincible, except for some bosses.
<br>
<br>Anyway, my score is 8 out of 10, it&apos;s entertaining but it isn&apos;t like a MG game for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3963713">Expand</a></span>

This game is nothing more than devil may cry right down to the backstreet boy looking character with cyborgs instead of demons, just another linear run through hack and slash pos, at least DMC had way cooler upgrades and skills. There is no stealth play at all, you are in approx 2025 ad running about with a sword hack and slashing cyborgs, lol downright pathetic and a slap in the face to the name metal gear, in short if you like games like devil may cry (not that it was a bad game itself) you may like this game, if you are a fan of the metal gear series and the stealth killing, planning, and having to think to play a game, look elsewhere this is not that game anymore, dumbed down to the core.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3915009">Expand</a></span>

Do not buy this **** buy DMC instead or anything else.

Let me just start by saying that the game is incredibly gory so if that&apos;s a deal breaker for you then don&apos;t bother. However if you can get past the violence than this can be a fun game for you. Graphically it&apos;s amazing the characters are all rendered well, the environments all look nice, and there is so much chaos and destruction that there will be bits and pieces of just about everything from enemies, to missiles, to vehicle parts flying all over the place. The game play has some issues though, to me the game felt like a beat &apos;em up so while chopping enemies to bits is fun it can get a little repetitive. There are some stealth elements to mix things up a bit, but there are several sections where I feel it&apos;s impossible to get through without being detected on your first try. There&apos;s a very strict learning curve throughout this game, you will have to think on the spot and master skills as quickly as you possibly can and there is little room for error. While this offers some challenge, I can safely say that this game is not nice to beginners. Not to mention the difficulty is all over the place I was killed three times by one by only to defeat the boss that came after it in one try. The soundtrack is full of kick ass hard rock and it greatly compliments all the action on screen, especially when fighting a boss. Finally, I like is the story, amidst all the hacking and slashing, there is a story that brings up many different perspectives on war philosophy and ethics in this case it&apos;s mainly centered around the subject of child soldiers. It&apos;s something that really makes you think long after you put down your controller. I like it when games do this because I think it really enhances your experience, it makes you feel like your actions have weight behind them. Just to clarify, I think this is a good game and if you want to buy it for yourself then go ahead, just be prepared for what lies ahead of you when you do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3926045">Expand</a></span>

<br>Problems? Oh yeah, a ton. It&apos;s a Konami PC port after all. No resolution settings above 1080p. No Quit (but we all know how to Alt + F4, right?). Occasional camera frustrations. Large amounts of action that happen in cutscenes, instead of by player agency. (Also: yes, it&apos;s designed for an XBox controller, but that&apos;s not a &quot;problem&quot;; if you&apos;re a PC gamer in 2014 still insisting on kb/m even though it&apos;s obviously unsuited to most games out there, YOU&apos;RE the problem.)
<br>
<br>It makes up for that with its kitschy, swivel-eyed disregard for anything approaching good taste or class. It would be comforting to think that Kojima Productions know how silly their games are, but the MGS series suggests otherwise, and maybe that&apos;s for the best. I doubt this level of campness could be achieved unless the makers looked upon their wacky story with anything level than the utmost solemnity. It is toe-curlingly theatrical, and never anything less than 100% entertaining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4369539">Expand</a></span>

MGR is probably the best example of a game being more than just the sum of its parts. The combat is a bit button-mashy (with slowly reacting AI) on lower difficulties, map design is mostly point A to point B, and the weapon variety is very limited. Somehow the game overcomes its shortcomings by combining ridiculous over-the-top cutscenes, a diverse OST with tracks ranging from traditional MGS-style ambience to blood-pumping boss themes, and a cast of uniquely difficult bosses that all feel like properly fleshed out worthy opponents for your anime cyborg ninja.
<br>
<br>Western devs are trying so hard to remove bosses and &quot;video gamey&quot; elements that when something like MGR comes along it feels like a breath of fresh air despite doing nothing revolutionary. MGR is a video game made by people who actually play video games and it shows. Bosses will beat techniques into you and make you get good, only to have the next boss require you to &quot;unlearn&quot; and adapt your previous strategies. MGR&apos;s bosses are an outstanding example of good game design in every way possible... I honestly can&apos;t remember the last time I played a game with such memorable boss fights.
<br>
<br>MGR manages to feel like an extension of MGS while standing on its own strengths. With a plausible plotline (within the MGS universe at least), charismatic bosses, a likable supporting cast, and actual character development in an action game, MGR creates something unique by smoothly melding a bevy of genre staples. I don&apos;t know if MGS fans will want to pick this up, but its hard to deny the adrenaline-pumping awesomeness of Metal Gear Rising.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=5072770">Expand</a></span>

<br>it IS however, the metal gear action stealth title you&apos;re looking for.
<br>Metal gear rising (i&apos;m not typing out that full name) is an inverse metal gear formula that focuses on an explosion of hardcore action that feels like a pleasing blend of devil may cry and- oh who am I kidding, IT&apos;S JUST FUN TO PLAY!
<br>this game&apos;s greatest strength is that it revels in being this just for fun over the top hack n slash that is the trademark of platinum. you play as raiden, and you get to do things that, quite frankly, raiden has been seen going in metal gear solid 4 a lot of the time.
<br>if you were expecting cameos by solid snake or references to the events of past metal gear titles, i laugh at you, I laugh at you and hold my belly whilst I do so.
<br>the game likes to detach itself from the canon, to keep its plot seperate but connected, there are a total of one references to solid snake, none of big boss and sunny is only there because she and raiden have a history, and she&apos;s only there for a few moments before you&apos;re flying off in a superjet with a robot dog.
<br>i&apos;m not even making that up.
<br>this game likes to make the ludicrous seem possible, or even plausible, from a cyborg brazilian samurai with a glowing red sword and a flawless trollface grin, to an indestructible US senator who spawned an internet meme with a single line before kicking your cyborg ninja character around like a football while making football league remarks, this is a game that doesn&apos;t **** around with the ridiculous-meter. but as I said, it&apos;s a blast to play, from explosions framing you in the background after many boss fights, to insane waves of enemies being chopped down in a single cut, the game&apos;s strength is its presentation and addictive &quot;zandatsu&quot; system, which involves you cutting enemies apart in exactly the way you direct the blade, which of course most processors have nightmares about.
<br>the plot is good, featuring a trial of raiden&apos;s own honor code, which is then dropped mid-game for the sake of going **** crazy and just rescuing children because that was the objective the entire time, who needs honor?
<br>despite this pitfall, the game is clearly a metal gear game, it feels like what metal gear would be like if it were simply an action title, it IS metal gear.
<br>the combat is also surprisingly deep, various I-frames or parrying frames changing between difficulty as well as a few notable adjustments to AI the harder the settings. these small details within the game speak of a well designed title that is worthy of the metal gear name.
<br>so if you like having a blast slashing apart hapless cyborgs for their electrical intestines, then this is the game for you you unrepentant psychopath! =)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4172107">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I have to give this a 2 as there is no strategic mechanic built into this game. Pure luck. I have finsihed Demon&apos;s Souls, Dark Souls and I can tell you there is no learning curve in this game. No block, just an absurd parry which doesn&apos;t work half the time.

<br>Monsoon is where I gave up FYI.</span>

<br>
<br>The blade mode is sooo good. I thought I would get numb to that within a few tries, but turned out it has so many other factors and additions (spam-cutting is often not the best scenario in terms of outcome) that keep it interesting, not to mention the raw psychological pleasure of grinding your enemies into pieces. Kill mode/ killing cut scenes are also creative and just plain cool.
<br>
<br>Every boss fight is memorable. Not only did the dev think up so many different moves for each boss, but they just nailed the brief interactions between Raiden and each boss so precisely (with great lines and main character development)  that evoked different emotions when fighting different boss. It tries to do the &quot;you&apos;re not just battling, but battling with ideas&quot; thing which is dangerous since it&apos;s beaten to death. But they still managed to pull off new and interesting ideas in the process, of which I think proudly upheld the great track record of the MGS series.
<br>
<br>In addition, it contains a lot of Japanese elements (environments/ character persona/ humor) which sneak in as a pleasant break from the hack and slash.
<br>
<br>Cons: Camera is sometimes bad, but not too much of a problem. The unnaturalness of  blade mode lining is worse in comparison, on top of some spooky interactions between the character and terrain.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4326829">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s linear story is unremarkable and very few characters leave a lasting impression, but the game makes up for this with its unique sword cutting mechanic and fast gameplay, which is very cool, especially when playing it for the first time. The best way to enjoy this is to turn your brain off, mash buttons and just let it rip. Kudos to Platinum for making a novel cyborg ninja cutting game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=7493881">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>CONS: Frame-rate limit drops by 1 fps every hour or so, until a full restart (e.g. 3 hours of play = 57 fps limit). Game ignores my chosen refresh rate (60hz) and instead uses my highest (75hz), resulting in consistent jitters (fixed via 3rd party app that forces 60hz). Mouse pointer comes in during random cutscenes. Crashed once (hardly worth mentioning). Crappy keyboard + mouse support (not really a con for me). No support above 1080p (also not my con. I use 720p).
<br>
<br>Conclusion: It&apos;s a lot of fun and not a terrible port, optimized for the most part. I think I paid $15... no regrets. I don&apos;t get why anyone would need over 1080p. It&apos;s not like the textures will look any better on 1440p, 4K or whatever. The graphics aren&apos;t ground-breaking, and still wouldn&apos;t be if you managed to take a time-machine to 4 years ago and showed it to everyone in 2010, but that&apos;s totally okay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4438351">Expand</a></span>

The story&apos;s not bad, but the game play is the main selling point.  I actually loathe the MGS franchise, however after seeing this game&apos;s footage I had to play it.  It&apos;s incredibly fun, by far the best thing about the game.  My only complaints is that it&apos;s a very short game and the pacing of it is all off.</span>

<br>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is awesome, and well worth 30 bucks.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY: The gameplay in MGR:R is fast-paced and highly-satisfying. The first time you cut a guy in half, your jaw will drop. Then, you&apos;ll do it a hundred more times and not be tired of it. Part of the reason for this is because of a mechanic called &quot;blade mode&quot; in which you can slice and dice in any direction you see fit. For example, you can cut someone in half at the waist and watch their upper body slide off their lower body while their legs remain standing -- it&apos;s very reminiscent of something you might see in a Kill Bill movie or an anime.
<br>
<br>Part of the appeal of this game is because of blade mode and the fact that enemies rarely die in the same way twice. Want to cut someone&apos;s right foot off? Go for it. Decapitation? Done. Or maybe you just want to cut off their right arm so they can&apos;t hold their gun anymore, that&apos;s fine too. As you can see, there is a lot of room for &quot;creative killing&quot; and it really increases the replay value of the game.
<br>
<br>There is a lot of variety in enemy and level design and this keeps things fresh. While there are a fair bit of &quot;quicktime event&quot; prompts, they&apos;re not too obtrusive. In reality, these quicktime events usually involve some of the most mind-blowing moments that happen throughout the game.
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS: Beautiful. I have no complaints here and not much to say except that they&apos;re awesome.
<br>
<br>SOUND: The sound effects are fitting and the music helps you get into the action. If anything, I wasn&apos;t too crazy about the vocal tracks in most of the songs, but I tended to kind of phase it out after awhile and didn&apos;t notice it much.
<br>
<br>CONTROLS: This is one area in which I have a complaint. There is some kind of negative mouse acceleration going on which can&apos;t be disabled, and it&apos;s a little annoying. Basically, it means that small, slow mouse movements don&apos;t register and this sometimes caused me to die (mainly near the end of the game when precision was required). That said, it&apos;s not THAT noticeable, and while it could certainly be better, I feel that it doesn&apos;t detract too much from the experience as a whole.
<br>
<br>REPLAY VALUE: High. There are a ton of unlockables and things to get from playing again on higher difficulties and accomplishing certain tasks. Plus, you get scored at the end of each chapter and some people might appreciate trying to beat their previous score in a level.
<br>
<br>STORY: It doesn&apos;t really &quot;continue&quot; the Metal Gear Solid storyline in any real way, but, instead, branches off on a different path to show what Raiden did after MGS4: Sons of the Patriots. In traditional MGS fasion, the story is told through several cutscenes, some of which are rather lengthy. In fact, the cutscenes of MGR:R are one of the most impressive aspects of this game to me. I was blown away by the animation, the voice acting, etc. The cutscenes seem to be mostly (or entirely) done in the in-game engine and are a joy to watch.
<br>
<br>CONCLUSION: Overall, this is simply an awesome game which I feel has gone mostly overlooked by the gaming population. It drips with AAA quality and is fun to play -- what more do you want?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4002479">Expand</a></span>

I was so sad that MGS Rising got **** because it looked so cool. More action oriented stealth where you play as a cyborg ninja character! Thankfully Revengeance turned out to be an awesome game in its own right. Platinum payed a tribute to MGS with how faithful this game was to the style and feel of MGS and threw in a little (a lot actually) of their own over-the-top flair. I wondered going into the game who the boss could possibly be and how could he possibly be stronger than 4 super cool evil cyborg ninjas? How? NANOMACHINES SON! Sorry I had to say it. Anyway this game also had really great music that fit the game perfectly, and Raiden&apos;s transformation from whiny self-pitying loser in MGS4 who seriously says &quot;it even rained on the day I was born&quot; LOL (I still liked MGS4 Raiden) into a psycho cyborg killing obsessed maniac is great. I only hope that Raiden returns one day to slay new hopefully even cooler evil cyborgs and nanomachined up war mongers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4381206">Expand</a></span>

Empecemos con algo bueno:
<br>La m&#xFA;sica es incre&#xED;ble, tiene una buena banda sonora con notas dando en el momento justo, seguro acabaras descargando la m&#xFA;sica. Un aspecto malo es que el juego DURA 5 HORAS. Es extremadamente corto, si lo re-juegas puedes superarlo en menos, de hecho, hay un logro en el cual debes terminarlo en menos de 3 horas. Es corto y los creadores lo saben. Sin embargo, el combate es muy divertido, tienes una espada pero luego puedes desbloquear mas espadas y otras 3 armas &#xFA;nicas, pero tienes que pagar por todas ellas y solo tienen ataques fuerte por lo que no puedes bloquear si no usas espada, as&#xED; que acabaras usando solo la espada o sufrir&#xE1;s muchos da&#xF1;os por golpes que con ning&#xFA;n arma secundarias podr&#xE1;s bloquear. Y si hablamos de jefes? Son batallas muy entretenidas, cada jefe es &#xFA;nico y tambi&#xE9;n tienen personalidades &#xFA;nicas, aparte de que tienen muy buena m&#xFA;sica. Sin embargo son algo malas en si, y en si me refiero a lo f&#xE1;cil que algunas son. Aqu&#xED; llegas a tener un rival llamado &quot;Sam&quot;, un igual que usa la espada que parece ser un igual en poder como Dante y Vergil en DmC. Pero no lo es, es tal ves el jefe mas f&#xE1;cil de todo el juego... Eso es lamentable. :( Otro aspecto negativo es que no hay tanta variedad en el combate como en DmC: Devil May Cry, por el gran historial de Platinium Games esperaba mas variedad y algo mas de duraci&#xF3;n. Se puede re-jugar pero hay problemas como que no puedes saltarte de un clic el dialogo de personajes, tienes que mantener Z y esperar como medio minuto a que paren de hablar. Adem&#xE1;s se volver&#xE1; mas repetitivo el combate si lo re juegas. DmC: Devil May Cry tenia una historia de igual calibre y un combate mas variado y mejor, aparte de una mayor duraci&#xF3;n y variedad de enemigos. Aqu&#xED; los personajes son muy interesantes destacando a: Raiden, Doktor, Wolf y el villano Armstron, que lamentablemente solo sale 10 minutos en todo el maldito juego. Pero los 10 minutos son oro puro, es uno de mis villanos favoritos, en serio, si lo miran seguro que se te quedara en la mente por un rato. (este es mi primer metal gear, seguro que han habido mejores por lo que he o&#xED;do) Al final le tengo que dar un 06/10, por lo corto y repetitivo pierde puntos, pero aun as&#xED; es buen juego, consigue a 30 o si puedes menos, el juego esta... es algo as&#xED; como uno de los manjares de los hoteles que son peque&#xF1;os, deliciosos y, lamentablemente, con un precio muy elevado. Si tuviera que puntuarlo por su precio completo de consola le dar&#xED;a un 05/10, pero por suerte la versi&#xF3;n de PC salio ganando.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4599271">Expand</a></span>

In this game you slash foes without thinking too much or having to solve useless puzzles to get through the levels.
<br>
<br>Graphic is awesome and the programmers managed to get a lot of polygons where needed, and almost none where no one cares, totally appreciated that because this game never ever drops fps.
<br>Music is nice, you get a lot of electro-ambient music running around and pop-rock music on boss fights (I have to say I don&apos;t like that kind of music, but since boss fights are not hours long it doesn&apos;t hurt much)
<br>Plot is good, of course nothing new: the bad guys against the children + the world, the good guys trying to save them + the world, but it was at least enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is fantastic, you have the classic slashing around, parries (not really a good button combination for those, a guard button was probably better than light attack one) and a blade slashing mode that works slowing time a lot and letting you MANUALLY slash things (having the slashed object cut exactly where you aim). I felt like Goemon with that one.
<br>Difficulty seemed quite fair. I have to say I&apos;m not used to the semi-interactive cinematic system (press button X, now button Y, spam button Z, etc) and so I had hard time with bosses for like 5 minutes at 0,1% while failing the semi-automated cinematics instructions...
<br>
<br>About flaws, I think there are just two quite noticeable: the replenishing mechanic should have been far less than FULL replenishment (this quite often makes things too easy) and the camera movement is awful with a mouse (default keybindings are instead &quot;acceptable&quot;).
<br>So, well, the camera is fine if you have a controller since it&apos;s a 100% port from console versions (DLCs included) but controlling the camera with a mouse is just not possible at 100% effectiveness. Your mouse works like an analogic lever (which is not) and thus the erratic camera movement with mice.
<br>
<br>Anyway it was good overall. So let&apos;s say totally recommended if you have a gamepad, not so much if you&apos;ve not and you&apos;re not that much an hack and slash fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4899620">Expand</a></span>

This game give players the opportunity to become one and shows what it means to slice through almost everything, especially through the enemy. It is a Hack &amp; Slay game which makes it a lot of fun, especially when changing into Blade Mode and cut through literally everything like butter. Well but that&apos;s about it, apart from the cool style there is not much which makes it more enjoyable since it gets very repetitive. The fights consists of nothing but stupid button mashing from the beginnig until to the end of the game and worst of all, no dodging option in a fast paced action game??!! Well that is indeed sad. Overall the game is a stereotypical action game starred by a stereotypical docile hero with stereotypical good looking hero moves and a stereotypical good ending story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=5530122">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also one of the few games in which you&apos;re able to CUT YOUR WAY THROUGH-OUT the playable areas and not looking for a path to go wherever you wanna go. The only boring mission the game (in my opinion) is when you face the Metal Gear EXCELSUS (mission before the final boss). Another &quot;negative&quot; are the long cinematics (but you have to see them if you wanna understand the story) but you can just skip them and kick some cyborg ass !!! Last of all I&apos;d like the gameplay to be longer because it&apos;s realy awsome but the plot is complete and you gonna enjoy it realy much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4583409">Expand</a></span>
