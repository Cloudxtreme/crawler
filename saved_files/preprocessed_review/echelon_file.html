If I have to summarize it in one word it would be: disappointing. This game had a lot of potential but none of it was realized. The concept is interesting, as you fly a hovercraft. They control much like a helicopter would. You can customize your weapons a little bit and then take to the skies. Single player was again, disappointing. It was short and rather hard at times. Multiplayer is just deathmatch or lousy coop against bots that respawn. The problem is you can&apos;t control how many of them spawn, which are far too few and it too easy. If the devs put CTF modes, a centralized server listing system, and further support for the game it would have held better but none of that was ever realized. I think even the devs &quot;Baka&quot; forgot about their own game a month after it was released. There is little to any info about this game on the internet. What a pity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/echelon/user-reviews?user_review_id=744560">Expand</a></span>
