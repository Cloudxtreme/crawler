I have spent over 11 hours on the game and still feel like I have not seen anywhere near all this game has to offer. The visuals are crisp, and fill the screen with a nice 2-D colorful environment. At a $9.99 price tag ($8.99 if you purchase it on steam this week!) its really hard to go wrong here. The music is phenomenal (beware of how catchy and addictive the main theme song is). The sound is also great. The game, like many puzzle-based games, continues to challenge the gamer. Snapshot really, really does this well. Starting off feels very easy, but just you wait. It demands open-minded thinking from the gamer and it really wants you to use every resource at your disposal to beat the more advanced levels. Simply put, Snapshot is a great game. One that deserves both your time and money. Hearing that this game offers 20+ hours of gameplay makes it all the better. Go get this game. You will not regret it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/snapshot/user-reviews?user_review_id=2608123">Expand</a></span>

When you want to take pictures of the landscape, it&apos;s more trial and error than precision. Additionally, when you walk close to ledges, the game seems to want to throw you off at times for unknown reasons.  This is only the beginning. There&apos;s all sorts of glitches where you have to restart the level if you do 1 thing wrong and you if you jump towards the top of the screen, it actually knocks you down in a dumb way that i thought Mario taught us not to design games in that way.  This game, if tweaked, could have easily gotten a 9 or a 10, but i think an 6 is a reasonable score, as it stands.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/snapshot/user-reviews?user_review_id=2845588">Expand</a></span>
