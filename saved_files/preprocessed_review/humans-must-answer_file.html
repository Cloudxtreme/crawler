Image playing R-Type with weapon upgrades that can be purchased between levels and you petty much know what you will be getting in the game. The fun mechanic of this title is you can use an energy weapon to kill regular targets and a physical gun to penetrate shielded enemies, so you will be changing between the two weapon types often. On top of that you can deploy a drone which shoot energy weapons for a few seconds in a stationary position, so you can be firing in two places at once, but you will be placing the drone in the correct location to kill the non shielded foes.
<br>
<br>Did I mention you will be playing as a chicken who is gunning against the humans?
<br>What could possibly be wrong with that???
<br>
<br>Not a perfect game, but it is good if you enjoyed old school side scroll shooters from the late 80s/early 90s.  8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/humans-must-answer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4078219">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>You must make your way through 20+ stages, some are optional but all are replayable anytime you want once unlocked.
<br>The challenge in this game comes from having limited ammo. This means you shoot when you see enemies, you can&apos;t just go in holding down the trigger the entire stage.
<br>You have 2 main weapons. One is an energy weapon that regenerates ammo with time, the second is your classic firearm weapon.
<br>There are ammo pickups for both weapons within the stages.
<br>As you replay a level you&apos;ll memorize where the enemies are and figure out which weapon is better suited for that run.
<br>You also have a special weapon and a very useful drone that will shoot for a limited amount of time from where you spawned it.
<br>Between each level you can buy/upgrade weapons, armor, capacity, etc.
<br>There is no penalty for selling back stuff, so you can try as many combinations as you want, really cool.
<br>Combine that with 4 difficulty settings and you have excellent replay value.
<br>
<br>Controls are responsive. Use either the keyboard, a 360 controller or, like me, a generic controller mapped to the keyboard with &apos;JoyToKey&apos;.
<br>
<br>Level design. Each stage has been carefully crafted and it shows. It&apos;s not just a bunch of enemies thrown at you. There are obstacles to avoid and paths to choose.
<br>Your choice of equipment (weapons and special) matters. Smart use of the drone is also important.
<br>Boss designs are quite clever, not just about shooting but figuring out how to damage them.
<br>
<br>Sound: I love the music and it fits the style perfectly. I even bought the soundtrack on the composer&apos;s Bandcamp page, MDKSound.
<br>Good sound effects, your weapons and enemy explosions have punch.
<br>
<br>Graphics: Beautifully detailed textures for enemies, obstacles and backgrounds. It&apos;s a mechanical style. There are no organic creatures or stages like in Gradius.
<br>
<br>No anime girls in bikinis crap, thank you very much. This game was not made in Japan.
<br>
<br>Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/humans-must-answer/user-reviews?user_review_id=3931032">Expand</a></span>
