<br>
<br>This is a beautiful enhancement to an awesome game. It contains all of the expansions and content from Icewind Dale, plus some more. I know that many critics and users will complain, as always, that it doesn&apos;t add enough content to warrant the $20 price tag. I disagree ($20 is not expensive for a game) and IWD adds even more than BG1 and BG2 enhanced editions did. It&apos;s very similar to the latter two games, but since Icewind Dale originally didn&apos;t have very many class choices, you&apos;re given all of the kits from BG2 plus a few new ones. The new quests and content add about ~6 hours of play (there are $20 games out there that take this amount of time to beat) and much of it is drawn from deleted content that never launched with the original game, which is awesome to see, as a fan of IWD!
<br>
<br>The UI is beautiful. I have experienced no bugs at all and everything is running flawlessly. The release of the game came quickly and as a surprise.

<br>****************************************************************************************************
<br>
<br>IWD AS A GAME, WHAT TO EXPECT: Icewind Dale is a Dungeons and Dragons-based, isometric RPG that uses the Infinity Engine, with a combat system similar to Dragon Age: Origins. It is like Baldur&apos;s Gate but at the same time, very different. Icewind Dale is not dialogue heavy. In fact, there&apos;s very little dialogue, although the small amount that exists is well-written. The plot IS good but it is rather straightforward and basic, with a couple of twists towards the end. The game has very little city exploration or party banter. What it does have is the following: superb music, incredible atmosphere, top-notch level/dungeon design, beautiful artwork, extremely high replay value, a sense of adventure and wonder, and strategic, fun, challenging combat.
<br>
<br>The beauty of the game comes from the music, art and design. The fun of the game comes from two things: (1) combat - wish very well-designed fights that require placement, strategy and planning and can be very rewarding on higher difficulties; (2) party creation. If you HATE creating full parties and spending hours thinking about how your party will work, this is probably not the game for you. If you don&apos;t hate that, it&apos;s a lot of fun and adds a ton of replay value. If you&apos;re one of those people who hates being given &quot;premade&quot; characters that you can&apos;t customize or build from scratch, THIS is the game for you.
<br>
<br>You get 6 party member slots. You can decide how to play the game in whatever way you want. Solo with a sorcerer? Play with 6 archers? Duo with a &apos;decoy&apos;/&apos;tank&apos; and healer? Make an all-evil party? An all-good party? A mixed party? Sure, you don&apos;t get the party banter of Baldur&apos;s Gate, but there&apos;s so much freedom. You can name all of your characters and make them from scratch, gear them up, give them different stats so that they work well together. I have spent hours devising ways to create an effective party, e.g., 2 melee, 2 casters, 2 decoy/tanks, or a mix of classes (multiclassing/dual classing is one of the best parts of D&amp;D). If this appeals to you, it can be SO MUCH FUN.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/icewind-dale-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4640551">Expand</a></span>

All these aspects come together really well, though, and the experience is more than just nostalgia. Revisiting the old AD&amp;D 2nd Edition is all nostalgia, though, but a few improvements here and there offer a bit more variety and depth than just the old school.
<br>
<br>If anything negative is to be said, perhaps the game is slightly too linear at times. A bit more exploration would have offered an even stronger feeling of being out in the desolate wilderness which is a feeling the game otherwise very successfully creates through it&apos;s music and artwork.
<br>
<br>For me it&apos;s a perfect casual game to play in a window while watching a stream or something like that. If you like RPGs and enjoy managing skills, tactics and customizing your finely tuned party, this is for you. I definitely recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/icewind-dale-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5357596">Expand</a></span>

<br>IWDEE looks like and feels like the ultimate version of how an IE game could be enhanced given all the lost data. So far I had no single crash, didn&apos;t encounter anything even remotely close to a bug and/or problem, didn&apos;t see anything that could upset me. With the new UI, all the new spells and kits - and in the same time with all the music, the landscapes and the enemies from the vanilla version, - the game feels absolutely brilliant.
<br>
<br>With a need of making your own party and not a single character plus tons of new spells, IWDEE gives an unlimited field to try any party composition you always wanted to try but could not let in BG. What if I try a cleric without any second class? What if I try a druid without any second class as well? What about a singing bard? What about a wild mage who&apos;s not Neera? And and all of that is available in one party!
<br>
<br>IWDEE brought me the joy of developing characters right from the first level - the thing I like in BG1 so much: these are the moments when even a pack of orcs feel dangerous. &quot;Ohh, I&apos;ve found the first +1 item!&quot; &quot;Ohh, the first level-up!&quot; &quot;Ohh, the first Mirror Image spell scroll!&quot; These emotions are simply unforgettable:)
<br>
<br>IWDEE gives you a chance to finally try and enjoy using a bard and a druid in your party. Both these classes shine in this game.
<br>
<br>IWDEE gives you items gradually. You can&apos;t visit all locations from the start to plan your items and spells - in this game you get them step-by-step. The joy of finally finding a thrown axe and finally getting a Web spell is unmatched. Beamdog have made a food job of putting new items here and there &#x2013; just like they were always there: new monk bracers come exactly when they&#x2019;re needed, a new katana +2 with a fine enchantment comes not long before a battle when you need it happens.
<br>
<br>One of my party members was a Tempus priest, a new kit developed by Beamdog. I&#x2019;ve liked him a lot. Getting Holy Power from the 1st level is a nice buff, especially combined with DUHM. Chaos of Battle became my favourite opening spell in any mass fight. Overall, a chance to try kits in IWDEE is worth it.
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;ve fallen in love with IWDEE. Being a BG fan for years, I&#x2019;ve found lots and lots of positives in IWDEE. Some spells work differently: you now have to think twice before using the Insect Plague Spell in the middle of the combat. If you fear your character can be charmed, just cast Protection from Evil on him. Enemies in IWDEE have refreshing abilities as well: you should kill those beetles fast and BEFORE they come close to your party members.
<br>
<br>I was blown away by beautiful music sets of Kuldahar and Easthaven. The battle compositions of the Vale of Shadows and the Dragon&#x2019;s Eye were lively and suited the areas perfectly.
<br>
<br>I don&#x2019;t think this game can give only one playthrough. With the variety of party compositions, certain spells that are alignment-restricted and the HoF mode, one can easily have several runs of IWDEE, the replayability is there.
<br>
<br>The new user interface is a win! With the UI which we know from BGEE and which has been further developed, playing IWD becomes as most convenient as we could ever hope.
<br>
<br>IWDEE is so good you won&#x2019;t be able to stop playing even for a sleep. It gives an absolute immunity to sleep, I should say. An impressive level of work has been put into this game. Beamdog have done it!
<br>With IWDEE Beamdog have made something abundantly clear &#x2013; that they can release a thoroughly polished product with which gamers will have a blast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/icewind-dale-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4678773">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game itself is great, gets to the heart of action quite quickly and builds the story well. Plenty of areas to visit, not as many as BGII obviously, but still a decent amount of gameplay.

As it is, replaying the same game you played 15 years ago with silent companions and asking 15 euros for it, it&apos;s kind of a stretch. Worth it for 5 euros or if they add some DLC companions in the future.</span>
