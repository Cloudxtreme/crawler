And in my opinion that is one of the most important aspects of any rpg , the game engine reminds me a lot of the dungeon siege 2 ,and the controls are okay for combat . I recently bought the glitzy no story boring action rpg assasins creed and was completely bored to tears after about 6 hours . sightseeing is not enough in games . I say give this game half a chance and you will like it . soldier on through the first hour or so as the story can be  confusing but then evrything becomes clear just like inflatable bratvurst!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-to-be-a-god/user-reviews?user_review_id=71423">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is just awesome, apart from some small problems with the general control scheme (that really arnt a problem once you get into the game) and some glitches that are quite minor and are normally fixed by saving and reloading the save
<br>
<br>Combat is always enjoyable, heaps of background whatnot to collect and read though, dialog is really well translated (not perfect, but pretty good) and the speech is quite good as well
<br>
<br>Cant really flaw this game too much to be honest, would highly recommend picking up for $15 bucks off Ebay</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-to-be-a-god/user-reviews?user_review_id=3969226">Expand</a></span>
