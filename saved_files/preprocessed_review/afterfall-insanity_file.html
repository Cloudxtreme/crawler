I have spent more money on many games that are not as good as this.  The game does start slow and the controls can be a bit clunky.  The hacking and puzzles are rather lame as was the boss fights.  That being said, once I got a few chapters into the game, things did get better and it kept my interest.  The plot and the atmosphere of the game are good.  The graphics are not great but they are pretty decent.  Just to give you a reference, the graphics are slightly below those of the more recent Call of Duty games.  It seems like the graphics got better and more detailed farther into the game.  The game was not too short.  I would have preferred having more shooting and less beating things over the head with a stick  For an initial retail price of $20, it is a good buy.  If you got the game for $1 in the pre-order special, you really lucked out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/afterfall-insanity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2818473">Expand</a></span>

<br>considering that its regulary sold for only 9,49&#x20AC; on steam (im saying &quot;only&quot; because ive played much worse, for a lot more money *cough* metro last light *cough*)

<br>
<br>the level design is interesting, it feels like a mixture of doom 3 and halflife.
<br>the controls are harder than at other games, but that makes it a challenge, i like it.
<br>it has some riddles to solve, quicktime moments, is somewhat creepy...
<br>
<br>all together i would say that the developers made the best of their limited ressources and created a solid budget game.
<br>
<br>for sure worth the price! (ps: there is also a FREE arena dlc)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/afterfall-insanity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3412850">Expand</a></span>

The story was uninteresting and bland, the voicing pretty embarrassing and the combat lousy. I really wanted to like this game, but don&apos;t go into it expecting anything. BTW I love the Dead Space franchise so don&apos;t expect the same game or you WILL be disappointed.</span>

                                        <span>I found this game to be pretty disappointing; as I only played about 30 minutes of it and then gave up. The story was uninteresting and bland, the voicing pretty embarrassing and the combat lousy. I really wanted to like this game, but don&apos;t go into it expecting anything. BTW I love the Dead Space franchise so don&apos;t expect the same game or you WILL be disappointed.</span>

<br>Mainly I want more games that have an interesting and creepy story line that is not cut and dry, most of what I don&apos;t like about this game could have been solved with a few more developers and a better budget. Turn the difficulty down and play through in a couple of sessions and you will get a good story experience for cheep.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/afterfall-insanity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3389881">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The post-apocalyptic environment did not get portrayed as shallow playground for vagabonds (the game actually parodies this with the post nuke holocaust simulator level)- the direction and set design portray an Earth transfored into an utterly bizarre and hostile planet.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s fighting mechanics were a bit repetitive but I don&apos;t expect white-knuckle strategy from AI opponents (regardless of the game) anymore. By playing the game on the &quot;hard&quot; setting the player does not have enough ammo to fight every encounter. the trick to winning &quot;Hard&quot; mode were making the fight-or-flight decisions which I found challenging.
<br>
<br>The game was enjoyable overall. At $19 for 8 hours of immersive cinematic game play you can&apos;t go wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/afterfall-insanity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3582412">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unfortunately the English voice-acting is agonisingly poor, and in places illegible without subtitles due to poor quality recordings combined with overbearing background music.
<br>
<br>Visuals are adequate, even pretty in places, including that rarity in action-horror - dark rooms are actually dark! Animations, particularly facial animations are extremely stilted and out of date, however.
<br>
<br>The combat is the heart of the game, given that even two hours in there seems to be rather a lot of it, and this is what murders the experience for me - fights are simple exchanges of &apos;block&apos; &apos;strike&apos;, &apos;block&apos; &apos;strike&apos; repeated until the enemy turns into a sluggish ragdoll with a snarl or a groan. Repeat ad nauseum. Firearms combat appears to do nothing to alter AI, and merely drills off enemy HP until they either slump, or experience a gory limb removal.
<br>
<br>Default movement is a very slow, floating jog, giving the protagonist a manner both camp/effete and slightly creepy. You can slow this down further with a walk button, held constantly rather than toggled, but the walk is a sort of sleepy, unconcerned saunter more suited to a summer evening than a living nightmare. Beyond that is yet another reiteration of the Gears of War sprint, blurring and shaking as you hurl yourself like a charging bull into walls, using the local geometry to steer. Lacking any real physics implementation, you&apos;ll simply slide off the richly detailed but utterly static environmental clutter, and your stamina for combat and running will inexplicably recharge within half a second, almost rendering it irrelevant.
<br>
<br>What can be said... Some opportunist took a promising indie game and turned it into a low-budget Polish Dead Space with poor localisation and crude features - and I&apos;m talking about the updated version with &apos;significantly enhanced combat&apos; here - I can&apos;t imagine how bad the original must have been.
<br>
<br>A tragic waste, an overwhelmingly boring, formulaic copy-cat of a game, that fails to copy the best parts of its predecessors while slavishly mimicking the use of picked up notes (all irrelevant and boring), clunky third person melee combat and bland shooting. Cargo cult game design at its finest.
<br>
<br>Play something else, but hope these developers get to use their skills on a better directed project one-day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/afterfall-insanity/user-reviews?user_review_id=4184379">Expand</a></span>

Why this game is so hopeless? Because: 1 brainless Al 2 Graphics dates from the PS2 3 Music ... One of the worst soundtracks in gaming history. 4.Playability does not exist. I do not need to exchange more minuses. If the game was not free would get zero.</span>

<br>The sound is frequently off, voice out of sync in respect to character animations and the combat system quite laughable. However, I did appreciate the graphics, suspense, very good touch on mental mambo-jumbos and slightly scary atmosphere.

<br>
<br>The atmosphere is okay, but it is not a true horror game to what I have played, there are some scary scenes but not a game like Amnesia: The Dark Descent or OUTLAST which you will get some good scares, but reminds me like I am playing Alan Wake or Eternal Darkness with their psychological horror.
<br>
<br>But, there are some flaws, the sound effects are terrible, they sound like they were taken from a cheap sound website or from a cheap B-Movie, the voice acting is not bad, the main character&apos;s voice is awful, it&apos;s like the voice actor who voiced the main character was not bothered or was bored when recording, as it sounds pretty boring. The other actors voices are not bad, but still not up to good quality standards.
<br>
<br>The combat is awful, it looks like everyone has problems like the exorcist having spasms and I have encountered some glitches and bugs, like doors won&apos;t open and I have to reload to the last checkpoint, and sometimes the game freezes momentarily which bugs me, but overall the game is not terrible and is quite a good game if you are bored from other games and feel like playing a game that has a mediocre gameplay and story.
<br>
<br>Afterfall Insanity: Extended Edition includes the DLC with it. The DLC honestly is a waste, why on earth would you call it DLC if there is only two modes, Dirty Arena (in which you use melee weapons, and as you progress you use guns) and Second Strike (in which you use guns), which the gameplay just consists of wave after wave of enemies, then when you reach the fifth wave you get the boss. What a waste. Now I can understand if it was in Co-Op or Multiplayer, but not on your own!
<br>
<br>I understand the story focuses on just one guy, but on the DLC, the player and his friends or other players could of played as the main character, Karolina, the colonel, anyone of the characters mentioned, but nope, just you all by yourself, hitting and shooting your way through five waves over and over again, boring. What a waste on a good idea for DLC. Don&apos;t try the DLC, unless you are interested in what the DLC holds (like me), then by all means, try it... just don&apos;t expect anything good out of it! And if this is what DLC should be, then thank god I don&apos;t waste my money of this type of &quot;downloadable content&quot;
<br>
<br>Now to the recommendation, for its full price, I would not recommend it, BUT if it is either in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game like I got it (IndieGala&apos;s Giveaway - 25th May 2014) then I would recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/afterfall-insanity/user-reviews?user_review_id=5338086">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So, basically this is the action-survival-horror post-apocaliptic kind of thing.
<br>Which can be rather good bad also a pain in the &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;.
<br>The story of Afterfall, or at least the idea of it, is interesting and could be something pretty good actually. The main character is a psychiatrist which is supposed to investigate a serious disease which causing the people around mental and physical changes. I won&apos;t spoil anything else about the story and the game&apos;s futuristic setting but I would say that they&apos;re basically great and have a lot of potential.
<br>
<br>Too bad the execution is so bad... because that story doesn&apos;t go too far and doesn&apos;t develop that well.
<br>Is there a good climax at least...? I wouldn&apos;t say so.
<br>Also the script was pretty poor, and the characters&apos; voice-overs even poorer.
<br>What could be a pretty darn good video-game story ended up being a nuisance.
<br>
<br>A good gameplay can always save the situation, of course, because who gives a damn about story when there&apos;s a good game to be played, right?
<br>Well, the gameplay is also a tragedy, unfortunately, and is filled with mostly running around and with boring, not too fun, not too challanging, not rewarding at all- melee combat.
<br>There&apos;s a very low amount of weapons to choose from, and it all gets rather repetitive very quickly.
<br>Towards the end of the game it all got too annoying for me and I simply used a trainer just to finish this game and see how it ends.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s graphics were actually fine, BUT, about half of the game happens withing undergound shelters which are designed in a boring and repetitive way. And when you get out, IF you&apos;ll get to this point in the game, somehow it doesn&apos;t get too impressive, too.
<br>
<br>The music and sounds are well done, but I felt it only when listening to the game&apos;s soundtrack outside of the game (being the video-game&amp;soundtracks geek that I am) and I somehow felt that the soundtrack isn&apos;t integrated so well into the game, and gets way too repetitive and banal.
<br>
<br>As I said at the beginning I did enjoy this game somehow, to some extent.
<br>It made me curious enough to go and try the sequel (Reconquest) which I download at this very moment.
<br>I still wouldn&apos;t recommend this game so much.
<br>Perhaps you should try it if you, too, like mysels, have some mysterious affections to certain bizzare andor mediocre games.
<br>And.. well, it&apos;s just 5 dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/afterfall-insanity/user-reviews?user_review_id=5199813">Expand</a></span>
