AND, Yes, well, erm, err....... it was supposed to be but it isn&apos;t, not even close.
<br>
<br>The fact that the money for the development of the release was raised almost completely by fans of the prequel is absolutely amazing! Truly! Unfortunately though it looks like the developer ran out of money and didn&apos;t want to confess up to it, or just didn&apos;t care about the sorry unoptimized state that the computer game is presently in, maybe they just hated the idea of not making a profit on their title, and so instead served up their fans with what they describe on steam as a &quot;FULL RELEASE&quot;. and NO NO NO, this is a sorry excuse for a FULL RELEASE, its a terribly unoptimized piece of crap. Either the development team have overextended themselves, or they have run out of money. This is embarrassing, even to me, and truly, someone who has worked in the computer game industry and spoken to developers all over the world I have to say that I&apos;m extremely disappointed. The outdated graphics, and &quot;Playstation 1&quot; textures is really quite acceptable really, lets remember the DOS version of Carma2 was absolutely spectacular and had terrible graphics, so thats no problem and it was generally accepted because the playability of the prequel was so high. It just seems like a waste.
<br>
<br>What a waste Stainless games, you just stained yourself with this terrible release. A real slideshow of a game, by the way that means stuttering and terrible performance issues, even on a supercomputer with the best graphics card available in the world, (thats a $5000 machine), a sloppy hideous mess! Really? I&apos;m not sure how the developer managed to fool themselves that this was in any proper state to release, because the Q&amp;A and beta testers feedback must have still been ringing in their ears. What did you do? You chose to ignore them and release it anyway, and I have to say, looking at other spectacular A++ titles, you have failed, miserably to capture something which could have been the most epic title in a decade.
<br>
<br>FAIL!
<br>
<br>Expect a lot of &quot;hate&quot; from real hardcore fans whom you have really disappointed. I am sure the turdbuying teenagers won&apos;t notice the difference between other B titles, but you really messed this up. and what cost? Another sequel that could have been golden and had great promise ruined by budgeting , greed and project management ignorance! argh it burns.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5267092">Expand</a></span>

No, not great, and yeah, I agree - it should have been better with those graphics, hence I take away one point. But truth be told, I don&apos;t give a whack about the graphics when I fire up Carmageddon.
<br>
<br>I played a lot of Carma2 back in the day. I always adored the series. Under the cloak of  really, REALLY brutal setting, there was a very specific gameplay that happened to be incredibly fun. Reicarnation brings that back. And adds some new small stuff on top of it, that only hone the formula, and does not break anything. I love the way parts that fell off you are flying back to you when you repair, and the huge emphasis on powerups, new and old ones.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s sad, really - limited budget nowadays equals bad rep apparently. This is ceirtanly not a 3.9 game (current User Score as I write). Just because it does not work on your PC, it does not mean it&apos;s bad.
<br>
<br>Actually, the game itself is amazing. Physics, powerups, peds smashing, car destroying - everything is there, and it&apos;s better than ever. It&apos;s really hard to describe how awesome that is. This is one of those formulas that never get old.
<br>
<br>And yeah, there are bugs, inconsistencies, and random rant-generators here and there, but that really is irrelevant, carma never was perfectly logical and stable, it never was a problem, this game is chaos.
<br>
<br>Oh, and one more thing - If you are annoyed by the high repair cost to eat up all your score, I have a bad news for you - you just suck. I don&apos;t want to offend anyone, but I&apos;m glad there&apos;s this rule in career - it unlocks more events for you when you actually deserve it, the game does not treat you like a child and expects you to have some skill. Are we really this spoiled by today&apos;s AAA titles to turn that into disadvantage?
<br>
<br>In the end, I&apos;m absolutely glad that C:R got released. I love this experience. Negative reviews were keeping me out of buying it, but then I saw some videos where people seemed to have fun with it, and I decided to buy it. For me, it was worth the full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5355172">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Fragile cars: this is a somewhat new in Reincarnation I guess. Your starting vehicle (Eagle/Hawk) is rather fast but weak. You do however have access to stronger cars quite fast, so picking and upgrading the best car for the gamemode solves this.
<br>
<br>AI: I noticed that some bots just drove away from you or attacked you in early access. However now they feel just like they did in Carma 1 &amp; 2. Racing when you are racing, hunting when you are hunting. AI seems to be targeting every other car in the game without wrecking them (= good thing imo).
<br>
<br>I hope this somewhat explains the low score on metacritic, it&apos;s sad that the developers didn&apos;t release the game as it plays now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=6334303">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Needless to say I didn&apos;t hesitate to back Carmageddon Reincarnation when I found out Stainless was doing a Kickstarter back in 2012. The game was originally set to be released in 2013 but it got delayed several times until it finally materialized on Steam Early Access in March 2014. There it lingered until it was released in May 2015 after yet another delay.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played every Alpha and Beta version of CR and while the game looked decidedly mediocre and ran terrible it showed a lot of promise so I kept giving Stainless the benefit of the doubt.
<br>
<br>On their Kickstarter page Stainless states &quot;The Carmageddon community means the world to us&quot; yet they were very silent on the Steam forums and updates were few and far between during the games year-long stay in Early Access.
<br>
<br>In May 2015 CR finally went gold and it saddens me to report that Reincarnation is still buggy and highly unoptimized. This game looks incredibly dated (it pales in comparison to 2008&apos;s GTA IV for example) yet it somehow manages to be more demanding than even the most advanced modern open world titles (eg Witcher 3, GTA 5).
<br>
<br>Many graphical options have been cut from the final version of the game, normally this would be a bad thing but in CR&apos;s case it doesn&apos;t really matter because tweaking the game&apos;s graphical options doesn&apos;t seem to change a whole lot performance-wise, no matter what settings I select this game keeps struggling to maintain 30fps on my system (i7,12gb ram, 960 (4gb) ) and the frame rate drops below 20fps every single time I pick up/ use certain power-ups.
<br>
<br>Loading times are very long, textures and foliage look primitive, there is no regular traffic, no day and night cycle, no variable weather and no cockpit view.
<br>
<br>I do like the game&apos;s art and the fact that Carma&apos;s dark humour is present.
<br>
<br>The cars also look quite good and they have a proper damage model. If you&apos;ve played the old Carma games the car handling will feel just right, the game controls perfectly fine with a pad and it&apos;s also playable with a keyboard. I don&apos;t think wheels are supported at the moment.
<br>
<br>Peds look pretty dated but they&apos;re animated well enough. The gore is nicely done for the most part although I would prefer it if peds didn&apos;t explode so easily.
<br>
<br>AI is rudimentary at best. Your opponents still teleport around the map like they do in Carma 1 and 2. They also have trouble reaching certain spots on the map, this makes them more or less useless during some of the game&apos;s new modes. I don&apos;t really mind this but if you&apos;re looking for a game with challenging, &quot;believable&quot; opponents you may want to look elsewhere.
<br>
<br>CR has your &quot;typical&quot; fun Carma pickups (both classics and new ones) and there is a varied selection of cool, over-the-top maps. Sadly activating some of these pickups will turn the game into a slideshow, some maps also run much worse than others.
<br>
<br>The UI is fine but I would like to have the option to toggle it on and off.
<br>
<br>The replay feature is back and it&apos;s a joy to use.
<br>
<br>Sound design is very good and I would rate the OST higher if it didn&apos;t contain bloody dubstep tracks, this is not the biggest issue in the world but I think it&apos;s worth mentioning nonetheless because that noise gets really old really fast and it feels totally out of place.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer modes are still devoid of peds and pretty buggy, lag and random disconnects are still common even when trying to play with RL friends.
<br>
<br>So no I would not recommend CR, at least not in its current state. I know Stainless isn&apos;t a huge AAA studio but if your game looks archaic it should fly on modern gaming hardware, you can&apos;t have poor graphics, mediocre AI etc and expect to get away with poor performance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5270236">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well that has  been fixed with a patch that has fixed the Frames Per Second  issue. Now its a steady frame rate of 30fps and that on balanced settings. My system is an AMD Athlon 2X4 645 proc. 3100mhz with 5 gigs of ram and an R7 250 with a resolution of 1680*1050. I left a very critical review on steam. The developer contacted me and wanted me to try the newest patch for the game. I had uninstalled the game as it was unplayable. So I did just that. I downloaded the game and played it again.
<br>
<br>What a difference. Smooth driving. No more micro pauses every 2 minutes or so. No more jumping up and down on the FPS. It was playable and fun. I was very pleased. I have since changed my review to a more positive review on steam and here. The game is still not perfect. The music well it started to get stuck so I killed it as I dont care for the music. The signs on the building will pop in and out on occasion. I consider those issues mostly minor. The loads time are longer then what I would like. The important part is the game is now playable. I am able to race and to crush other cars and critters. So the Bad optimization is gone.
<br>
<br>Its history. It does not take a super computer to run it and have with it. So yes it was a terrible game however it has gotten a LOT BETTER with the newest patch.So if your like me and uninstalled the game due to it being unplayable on low end systems. Give it another try. You might be surprised by the way it plays now. My new review for the newest patch on this game. I hope to see more patches to further improve this game.

The framerate fluctuates too much even on a powerful gaming rig, and it&apos;s just an average game, technologically speaking. They had a lot of time to fix the issues before the final release, but sadly it didn&apos;t happen. BUT, it&apos;s a great game, a great remake, gameplay feels right just like the old fun Carma. The cars, the maps, game modes, everything&apos;s great. There&apos;s a big potential in there, a great game under the sheets, but at the moment it&apos;s just an unoptimized mess. Guess we&apos;ll have to wait some more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5266344">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Speaking of multiplayer, yeah, not really feeling very motivated to do that, as it is.  I mostly just enjoyed the career mode.  I know there&apos;s freeplay, but for a little more sense of direction it would be nice to see career mode keep going.

<br>
<br>I can now highly recommend this game,why? the performance issues are fixed, the game has been balanced, car handling etc. and they are working on with new updates, and are communicating a lot now with fans, and are listening to what you, the community wants this game to be.
<br>
<br>Before the update the game was running ridiculously slow, but now its smooth, and I can actually switch on all the effects and enjoy.
<br>
<br>It runs well and is as advertised. Check it out!
<br>
<br>I hope others who&apos;ve reviewed the game as negative give it another shot too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5438942">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>yes, you do need a decent gaming pc, but for me that was kinda Obvious. I needed to buy a new pc for Carmageddon 2, so i prepared to do the same for Carmageddon Reincarnation. And for me it is worth it. 270 hours since the first early acces. Loving every minute of it, well amost, losing isn&apos;t fun,
<br>The damage system is amazing, every crash is different and i&apos;ve never seen the same dents or shapes. Like other car wrecking games, the cars Always end up in the same damaged model, but not carmageddon.
<br>I also like the skidmarks that stay a long time. Even if you havent been in a part of the map yet, but the AI has, you can see the results of their carnage.
<br>
<br>People say the graphics are from 2005 but i dont see that, the game looks great on the higher settings. Maybe on the lower settings it looks old, but you cant really judge a game that way.
<br>
<br>But its all about gameplay, that&apos;s what makes a game good, and replayable. Car wrecking is never the same, AI is very good. Killing all peds without using stella is challenging
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is fun and intense, i Always start with my feet on the table, but Always end on the edge of my couch.
<br>
<br>i gave it a 9, because i know there are people who cant play the game because of the high requirements, and i feel sad for them. I hope they will be able to enjoy the game as much as i do in the near future. But after watching the twitch streams from stainless, i&apos;m sure they will get it fixed.
<br>
<br>Can&apos;t wait for the tracked vehicles and car splitting btw!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5279279">Expand</a></span>

It is broken, it runs like kife on even the highest end systems. Stainless had to know but they bungled things up so bad with the engine early on that they ran outta steam &amp; had to drop it like a steaming hot turd. It is not possible unless you&apos;re religitard crazy fundamentalist fanatical (like the few giving this more than a 6) about Carma &amp; you own high end rig, to reconcile the narrow scope, hugely dated graphics &amp; the disgustingly horrible performance. It&apos;s appalling that this ever came to market, at least as a &quot;final&quot;, &quot;gold&quot; release. I&apos;m sick &amp; tired of turds being called &quot;gold&quot;. Fix it or stop taking money for it &amp; give back what you did take post &quot;launch&quot;. C:R is Core2 Duo/Phenom X2 material at best &amp; even i5/i7 systems can&apos;t keep 60 FPS afloat on this. The content &amp; the game being more inline with something from 2005 is fine. I love Carma, this is Carma, it&apos;s a nicer looking version of the older games &amp; there&apos;s a huge amount of fun to be had if it were possible to run it. Great damage model, probably unmatched in any other game, but that&apos;s the only area that it possibly excels. The maps have really fun layouts but they&apos;re small &amp; not many of &apos;em. Being a small indie dev is a fine excuse for having less content &amp; less than par graphics &amp; lacking much of the things that a larger game from a larger dev may have, but it is never excusable to release broken garbage in exchange for $, no matter how unique your game may be, or how small your studio. Proper functionality &amp; performance is a bare minimum whether you&apos;re large or small &amp; Stainless blew it. I hope they fix it because I love Carma as much as anyone, but the reviews ain&apos;t gonna change. :(

<br>I give it a deuce, because that&apos;s what you gave us Stainless, a big fat stanky deuce.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5288027">Expand</a></span>

And that is exactly what Carmageddon: Reincarnation is. To hell with the rules, let&apos;s just roam the streets with the pedal to the metal while listening to the peds yelling for mercy as you light them on fire or electrify them for a nice sunday barbecue.

<br>
<br>As a Backer I am disappointed in this game, it could have been so much more.
<br>
<br>The new race types are a nice change, but the game balance seems rather broken, cars are simultaneously too fragile and too tough, sometimes a light bump is all they need to explode, other times cars can take massive impacts, mines and mortars and cheap kicking.
<br>
<br>Speaking of power ups, they are just many flavors of the same thing with cosmetic differences, and most are pretty useless.

So consider the source on places like Metacritic.
<br>I think myself the game runs at a ten out of ten. Frame rates are good. After reading some of the (honest) negative reviews on the game there are things I miss. Such as traffic. The fact that for some reason the peds bodies dont get bloody anymore. Yeah there are some minor issues.
<br>But considering its not a AAA company I still think they did pretty good with the engine that they were most likely forced to use.
<br>
<br>GOOD
<br>The game feels like Carma1 and Carma2.
<br>The peds seem pretty good as the old games.
<br>You can play the regular Carma type races if you want.
<br>The powerups etc have some new additions plus the old ones.
<br>The graphics look good on my HDMI TV connection at1920 x 1080.
<br>Runs at mostly 35 FPS or better full settings.
<br>Handling is still fun like the old games.
<br>Older maps are &quot;upgraded&quot;
<br>I love the details on the cars, disk brakes , etc.
<br>
<br>BAD
<br>Peds feel a little stale.
<br>No bloody peds seen in final release (they could fix that.)
<br>MP games are sketchy and seem based on connection (what online game isnt :) )
<br>FPS sometimes drop in pinball mode, (But at the time so did Carma2)
<br>Graphical glitches right now like when a wall disappears for a split second.
<br>
<br>I was a backer also because I loved the idea of Carmageddon and would love to see a present version  modded for the next few years. As for how much I backed, it was definitely more than the normal cost of a game but I didnt back it for myself, I backed it so we all could enjoy the game. Playing the beta was a living hell, but thats why they are betas. Now after playing the full game and playing every game mode I think they did a great job. Cant wait to see the DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5275196">Expand</a></span>

<br>On my PC (Overclocked at 4.7Ghz), GTX 760Ti it always runs above 45FPS, and that&apos;s smooth. Not great but good performance!

<br>
<br>I think addressing the complaints of others is important. The first issue that people are claiming are the performance issues; I bought my video card 4 years ago, and this game will run on some of the highest visual settings still. I feel as though most people could have a smooth performance if they&apos;d simply be willing to lower the visual settings. The visual settings are even named things like &apos;better performance&apos; or &apos;best performance&apos;. Part of being a PC gamer is understanding that the visual settings are modifiable, and thus you have to be willing to play with low or moderate settings with less capable computers.
<br>
<br>The second complaint is that you have to accumulate points to go to the next zone...there are three matches per zone, and it&apos;s extremely easy to get enough points to proceed just by playing those three matches.
<br>
<br>The third complaint, which is more founded, is the complaint regarding load times. Yes, the load times are fairly long, though if you happen to have a SSD for your games, the load times aren&apos;t bad at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5280744">Expand</a></span>

<br>Carmageddon : R is so far the best in the series.

<br>I certainly recommend the game to anyone who&apos;s a fan of the previous games, or like mindless fun.

<br>Before i go into pros and cons, i have to add that Carmageddon Reincarnation, although gone out of BETA and into GOLD, is not yet the complete experience.
<br>What do i mean?
<br>It is known that the developers are working on many, new, never-before seen in Carmageddon games features such as 2-wheeled tech, Tracked Wheel tech (the ability to add tanks in game :D), new maps, cars and car splitting.
<br>Also being a small/medium sized studio the amount of work, they achieved in creating their own Graphics Engine (no Unity, Unreal or Source here, since it was decided in 2012 before those went free) crushing bugs and dedication is phenomenal. Key features like Pinball mode, used to be huge CPU eaters (rightfully so), but not anymore! Each event in Single Player runs pretty smooth!
<br>By the way here&apos;s my performance report :
<br>
<br>Game runs good on 1080p Medium Settings on a 2012 PC. i5-3470 , 8GB RAM , GTX 750Ti, Samsung SSD 120GB. &quot;Runs great&quot; means 40-70 FPS on all times. And it is great since anything above 35FPS is enjoyable. 25-35 FPS is playable. Minor FPS drops only in Multiplayer. Single Player is great!
<br>
<br>I played the newest build (Gold Version) for a few hours and here&apos;s what i have to say for the v.1.0 and the game in general
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>-Awesome sandbox maps and gameplay full of unexpected outcomes.
<br>-One of the most detailed crushing code/physics i&apos;ve ever seen in a car/driving game
<br>-Great car models! Each car is unique with it&apos;s own parts (moving or not) and drives differently.
<br>-Sounds and animations are hilariously stupid! Cow sounds for example always give me a good chuckle.
<br>-Enemy car AI has improved A LOT since Alpha! I was amazed at the preciseness of the whole thing. If i&apos;m allowed to post videos in reviews to showcase this, i will.
<br>-The performance is good and smooth now on a 2012 PC rig.
<br>- There are some pretty eye-catching and innovative features like tires blowing off and popping out, and the suspension system is exemplary. Not many games can brag about such detailed stuff.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Although i never go went lower than 30FPS on 1080p mostly on medium settings, and the range is 30-70 FPS, the game could still be optimized a bit more. I don&apos;t consider it an &quot;unoptimized mess&quot; by any means, but the truth is it needs a bit more smoothing out.
<br>-One map feels visually empty (Icy Oil Rig).
<br>-Receiving and giving damage on Hard Difficulty is insane. That might or might not be a case with you (may other people found it pretty easy), but i was getting wrecked all the time and the damage i dealt to others was not satisfactory. On lower difficulty modes it&apos;s much better.
<br>
<br>Overall this game has the best combination of physics, fun and gameplay from all the latest driving games. Should you like Car Mayhem games i recommend this.
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of the first Carmageddon games i can&apos;t even describe how much you&apos;ll love this game.
<br>
<br>Taking into consideration that Stainless is not by any means an AAA studio in terms of size, i&apos;ll have to give this one a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carmageddon-reincarnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5268481">Expand</a></span>
