From an objective point of view, it is an OK game. The story remains unchanged from the original,and is a bit short in length.
<br>
<br>The interface is simple though sometimes a bit cluttered with many interaction possibilities crammed into a single area. The spacebar provides a &quot;reveal&quot; function which identifies each interactable area, alleviating this problem.
<br>
<br>The audio is pretty good, some of the games soundtrack comes through a bit too loud but the quality is good. The background audio in game (Jazz musicians, Tribal Drummers, etc..) is great and really helps set the mood during certain sequences.
<br>
<br>Graphically there is something to be desired. The graphics themselves aren&apos;t bad per se, but the game tries to blend 3D characters against 2D backdrops without depth scaling. This leads to 3D characters getting inexplicably taller as they move towards objects intended to be farther away, such as doors. The players character enters one door at normal height yet barely fits under another door in the distance. Aside from the poor blend, the visuals are good.
<br>
<br>Overall, this remake gets an 8 from me, but a big part of that is based on the nostalgia.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gabriel-knight-sins-of-the-fathers-20th-anniversary-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612280">Expand</a></span>

This game combines being true to the original while making  improvements and modernizing. And its visually stunning!
<br>
<br>+Amazing HD graphics! I love the way they kept the original composition as much as possible.
<br>+The new voice-over cast is a surprising success!
<br>+The new remastered music is wonderful!
<br>+Hints system and notes adds to the gameplay experience!
<br>
<br>-Some visual collision and sliding issues on animations, kind of jagged at times.
<br>-Had to reload a couple of times due to problems with continue function
<br>
<br>The new voice-over cast was initially worrying. Not so strange being a hardcore fan of the old 1993 version, having played it close to 30 times. However after a couple of hours into it, I found it surprisingly refreshing and wonderful. Especially happy to see the essence of Gabriel&apos;s cocky New Orleans character being intact. I would also mention Grace, Dr John, Mosely and Frick as outstanding performances.
<br>
<br>Visually its a balanced mix of photo and painted textures, blended with pre-rendered backgrounds and real-time props &amp; characters. A nice touch is the ambient atmospheric particles &amp; lighting effects.
<br>
<br>The original music is remastered by composer Robert Holmes. This is a huge improvement from the early 90s midi tracks.
<br>
<br>The bonus option to view old concept art from the different locations, combined with info and audio interviews with the original developers is a nice addition for fans of the old game.
<br>
<br>I would highly recommend this game for adventure fans, looking for a story driven game. If you are already a fan of Gabriel Knight, what are you waiting for?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gabriel-knight-sins-of-the-fathers-20th-anniversary-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612754">Expand</a></span>

The story is the same old classic people love so not much to say about that. Now that the most glaring, immersion-breaking technical issues have been dealt with, I can recommend this as a pretty decent way to relive the original without  any DOSBox shenanigans.</span>

<br>The HD remake portion is pretty good. New backgrounds and cutscenes are nicely detailed and the technology work great. 3D models are a bit low-res, but still good.
<br>
<br>Game length is fair. The story start a bit dull, but near the end it get really interesting. It is also pretty evident a female was the writer here based on some sentences.
<br>
<br>I encountered two places where I think it&apos;s impossible to think you need to do this without a guide, which is much less than the majority of p&amp;c games, so it&apos;s good. I encountered few smalls bugs (Gabriel not pushing the dead professor out of his chair the first time I entered the room, the mummies animation not getting triggered and wondering why I was dead, journal hints stay active even after completion of objective), but it&apos;s nothing game breaking.
<br>
<br>Voice acting is the poorest point of this game. The narrator voice is seriously irritating and cringe-worthy. Gabriel was not really nice to hear too. (sorry devs).
<br>
<br>Still a very great game to play for others like me who did not play the original, or for big fans of the original who want to see it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gabriel-knight-sins-of-the-fathers-20th-anniversary-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612410">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not sure this was such a good idea. The original was VERY unique, created by a group of master artists and programmers at the now defunct Sierra. Pinkerton Road are quite frankly not up to the challenge. Yes, they may have more cutting edge tools at their disposal, but it&apos;s like telling a high school art student to recreate the Mona Lisa. Some of the &quot;improvements&quot;, such as streamlining down the UI, feel like concessions made for the casual crowd.

I miss that era. Here is to the hope that remakes like this will stir things up and see not only continuations to these old classic gems but also new beautiful soulful games. Fans make some noise please!!!
<br>
<br>The game: Engrossing story based on real historical facts - locations- people mixed with myths and the supernatural, entertaining, fun to play and provoking characters(even when some act in a cliche way there is always a reason for it), excellent dialogue and atmospheric music. Challenging riddles and a classic point n click adventure gameplay.
<br>
<br>The remake: True to the original with beautiful graphics and very good voice acting. A job well done.
<br>
<br>Recommended for: Adventure, point n click, mystery, puzzles, horror, gothic, story rich, detective enthusiasts. Also people that like books. ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gabriel-knight-sins-of-the-fathers-20th-anniversary-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6839588">Expand</a></span>

<br>I will be very clear and objective about this remake of Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, so all who read this review can understand exactly what I mean with my words.
<br>
<br>1) In regards of graphics, this remake is amazing, with scenarios full of details, colors and clear passion in each one. Although, 3D models are not as good as I was expecting. In fact, I think that 2D and 3D does not combine well.
<br>
<br>2) In regards of musical scores, this remake is also great, in the same line of the original, with new instruments and, again, a lot of passion.
<br>
<br>3) Puzzles and extras are also good and I don&apos;t have anything to point out.
<br>
<br>4) But in this remake of GK there is one particular thing that does not surpasses the original and that thing is the interface. This remake&apos;s interface is somehow strange, sometimes unresponsive and annoying, especially when  we try walking to a certain area of screen and extra options show up undesired.
<br>
<br>5) Animations contribute to increase the atmosphere, but GK&apos;s animations react badly. Each time messages are shown on screen, skipping them makes ALL game animations run fast-forward until they reach the start loop point, which is awful, annoying and, most importantly, unacceptable for a new game like this. The original version did not suffer from this and even in 1994 this &quot;strange thing&quot; was also not an acceptable thing!
<br>
<br>In SUMMARY, Gabriel Knight is a decent game, with a great story, excellent graphics but with serious failures that should already be solved before launch date. I understand the passion, dedication and efforts around this project, but if the original did not miss in its aim, this one cannot definitely fail! For all this, and for the great annoyance certain things in the game causes to players, I&apos;d give it just a 6 out of 10. I give it a 6 because I&apos;m a GK admirer and lover, otherwise I&apos;d rate it 5 out of 10.
<br>
<br>PS: I&apos;d change my mind if I saw, in the future, these main problems solved. I can&apos;t be totally on the side of user CURUNIR, but I do understand his frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gabriel-knight-sins-of-the-fathers-20th-anniversary-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4605687">Expand</a></span>
