<br>
<br>My biggest issue with the game is the wizard class. the combo button scheme is strange to me and isn&apos;t gauntlet like. The wizard isn&apos;t a class that anyone can pick up and play. All other characters are great!
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t look too much into the negative reviews. A lot of people don&apos;t understand what Gauntlet is (this is a little different from the traditional concept Gauntlet, but imo a good twist) . I think they were expecting something more along the lines of Diablo. You aren&apos;t going to have fun if you play this by yourself and conquer it in 4 hours. It was meant to be played as a team!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4782890">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&#xB4;s kinda hard to play alone, and very fun to play with friends. I dont play the first Gauntlet, but i&#xB4;m happy to aplay this one!</span>

Those whom were huge fans of the previous games likely wont enjoy this much. However if you were into Magicka you will likely have a great time. The wizard is basically magicka lite.
<br>
<br>The story is there but you kind of have to look for it which really pulls you out of the game. So this game should be avoided if your looking for a story. As for a party game , or a game to be played with friends or even on stream with friends this game will hold its own. It&apos;s not a 40-60$ game and therefore you get your monies worth.
<br>
<br>However it is not the Gauntlet that we all deserve. It is still however better than that &quot;Thing&quot; we call Sacred 3. However Sacred 3 is more of an rpg than this. You do no character building. There is no loot. Super limited on upgrades and most of which requires high difficulty play to even unlock.
<br>
<br>There are 4 characters / classes in the game. Warrior, Archer, Valkyrie, Wizard. The Wizard is a combo based spell caster. Adding different elements creates a different spell. It has more play style than anyone else and was very obviously inspired by Magicka, hence the Magicka LITE comment earlier.
<br>
<br>The Archer is the most mobile class and seemed to do a decent amount of aoe. The biggest thing you noticed is that you can actually move and attack which is extremely important when playing on higher difficulties. However as an archer you have a harder time destroying the monster spawners.
<br>
<br>The Warrior is a barbarian. Wielding an axe you chop like the best of em. Pretty generic, Decent survivablity but playing on harder difficulties ... is well... Hard as a melee oriented class. This is definitely the class that at best is meant for killing monster spawners.
<br>
<br>Then there is the Valkyrie. The tank. The Paladin... The avenger.... Yea , that&apos;s right. I said Avenger. She throws her shield like Captain America. She is pretty beefy, Can do a decent amount of aoe at melee and at range. Most importantly. She has a block. She is the best at survival. Can fight at melee or ranged. She is kind of a tank anyway. She has a shield and can block but takes a lot of damage. Use of all of the tools is required to play her.
<br>
<br>I stuck with the Archer while my co-op partner played a Valkyrie and then later swapped to Wizard. We played through the first door with no issues. However on the first floor of the second door we encountered a game HALTERING bug. Where the key we picked up did not actually acknowledge that we picked it up. However it was no longer in the game world and we could no longer progress. That was the stopping point for me. Once you hit a game breaking bug that rings bells.
<br>
<br>The Drastik Measure gives this game a 6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4534215">Expand</a></span>

Its also frustrating seeing how small your character is. You wouldn&apos;t beat this game because its fun, you would beat it because you want to see the ending or your very bored.</span>

<br>Cursor keys for movement have been around for oh 30 years or so (hint : if you&apos;re left handed with the mouse, then your right hand is naturally over arrow keys not WASD)... Come on people, stop tacking on a half-a**ed crippled keyboard bad port job as an afterthought to controllers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4539729">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gauntlet: Nostalgia Quick Cash Edition. This game is unplayable in single player as the difficulty is set for 4 players co-op (4 pack costs 55&#x20AC;). I remember Gauntlet from the golden age of arcades where you had 600 health for 1 credit (coin) and you could enjoy the dungeons for a while. This remake is spitting in your face and is more expensive than a day out in arcade.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4536760">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty levels allow players looking for a challenge to experience death on the level of the original title but there are also easier difficulties for the rest of us.  The variation in play mechanics for each character is a strong point that allows Gauntlet to not be overly simple but also not to lose its arcadish feel.  The potential for growth in this game is still there, which keeps it from being a 10 in my books, but the foundation is fantastic and hopefully there will be some memorable DLC to push this game up the last few notches to a must-play co-op experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4541329">Expand</a></span>

It was one of the best games of the 80s, hands down.  I decided to purchase it on steam and I am glad I did.  The game feels very much like the old gauntlet did, even keeping sayings like &quot;Warrior needs food, badly.&quot;, the spawning skulls even look different as you damage them to a certain point, and many other little things that just brought back great memories!
<br>
<br>The developers of the game also did not go overboard and try to re-create the wheel.  The kept it simple and made it just overall very fun to play.  Each class has a different feel to it, and I love how they integrated the achievements in to the game play.  Example:  Die 5 times and you will drop less gold on deaths.  So dying isn&apos;t exactly a bad thing in this game.
<br>
<br>Also love the fact that this isn&apos;t a pure click-to-win game.  You can, and you will have to restart the entire level if you don&apos;t pay attention.  The game uses &quot;Skull coins&quot; or something to allow you to continue play after you die.  If you lose all your skull coins on one level, you die completely and have to restart the level.  Makes the game feel like the arcade!
<br>
<br>Overall 10/10.  I can&apos;t see how they could of made this better.  Loving this game and it&apos;s only $20 on steam.. Best $20 game I&apos;ve purchased in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4545096">Expand</a></span>

While, it doesn&apos;t play exactly like the classics it modernizes the combat system. The Elf playing like the classic gauntlet by shooting things as much as possible, the Wizard shoots varied projectiles based on the combinations of buttons you hit beforehand akin to Magicka, the Warrior is a heavy hitting brawler, and the Valkyrie acts like a tank. The game takes a different method of character progression in comparison to Legends and Legacy by swapping out the leveling system with upgrading the
<br>
<br>character based off of their performance.
<br>For example: the wizard has a thing if you kill X amount of enemies you get a 15% reduction on the cool-down of your charge ability.
<br>
<br>The item system only allows you to carry two items but I&apos;d argue that these items are significantly more unique with items such as a gargoyle or fire boots that leave a trail of flames that damage enemies.
<br>
<br>Overall its a breath of fresh air to the series and if you love gauntlet like I do you&apos;ll certainly love this game as much as I do</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4532167">Expand</a></span>

The only downside is how Gauntlet thrives on couch co-op, which maybe very difficult for some to pull off since this is a PC only game as of right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4531506">Expand</a></span>

<br>I recommend you buy it now, especially if you like arcade dungeon crawlers, as the series is the granddaddy of them.

<br>
<br>Next up Gauntlet is barely an RPG. Sure, you play as something you are not in real life, but Unreal Tournament isn&apos;t an RPG. It is just a co-operative dungeon crawler like Magicka was, but all indoors instead of a mix of locations.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d probably otherwise say 8/10. It is a good game, will I play it for 50+ hours? Probably. Would I pay &#xA3;14.99 for it? Clearly. Do I think it is a true reboot of the Classic Game? Absolutely.
<br>
<br>Next up we have a comment about class imbalance. Finding three of the classes hard? Play the other one. I can solo the game I have played so far with the Elf, so how you can say it is actually too hard unless you play the Valkyrie is beyond me. I agree about the Wizard, but in co-op that sort of thing may play better.
<br>
<br>Notice I agree with Thaeru who noted the game had a lot of Magicka in it as a negative criticism. Notice that Thaeru went on to give the game 6/10. Not 0/10 and not 2/10. Thaeru even found a game-breaking bug and it got 6/10 - about the worst game experience you can have.
<br>
<br>Think carefully before you mark a game that far in the Red.
<br>
<br>If you like co-op Dungeon-Crawlers. You will like Gauntlet. That&apos;s the bottom-line.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4534519">Expand</a></span>

Some time ago, there was another reboot ( which did not have the license i think ) it was called &quot;get Medieval&quot; - which was much more in the spirit of Gauntlet.
<br>
<br>This Gauntlet however feels much more like a mixture between Diablo 3 and any other generic dual stick arcade game.
<br>
<br>1) visuals:
<br>The game looks OK - but not great. It does run surprisingly bad for how it looks though - and especially the settings/options menu is outright terrible.
<br>
<br>2) gameplay:
<br>The game offers non procedually generated dungeons, which limits the replayability. I am not sure if the original offered it ( i kind of doubt it ) - but from what i read about it, the actual levels were larger, a lot less restrictive.
<br>
<br>Gauntlet offers linear levels with occasional secret spots - but usually closes doors so backtracking or actually using the enviroment becomes unavailable. What made the original gauntlet special was the monster generators, which produced legions of monsters - turning the game more into a gorefest like &quot;infested planet&quot;. This gauntlet is fairly conservative with its monsters it seems. The monsters are tougher - hence you get less.
<br>
<br>3) character classes:
<br>hm - they are not very balanced. While the original games classes were pretty much the same with just different sprites, in this revision the classes are a bit too different.
<br>
<br>the IDEA of them is not bad - and being different is very good, too. - but not if some class is much weaker.
<br>
<br>warrior: kind of generic melee class - but no reason to pick him when the valkyrie is better
<br>valkyrie: generic melee class
<br>archer: feels very weak, possibly a good support, but not so much suited for singleplayer in my opinion
<br>mage: interesting concept, but too complicated in a fast firefight. switching spells should not have been done with 3 key combinations, but rather with hotkeys - the mage already severely lacks other instant defenses ( dodgeroll, block etc )
<br>
<br>so for now - it is a fun game for a .. more or less fair price - if patches fix the game, especially the options menu and optimize it more.
<br>
<br>however, in terms of a revision of the old classic, it does not come very close.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4541492">Expand</a></span>

I was always a fan of the arcade and NES Gauntlet games, and this one combines what was great about those games with good graphics, humour, improved combat, and much more. If you&apos;re looking for a classic Gauntlet experience, try playing as the Elf, as his combat style is a lot like the original games. 10/10 I shot the food.</span>

The four playable characters have very unique playstyles which complement one another nicely, and the difficulty can scale up to require a truly seasoned party to overcome. Character progression is satisfying and interesting, eschewing Gauntlet Legends&apos; experience-based system for one which provides discrete bonuses for individual actions and achievements (you start healing when you blow up food if you do it enough!).
<br>
<br>Overall, Gauntlet is and always has been a game for people with friends, so if you have a group of buddies to play and laugh with  (either over voicechat or on the couch with you), you&apos;re going to have a great time. Playing solo is still fun, but might be too difficult and doesn&apos;t really showcase the true shine of this title. For $20 this title is absolutely worth every penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4532442">Expand</a></span>

<br>Wizard -TooHardDidn&apos;tPlay

This class is really over complicated, why would you make the wizard have combos but none of the others? Gauntlet is suppose to be a easy 3 button masher.

<br>
<br>Wizard -TooHardDidn&apos;tPlay
<br>
<br>This class is really over complicated, why would you make the wizard have combos but none of the others? Gauntlet is suppose to be a easy 3 button masher.
<br>
<br>Warrior - Under-powered Valkyrie
<br>
<br>This class really just feels like a valkyrie that is missing power and getting into battle abilities.
<br>
<br>Elf - The Toothpick Shooter
<br>
<br>This class is the weakest out of all of them. Your main attack does not even do damage to the spawners ... When all the other classes quick attack does...
<br>
<br>Valkyrie - The Only Good Class
<br>
<br>The title says it, this class is actually kind of fun to play. All the classes should of been like this one.
<br>
<br>OVERALL - this game is a very generic boring game. This is unfortunate since I am a huge fan boy of all the other ones that have ever came out. I feel like this was a corporate product to get a quick buck. I would not recommend this game to anyone who likes games that are fun.

The four characters available have differences in their playing styles which makes the game worth playing multiple times. The enemies are difficult at times but this forces the player to get creative rather than fall into the same murderous trance over and over again. Each floor contains something different from bosses, to death incarnate, to just flat out treasure troves. To make things better, the game contains many upgrades in the form of relics and you can even customize your hero with new armor and weapons in the shop in the hub room. This game is made even more fun when you play with your friends, the teamwork element makes strategies more fun and gathering more loot than your friend is always a fun contest. I cannot wait to see how this game progresses. It is a fantastic reboot and is more fun than most games I&apos;ve played this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4532946">Expand</a></span>

The classes are fun to play, the grinding is actually exciting, and the difficulties are, well, in fact like any arcade style game, Difficult.</span>

<br>+ Warrior chatter is hilarious
<br>
<br>+ Core gameplay mechanics are really, really fun. Love the idea of being locked in a room and spawners coming up spawning endless waves of enemies and lobbing AOE fire bombs into the middle of them with the wizard. Or running into the middle of a huge mob and doing the warriors spin attack and clearing a huge hole in the group. It&apos;s really a shame the map designs don&apos;t complement this enough.
<br>
<br>+ Decent graphics, but the FXAA isn&apos;t cutting it. You can see really bad jaggies.
<br>
<br>+ Fun and unique characters, just wish they all had as much complexity as the wizard.
<br>
<br>+ Wizard is really fun and probably the funnest character. He has so many magic spells that lets you have many play styles. Can play support or be an aggressive killing machine once maxed out masteries.
<br>
<br>Negative
<br>_____________
<br>- Bad camera when playing online multiplayer, you will often get screen locked. The hosts character controls  the camera position and centers around him.
<br>
<br>- HUD and kill streak popups cover your character onscreen because they take up 15% of the bottom of the screen! Because when you&apos;re running away from hordes and disappear from the screen, lol!
<br>
<br>- A lot of bad map designs and way too repetitive. The run and kill styled maps just kill the fun aspects of this game, the camping and fighting off huge waves of enemies! Dungeon 2 and 3 both have way too much run and kill style maps. Bad map design decision that don&apos;t complement the game whatsoever. Sorry to whoever made these maps, but they&apos;re seriously some of the worst maps I&apos;ve ever played for a top down view game like this.
<br>
<br>- Character balance isn&apos;t the best
<br>
<br>- The amount of content is way too little for a $20 title
<br>
<br>- Way too much grinding! Devs skimped on the content so they&apos;ve added over 50+ hours of grinding the same boring masteries over and over! Have fun killing something crazy like 80,000+ different enemy types on every character to get the damage perks so you can play the harder difficulties. It&apos;s just awful and makes me not want to even fire up the game anymore.
<br>
<br>- Finding an online game is a nightmare. &quot;connection lost&quot;, &quot;game already started&quot;, blah, blah blah. Have fun enjoying pressing join game 10 times to get into a game, and when you finally get into one, the character you want to play is already taken! rinse and repeat 2 more times.
<br>
<br>- Puzzles are so brainless and boring. Stand here to spin this thing, crank this lever to release lava, push block to get key. I&apos;m awful at puzzles and didn&apos;t even need to think for this stuff. It&apos;s just dumb filler puzzles.
<br>
<br>- Difficutlties need to be reworked. &quot;Unfair&quot;, the highest difficulty isn&apos;t even that hard once your team figures out to focus fire the spawners. Once everyone does this, the game feels like normal mode and becomes way too easy. Most pub players don&apos;t know to do this, so I guess it gives the impression of being hard, but the experienced players that have an ounce of strategy know &quot;unfair&quot; is a joke.
<br>
<br>- 99% of the relics are all useless, I&apos;m not joking. Just save your gold and get Ring of Mirrors. It&apos;s priced the highest for a reason, it&apos;s the strongest. Everything else just seems like a gimmick. Not to mention relics are very rarely used because of they require potion pickups in game. Once people get potions they just horde them until the arena map to spam them to make the arena map easier. A lot of people don&apos;t even use them because they forget they have them, that&apos;s how gimmicky they are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4562468">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The point is... This is perfect
<br>
<br>The maniability is really good and pleasant and easy to learn, and for those who say there is a probleme with the control... I guess they are not very smart because it&apos;s really easy to fixe with the keyboard and buying a pad is not that expensive...
<br>
<br>The progression of the caracter is something I really like... You don&apos;t loos your time in your inventory full of random **** like in diablo for exemple. You juste take pleasure by killing creatures and the succes system will upgrade your caracter, prefect!!
<br>But you spend time in this smart shop were you can choose your two Relics and try to find the best combo for your caracter.
<br>
<br>The graphics are simple and nice, we don&apos;t need more.
<br>
<br>This is the perfect game to spend hours and hours with friends and have fun with them.  What else???</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4538066">Expand</a></span>

<br>Overall, the gameplay experience was decent enough, but there wasn&#x2019;t all that much of it; for $20, only about 4-5 hours of gameplay feels a bit limited, but the fairly limited nature of the gameplay meant that stretching the game out any longer would have been a mistake as well, as there just isn&#x2019;t enough meat to the game for such. While there are challenges to complete which grant the player permanent minor buffs, and a number of relics which the player can unlock, in the end none of them really felt interesting or exciting enough that I had to play the game over and over again, grinding through the levels to unlock them. For $5 it would be a fine game, and even for $10 it would be okay for a lark with friends, but at $20 I expect a more substantial experience than what this game has to offer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4565440">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>HELL NO. Enough about that DLC scam. Gauntlet remake is a short, simple, soft-worked game. While its basis is still fun, it feels like devs ran into a hurry and cut the game while having just 3 tilesets (worlds).
<br>
<br>Gauntlet Legacy is just 1000 times better that this one. This one should still be a reallyc ool game, if it were at least 4-5 times bigger and varied, not just 3 &quot;worlds&quot; (tiles) with 4 levels each...
<br>
<br>Of course DLC would improve it, (in fact there is already a DLC with a new character, the necromancer) but still that should be a real scam. U pay full prize for the &quot;basis&quot; of the game, worth around 4-5 hours of gameplay, then u buy DLCs to &quot;complete&quot; the game. And thats the point, new DLCs wouldn&#xB4;t exactly be a extension of the game, but the pieces required to really have a full game.
<br>
<br>We could also point not just the lack of content but poor design (key rebinding is unknown to the game), and the fact its intended for multiplayer only. (Ofc u can play solo, but no really point on it, since it doesn&#xB4;t have a real character building or progress at all, its a multiplayer experience on its core)
<br>
<br>I give it a 1 just for the fact that, the little &quot;piece&quot; of game that is made, is ok done. (just fine, nothing specially remarkable) But as said. If this game get tons of DLC to expand gameplay time and map variety, as well as enemy variety, and they get all on a single bundle together by the prize of a fair game, THEN and only THEN it should be worth to buy and play it -with friends, ofc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=5081035">Expand</a></span>

The real fun begins when you bring a friend along for the ride via the local or online co-op multiplayer system. It deserves a place in everyone&apos;s library.</span>

Definitely check it out on Youtube before you buy it though as it&apos;s very basic and won&apos;t be for everyone.</span>

Character development is present only in form of perks (if you destroy enough food it actually starts to heal you, mage ignores first hit after taking amount of dmg, etc.), buying and upgrading relics (spells) and vanity items (armor skins).
<br>
<br>Each of four characters has unique feel and different playstyle.
<br>
<br>Mage: Casting is done by combining 3 elements into 9 spells (very similar to magicka). It takes a while to get used to and such it creates disadvantage in the beginning. But after a bit of practice this makes wizard useful in any situation you can imagine and IMHO the strongest class.
<br>
<br>Valkyrie: My favourite. Mobile, strong, capable of tanking and with ranged attack.
<br>
<br>Warrior: Brutal killing machine, creates a lot of space with every blow. Capable of running through hordes and invincible when using his special attack.
<br>
<br>Elf: Quite the same as in the original. Bombs and arrows, bombs ON arrows :), sniping mode and dodging.
<br>
<br>Addressing issue Catwaffles mentioned: the wizard/ranger only shoot at 45* angles
<br>This is just false. All classes have omnidirectional aim.
<br>
<br>Graphics are mediocre. Not ugly, not awesome.
<br>
<br>Overall: Gather some friends and go play this. It&apos;s fun. And that&apos;s the most important thing, isn&apos;t it? Btw sorry for my English. It&apos;s not my first language.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4538459">Expand</a></span>

<br>The games initial enjoyment quickly fizzles and you will be left wondering about the $20 price tag.  I don&apos;t know how someone could give this a &apos;10&apos;; People need to keep that score reserved for games like Baldurs Gate 2 and XCOM:UFO defense or else you are just skewering the rating system.
<br>Pros:
<br>- Characters have very different playing styles, which adds a  few more hours of entertainment mastering the different techniques.
<br>- fun co-op play.
<br>Cons:
<br>- it could be so much more!!! Have the different outfits provide perks! (fire arrows for the complete &apos;hard&apos; level armor set for the elf, increased fire explosions for the wizard, etc.)
<br>- More character customization, random level generation,  and better rewards would make for a gaming experience that would keep you coming back.
<br>(PS: character centered viewpoint on co-op would be an improvement, even if you are still confined to a limited space...  I hate being at the edge of the frame and getting hit by an enemy I cant even see!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4545092">Expand</a></span>

<br>Not much to do after you beat the game aside from play with the other characters and/or farm gold to get new cosmetics for your favorite character, but I don&apos;t see this having appeal to most people beyond the campaign clear.  Games like Gauntlet paved the way for something like Diablo, but now that Diablo has been around, Gauntlet just feels like Diablo-lite.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=6801732">Expand</a></span>

I purchased the game as a gift for some friends, and family. They&apos;ve been able to play it just fine, but the one copy I kept for myself has never been able to run because I&apos;ve been waiting for the Linux Support, and they coded it in such a way it&apos;s impossible to get working in Wine. The whole 20 min Steam says I&apos;ve played the game was just a vain attempt to try and get it to work tough Wine like so many other Steam games do.
<br>
<br>As of Last month you could buy Steam Boxes on the Steam Store, but no update as to weather or not support will ever come.
<br>
<br>Since I did get it for some family my brother brought his machine over to attempt to get local multiplayer working. Getting multiple controllers to work on the PC is an out right nightmare, and I&apos;m a Linux Guy willing to pound my head into a brick wall trying to get a game to work with Wine. One control is easy, two is hard, but doable. Four, and you may as well be blood letting to your favored God, or Devil. And that&apos;s on a windows box where the game runs just fine.
<br>
<br>As of Today it is Free for PS4 owners with a Playstation Plus account. I will probably be buying 3 additional controllers just so my wife, kids, friends, and family can all play local multiplay the way Gauntlet was intended to be played.
<br>
<br>At least I don&apos;t have to toss more money at this game just to get it to work, but the PC version is an unacceptable monster that should be avoided if at all possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=5856102">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve read a bad review of the classes here so I just gona give my two cents about it:
<br>&quot;Wizard -TooHardDidn&apos;tPlay This class is really over complicated, why would you make the wizard have combos but none of the others? Gauntlet is suppose to be a easy 3 button masher.&quot; Giving wizard combos made him very distinctive from other characters and he is really a bit hard to master but once you do you can do amazing things with him.
<br>
<br>&quot;Warrior - Under-powered&quot;
<br>Not really, he is a bit harder to play as you need to be in mele range but his dash knocks enemies down and damage them (kills many of the weaker mobs) and while you&apos;re attacking easier mobs cant damage you so you have to watch out for projectiles and harder-hitting mobs which are relatively easy to avoid. Still fun to play if you prefer mele.
<br>
<br>&quot;Valkyrie This class really just feels like a valkyrie that is missing power and getting into battle abilities.&quot;
<br>Haven&apos;t played it at all so far as I was focused on the other classes but if you think its good while others arent Im sure I&apos;ll like it :)
<br>
<br>&quot;Elf - The Toothpick Shooter This class is the weakest out of all of them. Your main attack does not even do damage to the spawners ... When all the other classes quick attack does...&quot;
<br>Its a sustained fire ranged class it have to do less damage as you can damage your enemies while constantly moving. Great class to play if your aim is good you as you can basically run circles with your enemies while sniping high-threat targets, also have decent aoe, if it would do more damage it would be OP as hell.
<br>
<br>If you give a game 2 because you can&apos;t play it Im not sure if thats a valid score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gauntlet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4768444">Expand</a></span>

In hard mode the hordes of monsters are much smarter and it pleased me greatly. Recommend playing yes, the amount charged is totally cost-effective. I look forward to more expansions dungeons the biggest downside of the game yet. oh and Merlin is totally fun to play, it&apos;s a blast.</span>

With 9 titles exisiting dating way back to 1985 I felt I needed to experience this title which dated back through the decades.
<br>Now this iteration of the game, as is customary with the other 9 games in the series (or so the wikipedia page tells me), is a hack&apos;n&apos;slash, dungeon crawler. A formula that I somewhat enjoy, having played things like Torchlight as well as Path of Exile, alongside several other games.
<br>In this title there are a four different classes to choose from, including a warrior (bashy bashy type class), a valkyrie (sort of like the warrior but with a Captain America-like shield which can be thrown), an Elf (who can shoot stuff and throw bombs) and finally a wizard (who has a range of spells and I&apos;ve also spent most the time playing). Their skills sets are all fairly versatile ranging from the mere axe swinging antics of the warrior to room clearing fireballs with the wizard. You can also buy upgrades for each class by collecting enough gold in each dungeon level. These upgrades range from several relics, which all classes can use, and vary from radial freezing abilities to summoning gargoyles to fight with you. Alongside the relics you can also buy new weapons which grant your character different abilities, class dependant of course. And of course you can buy cosmetic items to change the look of your class. Do you feel the wizard isn&apos;t Gandalf-y enough for you? Buy him a pointy hat. Or is the warrior too scantily clad for your tastes? Then buy him some armour. Each class has about three different cosmetic options for both the head and the body. Armours, hoods, capes and hats. Take your pick. You can also unlock capes by beating numerous waves of enemies in the colosseum, which I tell you now is no easy feat.
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Overall I&apos;d say this latest iteration of Gauntlet has many of the elements that dungeon crawling, hack&apos;n&apos;slash titles have and need. If you&apos;ve played the other Gauntlet titles or have played titles such as Torchlight or Diablo etc this is definitley worth a look.
