                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_5853196"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">As someone who really liked the series up to this point (besides how the writers handled the teen dialogue which was pretty awful at the start) this last episode was really disheartening. The fact that it&apos;s getting so many nines and tens astounds me considered how many things are blatantly just...wrong with this episode.
<br>
<br>The David &quot;puzzle&quot; is a complete joke, it has the most warped logic as to what will make a difference and is frustrating in all the ways a good puzzle shouldn&apos;t be. Going through an apocalyptic Arcadia Beach was cool to begin with until the puzzles for saving people started kicking in...I honestly didn&apos;t see the point of saving anyone beyond the people in the diner since Max was obviously not going to let this future stay (more on that later). The &quot;dream&quot; sequence was also something that started out interesting and had a few highlights even later on that do a good job of showing Max&apos;s insecurities but it drags on FAR to long, especially the walking down memory lane with Chloe part.
<br>
<br>And the ending...My god the ending. This ending is the personification of your choices having no meaning. This is mass effect levels of disappointment except with one less option. Time is depicted as a thinking force that is actively out to hunt down Chloe since she is &quot;destined to die&quot;...but she never would have been saved in the first place if time had never given Max her power? Max has visions of the storm BEFORE she has her first time travel incident, before she even saves Chloe. Also, when Max goes back in time and saves William from dying on the day he was supposed to the storm never came at him like a bat out of hell. It seems to still be coming years later but why did he get a delay when Chloe didn&apos;t? Is the storm really just about teaching Max a lesson? A lesson Max...wouldn&apos;t really have needed to learn had she not received these powers in the first place?
<br>
<br>This ending reeks of plotholes, invalidates all of your previous decisions no matter what path you go down and yet people still praise it. I can only assume they are blinded by &quot;feels&quot; as I might have been years ago when I was fresh to the story driven game genre and while I did find one of the endings to be particularly sad the path leading up to it had me feeling more upset and betrayed than anything else.
<br>
<br>I might have given this episode a 7/10 and the series as a whole a solid 8 if not 9 had the ending been even just decent, but I can&apos;t stress enough how important an ending is to a game based around telling a story. Overall I give this episode a 3 for all the reasons I stated above, the only things saving it from any lower is some interesting and well-handled scenes and imagery. For the series as a whole I give it a 6/10. I would no longer refer this series to someone based on it being an excellent game in it&apos;s genre, I would only refer it to someone who has already played a lot of adventure games and was just looking for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5853196">Expand</a></span>

Admittedly, there were a few times that the story hit rather close to home and pulled my heart strings (Chloe&apos;s debacle). Shy of a 10 only because of a slightly rushed Mass Effect-style ending, a few spots of inaccurate lip syncing, I would still recommend LiS to anyone as one of the best games of 2015.</span>

I&apos;m removing this episode from my mind and making my own ending, where we go back to the first photograph, simply keep standing in the toilets so Chloe&apos;s life gets saved without abusing Time Travel, save Kate, and still bust Jefferson/Nathan. Boom, best ending to the game.

<br>
<br>[Potential spoilers ahead, but without specific details.]
<br>
<br>If you choose one ending, what you get feels hollow, unsatisfying, and &quot;wrong.&quot;  Players can easily go back into the menu, start the game from that last branch, and choose the other ending.  Basically, players can use Max&apos;s powers to go back and put things right ... but the game makers don&apos;t force you to do that.  They leave you to come to that conclusion on your own.  When you finally make the right choice, you have to live with the decision just as Max does.  It&apos;s brilliant!
<br>
<br>[More overt spoilers ahead]
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not clear if Max knows at the end that she even has time-traveling powers.  The entire game seems to be about Max coming to terms with and accepting Chloe&apos;s death.  It&apos;s a game about loss, denial, mourning, acceptance, and maturity.  It is truly a coming-of-age story, and it&apos;s beautifully done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5581082">Expand</a></span>

The previous episodes had been good, they had depicted a college student&apos;s life with relative success - &apos;hipster&apos; is the only way to describe the atmosphere. The game then took a darker turn to then finally end up with this episode. I would describe more of the game but the reason I won&apos;t is because there is literally no point. There are two endings to the game and only one of which feels like the &apos;correct&apos; one. Kill everyone in your town besides you and your bestfriend or kill your bestfriend. Any sane person chooses the first one, but therefore every single episode before this one is meaningless. In short, this game has wasted your time making a story that results in it all being destroyed physically or not even existing in the first place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5632346">Expand</a></span>

There are too many plot holes at the ending of the game.   The game having two endings felt really forced and everything you played from episode 1-4 didn&apos;t really matter in this episode. The story would work well in a movie or set of movies, but not in a game where you put your hours on the first 80% only to be wasted on the remaining 20%. Every effort and dilemma I put on playing the first four episodes just faded away, like a bubble.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5643261">Expand</a></span>

Definitely the greatest emotional impact a game had on me since Walking Dead part 1. The action in this episode will be surreal at times, as we finally experience what being &apos;beyond dimensions&apos; feels like, while the final choice of the game plays with your expectations beautifully. You might know (or feel) where this is going, yet the interactions between the characters are done so delicately and so majestically at times that the ending still delivers a blow... The kind of blow you see coming yet avoiding it is impossible. From my point of view, there could be no other way for the game to come to its conclusion, as there can be no truly happy endings when playing with the fabric of time and life itself. Any other sort of ending would have probably only weakened the fantastic emotional power of the game...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5627459">Expand</a></span>

What cannot be debated however is how the rest of the episode is panned out, many of the sections of the game not meshing or congealing with what the other episodes excelled on. Gone are the well paced events that drive the story. In the beginning of the game Max picks up right from where she left off, in the clutches off the supposed antagonist. While I was concerned over the tone shift at the final quarter of Episode 4, they handled it well without being overbearing. The villain in the first 30 minutes could hardly be more &quot;psychopath murder villain&quot; token. He hardly adds to the plot and is just there to give Max a situation of peril. He&apos;s bland to put it simply. What hurts however is the whole sequence in the Dark Room, where much of your time is spent listening to the token dialogue and minimal interactivity, it&apos;s painfully slow for what should have been an explosive start.
<br>
<br>LiS really utilized the reverse time mechanic very well even for the most menial of tasks throughout the first four episodes, but in EP5, Max uses it for simple, but awful stealth sections, trial and error  (in a bad way) fight scenes, and meaningless choices. And speaking of meaningless choices, Polarized probably summed it up the best. It&apos;s easy to understand that DontNod aren&apos;t big time developers and not everything will see come to a close, but absolutely everything, Rachel&apos;s story, Victoria&apos;s fate, Nathan&apos;s fate, Max&apos;s powers, the storm, and even Jefferson&apos;s motives, see little to no closure whatsoever in addition to the few dozen other choices that you have made throughout the series. If you played LiS&apos;s last 5 minutes, you would&apos;ve played the entire game as your choices have no effect on the binary endings, both if which sell the concept well enough, but choice is disappointingly thrown out of the window.
<br>
<br>What really drove the events of the game was the craftsmanship of Max and Chloe&apos;s relationship, whether platonic or romantic, there was no denying it was the driving force of the series and the reason LiS is so amazing in the first place. Here, it takes a smaller backseat to a more &quot;meta-nightmare-introspect&quot; of Max overusing her powers, which is best summed up with the mixed bag of a nightmare sequence. On one hand, the final sequence of the game really presents the final two choices in the game with polarizing evidence that makes the choice much tougher to swallow for many players, but getting there was a chore. LiS didn&apos;t need to break the fourth wall b/c it had a world/atmosphere beautifully developed that was one of the main sticking points, and to abandon that in favor of an annoying stealth section paired with pseudo time travel wackiness that hurts more than peaks interest.
<br>
<br>Chloe&apos;s character arc, imo, is the most interesting in the game, as her tragic backstory and her relationship with Max is what drives the game forward, but the writing takes a dip.  Most dialogue exchanged consists of Max prioritizing Chloe and putting her above anything else, which is compelling, but the dialogue with Jefferson, Victoria, David, Warren, and hell even herself felt lower quality. Knowing that the writing of the beautiful intro of Episode 4 has dropped is gnawing.
<br>
<br>Other than that there exists nitpicks. The Warren romance subplot feels shoehorned in without proper context, the many red herrings the game teases like Rachel and the doe, how one ending throws logic out of the window, how Nathan&apos;s character takes a sudden 180 turn just to satisfy fans, and the amazing music is sparse. Many can disagree on these minor infractions, but what cannot be denied is that Polarized is a disappointing conclusion to what might&apos;ve been one of the best narratives told in gaming.

<br>LiS is still an excellent series, and the first four episodes are some of my favorite experiences, despite them not being plot concluding as episode 5, they understood what people loved most, the gentle world building/atmosphere and the small moments between the game&apos;s two protagonists that is among the most fleshed out in gaming. Polarized is still an emotional roller coaster in bursts, and the open ending actually works better than an overexplained one, but there was so much that could&apos;ve been done better. As for the ending? Bae over Bay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5853758">Expand</a></span>

<br>it was very &quot;Lackluster&quot; &amp; felt rushed, I also noticed that the Lips animation were not really matching with what the character were saying.
<br>
<br>OVERALL: Amazing game, poor ending.</span>

In our desperate attempt to make everything right we truly learn what meddling with time and destiny can lead to, that we can not always have it our way and that we need to bear and accept the consequences that come along with our decisions.
<br>We get to explore the main protagonists true self, her feelings, her fears, how she grew as a character. And what friendship truly is.
<br>All this is delivered with some really heart-wrenching moments and powerful lines (the voice actors did an astonishing job here!).
<br>
<br>While I understand that the ending may not live up to some peoples expectations I am satisfied with the way the game ends.
<br>The way that we play and experience the main protagonist, all the choices that we make along the way (and how little their impact may seem at times, but it is there) ultimately boil down to this one final decision that concludes all the amazing character development that both main protagonists went through over the course of the five episodes.
<br>I do feel that only one of the two possible outcomes is the way the story truly was meant to end. In retrospect that is the only valid conclusion that the story build-up along with all its foreshadowing led us to.
<br>And it was done in a delicate way - with powerful scenes and a wonderful soundtrack.
<br>
<br>It gave me closure. I am satisfied. And that is all I asked for after this wonderful journey.
<br>
<br>I am truly glad for this beautiful experience that is &apos;Life is Strange Season 1&apos; and I envy those who have not yet played it but hopefully will.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5577784">Expand</a></span>

<br>At the end 6/10</span>

<br>
<br>By the time episode 5 came out, I was genuinely excited.. we just had, that cliffhanger, how was the main character going to get out of this one? and she got out of it the way the bulk of the fan base thought she would.. a picture. sorry but it really annoyed me how it was the first thing I guessed and they went with it, it was quite linear, again this may just be me but I found that cliffhanger utterly pointless, it could&#x2019;ve been the character we all thought it was and it wouldn&#x2019;t have changed a **** thing, we just needed an &#x201C;oh **** moment so more people would buy the game of course.. It added nothing to the overall story for me at least felt quite half arsed.
<br>
<br>But then I went back in time in episode 5.. and then I was introduced to the most consistent filler that I have ever witnessed in a video game. I wasted 1 hour, doing **** all in this episode. literally, walking. that was the experience. I walked for an hour, or looked at something that I&#x2019;d already seen. That&#x2019;s filler. that&#x2019;s boring and I don&#x2019;t care. I found myself actually saying &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care, get the plot moving&#x201D; more in this game then any other game I have ever played. Maybe that&#x2019;s because I don&#x2019;t buy into this whole teen drama sub plot.. or was it the main plot? Wait, we have a character who can go back in time and change **** Why can&#x2019;t we see her do something cool instead of revolving the game around 1 person.. her unlikeable (according to me) friend, chloe. I get it if you like that sort of thing but here&#x2019;s the thing, I like escapism, I get enough of that boring bull**** that people call &#x201C;teen drama&#x201D; which I quite frankly hate putting those 2 words in my real life, I don&#x2019;t want to sit down and play a game about something that goes on all the time, OH NO I MADE A FRIEND ANGRY I NEED TO MAKE THEM HAPPY SO THEY LIKE ME AGAIN, I like fiction. not teen drama with a touch of time travel, why not just ****ing TIME TRAVEL? I&#x2019;m sure a lot of people would&#x2019;ve been happier if they saw this character go back to historical moments and change the events taking place so they never happened, and how the world would be different now. That would be really interesting. however we&#x2019;re greeted with a tweenie drama ****ty thing. yes I understand the appeal but comparing what I like to what this game is, you can understand why I dislike the premise.
<br>
<br>Anyway, back to episode 5. the thing that pissed me off the most was the ending that most of you are calling good. if you don&#x2019;t want this game to be spoiled. stop reading. You can either choose to save your friend or the town. I chose to save the town because I found Chloe annoying. and My god, I picked the potentially biggest **** YOU to the audience I have seen since Breaking Dawn Part 2, I mean all twilight movies sucked but that was a general **** you. it ends with everything you&#x2019;ve done being rendered pointless, everything, sure you have to decide, can you let your friend die, but the fact of the matter is, you can choose, save everyone, including warren one of your other best friends. save chloes family, let chloe die which she&#x2019;s fine with and let everyone beside chloe&#x2019;s step dad and mum be happy. However everything you have done over the previous 5 episodes holds no ****ing weight whatsoever, if you didn&#x2019;t save your friend at the beginning of the game, (if you had the choice) the game would be over in 5 minutes.
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;m sorry, what&#x2019;s the moral of this story? all I got was &#x201C;if you get time travelling powers don&#x2019;t go back and change the past because bad stuff will happen&#x201D; and in the other ending it&#x2019;s &#x201C;choose your friend over saving a town because 1 friend is more important than everyone&#x201D; what the **** all in all I disliked the finale to this series, there should in NO WAY be a second series, NO WAY. I hate all the loose ends sure, but it&#x2019;s done now, the whole thing is over I don&#x2019;t want to see more, chloes dead, I don&#x2019;t care anymore. The episode is still a **** TON more enjoyable than the 2 hour head scratcher the walking dead season 2 episode 5, but I just didn&#x2019;t like it. Sorry if you did, I just really couldn&#x2019;t get invested in this episode. I liked the other ones but the conclusion really let it down for me..
<br>
<br>Overall, yeh it was an okay build up.. a massive let down in this episode though. and I really really wanted to like it, I didn&apos;t find any of the other episodes bad, it&apos;s just this one really let me down and I don&apos;t want others to be let down too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5587301">Expand</a></span>

Tales from the Borderlands, Game of Thrones and now - Life is strange. It is atmospheric, sensitive and dramatic story about teenager Max Caulfield with a power of rewind time. I bet somebody thought &quot; What if I choose now that and rewind after to see another side of this?&quot;. Sometimes It was really hard to choose one from many choices to proceed further. The final episode will answer to all of your questions about what happened exactly, with a portion of drama and unexpected vision of alternate reality, but truth hurts the most. The final choices were really hard to decide: decisions,decisions everywhere .But the game isn&apos;t perfect as it supposed to be - the ending was both obvious and well-made but these factors won&apos;t break your sense from game. 9/10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5584408">Expand</a></span>

<br>So, It&apos;s not really a game, having no real &quot;failure&quot; state, but it&apos;s a great way to tell a great story, and this one got me hooked from the beginning. It&apos;s a game about consequences. Did you ever think about what massive influence the most littlest decisions in your life have if given enough time? This game goes through an extreme effort to present some of the influences of some decisions. If you like movies such as Donnie Darko and About Time, you&apos;ll have a blast playing this.
<br>
<br>This game is really original, ambitious and has a great soundtrack. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5588775">Expand</a></span>

<br>Hard to talk about it without spoiling anything, but things got twisted and I loved it.
<br>
<br>This one is a bit different than the other episodes in terms of gameplay but not in a bad way, and serves as a great conclusion to the series, in my opinion.
<br>
<br>Except for the very end.
<br>I chose not to trash the game for its disappointing ending because Life is Strange doesn&apos;t deserve it. It&apos;s really a great game, I had such a good time playing it and even waiting from episode to episode.
<br>
<br>Too bad the ending is almost unforgivably weak and narrowed down, with all of your previous deeds just not counting, and, (STOP NOW BEFORE A SPOILERS COME) are wiped out and thrown out of the window by either your own doing or a a big destructive storm, which is, apparently, your own doing as well.
<br>
<br>The main problem with Life is Strange turned out to be that it just raises your expectations so high, and then washes them away.
<br>The conclusion is rather simplistic, all the choices you had to make (and there were a lot!) don&apos;t have the slightest impact in the end, and moreover, we don&apos;t get answers to some of the big questions which were floating upon our minds throughout the entire game: How did Max even got those powers in the first place? What&apos;s their source? And how did she manage to create the horrible storm? (Except for the poor reference of the butterfly effect), and what do all these does  have to do with that twisted plot?
<br>
<br>I guess that&apos;s starting to sound like a negative review, but it is really about the very last moments of the game.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s still a 810, the entire game was greatly done, the ending was moving even if weak, and I hope DONTNOD would create more qualitative products such as this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5634649">Expand</a></span>

<br>The song fits the mood, the character development was great, the whole storyline left me so empty afterwards but no game has ever made me feel that way before.
<br>To make someone care so deeply for the characters and the storyline, just shows how beautifully develop the whole game is. And Life Is Strange had definitely made me feel that way. After playing Life Is Strange episode 5, I couldn&apos;t get over is for days. I don&apos;t regret playing this game at all, not a single bit.

Like bold letters: Mr Jefferson did this, the town is in danger, evacuate and enjoy your relationship with Mrs. Punk Rock. But I guess that would just make the story dry. I also feel they overdid it with Jefferson as to his psychotic tendencies. While it does have to be emphasized he&apos;s a lunatic, it was just over the top stereotypical for the psycho to be how he is, especially as compared to how collected and calm he is through the other episodes. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I enjoyed the series and wouldn&apos;t know how to conclude it myself, but I&apos;m gonna go with the other people in saying that it could have been better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-5---polarized/user-reviews?user_review_id=5624833">Expand</a></span>

Despu&#xE9;s de todo Max jamas pidi&#xF3; tener esos poderes y se activaron cuando ella decidi&#xF3; salvar a Chloe en el ba&#xF1;o, sin duda salvar a Chole era la prioridad numero uno de Max. .

This episode ties up some loose ends but also leaves a bunch of loose ends up for interpretation. The entire game basically leads up to one decision at the end of the game which decides which ending cut scene you see.
