VH3 is definitely a downgrade over the previous games, the biggest regression being the skill system, it has been dumbed-down by removing many skills and changing others, this leaves you with very little choice when it comes to creating your build. The toughest decision you&apos;ll have to make is which of the skills you&apos;ll max out first, as you&apos;ll end up maxing out most of them by the end anyway. Another major issue with the game is simply the classes aren&apos;t fun to play, the skills are boring, the skill trees are bland and I honestly felt only two of the six classes were enjoyable enough to finish the game with.
<br>
<br>If you can get past the boring classes and restrictive skill system another backtrack from previous games is the loot, much like in VH1 you will rarely find any legendary items, by the end of my play-through I only had two equipped. In VH2 this was fixed and the loot progression was great, I was regularly finding interesting, build changing legionaries and I have no idea why they went back on this in VH3.
<br>
<br>Now if you can look past the bad, underneath it&apos;s the same old Van Helsing, so if you enjoyed the first two games you&apos;ll probably enjoy this one too, just not as much as the previous entries. The solid voice work and humor once again carries the game and makes you forgive certain downfalls, and if you want to see how the story ends I would suggest picking the game up when it&apos;s 50 - 75% off as it&apos;s not worth full price. That being said, if you own all the Van Helsing games you will be entitled to the Final Cut edition for free which is releasing next month, it&apos;s basically all three games combined and improved (although we&apos;re not sure how, but they have said they&apos;re overhauling the skill system which was absolutely necessary IMO). My advice would be to wait and play the Final Cut edition, instead of playing VH3 as a standalone game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5437627">Expand</a></span>

There are 6 great classes to choose from who all have their strengths and weaknesses. However I seemed to notice that the elementalist (wizard) seems a bit overpowered, since I&apos;m having no difficulty als can take on large groups of enemies. At the humble price it stand, I would definitely check it out!</span>

The skills have been greatly reduced, item sets removed, reduced level cap, simplified gameplay and very limited Van Helsing 2 save game porting. In fact, I couldn&apos;t port my character from the second game as it just won&apos;t detect it. I&apos;m quite disappointed, but since almost all games don&apos;t do this, I won&apos;t be so mad about it. That said, it still retains the great writing and funny dialogues, which count a lot, for me. Combine this with the low asking price, and it earns a solid 7/10 for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7467022">Expand</a></span>
