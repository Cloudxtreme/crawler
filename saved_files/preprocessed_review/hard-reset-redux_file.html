<br>Decently Fun, but super repetitive
<br>Hard Reset Redux is the extended version to Hard Reset released in 2011 nearly doubling this games length and of course extending the story...
<br>that is if you can actually follow what&#x2019;s going on&#x2026;
<br>Something about AI gone wrong and you have to save the city they occupy...
<br>I&#x2019;m not even sure...
<br>If you&#x2019;re playing Hard Reset you&#x2019;re playing for the gameplay&#x2026;
<br>And this game can be great fun at times&#x2026;
<br>You get 3 weapons in this game... a rifle...a plasma gun, and later a katana&#x2026;
<br>But both the rifle and the plasma gun all have 5 variations that you can unlock as you collect xp from secrets or just by killing enemies...
<br>As you progress through the game your meter will fill up and give you a skill point to spend on either a new weapon, a weapon upgrade, or gear upgrade&#x2026;
<br>And these weapon upgrades are really all there is to keep the game feeling fresh and ultimately what keeps it even the slightest bit engaging&#x2026;
<br>There are a few enemy variants that you can take down with any weapon, but you&#x2019;ll clearly fall in love with one weapon type to deal with a certain enemy over another, for example I like using the shotgun on explosive enemies.. And I loved using the katana on pretty much everything else.
<br>I easily had the most fun with the katana... but the fact that I had a favorite weapon for every enemy type tells you a lot about how much weapon variety actually matters in this game&#x2026;
<br>That is such a refreshing feeling, where I feel like in most first person shooters I can get away with anything and it doesn&#x2019;t matter&#x2026; but here it does
<br>unfortunately after you&#x2019;ve played with all of the variants for a while, the game really starts to get boring and feels like it drags out way too long&#x2026;
<br>Hard Resets biggest issue is hands down the level design&#x2026;
<br>Every levels is activating switches while you kill everything between you and the switch&#x2026;
<br>And every level really looks nearly identical&#x2026;
<br>and honestly without having known that the game would be the same throughout, I was already unimpressed the moment the game started, as It looked like a dated bargain bin game
<br>Its gray and boring, but there are some cool nail-biting sections towards the end of the game if you can manage to drag yourself through 7 hours of the same thing to get there&#x2026;
<br>You practically see all there is to see in level 1, minus a few boss fights thrown in there&#x2026;
<br>Hard Reset Redux offers a great deal of fun with its weapon variety,
<br>But if you don&#x2019;t like feeling like you&#x2019;re stuck in a demo level for 8 hours, you&#x2019;re better off looking for your fun elsewhere
<br>I give Hard Reset Redux a
<br>6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset-redux/user-reviews?user_review_id=6494024">Expand</a></span>
