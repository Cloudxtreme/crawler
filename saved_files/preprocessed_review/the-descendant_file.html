<br>Right now they have just released the first episode so this will be a review of that, not the entire season.
<br>
<br>To start with the episode was quit short, just about an hour. That is my biggest concern this far. Humanity has destroyed earth ending it by nuking the whole surface. Luckily the governments built the &#x201C;arks&#x201D;. They held 4.000 of the most important people underground and made sure that there would be a tomorrow for mankind. You get to play the story throughout two separate timelines. First you play as Mia, a janitor, tasked with maintaining Ark 01. And you also play as Glen, two hundred years later. And Glen tries to find out why Ark 01 never opened when the other arks did.
<br>
<br>Its an intriguing story set in a wonderful apocalypse environment. The graphics isn&#x2019;t amazing but I believe its better than both The walking dead and Life is strange. Gameplay is point and click puzzles mixed with a lot of dialog and dialog options just like expected. For me the puzzles was somewhat too easy but that could be just me. Something that I really like though was that in the end of the episode every failure I made in the puzzles during my gameplay resulted in one dead member of Ark 01. How many will be alive when I finished the season?
<br>
<br>To make it short. A great episodic game, perhaps a bit short but well worth the money!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-descendant/user-reviews?user_review_id=6217053">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve just finished the game and I enjoyed it for the most part, it looks and feels like a Telltale game, just not as polished, if you told me it was an early effort by Telltale I wouldn&apos;t question it, they&apos;re that similar. I found the story interesting and you were kept guessing all the way until the end, I was kept engaged throughout and I always wanted to start the next episode after finishing the previous one. The voice work was a little rough in parts, ranging from serviceable to good depending on the character and the visuals while nothing special did the job, they went for the cel shaded look ala The Walking Dead and co. Gameplay was what you&apos;d expect, walk around finding clues, press the correct button at the correct time and select whichever story choice you prefer. The Descendant did have more puzzles though which I personally didn&apos;t like, episode 3 was especially bogged down with fiddly puzzles.
<br>
<br>Now for the bad though, it&apos;s technically not great (is this genre cursed?), it&apos;s a Unity engine game that&apos;s capped at 30fps, you have to edit the registry to fix this which is easy enough to do but you&apos;ll notice straight away the game is optimised for 30fps, even on medium settings I couldn&apos;t hit 60fps in all situations (although to be fair, I did most of the time). So my advice would be to uncap and switch to medium settings unless you&apos;re using something better than a GTX 970, there&apos;s high and very settings above medium for those of you rocking big boy GPUs.
<br>
<br>Overall though it was decent and it&apos;s dirt cheap on key sites (I paid &#xA3;2.32), plus episode 1 is free to try on Steam so if you&apos;re a fan of the genre give it a go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-descendant/user-reviews?user_review_id=7401328">Expand</a></span>
