The game introduces 6 missions for Allies from Normandy to heart of Germany. The positive thing is huge maps, requisition of new units based upon your progress (you do not have to capture all enemy locations, but the more you capture, the more units you can field), quite good cooperation of armors and infantry (you need to make a recon using a scout infantry as your tanks do not see so far and ca easily be killed by hidden AT guns or panzers). The number of units you can use is also sufficient. Regarding the graphics, it is not top of the line, but also is not the worst I have seen. I would say it is quite sufficient. In a summary, the game certainly kept me entertained for many days and I can recommend it to everyone who likes a good and somewhat realistic strategy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/officers/user-reviews?user_review_id=1367684">Expand</a></span>
