<br>Invisible walls and getting caught on the scenery didn&apos;t help. Neither did the semi-QTE&apos;s (shoot NOW!) or how the AI can hit you 300m away with an AK and you cant shoot back because the screen&apos;s shaking.

The AI is so simple and dumb; even if you are 3 miles away sniping, if you are not hidden in dense vegetation, they can see you and have a perfect accuracy with machine gun while you try to snipe them! You can&apos;t take 3 steps without getting a collision bug and that is not exaggerating.. You will either walk through big rocks or will get stuck on a perfectly flat floor, plus you can&apos;t &quot;climb&quot; stairs crouched.. You can spot enemies on your radar but even after 6 hours of gameplay, you wont know how it works cause it sometimes automatically reveal them a mile away and sometime having the NPC 2 meters in front of you in plain sight wont still show him.. You will have more fun playing CoD or Crysis and adapting your play style then playing this.

There is no sneaking around trying to find the perfect shot, the game holds you hand and guides you through a safe path on every &quot;sneaking&quot; level and puts you in position to succeed every time. There is no player choice. Also, only about 60% of the game is sniping. The remainder is CoD-esque firefights where you&apos;re forced to use an assault rifle (which are complete garbage) to get through the level. These are easily the worst experiences in the game. The weapons are so bad, and the effects are so horrid, that it makes playing through these levels an absolute chore. On top of all this, the game is riddled with bugs and glitches. Sound become de-synced, graphics, glitch, AI derps, it&apos;s all there. Sniper Ghost Warrior is an average game that becomes below average due to the massive amount of bugs present therein.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3178509">Expand</a></span>

<br>The controls manage to be stiff, even at 60 fps with mouse and keyboard controls. Animations are wooden, and the AI is remarkably bad. I really have no idea how the AI can be just this terrible. Sometimes enemy guards will see you randomly and raise the alarm, even if you&apos;re half a mile away buried under bushes and dense grass. Other times, you can dash across a road right in front of them without alerting them. Broken AI is unforgivable in a game about stealth and sniping.
<br>
<br>Enemies themselves are pathetic in fights, and it should be simple for any gamer to simply kill everyone. It&apos;s easier than trying to sneak through, considering how bad the stealth mechanics are.
<br>
<br>The final nail in the coffin is that Ghost Warrior is heavily scripted. Your character will do things without your control in mini cutscenes, and usually it ends up landing you in trouble or setting you up for an especially broken mission where every enemy is automatically aware of your presence.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t give this game more than 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3246798">Expand</a></span>

The Good- It is a very realistic sniping game - Average story line - Average graphics. The Bad- Enemies will shoot you across the map with an automatic weapon - Enemy AI will spot you very easily. Altough, i do love getting the slow-mo head shots 500 feet away. Multiplayer is somewhat fun, but repetitive. I am currently stuck on the mission where you have to sneak past a base, and im crawling in the dark, tall grass at midnight, and the enemies on the ground still spot me, about 70 feet away. So- Terrible AI and a somewhat fun multiplayer earn this game around a 6.

<br>With Sniper Ghost Warrior, it&apos;s almost never the case: you have to stay low, stay quiet and stay invisible or you&apos;ll get killed pretty quickly, or trigger the alarm and lose. Only a couple of run and gun chapters, that are actually making you relax and break lose, shooting everything that comes at you.
<br>Yes, there are some bugs but they don&apos;t impact the game-play to my opinion. Not quite sure why everybody blasted it in reviews. It really delivers the sniping experience to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=2816340">Expand</a></span>

I rated this game a 5 or 4 before, now its a easy 9, good graphics, no crazy AI problems where they could see u anywhere and everywhere from 800 miles away and shoot with acuracy like they were infront of you, no its fixed it seems, thanks devs.....thats all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=1850438">Expand</a></span>

Maps should be much bigger, with a lot more places to hide and better concealment, generally they should have just spent more than 1 day on their maps. Then the compass simply shouldn&apos;t exist.</span>

I thought it was good how I had to use cover, stealth, and precision firing to reach my objective. I also had to think about my next move. The missions were good, exciting, and different(at first). The wrongs. First, the most important, the A.I. I don&apos;t remember what mission it was but, I was sniping a convoy from a lighthouse. The enemies were 1000 yards from me, firing full auto at me, and i was getting hit left and right. Then i took cover, and one of my little toes was not in cover, and they were still hitting me, ON EASY!!!!  Next, the A.I has eyes of a hawk. If you make the slightest motion, BAM!!, everyone and their uncle is shooting you. If you want a below average game, buy it. If you want a good game, don&apos;t. The only complaint is that the A.I is terrible, the missions are boring after 1 time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=2080199">Expand</a></span>

Sneaking around in a beautiful jungle taking down enemies one by one as silent as possible seemed great. The game was gorgeous to look at and the sniping was incredibly satisfying. There were some bug and invisible walls here and there but the overall experience was great. One hour later and all of that had changed. The AI in this game is truly horrible. At times the AI will be incredibly dumb and will barely notice you while you are walking beside them. Making the game beyond easy on the hardest difficult setting. And at other times the AI goes into full god mode being able to see you and shoot you in bushes several hundred meters away. This gets especially annoying on the missions where you play as a normal soldier since they are more linear, and lets not even talk about the friendly AI. I would go as far as to say that the game is broken on the harder difficulty simply because of the AI. If you are not looking for a challenge and simply want to cruise around the islands shooting bad guys then you can still probably have a good time with the game, otherwise i would recommend that you stay away from this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570921">Expand</a></span>

The bugs  in the game aren&apos;t annoying and they will get fixed. This game is becoming one of my favorite to play. I love it!! If you have played sniper elite before then you should be right at home with this game, it follows the bullet to the target like in sniper elite but 10 times better. If you feel like your a sniper in real life and love to do it in games then you cant go wrong in getting this game. Get it if you love sniping!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=1373413">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game presents a somewhat overused idea and puts you in the shoes of a sniper (hence the title). The graphics are quite nice and the gameplay isn&apos;t very good. basically, you just try to snipe people but you have to watch for variables like how many people are around your potential victim. Many other games have sniping segments (such as Modern Warfare) but they are much better than this game.</span>

The singleplayer campaign was a little short- about 4 hours long. The AI sort of juggled between being really tough (being able to spot you from across the map) to normal, to downright dumb ( not shooting at me even when Im standing in front of them). The campaign was interesting, although there isnt really a back story to it all. You&apos;re just simply there, doing the job. I give the campaign an 8.
<br>The multiplayer was what made the game for me. It was just damn fun to play with my friends. The sniping feels natural and realistic enough to keep me playing. Although the pistols might be a little overpowered, they are a nice addition to the sniper-based classes. You cant edit the classes though, and that is what disapointed me. I&apos;m giving the multiplayer an 8.5.
<br>Overall, the game is fun, and although having bugs and other annoyances, this game should definitely be picked up by anyone who loves sniping in FPS games. Even those who dont. Im gonna give it a score of 8.5 overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=1458695">Expand</a></span>

I played the game on normal difficulty and have to say that most of the reviews are misleading. This game is highly underrated. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It took me 9 hours to complete the single player game. The graphics are fantastic, but you will need a decent machine to play it on the higher settings. I did not experience any problems with AI over reacting. If you take your time, move slowly and stay hidden, you won&apos;t have any issues. If anything I must agree that the AI sometimes under reacts e.g. not getting a reaction from a guy when you have just taken down the guy standing next to him. There are many factors you have to consider when playing this game. Are you using a suppressor or will the AI hear your gun? Is the AI facing you when you make a dash across the path or road? Do you change position when your cover is blown? The quick save feature is very useful. I was caught a few times and after trying a different approach, managed to get through.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed the few missions where I had to use an assault rifle. It added a nice change to the game. The pistol and knife were useful in close quarters situations. I hardly used the grenades. I also enjoyed the mix of sniper rifles you get to play with. I loved the fact that you can shoot through small gaps in walls and fences as well as through vegetation.
<br>
<br>I have started the game again on hard difficulty, which has no assists and presents a whole new challenge. I can&apos;t wait!
<br>
<br>I would give the game a 10, but there were definitely a few issues with it. The game as a whole far outweighs the glitches and I highly recommend it to FPS gamers who enjoy the satisfaction of a successful sniper shot. It is definitely one of my favourites.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=1642006">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I find this game very entertaining.
<br>i Love the realisim in it.
<br>I do find the parts when you have to be stealthy or use a machinegun/pistol a bit challenging (probably because its made for a sniper), but the sniping makes up for it.
<br>i dont think this deserves 55/100, probably like an 70-80 (i did 9 to try and bring it closer to what it deserves)</span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_1691559"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">If you have ever played a Tom Clancy game, whether it is Raven Shield or Las Vegas, perhaps you really liked that one mission in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare where you use a high powered sniper rifle. Perhaps you loved the free roaming and sniping from the original Crysis, Far Cry (either of them) and felt that maybe there should be an entire game dedicated to sniping; then you should stick with those games. Sniper: Ghost Warrior is the first game to incense me to such a point where I felt I needed to review it simply to let people know what a truly awful game this is. Unlike the aforementioned Rainbow Six games the sniping never really feels, tough. You are seldom worried that a single bullet will end your existence. On the other hand the lush overgrowth and jungle setting may tempt you to think that maybe you&apos;ve found Sniper&apos;s Farcry or maybe Crysis. However the pervasive invisible walls and glitchy AI will swiftly end that dream. Certainly the original Farcry had it&apos;s own faults, but the levels were so expansive that you could forgive the goons that seemed to spot your brightly coloured hawaiian shirts from several kilometres off because at least the game didn&apos;t fence you in so tightly. Of course in this game there are no super suits, you won&apos;t have the advantage of a cloaking device, but you have the next best thing if COD: MW has taught us anything; a ghillie suit.<br><br>However this ghillie suit must have been made by acme, because it seems about as effective as the hawaiian shirt you wore in farcry for avoiding detection. In some levels it does work, but in others even looking in the direction of a goon will end the mission immediately as someone sounds an alarm.<br><br>Now don&apos;t get me wrong, I gave this game a 1, not because of the graphics - Crysis did graphics better. But because of the delightful sniping mechanic, this game on easier settings gives you a dot which changes position and often doesn&apos;t match up with where your cross-hairs point and indicates where your bullet will end up. Should you score a headshot then you get a slow-mo recap of the shot (assuming you left that option on) and the path your bullet took, you can use this to scout out enemies hidden behind objects or near your victim - and this is enjoyable. The problem is that your enemies act unpredictably. Sometimes they&apos;ll notice their colleague drop and then by immediate psychic connection open fire on your position - sometimes from miles away. Given your weapon is almost always silenced one has to wonder how the hell they could tell where the bullet was fired from. On other occasions they won&apos;t even notice, or they will get stuck in walls or tents searching for you. Another problem is material penetration, given your weapon of choice why do flimsy walls often stop your bullet even at close range? This game is terrible. It isn&apos;t worth buying even during a steam special, the company that made this game do not deserve your money no matter how little it is. The story isn&apos;t worth your time of day, the stealth mechanic certainly isn&apos;t, and the hours of frustration at the invisible walls and linear paths, dodgy AI and only slightly enjoyable sniping mechanic are not worth it. Buy a better game, get Farcry, replay COD: MW, check out any of the Rainbow Six games because they are all better shooters, have better storylines and less flawed gameplay than this piece of rubbish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=1691559">Expand</a></span>

You lay in the grass and you will never see anything again, partly because the grass is too damn high and you have NOTHING to help you see better, and partly because concealing yourself is the same damn thing as screaming at the top of your lungs. You can try to go to the edge of the grass if you haven&apos;t already been seen by everyone on the planet earth while trying to keep concealed but **** it if you&apos;re not dead already you&apos;re going to be, cause the only way to see out of the grass is to BE out of the grass. Now lets climb **** on the way to our objective which, by the way is not even disclosed. **** IT, LET&apos;S JUST SHOOT **** I had high ****ing hopes :(

Some of the worst A.I i&apos;ve ever seen, horrible levels, glitches, a non-existent story with a laughably bad ending, there&apos;s not a single thing that this game does well.

Firstly, they make no more that 5% of the game, and secondly, the solution is very simple: don&apos;t play them as run-and-gun.

(through Steam). I have mixed feelings about this game. In the playability it seems that it hasn&apos;t been tested properly before releasing it. Lots of little things that sometimes are a bit frustrating. For example getting shot in the blink of an eye by normal weapons when you are sniping from a great distance. Also, the sudden end of the game of the campaign, after about ten hours of playing, makes you think that the designers were suddenly out of budget (or inspiration). Compare it with a B-film, you will want to watch it if you like the genre, but otherwise you might as well skip this one. Please let me know if you find this helpful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=1467152">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I think the game is really good. Especially the single-player, its with nice weapons but the story is a classic with one hero, you. And when you kill someone they don&apos;t immediately sound the alarm. The on-line really ruins the game much bugs and the more you kill you don&apos;t unlock weapons or things like that.</span>

The bullet time kill can was a great addition and the graphics still hold they&apos;re own to this date.  If you like action FPS with a bit of sneakiness it is definitely one to  pickup and play, even if its for one play though.</span>

The Multiliplayer is very very limited, you cant edit your classes and there is only about 5 classes to choose from. I feel that people use the pistols and grenades more than the accusal rifle. The campaign is pretty good, better then the MP, but it has its bugs as in, lack off narration causing the player to get lost sometime. Over all I rate the campaign and 8 and the MP a 6 so over all a 7</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=1450897">Expand</a></span>

The City Interactive team did a good job on the Chrome 4 Engine and the atmosphere and background music is just great. Looking forward to buy Sniper Ghost Warrior 2.</span>

I can only think of one flaw with this game. The AI. It is the absolute worst thing I have ever seen. The AI instantaneously see (this is on hard mode by the way) you if there is a direct line of sight (as in no walls). Now, you may be thinking &quot;Okay, not bad, so they see you.&quot; They also DON&apos;T MISS! They instantly see you, even if you are in bushes. Meaning you cannot see them. They don&apos;t miss. If you poke your head out -- you die. That is it. Simple as that. The only reason this game is not a 10 is because they let a braindead monkey on crack program their AI. I tried the level where you stand on a hill with the machine gun and defend yourself for a few minutes 30 time before I gave up on the game. It is nigh on impossible, because once you finish (which is not that hard once you get on the machine gun) a guy randomly spawns in a bush behind you and instantly kills you. Every time.<br><br>Great game save for the worst AI I have ever seen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=1697095">Expand</a></span>

I was very happy with the game. The graphics were great, I love how they didn&apos;t overdue it with the color hues. Too many games create washed out colors in an attempt to create atmosphere (GRAW 1&amp;2, Far Cry 2, etc.) but this had a very realistic feel to the environment, visually speaking. Now when it came to movement around the environment, there are a lot of invisible walls. Some areas will allow you to crawl under, say a tower, but then in another area it won&apos;t let you go under the same kind of tower or some ledges you can make your way up but other, similar, ledges your denied access. This was, no doubt, to force you down a path the level designers wanted one to go. But, inconsistencies like this, can make the game slightly frustrating, from time to time, and reminds you it&apos;s just a game. Also, not being able to jump a four foot fence or ledge was a let down, especially when it&apos;s the only thing standing between you and the next target. The player&apos;s character animations seemed unfinished. When you approach a wall your character lifts up his gun but then when you crawl on the ground the animation looks the same as when you are standing, just a lower POV. And for a game that requires a lot of crawling, this is a bit of a disappointment. I never had any of the problems of the A.I. spotting me when I was hidden, unless I took the shot when they were looking in my general direction. But, there are times when the A.I. is dumb as a rock. This just makes it fun to snipe yet another enemy. ;) Some levels don&apos;t seem like they would work without the A.I. being dumb.

It runs extremely smooth on my ASUS G72GX. Part of what makes a game great is that it is fun and lag = no fun. Ive seen no lag with this. The slo-mo bullet scenes remind me of Fallout3 or New Vegas VATS shots and such but better. The game is fairly big if you take your time with it, it definitely wasn&apos;t meant to be rushed through. One example of the realism in this game is if you&apos;ve been sprinting and stop to shoot your vision is slightly blurred depending on how long you have drained your stamina so you will have to wait to make a clear shot. There&apos;s much more but i will just say if you like sniper games get this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=2103228">Expand</a></span>

Despite all it&apos;s bad reviews, and all the flaws the game has, I&apos;ve yet to see another game offering the same kind of game-play. Being completely stealth in the jungle, slowly making your way forward, and taking out those who are in your way, without anyone every knowing who it was. Killing in this game is really satisfying, and the bullet kill-cams is awesome. Although this game have some serious issues regarding the AI. Sometimes they&apos;re just too stupid, and sometimes way too smart. It&apos;s really random how some can detect you hundreds of meters away, when you&apos;re barely moving and with full camouflage. Also really random how they sometimes don&apos;t see you when you&apos;re just in front of them. The one thing that ruined the game for me, was the missions where you had to use Assault rifles. When you aim down your sights with an Assault rifle, the aiming feels so rough, and clumsy, and not smooth at all, which, even in the hands of a pro FPS player, would make it hard. And a mixture between extremely random AI, and bad guns, are a REALLY bad mixture. But all in all, this game is good, and i like it, only on the sniper missions though. There is unfortunately a few missions where you do not use snipers. I thought it was a sniper game. If you see this game on sales somewhere, and you love sniper games, i must say i recommend this game. Because, as i said, despite all the flaws, it makes up a pretty good sniper game for those who like stealth sniping.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3029375">Expand</a></span>

All the understandably previously described bugs and pro/user/review/complaints are fixed.
<br>
<br>First it was heavily criticised for checkpoint saving. Reviewers reported traversing long distances dying and having to do it all again. NOW it&apos;s F5+F9; it&apos;s been updated to quicksave and quickload. Perfect. Plus there is SAVE and LOAD when you press Esc for the in-game menu.
<br>Second the A.I. The complaint was that it was too lame, then too accurate at long distance even when you were camoflaged. FIXED. I estimate the A.I. is about the same as you would find in Crysis.
<br>Third, that the pistol was overpowered. I have to disagree with that. It&apos;s nice that two clean shots can kill, as it should be. Sometimes you have to make more shots anyway.
<br>
<br>Moving on though, the graphics are lovely. It&apos;s set in the Amazon jungle, and looks exactly like a blend of Far Cry and Crysis. Sadly there is no &apos;antialiasing&apos; in the video options so you can expect a few jaggies. It should run fine on very modest graphics cards. A GT240 type graphics card should max it all.
<br>
<br>Just because it&apos;s a sniper title, doesn&apos;t mean slow gamplay: the game moves at a lively pace. It&apos;s moderately intense, involving, and exciting. There is an auto slow-mo replay of some of the headshots you make, and watching the physics is great. Overall the shooting has plenty of rewarding take-downs.
<br>
<br>If you look at it and think even vaguely &quot;Maybe a sniping game would be good&quot;, you could love this.
<br>
<br>My score of 8/10 is really about 84%. I knocked a few points off for the following. 1 Mounted heavy guns are very loud and recoil on them is phenomenal, but luckily you use them rarely. 2 &apos;No anti-aliasing&apos; in video settings&apos;. 3 There was a moment when I got stuck, and it took me about twently minutes to work out why. All I needed to do at that point was make two more kills, before I could descend from a ledge. 4 -&apos;THE INTRO SCREEN HAS A BUG&apos; so you can&apos;t watch the introductory video properly. The bug shows only the lower half of the video, while the upper half of the screen is blacked out. Fear not though because the game, and all the menus are complete.
<br>
<br>I paid &#xA3;0.89 for it on Steam&apos;s current sale. At full Steam price of &#xA3;6 it&apos;s still a generously priced buy. I will buy Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 before the 2013 Steam Summer Sale ends. Buy SGW quickly in case Steam up the price since it works now, and that word might spread. You will be buying a solid shooter, and the gun...seriously..!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3281398">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics:
<br>The game looks great and has superior light- and shadow-effects, no doubt about it.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s in my humble opinion on the same level like OF:DR&#xB2;, CoD4  a little bit more than BF&#xB2;.
<br>But it appears to be a bit delicately  don&apos;t know how to convey it.
<br>It doesn&apos;t seems to be robust and full-fledged like &apos;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&apos;.
<br>There are often skippin&apos; textures, flickering and stuff like that (which it&apos;s not driver/graphic-cards dependent).
<br>
<br>AI:
<br>One word; Measly.
<br>The AI is disastrous, it&apos;s simply in-existent.
<br>There are unbelievable scenes and things which aren&apos;t acceptable.
<br>
<br>Bugs/Gameplay:
<br>You care for an example?
<br>The situation:
<br>I tried several times to invade and cross a village while remaining undiscovered, so far the plan.
<br>Notwithstanding the grass is about 3 feet tall and i prone in my almost magical &apos;Special SpecOps Marksmen Sniper camouflage suit&apos;  which is pretty cool and a soldiers dream to look at it  i got a head-shot from 800 meters for free.
<br>
<br>So i decide to make the Rambo.
<br>I went to engage the village with all the fire-power i got, and as obvious and loud as possible.
<br>In the end, you probably guess it;
<br>I watch in awe two enemies shootin&apos;  for whatever sake   a freaking stone and foist the stones dead?
<br>I knifed both.
<br>Any questions ?
<br>
<br>In general the AI gets and hits you, wherever and behinds whatever cover you are  mostly with a headshot.
<br>
<br>Stealth-Meter:
<br>It makes no difference if you&apos;re well covered in endless-tall grass or behind the thickest wall, or if you&apos;re roam freely on the highest exposed places.
<br>The Cover-Meter (witch is [at best] useless) indicates me on the first situation i was exposed and on the other hand i was nearly invisible.
<br>
<br>Freely exposed while hidin&apos; hundreds of meters away in grass or behind walls.
<br>And virtual unseeable staying on-top of a HMMWV
<br>while shootin&apos; at an enemy just a footstep away.
<br>
<br>No further questions, Your Honour.
<br>
<br>Performance:
<br>The performance is abysmal.
<br>The graphic is, let&apos;s say, 2008&apos;s measures adapted and meets barely todays standards.
<br>But the for this purpose needed performance and processing power, speechless.
<br>
<br>And no, i didn&apos;t forgot the multiplayer.
<br>It&apos;s just not worth mentioning.
<br>
My conclusion:
Sniper: Ghost Warrior joins seamlessly today&apos;s line-up of games which got nice graphics but crappy and buggy gameplay/AI/whatsoever.

From this point of view, it&apos;s dure but true, S:GW puts itself on the same level as SC:C, CoD:BO, OF:DR&#xB2; and so on.

All that glimmers isn&apos;t gold.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3908801">Expand</a></span>

Bad, the graphic is normal and: difficult- 10/100    bugs- 80/100 (at least) and it also got less selections. the pistol is so powerful.... the sniper is a bit weak,,,, over all its normal.... looks like they have been making less effort on the multi player but a lot more effort on the singleplayer...</span>

Got this as the FPS obviously. Firstly was greatful to see that the graphics ran high on my laptop. The scenery is stunning and love the ragdoll effect on dead enemies. Weapons are awesome and recoil and bullet drop add some fun. Only played through once and that&apos;ll be it. i couldnt wait to finish it, which is a shame! the AI is frickin retarded. stealth means knife kills. even if u shoot someone with a silencer on, you can be heard from 200m away, but not a knife kill and the body falling. hell a body can fall next to a dude and he doesnt know. second, even though you can barely see enemies, they can see you. acting normal, then all of a sudden from 100m away and from behind they spin around WTF? made some missions, esp when ur escaping very hard. i thought the vegetation would cover you enough but these enemies are superhuman, they can even hit you at 300m with a full auto ak 90% of the time. some things they do are ridiculous, others are just plain stupid. would be good to also see some map areas accessible - like i cant crawl under a 2ft gap if its not in main map but i can slide 50m down a hill and be fine??? if vegetation was fully effective and AI was smart (they just duck up and down after you shoot a guy next to them) this would be a mad game. sadly one i wont be playing again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=2110043">Expand</a></span>

After playing this for a while I must say that besides the first map in single player campaign the game is rubbish and feels like it&apos;s in early alpha stage. The problem is that there are few levels after another that you do not even get to use sniper in sniper game, you are forced to use USAS or AK47 and they do not do any damage not even if you manage to get a perfect headshot. I recommend using the pistol instead because it is one hit one kill weapon. There are lots of bugs and enemies tend to shoot at you behind walls even if there is no way they should see you but if you crouch in bushes they can just walk over you and not notice you at all. The mechanics behind this game are broken. This title should have been cancelled or given even some polishing because single player is partly unplayable. Shame really... the idea of the game was good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=4432133">Expand</a></span>

But for me? I can spend a little time for it but the control, navigation and the environment of SGW are just too faulty and buggy to be enjoyed on its maximum potential. Additionally, the AI can be too stupid or too smart -- you can shoot anyone with a loud sniper and their allies from 50 meters away wouldn&apos;t even react a finger, but they have accurate ass shooting skills where their assault rifles can literally kill me even if I&apos;m in sniping distance.

<br>PS, I have a mid-tier unit that can run any games esp if it&apos;s several years old, but yeah my unit is still coughing blood just trying to run this 2010 game on medium graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=5940132">Expand</a></span>
