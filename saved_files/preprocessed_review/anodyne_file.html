This entire trend of crappy games sold as &quot;Indie&quot;, &quot;Retro&quot; or &quot;Old-School&quot; is really starting to get on my nerves! I don&apos;t mind the lack of voice acting, I don&apos;t need long and gorgeous cut-scenes, I can live with the shallow storylines, I can also deal with the ugly graphics in general. But what really drive me nuts are the small things, such as, for example, me being able to hit an enemy from 100 miles away.... with a melee weapon! Nevermind the fact that all I really hit was air, the monster on the other corner of the screen just dies and disappears.
<br>
<br>For me, this is a game breaker. It&apos;s like the game devs are telling me, &quot;Hey, it&apos;s a fantasy game, right? You only imagine you&apos;re an adventurer, you only imagine you&apos;re fighting monsters, so what&apos;s wrong with imagining you really hit the bat right before it died?&quot; Well, at this point I put on my Grumpy Cat mask and shout, &quot;No! I won&apos;t friggin&apos; imagine that! It&apos;s your job as game devs to illustrate at least the most basic stuff!&quot;.
<br>
<br>Needless to say, that if in the past I generously shelled out money for indie games without digging too deep, thinking to myself that even if I won&apos;t be enjoying the game, at least I&apos;d be supporting the games industry, that is not the case anymore. I&apos;m tired of lazy game devs selling me crap as &quot;Indie&quot;. I&apos;m willing to pay for good games, but I work hard to earn that money, and so should everyone else, including game developers.
<br>
<br>As far as I&apos;m concerned, Anodyne is a bad game. I can&apos;t remember how much I paid for it, I just hope it wasn&apos;t much. Oh well, at least I&apos;m wiser and more careful now, when it comes to choosing what games to buy, regardless of how cheap or expensive they are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anodyne/user-reviews?user_review_id=3949814">Expand</a></span>

<br>I grew up on FF3, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and Zelda. This game fits into that world, explores it further in many respects, and falls short as well.  As you go through the game, you realize these game devs played those games, and they remember what it was like to be a kid. The nostalgia goes beyond the stylization and pixel art.  Its as much an homage to the genre as it is to the kids that PLAYED the genre back in early nineties.  The game is a gift to its users.  For that reason, it gets high marks from me.  I have trouble critiquing what I didn&apos;t enjoy because it was part of the art.  The aforementioned games are TEDIOUS, and Anodyne has annoying spots that require some keyboard jujitsu to jump holes.
<br>
<br>The game features the best post completion New Game+ experience that I&apos;ve come across.  I won&apos;t give away spoilers, but the rabbit hole goes deep.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anodyne/user-reviews?user_review_id=3136600">Expand</a></span>

I really couldn&apos;t bring myself to finish this game. While the environments are neat and a bit unsettling, the game&apos;s puzzles are really poorly designed and the controls are sub-par, which made this a really frustrating experience. In addition, the map is completely labyrinthine. I had no idea where I should be going, the map was useless, and I pretty much immediately got lost.
<br>
<br>The star of this game is the aesthetic. It mostly sticks to the 16-bit style, and it does it well most of the time. The music is mostly ambient and a little creepy, which really hammers in the unease.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, though, I found I couldn&apos;t forgive the game&apos;s serious gameplay flaws. If you think the aesthetic alone will be worth the price of entry, then you might really enjoy this game, but otherwise, there are many better ways to spend your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anodyne/user-reviews?user_review_id=3190335">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s not much room for exploring other than finding the gateway to your next &apos;dungeon&apos;. These dungeons consist mostly of week enemies, very easy puzzles and a final boss. There are also sort of collectible cards that are required for you to open gates to new areas but besides that do nothing else than provide couple lines of &quot;humour&quot;. These &quot;jokes&quot; feel quite ackward in context of rest of the game being &quot;serious&quot;. The audio of the game is decent but forgettable. I didn&apos;t feel that Anodyne was really a game, it resembles more to &quot;To The Moon&quot; as an interactive story that looks like an old JRPG and should be counted as one when considering a purchase. The price tag of 8&#x20AC; is a bit steep so I recommend waiting for a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anodyne/user-reviews?user_review_id=3109753">Expand</a></span>

What starts off as merely strange becomes a journey into the bizarre.  Can&apos;t recommend this gem enough.  On sale right now for 30% off which is a great deal, but honestly $10 bucks isn&apos;t too much to ask for a game with as much charm as this.</span>

<br>
<br>When Anodyne ends, it gives you an item to switch floor tiles, making you able to work places you couldn&apos;t before. This is done with the promise of further exploration and an entire (hidden) second half of the game. The thing is; you&apos;re meant to use this tool to exploit glitches that occur when moving outside of the maps, to get you to secret glitchy areas. This requires abusing your controls, and works about 1% of the time, essentially making the whole experience extremely frustrating.
<br>
<br>What is equally as frustrating is the fact that so much work seemingly has gone to making these glitchy areas, with 99 doors you have to try and pass by jumping into holes that kill you at different spots of different levels, but bringing up the menu, teleport to the waypoint area, and hope you hit one of the spots that has floor tiles to land on, and is on the right side of the doors.
<br>
<br>If this was truly meant to be optional, it would have been hidden away as secrets, not be your reward for completing the game, and it would definitely not have about as much content as the main game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anodyne/user-reviews?user_review_id=3732330">Expand</a></span>

<br>hours on end. This game proves you don&apos;t need tens of millions of dollars to create a amazing game. If you haven&apos;t bought it, seriously, go do it, I mean like now, DO IT  for the price of only 10 bucks!)</span>
