<br>
<br>Cloud chamber is the most innovative &quot;game&quot; I have seen in a long, long time. The general idea is that you are shown a piece of information in form of a movie, a document etc, and then try to figure out what this is about. You have a board to post comments about it and discuss with others.
<br>There isn&apos;t much gaming in this, I think that all you can really get is likes for your posts, and getting these likes (I think) opens up extra documents.
<br>Cloud Chamber is an experience rather than a game, but oh, what an experience!
<br>The story is seen from lots of different perspectives such as a documentary, videos taken of the involved persons, official documents, e-mails etc., and it is in fact possible to spend lots of time just watching a single short clip and trying to figure out what is happening in it.
<br>
<br>The only thing that really troubles me is the rather free use they make of physics such as trying to capture neutrinos with a cloud chamber? It bothers me because I in fact am educated as a physicist and  its difficult to suspend my disbelief once in a while :D If I do though, then this is a great story.
<br>
<br>If you want a very innovative new type of experience then this is for you, if you expect an old fashioned game, then this certainly is NOT for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cloud-chamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4408915">Expand</a></span>

Experimented gamer, and all others who read gaming industry press, knows it: mixing movie and gaming experience is tricky and a difficult challenge for a developer to handle. But IRL I like risks, especially if taking those risks may, in the end, thrive an audacious one &#x2014; in this case investigate north (from Denmark :) ).
<br>Before writing further impressions, be told that Cloud Chamber game shares one unique language, english (obviously)! Videos have proper CC (except for those from ESA unfortunately). Next paraph is a quick description of game&apos;s mechanics. Go to 2&#xA7; for impressions.
<br>&#x2014; If you come from The Secret World or you&apos;ve tried Uru Online (RIP), Cloud Chamber doesn&apos;t have the secret world&apos;s frontal approach for enigma, no good or wrong answer to provide, you don&apos;t get to be blocked until you find the solution. Regarding Uru, C.D. is not about puzzles, but according to me community spirit from uru is definitely present here. (No avatar like you had to create in Uru though)
<br>
<br>1&#xA7; &#x2014; So in concret terms what (the he**) is Cloud Chamber. No 3D Avatar, you are yourself browsing a database. Actually a methaphoric representation of a database. The game is divided into 10 chapters, 1 chapter is one metaphoric environment in which there&apos;s a database path. Along the path: data nodes, each contains altered data that has been retrieved from ... let&apos;s not go there.
<br>So that being said you can now represent the world in which you&apos;ll be evolving.
<br>Those data are provided to you in no specific order at all, some might be very short video excerpt while others are transcript, screenshot, photograph, etc. Note that among all the videos, as you probably figured it out yourself, many comes from the short film realized for the needs of the gameplay. Beside the data displayed in the node, you&apos;ll find a feed of comments from any Cloud Chamber players. Post your comment, post a reply to a comment, up or down-vote any of those.
<br>
<br>Since it&apos;s the concern of many players: be told that, there is no comment that can stay at the top of the feed for very long. Indeed comments in feeds can be sorted by &apos;last posted&apos; but they come to you by default sorted by their relevance (obviously based on reply/upvote). But some algorithm takes care of pulling any comment - whatever its quality - to the bottom of the list as the time flies. Each days, it belongs to a new wave of players to restart their investigation without seeing a super comment right away, by that time previous wave has moved to the next chapter.
<br>
<br>2&#xA7; &#x2014; It belongs to you to ask the &quot;right&quot; question, to note the little details nobody commented before, just write it and it will rise. That&apos;s the kind of reward/recognition you can expect in Cloud Chamber (as well as in-game badges), it just works fine and that is one of reasons I like the game, self renewal of investigator/investigation! About the gamers and their comments, it is most of time constructive and clever thinking, you can feel the good will of the community pretty soon as you play, probably thanks to moderation (and responsible players though). Basically in comments you: ask, explain, confirm, infirm, add details to what have been said.
<br>
<br>You can go through the game without socializing but it will probably be a dull experience. The game demands you to get your social switch &quot;on&quot; don&apos;t doubt that. So at first, if &quot;social stuffs&quot; are not your thing, you&apos;ll need to dare commenting but soon you&apos;ll be commented and voted yourself. You don&apos;t have anything to fear, this is not facebook at all (you&apos;re really far from fb) simply because everyone is focused on the common goal: understanding the big picture (plus there is a barrier from real world just like any others mmo, so your life and personality is not 2 clics away).
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Let me add that as amateur of cinema: I&apos;ve been surprised by the in game movie. I am from BE. (fr) so I don&apos;t know well the danish cinema (M. Mikkelsen, L. Von Triers, Niels Arestrup, Adams &#xE6;bler, are pretty of all I&apos;ve seen/knew). Still I want to say that once again I was very delighted by the quality of the production (definitely far from B-Movie or anything of that kind). On the music side, soundtrack you can hear while investing is just gorgeous.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; At last a new experience, new medium to interact with, video game scene needs more initiative like Cloud Chamber. Just for such a bet, the game is deeply good and developers deserve recognition. It not a flawless journey of course but still it&apos;s new, it&apos;s a changing experience. I want Video Game to conquer new lands and new ways of telling stories, if you want that too you have to be curious of Cloud Chamber. Gaming scene have to reward and give heart to the step forward that Cloud Chamber is. Investigate north has trusted gamers community giving it their game, and as part of that community I chose to trust investigate north, I don&apos;t regret it.
<br>
<br>May Cloud Chamber be a &quot;Season 1&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cloud-chamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4412525">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The basic premise is that you navigate through a three-dimensional representation of a database, investigating the actions of a scientist and her associates at a research laboratory based out of Denmark. As you discover more information and unlock additional sections or nodes, more questions and answers surface, building a massive web of evidence composed of screenshots, video diaries, e-mail messages, transcripts from scientists, and so forth.
<br>
<br>What is amazing about the story is that the science is all based on today&apos;s knowledge - it&apos;s not this unbelievable extraordinary science-fiction story, but one based entirely on science-fact, psychology, and philosophy. You don&apos;t collect data or evidence in a physical manner, but you do discuss what you&apos;ve found with other players in the game, using an in-game forum where up and down-voting is encouraged. Contributing comments, new posts, or replies creates more discussion, and eventually through your contributions, you unlock new venues of information and evidence. As you progress through the 10 chapters, you weave through a complex web of information and clues that only serve to further your addiction and desire for more of the plot.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been glued to Cloud Chamber since it released, and I&apos;ve been highly engaged in the story line. Although I consider myself to have considerable knowledge of Astronomy, Astrophysics, and Particle physics, Cloud Chamber has given me new perspective on recent theories that the scientific community is encroaching upon. I&apos;ve learned several new things, and it&apos;s been a real pleasure to carry on discourse with other players, like-minded folk, and those who are curious and want to learn more! As such, this is almost an educational title; I guarantee you that by the time you finish the main story line, you will have a much greater understanding of the micro and macroscopic (without providing spoilers).

<br>I was pleased to read that the developer was entertaining the concept of creating additional content, in the form of &apos;new seasons&apos;. Once you finish the title, you definitely thirst for more! This title has been the best $17 I&apos;ve spent on entertainment in years. The idea of an interactive feature-film with social network attached, is an insanely brilliant and novel idea!
<br>
<br>In regards to the production values and cast, I love all the actors thus far and find that the casting was executed perfectly for Cloud Chamber. They have believable reactions, emotions, fears, but behave as I would under their pressure. You really feel like you&apos;re a part of the story, and not just a spectator. Videos shot for the title aren&apos;t borne of shaky-cam sequences with bad audio; it&apos;s clear that the developer, &apos;Investigate North&apos;, hired a professional film crew with solid Directing and a strong Producer.
<br>
<br>I read in the game&apos;s official forums that the value you get from the game is quite high compared to the cost to the end-user. Essentially, you get the value of an IMAX Film with a bag of popcorn -- except with the ability to interact, reverse, rewind, fast-forward, pause, zoom-in and out, all the evidence to try to reveal far more info than you could from a 90-minute theater film, with which you can then discuss with people in almost real-time what you personally took-away from the scene, and see if your perspective and understanding matches those around you.
<br>
<br>Involving and integrating social media and discourse converts it from a 2 player &apos;Clue&apos; game to a super-charged 50,000 player investigation game. If you&apos;re curious, aren&apos;t afraid to post your observations no matter how silly/simple or super complex and extraordinary they may seem, you&apos;ll get far in Cloud Chamber. The title rewards those that are curious, investigative, and contribute, and that can either be by posting your perspective, or commenting and up-voting someone else&apos;s opinion. Have no fear, new players coming-in today to the game won&apos;t be greeted by a game that &quot;has already been discovered and spoiled&quot;, according to other negative reviews I&apos;ve read elsewhere. Even if you&apos;ve completed the initial story line, you can go back to the game to see what other ideas people have posted; to glean more info and perhaps formulate a better understanding of the &apos;end-game&apos;.
<br>
<br>As for the Score, the soundtrack really made it for me; I was already glued to the story line, but the music just cemented the whole experience for me. A combination of Electronic, Trance, and Progressive from the likes of Burial, Trentem&#xF8;ller, Lulu Rouge, Nero, and many others; I desperately searched for an official soundtrack, but thanks to the developer and other players in the discussion forums, we were able to put a playlist together and I&apos;ve since obtained my favorite tracks from official sources.
<br>
<br>This is one developer I&apos;ll be keeping tabs on!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cloud-chamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4412085">Expand</a></span>

The community as a whole is great, I doubt you will find many other communities that present themselves to be this &quot;unified&quot; and who have achieved so much in such a brief time.
<br>
<br>The developers (Investigate North Aps) have expressed a keen interest in involving themselves within the community, to the benefit of improving the game, through integrating the thoughts and ideas of community members. I was surprised that the development team did work so effectively and efficiently in such a short time to overcome any quandaries that community member have faced and have already began to make improvements to Cloud Chamber.
<br>
<br>The creative team behind all this is also very active within the community, answering questions, discussing improvements. I have found that they are not only working for the progress of the game, but also express an extremely friendly and dedicated passion towards the entirety of the community.
<br>Investigate North have proven that they are not money orientated nor avaricious, I truly get the feeling that they want to please us in any way or form they can and believe me, they do.
<br>
<br>The game can be slow or fast-paced, it&apos;s what you make of it. Whenever I find a new clue I&apos;ll drown myself into research about said clue, while others go through it at a much faster pace, you can play this game the way you like.
<br>
<br>The game can be slow or fast-paced, it can be tailored to your play style, and it&apos;s whatever you make it. For instance whenever I find a new clue, I&apos;ll drown myself into research about said clue, while others go through it at a much faster pace, you can play this game the way you like. That being said I find that the game urges me to play more and more as I progress, as with this type of game you would believe that it can become repetitive, however through every single event of playing Cloud Chamber, I have felt that the story has only pulled me in deeper and deeper.
<br>
<br>Personally I stopped reading comments from other players, first I write my own speculations down and only after that I start reading what other players have to say. Which is often jawdropping due to the higher levels of intelligence I have witnessed within the community. I have witnessed that everyone has their own unique way of developing and concluding the ideas and evidence they have found from the events within Cloud Chamber, not only this, but I find that it is beneficial being able to compare and contrast my ideas with that of others, making the communal aspect of Cloud Chamber an integral but also distinctive part of the game.
<br>
<br>This is not your average gaming experience, trolls, racism and swearing do not exist here, instead Cloud Chamber pertains to a much more mature audience, in which I can work together with people who also want to dedicate themselves to an enhanced gaming experience. That&apos;s something I rarely see in any type of game and it&apos;s what sets Cloud Chamber a universe apart(pun intended) from the rest.
<br>
<br>In the end I&apos;d like to suggest this game to any person that likes to think, re-think and think some more. Space enthusiasts, Indie lovers, sci-fi fans, fantasy geeks, daydreamers, philosophers and just most gamers in general are up for a treat with this little gem.
<br>
<br>Storyline (so far) 9/10 (I&apos;d love to give a 10, but there&apos;s always room for improvement in any game).
<br>Graphics/Visuals 8/10 Original, never seen anything quite like it.
<br>Audio 8/10 It&apos;s either your taste or it isn&apos;t, nonetheless it&apos;s great and really adds to the experience.
<br>Community 9/10 As mentioned before, the community is one of the best I&apos;ve ever encountered.
<br>Innovation 10/10 For an Indie developer to take such &quot;risk&quot; shows balls, and it turned out they&apos;ve put their money on the right bet.
<br>
<br>As a last note, the game requires Quicktime (mentioned on the storepage) which many people didn&apos;t realize.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cloud-chamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4413048">Expand</a></span>

But this had elements of &apos;Fringe&apos; and &apos;The X-Files&apos; that really made me excited.
<br>
<br>Imagine that you had access to &apos;found footage&apos;.  Not a complete assembled story, but video diary&#x2019;s, research, documentary clips, each leading you further into a complex story about a mysterious &apos;Signal&apos;.  The game gives you access to an archive of uploaded data and a network of real life players with whom you construct the meaning of what you are seeing.
<br>
<br>This is not a game to win.  Race to the end and you achieve nothing.  Take your time...  Interact with others...  Discuss theories...  Investigate in the real world...  This is a game to savour!  If you do, you will be rewarded.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t want to give any of the story away.  All I will say is that this is a big step forward for interactive entertainment.  Hollywood  should sit up and take notice.
<br>
<br>For me, it&apos;s a bit like when I first saw &#x201C;the Blair Witch project.&#x201D;  I wish I had thought of it first :)
<br>
<br>For the price of decent found footage film, this experience will more than pay for itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cloud-chamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4413196">Expand</a></span>

Seriously, it is a breakthrough in gaming and something most of us have desired for quite some time. For the people that are thinking in buying it, buy it if you have the heart of a scientist! Seriously, the game touches subjects like Black Holes, parallel dimensions, signals from deep space, the big bang, stars, sound, light...come on, every astrophysicist would love to play this game. I&apos;m no pHD but I do understand most of the stuff that&apos;s in the game, although I can&apos;t for my sake speculate on the truthfullness of it all. But thats what google is for I guess.
<br>
<br>Anyway, you are YOU, investigating what the hell happened in that institute and your partners are the other players. You will investigate, search, assume and follow guidelines given from other players and given by the game itself in the form of videos, photos, notes and subtle stuff you see on the way to the &quot;end&quot; of the game. I won&apos;t go into much detail here.
<br>
<br>Now, who cares if you need to install Quicktime? Seriously...it&apos;s one of those things I couldn&apos;t care less about. The game was made by very intelligent people let me assure you. This is a step forward in gaming. Buy it if you love science! Buy it if you love to investigate and explore the social aspects of cooperation via internet. Buy it and you won&apos;t regret it.
<br>
<br>It is a privilege for me to play this game. I will surely keep spreading the word and show how wonderful this game is.
<br>
<br>The developers and all the team behind it are genius and that&apos;s that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cloud-chamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4417004">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It might seem like a strange question to kick off a review of Cloud Chamber but let me explain.
<br>Pulp Fiction was a cool film in part because of its editing. Scenes took place out of sequence to each other. The disjointed narrative allowed you to pat yourself on the back when you worked out the timeline of the narrative. Cloud Chamber gives you that same feeling of accomplishment.
<br>When you boot up Cloud Chamber for the first time, you will presented with a visual data base consisting of various nodes branching off across a landscape.
<br>All of these nodes are closed to you at the start apart from one.
<br>You&apos;ll click on that node and be presented with short peice of video footage (which is of a suprisingly high quality, stylised and very well acted).
<br>This opening video clip shows 3 people breaking onto the roof of a building, accessing some radio equipment and... well the mystery starts from there.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s no I in TEAM, but there are lots of detectives
<br>
<br>After you&apos;ve watched the first video, you&apos;ll have the opportunity to share your thoughts on a bulletin board regarding what you&apos;ve seen, what you think is happening and why.
<br>It&apos;s here that the games social aspects really shine through.
<br>You will be able to read the most recent comments of others who are trying to figure out what&apos;s going on along side you. Comment on each others posts, theorise together and enjoy the detective work with others.
<br>
<br>Is there a Troll under that bridge?
<br>
<br>I know what you&apos;re thinking, It&apos;s only going to take one spoiler post to ruin the whole game for you, right?
<br>Not so my friend, along with your fellow sleuths, you can vote up or down on each comment posted. Any trolls or spoilers are quickly voted out of existence and it is this self policing which keeps any possible spoilers at bay.
<br>I&apos;m several hours into the game and haven&apos;t encountered a single troll post so it seems to be working very well.
<br>
<br>Is that a branch in your pocket or are you pleased to see me?
<br>
<br>OK, so you&apos;ve watched the first video, you&apos;re intrigued.
<br>Now you notice that another couple of branches have opened up leading to other nodes, and when you explore these, further nodes will become accessible. Each one adding its own piece to the puzzle and telling a hugely entertains story as you go
<br>
<br>You said something about Pulp Fiction Right?
<br>
<br>I did, you see, The pieces of the puzzle are jumbled up.
<br>Just like in Pulp Fiction, the footage you&apos;ll unlock is not in sequential order. You&apos;ll be jumping backwards and forwards in time trying to piece things together.
<br>This is great fun, especially when you unlock a clip that clearly fits directly before or after one you&apos;ve seen earlier.
<br>The sense of anticipation before you watch a freshly unlocked piece of footage builds quickly as the story progresses.
<br>
<br>Remember to Vote
<br>
<br>You remember that I mentioned up-voting other peoples comments earlier. This is important for another reason too. You will need to receive votes on your own comments to unlock certain nodes through out the game, this forces you to actually think about what you&apos;re watching, make intelligent comments and not just rush through the footage.
<br>Being social is the key here, take the time to read, vote and comment on other players theories and they will do the same for you.
<br>
<br>The Truth is out there
<br>
<br>I can honestly say this is the best (and only) thinking mans spacescience social mystery game I&apos;ve ever played!
<br>It&apos;s a unique and refreshing experience, one hell of a story and it&apos;ll get your grey-matter working overtime.
<br>Come along and help us solve the mysteries of the Cloud Chamber.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cloud-chamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4418695">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really don&apos;t understand why a game like this haven&apos;t been made before but I&apos;m happy that its made in Denmark by a danish company, and i think that especially school pupils who&apos;s mother tongue isn&apos;t English (like me) will be boosted through this game because the game activates your brain, explains some astrophysics and forces you to express yourself in English in a extremely fun way.
<br>This game is full pros unlike many other games because you get something in return else than entertainment.
<br>
<br>This is a game everyone should try and it is worth both time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cloud-chamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4425046">Expand</a></span>

After hearing about the intriguing concept developer Investigation North brought to the tale with Cloud Chamber, a puzzle with little puzzles, instead asking you to follow a compelling narrative and figure out the science behind a sound coming from the depths of the universe.
<br>
<br>Once you do the usual housekeeping and finally boot up Cloud Chamber, you might find yourself a tad confused to what exactly it is, so much that it doesn&#x2019;t even look like a game. There is a game there don&#x2019;t you worry, one that fits snug in the bracket of virtual reality, where you must untangle the video, photos and scanned documents available to solve a mystery the Hardy Boys would scratch their heads at. The game offers a 3-D landscape featuring various nodes which are all connected but not in chronological order, each one offering information that unlike other mystery games is already at your fingertips. Navigating these nodes can be frustrating however, accidentally pressing the wrong node bringing you on a journey you just didn&#x2019;t want to take. The overview of the chapter you&#x2019;re in can also be stressful to use, not allowing you see all the nodes available, only the ones in the location you are.
<br>
<br>The story centers around a research institute run by Gustav Petersen that has seen better days financially. Petersen&#x2019;s daughter Kathleen manages to convince her stone-faced father to create a documentary about the  institute that will cater more to those wrapped up in today&#x2019;s world of social media and technology. The institute has a grim history in which Kathleen&#x2019;s mother died after discovering a mysterious signal that has been broadcasting from space for over 40 years, a signal which Kathleen and her documentary crew try to figure out in the present. Eventually it goes **** up and Kathleen goes AWOL when her and the documentary crew consisting of well-dressed Tom and the tech-minded Max attempt an experiment to find the secret behind this signal. Her team then upload all the files they&#x2019;ve collected onto a fictional system titled &#x2018;Crowdscape&#x2019;, were people can help find out exactly what happened to her.
<br>
<br>The &#x201C;found footage&#x201D; scenes in particular are acted out well, on par with anything you see in your everyday mystery TV show, which is more important than you think, the information needs to be delivered perfectly to enhance your experience and Investigate North do just that. The developer didn&#x2019;t hold back acquiring top-notch talent for Cloud Chamber either, with Gethin Anthony from popular show Game of Thrones and Jesper Christensen who starred in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace making the credits.
<br>
<br>While you have to look through all these files yourself, where Cloud Chamber gets really creative is when you interact with others who purchased the game, bouncing ideas around in a single web portal in a hope you might further the cause. This is where I got most of our entertainment, mingling with the community the same you would on social network sites like Facebook or Reddit, all working towards the same goal. The interface Investigate North designed for these brainstorms are understandable and easy to use, by simply pressing a node I was presented with a screen of information with either a document, video or photo present, accompanied by a message board where I could jot down my thoughts on and reply to comments my fellow posters created.
<br>
<br>Given the social aspect and the high volume of users interacting with each other you would expect a few disrespectful comments and the usual trolling to take place, but thankfully it stays mostly clean, with users only offering criticism to pointless questions non-related to the information on offer and usually in a very polite manner. If you do decide to share your thoughts then the community can reward you for your curiosity. Each player can make a name for themselves by taking part and is ultimately how you progress further in the game, with emblems accompanying each profile that can be ranked up, these range from &#x201C;best comment&#x201D;, &#x201C;best eye&#x201D; and &#x201C;most replies&#x201D;. Obviously the higher your stats on each emblem the more serious people will take you and what you discuss on the message boards.
<br>
<br>All together Cloud Chamber is a breath of fresh air for those hoping to take a story in without having to work your keyboard into overdrive to get to the next plot twist or ending. Investigate North deliver a compelling narrative that&#x2019;s bolstered by some top-notch acting by all main cast, most notably the Cumberbatch demeanor of Thomas, played by Gwylim Lee. The mystery while not played out chronologically still manages to hold your attention, your curiosity to see what happens next fueling your need to keep playing. All together Cloud Chamber stands out and may suffer from a few mild interface issues but is ultimately dwarfed by you and the community&#x2019;s need to find the truth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cloud-chamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4425238">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As for the technical level, we really get a kick from analizing a photo or a video and finding things that no one has seen before, connecting dots, coming up and disproving theories basing our arguments on these &apos;fictional facts&apos;. Conspiracy theorists: this game is for you. There is no gameplay; only discussions, theories and some serious and true investigation involved, that sometimes even extends to real-life references, places or events. It&apos;s a rich and immersive experience with an excellent and addictive soundtrack that glues all together and sticks in your head even when you&apos;re out of the game, along with all the theories and facts and timelines swirling around inside your head in a giant brainstorm.
<br>
<br>This game is not recommended; this game is an absolute must play for all game lovers because it&apos;s rich, immersive and complete. We should support truly new projects like this, so go buy it NOW.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cloud-chamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4488375">Expand</a></span>

Now that i finally got up to the final stage of this wonderful game, i just can&apos;t think of anything else... It&apos;s haunting me, with a lot of &apos;What if...&apos; I could get through Cloud Chamber a couple more times without any troubles, finding new clues, and thinking again about those for hours, trying to figure out how the pieces could stick together. Finally, we&apos;re getting as obsessed by this than the mains characters... Just get that game !
