So, it is quite entertaining. The timed jumps can be frustrating though, mainly due to the first person view. Sometimes, it&apos;s difficult to see how far you can go in order to jump - especially under the pressure of time - and you end up wondering if you&apos;re doing what is necessary to solve the puzzle or just failing at jumping properly. So it leads to a lot of trial and error where you keep dying. But overall, that&apos;s a good game, with interesting puzzles/concepts. This game has a lot of potential; if it had the Steam Workshop feature enabled where players could submit their puzzles, it would become exponentially richer and famous. Ultimately, getting it at a good discounted price (like 75%) is a good deal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2864893">Expand</a></span>

It will start to grate on you after a while.  Seriously, stop talking at me, Uncle Crazy!  I wish there was a little less attempt at theatrics and a little more making this a tight puzzler as the story is essentially non-existant...but man your ear gets talked off about it.  This is a lame complaint though, considering how much you are getting at a 15 dollar price tag.  Play it for the puzzles and just try and tune out the continuous Vincent Price-esque monologue that&apos;s ever in your ear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2499067">Expand</a></span>

Instead of targeted teleports and strange substances though, our weapon of choice influences (&quot;shifts&quot;) the whole environment, making everything ultra-heavy, ultra-light, super-slow-motion, or gravity-inverted. It&apos;s actually quite fun. Like Portal, all puzzles are divided in rooms, and a sarcastic voice follows you throughout your gameplay. Unlike Portal though, this game doesn&apos;t deliver in many aspects. The atmosphere is quite bland. The story is utterly un-compelling. The sarcasm is usually nice but nothing special nor peculiar. The platform elements are annoying (as in any first-person platformer), though not terribly awkward.
<br>Anyway, considering the price range, it&apos;s a nice little game, with relatively easy but entertaining puzzles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2494484">Expand</a></span>

And you can&apos;t help wonder if Narbacular Drop would have turned out a little more like Quantum Conundrum  if Valve hadn&apos;t turned it into Portal.
<br>But her time at Valve has certainly rubbed off. You have a first person perspective, the classic Valve learning curve, a silent protagonist, a guiding voice, Team Fortress-style graphics, and no annoying cutscenes whatsoever.
<br>Although it never reaches Valve&apos;s high quality-bar, QC is funny, charming, inventive and has just enough variety of puzzles to keep you going. It suffers from being just a little too easy (and I don&apos;t think I&apos;m being immodest!), and from a very basic plot which only offers any true feeling of peril in it&apos;s closing minutes.
<br>What QC does well is to remind you that fun and originality don&apos;t have to be confined to indie titles. Well done Square Enix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2523263">Expand</a></span>

John de Lancie&apos;s performance delivers his usual wit, though the character still manages to lack personality. Professor Quadrangle is no GLaDOS. I did enjoy the game mechanics; they did have a Portal-esque planning-requirement when solving puzzles. I did find some puzzles were too lacking in direction, as if they hadn&apos;t been playtested enough (but I admit I may just be a bit of a dolt). The lack of a real conclusion was rather annoying, with the climax over before it really has a chance to begin. Don&apos;t expect nearly the level of polish and awe that you got with Portal. A somewhat overall repetitive environment and series of puzzles leaves the game feeling both too long and too short- as if the designers simply ran out of ideas and decided to add in more of the same until it met an arbitrary length requirement. Overall, QC is something to pick up on sale to kill some time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2539172">Expand</a></span>

The writing of the story is surprisingly bad and John de Lancie&apos;s performance does not really fit, as if he was just reading some lines. The game also features certain jokes and not one of them is really funny, which is the worst that can happen to a game that always tries to be comedic. Worst of all is the anticlimactic ending, what an awful waste of time and money.
<br>
<br>After all, since Kim Swift made that game without Valve this result seems logical, the principal game idea is good, but the execution of it into a game is - without Valves team - just underwhelming. Sound was mediocre, a bit too childish for my taste and graphically the game also looks as if it was designed for children, but I don&apos;t care about the visuals too much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2568603">Expand</a></span>

Slightly boring toothless kind-of-fun for the whole family. You repeat the same pseudo-entertaining tricks for six hours, like a slightly stupid dog jumping through hoops, in process discovering almost nothing about almost nothing, and, for lack of a worthy narration, entertaining yourself by looking at various paintings in various dimensions (they change, somewhat predictably, in a cringe-inducingly fun way). Now that I think of it... the game is a dementia simulator. You don&apos;t know who you are, you are locked in a strange place with no reason and you do strange things because a condescending voice in your head tells you to. Meanwhile learning the laws of physics and enjoying the view.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2562056">Expand</a></span>

Please consider the budget of this game and the price. It is not portals! Thank you Kim Swift (Lead designer of Airtight Games) as well as Airtight Games crew.

The only times I got stuck was when the execution of the puzzles was too clunky and needed multiple tries. Unlike Portal, you never have to think outside the box. Top that off with a lackluster story, a GLADOS rip-off commentary which makes no sense and is supposed to be funny but ends up annoying, and an obsolutely anticlimatic ending, there is no way I could have given it more than a 6.

The writing gets a little stale at times and the platforming segments can be iffy, other than that the overall game is very reminiscent of the portal series in a good way. Something I was not expecting and pleasantly surprised by was GLaDOS&apos;s cameo as the last boss fight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2486777">Expand</a></span>

In this game, there are 5 dimensions, in which each dimension has their unique properties, but the main character would still remain constant when shifting to various dimensions. The difficulty increases steadily, often you&apos;ll bump into levels that you find difficult at first glance, but after sometime, you&apos;ll figure out the solution. The visual representation is amazingly great, everything has their unique look in the 5 different dimensions including the original dimension. Additionally various portraits throughout the game will change when you shift dimensions, and they give a distinct feel to the dimension you&apos;re in currently. The story goes something like this: During your current visit to uncle, some explosion happened, and uncle goes missing, so you have to rescue him. The story is good enough, it&apos;s not great because there isn&apos;t too much change in atmosphere, it always feels positive. With games like this, you expect a perfectly happy ending, meaning, you&apos;ll rescue uncle and together you live happily ever after, right? Well, not entirely, but yeah. Throughout the game, the uncle talks to you occasionally. The dialogues are interesting to listen to, as some of them might help you out at times, some of them are hilarious/humorous, and some of them tell gives you some stories that happened before the your current visit to uncle. For 15$, you&apos;ll get the main game that comes with a lot of content. For 20$, you&apos;ll also get the soundtrack and 2 upcoming DLCs. I would recommend the 20$ version, not because of the soundtrack, but because you&apos;ll also get the 2 upcoming DLCs. The 2 DLCs weren&apos;t released yet, but judging by the quality of this game, you should look forward to playing them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2489845">Expand</a></span>

It had all the things that it needed to be a great game. And it might be. In a few patches. This game came from Kim Swift, known for working on Portal, a GREAT GAME, and for another first-person physics puzzler I expected it to be a lot like Portal. But I think Portal somehow did the concept and pulled it off much better. While I was playing, I was getting a lot of frame lag so as the game was nearly unplayable. I looked at the system requirements and found that my computer was only 0.1 Ghz away from being able to run this game well enough, and I&apos;d just like to make a point to the developers - if you&apos;re going to create a game with such an intensive physics engine, make some freaking graphics settings. Anyways, I continued playing it on the PC in my living room which could run the game better, and I actually started enjoying it a lot, and only found a few things that were very bad about the game. Either the jump length is much to high or the rooms are much too small, because you had to stop yourself most of the time when jumping to the next object. Also, sometimes the safes fell and just tumbled into patterns that made the test lengthier as you had to wait for another one. This wasn&apos;t game ruining, but it was annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2511267">Expand</a></span>

QC is a solid game in its own right. The graphics are friendly, the characteristics of the alternate dimensions are interesting and the premise is adequate. The puzzle difficulty seems to be either too easy or maddeningly reliant on high precision twitchery. If you just want to solve puzzles, this game may not be for you. After thinking your way through a puzzle, you must then execute your plan which is sometimes much easier said than done. The conclusion is unsatisfying, you won&apos;t be playing this game for plot. The game is pretty short and encourages replay for various bragging rights (not dying, fast completion, fewest dimensional shifts) if that&apos;s your cup of tea. All in all, because of the low cost of this game ($9 on sale), it&apos;s worth the investment. Just don&apos;t expect it to be Portal 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2526473">Expand</a></span>

You play the twelve-year-old nephew of the brilliant but half-mad genius Professor Fitz Quadwrangle (decently voiced by actor John de Lancie (remember Q from Star Trek?)) Something goes wrong and dimensions start to shift. Soon you&apos;re put through a series of Portal-style levels, but instead of controlling just direction, you also control gravity &amp; time through a combination of 4 dimensions you can eventually select at will 1. Fluffy (everything 10x lighter), 2. Heavy (everything 10x heavier), 3. Reverse (gravity is reversed and anything that isn&apos;t nailed down accelerates up at the same speed it would normally fall down), and 4. Slow time (by a factor of 10-20x or so).
<br>
<br>The game works out really well, soundtrack and voice acting are good, GFX are OK (you obviously don&apos;t play these for super eye candy). The puzzles are very well thought out which is what counts in these games, and if you loved Portal then this is well worth a shot. I&apos;m giving it a 9 rather than 10 as some timed platforming is a little tricky (at least before you get the slo-mo dimension shift), but it&apos;s hardly a game-breaking issue.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=5054853">Expand</a></span>

I always look forward into puzzle games with interesting mechanics and when I saw this game about changing dimensions I really got curious and I wanted to see how it would go, and luckily my hopes weren&apos;t crushed. First of all, I like how the graphics are simple yet colorful: it&apos;s a nice touch and really looks nice in this game, especially since when you use a different dimension, even the colors change according to that dimension (and props too). The mansion is huge and puzzles are many: you have 4 choices of dimensions (fluffy, heavy, slowmo, reverse gravity) but you won&apos;t always have all of them which means you need to work out with whatever you got. Puzzles have different difficults: some are easy, some are very challenging and sometimes you&apos;ll need to think quite much in order to go on, but strangely never seems unfair and it&apos;s usually VERY logic. Overall, the puzzles are very good and, at least for me, they are varied.. The story is almost non existant: you basically have to power up the generators of your uncle&apos;s house, and for that you need to do these puzzles in order to reach the generator. Only big flaw for me, at least I think it is, is that there&apos;s almost no life inside the house (except for that little furball that always disappears!). You&apos;ll basically never see anyone (not even your uncle. Not even yourself), showing that it&apos;s a very simple game....Infact I believe it&apos;s also kinda short (I haven&apos;t finished it yet, but I played for 4 hours and I&apos;m at 3/4 of the game), and for that we will have future dlc (cheap at least), but  except that we only have challenges (which I never do, but for those who like them...). Overall, It&apos;s a very good game and attempts a new concept (sort of) and a variety of ideas for the puzzles: it&apos;s not as detailed as many other games (like portal 1 or 2) but for 15 bucks  it&apos;s a very puzzle game and it&apos;s pretty harmless (as in, it could have been more, but it didn&apos;t overdo it, and to me it&apos;s fine). If you like puzzle games, give it a look, you might enjoy it a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2713503">Expand</a></span>

I was more excited with watching in-game paintings changing art styles in a different game modes then actually playing game itself. I&apos;m fine with a game being arcade itself, although there are much better arcades with puzzle elements. And I hate laser levels with constant trial-and-error parts the most.</span>

The commentator is nice and quirky and the visual design is pleasantly unique. The puzzles work overall well enough, it should be mentioned that a lot of them is based on platforming which might scare some people away. The platforming works alright considering that its a first person game. A couple of puzzles later in the game does get a little bit annoying since the platforming gets a little bit harder and you really start to feel the limitations of the first person view. But overall they puzzles are quite nice though a little bit samey. What i do think the games six hour-ish campaign is missing though is impact.  Even the ending is abruptly finished and never reaches the big climax. QC is a nice little puzzle game but no more. I would still recommend it though if you are a fan of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2798922">Expand</a></span>

I strongly believe that platforming and 1st person cameras will never, ever work, and my death pattern throughout this game would back that up. It&apos;s still definitely a puzzler like Portal with a similar difficulty curve to Portal 2 (IE, rather easy), but those nagging platforming sections seriously dilute the thinking challenge I feel this game intended to deliver.
<br>
<br>Long story short: Obvious parody, decent (and new!) idea, off-target execution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2571287">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The biggest problem with this game is that shifting physics do NOT lend themselves to interesting puzzles that require real thinking. So, the game designers had to resort to jumping and timing.
<br>
<br>Now anyone who&apos;s played any FP game knows that no one, and I mean no one, can jump accurately in FP mode. It&apos;s like walking around your house while looking through a rolled up newspaper and trying not to get injured.
<br>
<br>If your unlucky jumping doesn&apos;t kill you, don&apos;t worry, the next one will. There are so many requirements for jumping and jumping and jumping where the final jump is your doom. This sends you back to the last checkpoint, which is usually not too far back and one of the game&apos;s strong points. And it&apos;s a good thing too because it would be unplayable otherwise.
<br>
<br>And then layer on timing requirements. Don&apos;t jump in the right direction at the right time and it&apos;s back to the checkpoint for you.
<br>
<br>This game suffers from the traditional solution that most designers resort to when a game is too easy. Death. Death everywhere. Any false move and death. Die, die, die. That&apos;ll slow them down.
<br>
<br>Dying is fine when I&apos;ve made a mistake. But when you rely on continuously killing your player off to extend the play time, you&apos;ve failed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2773662">Expand</a></span>

Then, you find out your uncle is in trouble.  You help him and he helps you.  You two actually have a bond and truly care about each other.

<br>In the game you are a child of about ten years old that gets sent to his uncle. But your uncle is in fact a crazy scientist that cares little for you. And upon your arrival it turns out that your uncle is stuck in some weird dimension and needs your rescuing. So you put on dimensional glove and embark on a journey to find your uncle in his crazy scientist mansion.
<br>
<br>The game plays like portal with the only difference being you do not control portals - instead you do control dimensions. You gradually get to control up to four dimensions in order to manipulate objects and progress deeper into the mansion.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are well designed and require some thinking at times. Though are not extremely overcomplicated but rather just right. The use of different dimensions and their combinations is clever and interesting. There are a few puzzles that require agility as well apart from clever dimension use which is quite nice.
<br>
<br>The graphic is cartoony and cheerful, and fits well within the game setting. The narration is funny and witty adding to the general atmosphere of the game.
<br>
<br>I had really good fun playing it and can happily recommend it for picking up if you like games like portal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quantum-conundrum/user-reviews?user_review_id=6505176">Expand</a></span>
