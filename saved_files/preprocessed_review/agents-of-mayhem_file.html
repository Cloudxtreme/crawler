<br>A Sleeper hit
<br>A gents of mayhem is a spin off game from the saints row series
<br>where a group of heroes are assembled with their own hatred for the legion to take them down
<br>The game takes place in south korea and the story is told with animated cutscenes and tons of humor and charm&#x2026;
<br>This is a bit of a 3rd person version of a hero shooter.. though completely single player
<br>you start out with 3 characters, and once youre set free in the open world youre able to go and recruit the other 9&#x2026;
<br>The game handles the introductions and unlocking these characters perfectly&#x2026;
<br>and rightfully so as recruiting them makes up a hefty chunk of this 22 hour long campaign
<br>To unlock a character you have to complete a mission with that character..
<br>each characters mission introduces them, gives them a back story and their reason for wanting to take down legion&#x2026;
<br>and none of them feel throw away, every single character in this game feels fleshed out, both in their play style and their personality
<br>These missions introduce the characters weapon, their special attacks, and their mayhem attacks..
<br>They force the player not only to dip their toes in the water with each character, it forces them to prove they can succeed with that character as well
<br>And each is balanced in a way that you may love 2 things about them but hate one&#x2026; or really love one thing but hate the other 2..
<br>This makes picking your favorite 3 so hard&#x2026;
<br>And keeping in mind you need a variety of characters in your squad for different objectives missions may throw at you..
<br>Once  you have your 3 favorite characters , its time to squad up and take the city for your own
<br>A squad consists of any 3 characters
<br>You can take these characters and clean up the town if youd like, taking over outposts so that you can unlock a regions side activites or claim currency terminals to increase you dollar per minute you earn back at your base
<br>these side activities aren&#x2019;t really too interesting or fun&#x2026;
<br>I don&#x2019;t imagine many people will spend their time running around this tiny city doing them..
<br>and other than unlocking schematics for new cars theres not much incentive to do them anyway..
<br>speaking of cars this is how you will traverse unless you choose to jump and dash into the air, but the game makes it easy by letting you call a car instantly with the touch of the d pad
<br>but sadly there is no fast travel here, youll be driving a lot
<br>most of your time will be spent doing main missions and running through lairs or dungeons
<br>These lairs and dungeons are found in story as well as in the global conflict section of the game which is where you send out your unused members to go out and earn xp and scraps for gremlin tech which is basically a consumable attack
<br>These dungeons are where youll earn mods for your equipped characters
<br>The mission structure here though is practically identical throughout all 20 hours..
<br>heres the crazy thing though..
<br>The game stays fun throughout inspite of this..
<br>Im surprised how much I ultimately enjoyed agents of mayhem&#x2026;
<br>while the open world is shallow, the level design is extremely repetitive, and a low health indication like a harsh vibration or blood/discoloration on the screen doesn&#x2019;t exist..
<br>the heroes with their different moves, diolog, and personalities, the different villians that are fun to hate.. the overall writing in this game.. all of it keep this game fresh and fun throughout&#x2026;
<br>if youre a fan of hero shooters in any way.. don&#x2019;t miss out on this one
<br>I give Agents of Mayhem
<br>an 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/agents-of-mayhem/user-reviews?user_review_id=7467159">Expand</a></span>

This game is from the authors of Saints Row, but now they have reduced the level of insanity and phallic objects. Which, incidentally, was the controversial decision. After all, Saints Row was talking about it, and the plot was not so important. At Agents of Mayhem, the plot is still for show, but the former no fun. The plot is serious with just the evil doers, and for the sake of the plot, just not worth it to buy the game. But for what then? For the sake of gameplay and the agents themselves. All the humor moved into the images of the agents and their conversations. Agents (controlled heroes) every single exaggerated images. Here we have a Hollywood &quot;star&quot;, which quoted the militants and busy narcissism, the Yeti is incredibly cool Russian soldiers (Yes, Volition has still not benefiting from the Russian), which became even steeper and became, in fact, Mr. freeze, Braddock &#x2013; typical girl inflexible martinet. And so on. Images of agents fun, the dialogue is sometimes forced to smile. Heroes pour cool phrases, like from the movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger, quoting different movies. But the plot is boring, insanity is no fun for sure. You will need to entertain themselves, inducing chaos is not in Steelport, and Seoul.
<br>
<br>Agents of Mayhem in the main gameplay. Each agent is individual with their individual weapon (it even can&apos;t be changed) and abilities. You will have a team of three agents, which can simultaneously take. You can play for each of the three agents. The screen will be a hero, scroll wheel, and it was immediately replaced by others. The system is simple and allows you not to slow down and not to sit, if your health is almost at zero. The game, incidentally, not difficult and enemies will take in the main number and armored robots. Hitboxes are good. With such dynamics will not miss you and the bow. This game would make a great multiplayer shooter Overwatch type. So now to make these games popular, well, that Volition has decided not to compete with the same Blizzard, and created a dynamic, colorful game with nice graphics and design. Open-world here acts as a decoration. About any life simulation of speech can not go. The world is here, as in other projects Volition &#x2013; artificial. And the residents of Seoul for our intervention in their space can do is sit down and clasp his hands to his head. But, nevertheless, the city looks beautiful. Graphics have become, for me, even more multyashnoe compared to Saints Row, but this game began to look even nicer. In the city, as in any other open world scattered with different activities. You can even open the boxes containing the materials that you will need to enhance agents. You can move both on foot and by car. Heroes fast, sharp, high jump, but still a large distance it is better to overcome on the car. They have different weight, and well managed. It is desirable, of course, easy to cause the machine, not to take from the streets (bystanders are managed much worse than their own).
<br>
<br>Agents of Mayhem is a pure gameplay game and a great alternative to Crackdown 3. Funny characters, dynamic gameplay make this game good, but not a mandatory. There are no cool set of cutscenes, such as the first mission in Saints Row 4, there is no madness. Volition wanted to do something new, but was more sluggish Saints Row. But the play is surprisingly fun. Pleasant cartoon graphics, cheerful characters and gameplay do their thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/agents-of-mayhem/user-reviews?user_review_id=7471461">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Reset my computer, Uninstalled the game. Currently installing it again, but that has never happened before when I have downloaded a game here on steam.. Interesting stuff going on here&#x2026;..
<br>
<br>UPDATE: Game is installed, but says content is locked. This by far has to be the worst game ever on steam to where it gave my pc a virus with mcafee security. Not cool one bit&#x2026;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/agents-of-mayhem/user-reviews?user_review_id=7471385">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also turn your characters into queers still won&apos;t make them more funnier or &quot;progressive&quot;, don&apos;t you know that, Volition? On the contrary, it&apos;s kinda annoying due to today&apos;s social/political atmosphere.</span>

<br>Ignore the haters, it seems the only one who actually played this game was Quarter to Three. If you like light hearted shooter-action rpg hybrids, get this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/agents-of-mayhem/user-reviews?user_review_id=7484513">Expand</a></span>
