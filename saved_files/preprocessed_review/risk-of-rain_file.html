The multiplayer, with certain perks, I will admit, because almost tediously easy, but that only adds to the allure. The controls will require some getting used to, but are not extremely difficult to learn and only consist of a few buttons that can be reassigned anyways.
<br>
<br>The art is nice and the lore is fantastic, and, furthermore, although the game is out and finished, the programmers are still releasing new things, with more planned!
<br>
<br>Why, then, a nine out of ten? Well, the glitches are numerous, and the programmers, being college students, sometimes are a bit....slow in responding. Like, five months slow. Not cool for a finished game, but I&apos;m looking at the game more than the devs. At least they&apos;re still nice and responsive to the community!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=4407460">Expand</a></span>

However, the platforming is extremely dull and most of the game is spend unloading hundreds of rounds into enemies with way too much health.  It&apos;s not that it&apos;s hard, it&apos;s just dull.  Killing some &quot;normal&quot; enemies can take over 30 seconds, and a lot of the time that&apos;s when you&apos;re on a ledge they can&apos;t get to, spamming your abilities until they die.  This is fine for the bosses, but fighting pretty much every enemy involves the exact same steps.
<br>
<br>The game seems to assume that more health  more damage  harder enemies, which, while true, is a really boring way to increase difficulty.
<br>
<br>There aren&apos;t any clear ways to unlock anything.  The game doesn&apos;t explain what you should be doing to unlock things.  Getting far (to say level 4 or 5) doesn&apos;t get you any progress towards unlocking things, you have to complete &quot;achievements&quot; which are random things like &quot;Fail a shrine 3 times in a row&quot; or &quot;get to 500 health&quot;.
<br>
<br>The levels are actually designed, and there are only 2 variations per &quot;zone&quot;.  however, the placement of enemies/powerups/end of level are randomized.  This seems good, but the levels are extremely boring to walk though, and coupled with the really boring platforming mechanics, it just ends up being pretty boring to go through.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a decent game to spend a few hours on, but it doesn&apos;t even get close to games like Spelunky and Binding of Issac.  Towerclimb is a much better Rogelike platformer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3798589">Expand</a></span>

Holy crap is it hard but god after just 3 runs I begged for more.  I think this is the only rogue like I&apos;ve played that is based more around fluid combat then platforming  rts elements  rpg elements and bullet hell.  And holy crap is it an addicting formula.  I&apos;d recommend this game to anyone who likes Spelunky and Binding of Isaac.  Their is just enough random to make every run different while not overdoing it and making it feel impossible.  One thing I love about this game that is hard to say about a lot of roguelikes is that when I die, its my fault.  I messed up somewhere and that is powerful, that puts the hook in you baiting you telling you to do better.  Visuals are what they are, if you see screenshots you get what you see I personally think they could be a little sharper but they don&apos;t detract from the game and more importantly they NEVER overcomplicate things which can be a problem in other games.  The sound, oh god the sound just listen to the soundtrack and tell me you dont want to be blastin baddies on an alien homeworld.  The gameplay, well its hard to describe.  Its a lot of Dip Duck DOdge dive duck whatever else their is and a lot of strategic use of cooldowns.  Its really well done and I only have 2 characters (Both of which feel very different.)  All in all I&apos;d say go buy this game right now.  Seriously buy it.  Stop reading. Buy.  Go to steam. Purchase. Enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3779228">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing this both single player and with my roommate, and it&apos;s more than I&apos;d hoped it would be. It&apos;d be nice if the multiplayer wasn&apos;t your old-school &quot;connect to someone&apos;s IP address&quot; as opposed to a fleshed out lobby and open game selection thingamajig, but you know what? It&apos;s still a great game. 10.</span>

One thing: get going or get killed. It took me a while to realize that unlike most games it&apos;s often not worth it to search the whole level for loot and stuff, because the game gets incrementally harder as time passes.
<br>
<br>You need to find good equipment, and fast, or you will not survive very long. There are, however, many ways and strategies to approach the game, depending on what items the Random Number Generator gives you. One thing that bugs me is that in order to get a good quick start in the first level, you need gold. In order to get gold, you need enemies to kill. Usually it works out, but on some playthroughs it takes a good 2 minutes before anything starts spawning on the first level... Sometimes it seems that more enemies spawn once you kill the first ones, but this is not always the case. I don&apos;t know if this is a bug.
<br>
<br>Playing this game you will die. But it doesn&apos;t matter, because the replay value seems to be quite good. This is the first game in a long while where I did not feel the need to adjust difficulty to &quot;insane&quot; or whatever. You constantly unlock more things to find while playing. There is some contradiction in this: you unlock better items when you get further in the game, which in a way actually makes the game a bit easier the more you play it. A slight learning curve exists, but it doesn&apos;t matter because it&apos;s all action. Anyway, once you learn the right strategies for getting good stuff and fighting various enemies with different classes, utilizing your items etc. the game becomes quite fun.
<br>
<br>All that said, the game is both challenging and rewarding, and having played for a couple of days I can say that I&apos;m totally hooked. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3909043">Expand</a></span>

<br>It can be difficult, but with the available classes, all with unique, fun abilities, the game-altering artifacts, and the randomization that exists in the game is excellent, especially considering it was created by two students.

Yes, it&apos;s a rogue like with some solid, even compelling mechanics, but the more you play it, the more flawed it feels. An unfair element of luck(even for a rogue-like), poor class balance, monotonous level design, and several outstanding technical issues stop RoR from reaching greatness on both single player and multiplayer.
<br>
<br>I prefer the gamepad over the keyboard controls. RoR&apos;s combat is frantic and fun, with each character class having several unique attacks. All the crazy items you collect stack up on effectiveness and they are really what is making you stronger. With the right classes and a lot of luck, multiplayer in RoR is frantic and fun.
<br>
<br>...but as a single player game? This game falls flat on it&apos;s face. For one major issue, not all the classes are balanced that well. The starting class, the commando, has an indispensable dodge maneuver and a long attack range...but some classes have neither of these, making it impossible to even outrun the monsters on screen which will surely annihilate you very quickly.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s obvious that these classes were all designed with multiplayer in mind. Nevertheless, it doesn&apos;t play well alone. Even the rogue like elements feel kinda uninteresting. Randomized loot works a lot like how loot worked in The Binding of Isaac...and theres no reason NOT to collect everything you find. But because of the element of luck, you&apos;ll have good runs and bad based entirely on where stuff is. You&apos;ll sometimes find yourself going around in circles, frustrated as more and more stronger enemies spawn right on top of you while you can&apos;t find the level exit.
<br>
<br>Beyond that, there are technical problems too. While the sound track is great, I couldn&apos;t help but notice that NO MUSIC plays in about half these levels after the first one. And sometimes, for some reason, the music just doesn&apos;t play at all unless you restart from the menu. Gamepad integration is horrible, too. Certain menus only work if you use the mouse...whereas others can be navigated with the game pad. It&apos;s a nitpick, but it&apos;s still incredibly annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3805855">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>People are saying how fun and addictive this game is but for whatever reason I cannot relate to that. I find the controls annoying and on multiple occasions have found myself pressing the wrong button thus activating the wrong ability. With the default PC controls, it is incredibly difficult to climb ropes/ladders/whatever-they-are, because you cannot jump diagonally.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played this game with a game-pad which improves the controls a little bit, but even that doesn&apos;t make me enjoy the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3811972">Expand</a></span>

It lacked the quirky fun I expect in current-gen roguelikes, I had trouble figuring out what many items were supposed to look like (&quot;here&apos;s a light tan blob that looks like a cookie mostly consumed by ants -- it&apos;s some monster tooth which increases your attack power,&quot; &quot;ummm... okay&quot;), and the items didn&apos;t have the flair I was expecting, instead largely just changing numbers around a bit instead of necessitating a shift in playing style like Binding of Isaac items could. I initially ignored the game just by its name -- I thought it was some phone game port. It came across with the attitude of a more straight-forward arcade game out of the nineties, though gameplay is very fun for all the same reasons Binding of Isaac is. I very much appreciate the bite-size chunks you get from gameplay (where a round could last between 5 minutes and 30+ minutes) which lets me play as long as I want without worrying I&apos;ll have to continually interrupt gameplay to take care of other things. It&apos;s a very well-executed combination of twitch, luck, and skill which feels satisfying whether you reach the end on a play-through or not. Definitely recommend if you&apos;re new to the genre or have enjoyed similar titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3959833">Expand</a></span>

You feel the urgency to loot xp and money the fast as you can, every second is important and you don&apos;t have that much time to explore. It&apos;s like a space survival horror - rogue like! Was perfect to me , cause i don&apos;t play that much games nowadays and when i play i often choose a fast game that don&apos;t need too much attention.</span>

There is no such thing as a &quot;bad&quot; item, like in Binding of Isaac, and all of the items abilities are described on pickup so you know what you have. Sure, there is a luck based element on what items you get on a run, but the luck isn&apos;t nearly as impactful as games like Rogue Legacy and Isaac, you can still beat the game if you know how to properly use whichever character you&apos;re using. The game may seem dull at first, because you only have one class, but as you unlock the other 9 classes the replayability becomes more and more evident. For its price, it is a must buy in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3840090">Expand</a></span>

The game will attempt to guile you into thinking that level ups are important- but the balance is, while you&apos;re still weak, to try and find the best supplies in the shortest amount of time.
<br>
<br>Because within 15 minutes, bosses start spawning. The enemies uniformly become stronger. Your best weapons are merely pinpricks in the tough skins of the monsters that follow from there. All this awareness of the impending end is buffeted by the shinyness of opening a box, or killing a boss monster. or stacking an item that you&apos;ve already got one of and already love the effect. And then... like ashes in your mouth, your character is killed by an unusually hard mob.
<br>
<br>There are more characters to unlock. They ALL have benefits. Everyone will have their own favorite character- right now mine is the huntress for her ability to run and shoot. They unlock slowly enough that you&apos;ll be ready for a change. It will be a big change.
<br>
<br>The randomization of loot is not the downside, but the draw here. And after you visit later levels you can return and replay the set if you wish, before facing the final boss. It&apos;s this kind of New Game+ that warms the  of my heart. By the time you reach the highest difficulty (factored by time) you will be facing large numbers of bosses simultaneously. And if you&apos;re careful, they&apos;ll simply be food for the war machine as you continue to acquire items.
<br>
<br>It is a lovely game. Every aspect pushes the fact that a two man team created this to the limit of achievement. Even the music has a polish not often heard in indie games (hated Spelunky&apos;s music).
<br>
<br>The low reviews have been created by 1 of 3 kinds of people.
<br>A.) Don&apos;t favor roguelikes.
<br>B.) Don&apos;t favor serious challenge in a game.
<br>C.) Expect massive studio polishing even when playing an indie game.
<br>
<br>Risk of Rain is a difficult game that slowly rewards your efforts. The payoff is sweet. And if the titanic pile of loot I gathered at the end of my last play session that allowed me to curbstomp anything and everything in my path is a kind of payoff from these two people who made this game, they are firmly entitled to my favorable review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3873292">Expand</a></span>

The overall concept of the game is quite simple, kill enemies, get to the teleporter on each level, and do it as quickly as possible. The game gets harder over time  with a visual indicator showing a bar that  fills up) so you better book it to the teleporter. The controls are tight and the sound design is quite good. The art style is charming in a retro-esque way.
<br>There is a bit of a metagame in that if you rush to the teleporter too early you won&apos;t have enough items (or good enough ones) to survive the next level. I do like how the items stack allowing you to get better bonuses.
<br>There&apos;s no point to hoarding gold in the game as your leftover gold gets turned into experience when you use the teleporter.
<br>I&apos;ve only played the first 2 characters but the commando is extremely fun to play because of his agility and long range capabilities. I can&apos;t say whether all the other characters are equally as fun since I only have the enforcer unlocked (besides the commando).
<br>There&apos;s not much for story except for little blips from the codex or item descriptions but honestly, if you&apos;re playing this for a story you&apos;ve come to the wrong game.
<br>
<br>My biggest complaints are that certain levels become very platforming-heavy  (which can be quite difficult when under attack) and that the difficulty can spike if you don&apos;t have decent items.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3894843">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is a difficult game but it has easy, normal, and hard difficulty settings so even noobs can do well.  Dying almost always seems fair and not at all frustrating, which is key in a rogue-like game.
<br>
<br>Probably not worth $10, maybe wait for sale.  I got 20 hours out of this gem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=4332971">Expand</a></span>

Retro though it may be, I do believe this was one of the harder titles I&apos;ve attempted to play in recent years, and the satisfaction of having completed even a marginally successful run is immense and like no other elated feeling I&apos;ve felt in a pretty long while. Strangely, despite it&apos;s scarier foes, even Dark Souls pales a little in comparison to Risk of Rain, so I don&apos;t know which really scares me more anymore- they&apos;re both hardcore...
<br>
<br>Concept: 8-bit awesomeness with a real kick in the tail for the unprepared player attempting it, especially when they realize things only get harder as they progress, and never any easier at all.
<br>
<br>Graphics: The 8-bit art is pretty mundane as environments go, with nothing you haven&apos;t really seen before. However, the enemy designs and the random worlds that are generated, along with the dynamic enemy spawning are some pretty imaginative and awesome things.
<br>
<br>Sound: It&apos;s an 8-bit soundtrack if there ever was one. The same chip tunes and synth notes can be heard ringing in my head now just at the mere mention of them...
<br>
<br>Playability: The control scheme is simplistic and works well, which is good since it is a PC title- though if possible, you can play with a special controller as well, if you have the means to do so. I&apos;d recommend either way that suits you, as both are about the same in execution.
<br>
<br>Entertainment: It&apos;s really replayable and catchy, despite the challenge and extreme difficulty. The progression system is very large and you can unlock nearly a dozen or more classes throughout your travels and woes, even if you don&apos;t necessarily complete the game every single time. A thoroughly enjoyable experience to be sure.
<br>
<br>Replay Value: High.
<br>
<br>Overall Score: 8.25</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3945246">Expand</a></span>

Any game that calls itself a &quot;rogue-like&quot; should reward two things: smart choices, and random luck. I have played this game enough times to experience both, and yet, I consistently am unable to pass the third or fourth level.
<br>Most of the time, it doesn&apos;t come down to skill; it comes down to what items randomly spawn and whether or not enemies spawn directly on top of you. I don&apos;t mind randomness in games, but when randomness trumps skill, the game may as well just be a dice-rolling simulator.
<br>My verdict? Stay far away from this game. There are much worthier platform/shooter/roguelikes that deserve your attention.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5017600">Expand</a></span>

I have only had it for just over two days and have already devoted 23 hours to is and have unlocked 4 of the playable characters.  No, I am not a developer as some other reviewers have suggested and am in no way associated to this game aside from the fact that I play it.  Yes, at first I did think that the controls were rather frustrating but all you have to do is go to the controls configuration and change the jump key to up so that it shares a key with the climb function (trust me, this works really well).  In contrast to what others have said, climbing ropes and ladders in this game works just fine and in no way involved jumping, you just hold the up key.  This game is quite challenging if you play it for about 10 minutes or maybe even less depending on starting difficulty as time played=difficulty, meaning it continually gets much much harder.  Also, abilities such as protect and serve (aka enforcer&apos;s shield) are in no way OP, as it only protects you from the front and greatly limits your mobility.  Plus, later in the game, this doesn&apos;t even matter because many enemies have powerful projectiles that target you from behind and therefore get around the shield and there are also many enemies that deal splash damage, getting around your shield.  The other ability that was suggested to be OP is the commando&apos;s dive roll which only makes you invincible for about half a second and has a cool-down  of about 4 second.  Overall, this game is great and ignore the negative reviews because they obviously have not devoted any time or effort to the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3971975">Expand</a></span>

<br>Risk of rain has that very appealing minimalistic pixel graphic style that is utilized here to build wonderful levels and great looking monsters. The soundtrack sucked my in and matched the atmosphere of the world quite well.
<br>The combat is fluid with all the charactes i have played so far (6 in number) and they have their own very unique style in matters style and tactics.
<br>The huge amount of unlockables and achievements contribute to the big replay value.
<br>
<br>A small downturn is that I have the feeling that until now only the starting character &apos;commando&apos; is able to perform well with an arbitrary set of items. Rest of the chars seem to need very specialized gear or just lack mobility to get past some monster types.
<br>But thats just one flaw and maybe a very subjective one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3996223">Expand</a></span>

And you will have to do it quickly because the more time it will take for you to kill them the harder the enemies will be.

<br>survival tactics are required in this game so you can get to the end.
<br>the only reason why its not a ten is because the online is not working all that well only if.

Unfortunately, I fear most people are going to be discouraged by the old style direct connect multiplayer method.  I found multiplayer through Hamachi worked well after an initial set up and removed some of the hassle.
<br>
<br>The game is difficult and is designed to require many many playthroughs before seeing every level and unlocking each class.  As you move through the levels and kill monsters you earn gold that you can use to buy power ups.  Some of these have neat descriptions but others are very vague and require you to experiment with them to figure out how they work.  After a while, you start to learn which power ups work well with which character class.  Unfortunately, things aren&apos;t as easy as selecting which power ups you want like a class load out.  No, you have to find them in the game world in chests or buy them from dispensers.  It&apos;s random chance if you&apos;ll find something useful or get your money&apos;s worth.  This might be frustrating for some players as your success in any given game will largely depend on the luck of the draw.  For others this will enhance the skill based aspect of the game, and the game does require a degree of skill.  Each class has four abilities.  Learning how and when to use them is essential to survival.  Some abilities combo well with others and some even complement the power ups.  The game is more intricate than it first appears and with each game you peel back another layer.  My only major criticism is the game&apos;s visual appearance.  It&apos;s a nice pixel art style, which looks charming, but with so many things on screen in the latter levels from ability effects to explosions to experience and coin pickups to burning terrain, things get messy and indistinguishable fast.  While it does add a certain layer of tension it is also frustrating.  In short, great game with great value for the price.  Excellent co-op experience with others - provided you can get over the initial hurdle of setting up a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=4497733">Expand</a></span>

Before I used to stay away from this catagory but this game proved it can be onbe of the best genre&apos;s of games (in my opinion). I really hope there will be a sequel to this great game as it is one of the best of it&apos;s genre.</span>

<br>Risk of Rain is a game that will bring you a different experience each time you open it up. in terms of random drops/pickups, few games pull this off as successfully as RoR (BoI does well at this, but RoR is the true champion). The characters are diverse and feature difficulties and advantages unique to their skillsets. The sheer volume of unlockables in this game will keep you starting up another run to unlock the next character or weapon. Some of these items and characters are earned by killing certain monsters in a certain way, finding secret areas on the randomly generated maps, defeating secret bosses, collecting mysterious relics, or activating and figuring out hidden puzzles. Risk of Rain is a retro experience with a new-age twist and a belly full of secrets characters and weapons.
<br>
<br>The controls are tight, though to the uninitiated they may seem clunky at first. This is all part of the journey that is Risk of Rain&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;once you&apos;ve unlocked things like double jump (Hoopoo Feather), Rusty Jetpacks, Photon Jetpacks, and Goat Hoofs you&apos;ll be telling a different story. The world you are dropped in is convincing, deadly, and awe-inspiring&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;once you grasp the enormity of this world and its inhabitants you&apos;ll begin to realize your smallness on screen is no accident.
<br>
<br>I absolutely love the aesthetic of this game for the most part, and I can&apos;t recommend it enough to someone looking for a game with infinite replay value and a great multiplayer mode. Just don&apos;t play on the same computer (the sprites are too tiny for this), so make sure your buddy has a gamepad and $15 bucks to drop if you want to play with a friend. Minor bugs and poor menus are annoying, but they won&apos;t prevent you enjoying the game overall (with 60 hours on record, I&apos;ve seen my fair share of game ruining freezes and yet still find myself booting right back up).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risk-of-rain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5431651">Expand</a></span>

<br>My review of this game is on the Steam community forums under general discussions. I&apos;ve played this game more 650+ hours and it&apos;s amazing.... I have no clue what to say. If you have a GTX 970 or higher.... just calm down lol.
