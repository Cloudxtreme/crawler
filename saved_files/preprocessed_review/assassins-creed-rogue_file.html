It&apos;s a formula that in my honest opinion works much better than the one used in Unity, where they removed some of the best features of the previous game. The naval combat and exploration is awesome, there are some epic battles waiting for you, whether you try to conquer a fort or instead choose to engage on a legendary battle with a ship, much like in ACIV:BF. I love the sense of freedom, and all the activities that are at my disposal and that can be re-done almost whenever I like, such as &quot;harpooning&quot;, engage on battle with enemy ships to gather resources or reinforce my fleet to the naval campaign, or if I&apos;m just tired of going around on the sea, I can also go hunt or try to plunder a couple of warehouses! All of this has been removed from Unity, and it was nice to have them back on this game. So yeah, all in all it&apos;s being an extremely positive experience, the game doesn&apos;t look as big as ACU for completion&apos;s sake, but it feels very fresh all the time. I&apos;m still on a very initial stage of the game, but I&apos;m positive this feeling of freshness will remain until the end. To be honest, I think this is the second best game of the series, in parallel with ACIV, only surpassed by ACII, which introduced incredible innovations at the time.
<br>
<br>Now, more technically speaking, of course the textures aren&apos;t as crisp as in Unity, which was predictable, given the system requirements and the fact that this is basically a port of a game released for the previous generation consoles. Still, they do the job, and not being as detailed and crisp as Unity, it&apos;s certainly more beautiful, with its jungles, caves, settlements and last but not least, almost endless sea :)
<br>
<br>The gameplay is also on par with what we&apos;ve been used to on the series, the parkour is not perfect, so the land exploration and hunting can be annoying a couple of times, when you jump down the tree instead of climbing up, or when you miss by inches a rocky ledge and fall to your death. The gameplay really shines on the naval battles, sometimes I feel that this is the main purpose of the game, since it&apos;s so very well thought and designed.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know what else I should say about this game, so maybe I&apos;ll just mention a couple of cons just as to my review doesn&apos;t sound too biased. As I said before, the parkour isn&apos;t perfect, resulting in a couple of accidents when you try to do some basic looking manoeuvres when you&apos;re on foot, and the enemies&apos; AI is also poor, I think it&apos;s never been easier to hide from enemies after you&apos;ve been detected. Sometimes I&apos;m hidden in a bush, an enemy comes to me, I kill him and hide him instantly in the bush, and there was an enemy a couple of meters away looking on my direction and he doesn&apos;t even notice his mate has been assassinated.
<br>
<br>All in all, I think it&apos;s a great game, I&apos;d easily recommend it to anyone who&apos;s new to the series or to anyone who&apos;s already a veteran. Of course that if you played ACIV:BF and didn&apos;t like it, you&apos;ll probably won&apos;t enjoy this one either. However, if you liked ACIV:BF, you&apos;ll definitely love Rogue, so go ahead and get it. The series are probably taking a turn to a totally different direction, I&apos;m not very optimistic about it after playing Unity, so let&apos;s enjoy this &quot;old&quot; take on the series while we can.
<br>
<br>Cheers, I hope this review has been helpful to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=5060796">Expand</a></span>

Beautiful graphics , the game runs smoothly and the story is surprisingly entertaining. I liked the fact the you see the Templar side of the story for the first time and that the main character has a good reason for joining them. Other than that the ship gameplay is just like AC Black Flag but with some new adjustments like the ice-breaker and the ice-bergs which I found really interesting because they add to the strategy of the naval battles. Finally the story is a great connection between AC3 and Assassin&apos;s Creed Unity. It even features some scenes from the first missions of AC : Unity where you see Arno in the versailles, Great game , very entertaining , took my about 24-25 hours to make it to 52% and finish the main story. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=5323267">Expand</a></span>

I had no bugs issues accept minor that barely affected game play at all story was intriguing &amp; interested me a lot. I found that the naval combat could have been better( still better than Assassin&apos;s creed IV black flag overall it had some bugs but was very much a fun game I recommend it to anyone wising to start off a video game franchise</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=5847635">Expand</a></span>

<br>Besides, the story is actually damn cool, the Lisbon scene was amazing and I loved how it tied all the Kenway games together with Unity.
<br>Only bad thing about this game is really the gameplay, it doesn&apos;t add anything new but who cares anyway. Black Flag&apos;s gameplay was the most fun Assassin&apos;s Creed has ever had.
<br>Truly sad this game was overshadowed. Had it had more budget and been an actual title, it could have been the greatest AC game ever since AC2. But they went for Unity.

The game and story are both great. If you liked AC3 AC black flag and AC liberation this is a must have. Nice change of pace from the disaster that was Unity.</span>

<br>
<br>quick question to Ubisoft: Ubisoft - please tell us how come that a &quot;side&quot; game (Rogue) is become much  superior  compared to the main game in the series !? (Unity)
<br>
<br>Bottom line - If you loved other AC games and was disappointed by the last game (Unity) - This game is a must have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063167">Expand</a></span>

I am at about a 29% completion with 10 hours recorded and I don&apos;t really have any major complaints other than a few things.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>-The freerunning doesn&apos;t look as smooth as it does in AC unity, and is a bit more difficult to control. That being said after playing for a couple of hours you start to get used to this.
<br>-Bugs, I haven&apos;t encountered any big ones myself other than it being impossible to find animals in their designated locations sometimes.
<br>-Easy combat. Taking on massive groups of melee enemies is a piece of cake as usual, but I am not afraid to say that I have been bested by the everyday ranged unit and stalker.
<br>-No mouth animations when out of cut scenes. I know this is a small complaint but this totally breaks immersion for me in game when I hear a line of dialogue come from an NPC and their mouths don&apos;t move at all. It is not game breaking in any way and some people may not even notice.
<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>-Absolutely massive and detailed map where there is always things to do and places to explore. Coming from about 45 hours in AC Unity this was a very refreshing change!
<br>-Interesting combat. (I know this is in the bad too, let me explain) In Assassin&apos;s Creed Rogue you actually spend most of your time fighting against Assassin&apos;s, and they like to employ different tactics than your average AC enemies, these enemies will let you think you escaped by slowly &quot;losing&quot; you, and just when you think you&apos;re safe you get air assassinated. Also it is interesting to always have to be on the lookout for stalkers, who could be hiding on benches, roofs, and even hay bales.
<br>-Good story. Now I know that a lot of people will disagree with me, but compared to AC Unity, this story is far more engaging because there is actually some sort of internal conflict that takes place, making you question whether or not what shay is doing it what you would do and whether or not that is the right thing to do.
<br>-Naval combat. Although there is a little less here than there was in AC4, the massive areas you can explore on land make up for this, you can still raid and plunder unsuspecting ships, then steal their gold just like the gold old days, and another option they added (Which is very unappreciated!) is the ability to exchange the ship you boarded for gold, if say, you have full health and you don&apos;t want it to be a part of Shay&apos;s fleet. Overall, I think the naval combat was better in Assassin&apos;s Creed 4: Black Flag, this game comes very close and is still just as engaging. Also enemies can now board your ship, exciting!
<br>-PC Port. Now I know that everyone has had some bad experiences with previous Ubisoft ports, so you may be a little cautious as to whether or not you should pick this game up, so I came to assure everyone that this is a PC port that looks great and doesn&apos;t introduce any new bugs (at least none that I have found).
<br>-What I thought was very lacking in AC Unity is very, very present in AC Rogue, gadgets. You have so many gadgets and gear that it keeps gameplay very interesting all the time. For example I will explain Shay&apos;s Air Rifle, this silent shooting gun can do 6 different things (Not sure if more are unlocked later) including: Putting single targets to sleep (Sleep dart), single target berserk (berserk dart), Distracting/luring targets (firecracker shot), and **** grenades (shrapnel grenade, berserk grenade, sleep grenade). That&apos;s just one weapon, we still see the return of the classic rope dart and throwing knives and a few others such as the gas mask, which comes quite in handy when fighting an army of Assassin&apos;s.
<br>-Economy, so something that was absent in the past couple of AC&apos;s but something I loved about the older games is building renovations. There are buildings (forts count too) all over the world that you can renovate (for stone and money) and then start collecting income. Once you start to spread your influence all over North America you really start bringing in some dough. What this does is it makes it so money is not a constant grind, but something that you can earn while doing other things that actually interest you. Crafting with pelts and upgrading with materials plundered while out at sea is also very fun and time consuming. It is always rewarding when you finally get that final upgrade.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>If you are in to the Assassin&apos;s creed (or naval/pirate) genre and you have a PC then I think this game is a must have. The game plays great, is optimized, and rarely to never crashes. It has an engaging story from the point of view of the classic enemies, fun as hell naval combat, and a time consuming material/economy/crafting system that will keep you raiding and plundering for hours. I gave this game a 9 because it is not perfect, and has a couple of bugs and can seem repetitive after playing for an extremely long amount of time. Anyone who gets this game who has a passion for intense fighting and exploration will enjoy this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=5070383">Expand</a></span>

<br>All in all it&apos;s similar to AC Black flag. In my opinion, the story is great. I always wanted to play as a templar.
<br>
<br>Not to forget that the game is incredibly optimized and that you can play it with almost any graphics card from 2012. The game is a bit on the short side but it&apos;s worth it.

In addition to the ship upgrades and battles, looting warehouses and conquering forts/gang HQs are a different experience. It offers a few things reminiscent of previous AC versions. For example, lightning assassin strikes like in Revelations, the usual search for items to unlock a native and Templar outfit, renovating buildings to get income like in AC II, Brotherhood and Unity, etc. My least favorite activity were the assassin interventions, it was the same thing over and over and way too frantic. Unlocking the computers at the Abstergo office was much easier.  I did miss the underwater exploration with the beautiful color offered by Black Flag. Overall, I think it&#x2019;s an OK Assassin&#x2019;s Creed game, but it certainly does not take the place of AC II or Black Flag. I didn&#x2019;t think I could side with the Templars but the reason for doing so was valid. However, the main plot, in my opinion, is weak, and just not captivating. There was not a great buildup to the ending. There are times when the camera movements are very &#x201C;wonky&#x201D; such as in the bar fights to unlock taverns and in defending the ship. Using the pucklegun is awkward.  The scenery is not as pretty as in Black Flag, but the icebergs are a new twist. It&#x2019;s interesting enough to buy the game (although when it goes on sale it would be a much better value). I enjoy replaying great AC games, and have played AC II, Brotherhood and Black Flag numerous times. Will I replay Rogue? Like Unity, which also had a weak plot and other problems, not likely for quite some time. I&apos;m still loyal to the AC franchise though, and I hope we get another epic one like AC II, Brotherhood and Black Flag and yes, even Revelations, which offered a great plot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=5076660">Expand</a></span>

The story is much better than the fourth game, as well as the characters. And there are a few new weapons and abilities as well. Would recommend if you liked Black Flag and AC3. The main theme is very nostalgic as well, mixing some AC2 songs with the AC4 songs.</span>

                                        <span>Awesome game with an epic story/plot. Yes it&apos;s like AC 4 in ways well COD series are like that as well but they included new things such as *SPOILERS WARNING* the awesome Air Rifle with grenade launcher I had fun using it. You also get to meet previous characters like Achilles and Adewale. Overall this game is brilliant.</span>

Not like in Black Flag I can play on max settings with my GTX 980 and have stable FPS. It has good story, open world where are lots of stuff to do: from hunting, to fort capturing and finally it has double shooting cannons that I always wanted in Black Flag. Overall it&apos;s a really good game.</span>

Earlier this year Ubisoft vouched that they would work hard to make games better as far as completion and optimization went, and ladies and gents they kept that promise. Assassin&apos;s Creed Rogue is a product of  your dedication to the company and the game itself, so i say to you congratulations on a game well done. For those of you who have yet to try it i recommend it highly. Fantastic game play, smooth 60FPS on med-high range PC. Even low end PC&apos;s can enjoy 60FPS with most settings set to high, it is very well optimized and has almost no bugs and glitches, I&apos;ve only run in to one glitch during an event quest where the NPC was not there, i triggered it from above instead of below. That was solved with a single retry. The sea battles have been improved big time, you can get boarded by NPC now, and many additional new things have been added to it. Like assassinating high profile historical character such as Washington, and rescuing another historical character Franklin.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063503">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is in my opinion in many points just a remake of Black Flag.
<br>It&apos;s normal and usual to use the assets from another game but in my opionion players got these impression to often.
<br>Story and the game itself is great, so it&apos;s defenitely worth playing it.</span>

I was not a big fan of Black Flag (mostly because of the story, but also because some of the &quot;side content&quot; was mandatory to progress, which had me lose interest eventually), but did like ACIII.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d enjoy Rogue much, as most people said it was very similar to BF, and it is. However, this has become one of my fave AC-games.
<br>
<br>Story
<br>This is where Rogue gets a lot of points. The game manages in a very nice fashion to build a bridge between ACIII and Unity. This game is a prequel to AC III, and it was quite fascinating to play and see how the Templars got so powerful, how Achilles ended up the way he did before you meet him in AC III etc.
<br>
<br>Of course, you know the deal: This is about an assassin becoming a Templar. There are some parallels to the whole Anakin Skywalker-thing - brash student with lots of potential goes to the dark side and destroys his former organisation.
<br>However, Shay still has mercy left. He works with the Templars, but has good intentions and actually still does good things. At the end, there is a direct segue to Unity...or back to the beginning, if you want to (re)play AC III.
<br>Great stuff!!
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>This is very similar to BF. The parcouring and combat is totally similar to ACIII and BF, but there is a very strong focus on naval battles. There are some small improvements, and some differences (icebergs, for example), but mostly, its like BF... capture forts, destroy or capture ships, salvage them or add them to your fleet.
<br>Fortunately, no diving this time, which I HATED in BF. Instead, here you examine and explore shipwrecks, wghich is where you find blueprints to improve your ship to the maximum level.
<br>
<br>Characters
<br>I liked all the main characters. Haytham, Achilles, and several other chars from the series are involved. Shay is a cool guy.
<br>
<br>Misc stuff
<br>Different outfits (if you completed other AC games, you can wear Altairs and Ezios robes), whaling, a new weapons (air rifle, which replaces the blowhorn from BF, plus a grenade launcher, which you can use to toss berserk, sleep or shrapnel grenades)
<br>
<br>Verdict
<br>The game sometimes is forgotten because it came out so close to Unity, and Unity created a lot of press (a lot of it negative), but: It&apos;s an important entry to the series. While AC1-Revelations were pretty straight forward, the next part of the series started almost from the end, and Rogue leads back to AC III and closes the cycle... and leads to Unity.
<br>It is like a mix between BF and ACIII, but where it really shines is with the story.
<br>I finished the game (main story, quite a lot of side content) in 16 hrs, but there is more I could have done... find all blueprints and upgrade my ship to go for legendary ships, unlock all buildings and settlements etc.
<br>I enjoyed this quite a lot. If you liked ACIII and especially BF, and want something similar AND understand more about the connection between Achilles, Haytham, Connor, Shay, Adewale and the Dorians, get this!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=6455268">Expand</a></span>

<br>-&quot;Epic ships&quot; battles are really epic. I will remember this game only by this.
<br>- Great and brutal atmosphere of North Atlantic sea (weather, whaling, graphics...).
<br>Dislike:
<br>-characters,  (even Kormac is dummy).
<br>-Game is really easy. Plain clicking still make you god of sword. No assassination planning.</span>

While some may feel it as a copy/paste of Black Flag but trust me it has got one of the most satisfying tale to tell seen through a Templar&apos;s eye and SHAY turns out to be another memorable character in the franchise. Go for it. Highly Recommended !</span>

<br>The very last good Assassins Creed Game that also ended the PS3/XBOX 360 ERA, this is basically Black Flag in a nutshell but from the standpoint of the Templars. The game ran flawlessly all the way, constant 60 fps I was amazed after the disappointment of Unity I couldn&apos;t even believe my eyes. The music and ambient music is a bit of a mix and a hat tip off to AC2&apos;s soundtrack. The story I would say is very forgettable bar a few scenes that were pretty awesome but it ends on a set up for the next game which is absolutely blegh. Gameplay is basically black flag but very condensed there&apos;s less setup and its more straightforward think of it like far cry 4 to far cry 3. It was definitely enjoyable enough for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=6062747">Expand</a></span>

It introduces little with regards to new gameplay mechanics, and as is current Ubisoft tradition, about 70% of what the game has to offer are either mindless collectibles or repetitive side missions with little depth. It&apos;s long overdue for the Assassin&apos;s Creed formula to undergo some major overhauls as each new iteration seems to become more and more uninspired and stale. The gameplay is enticing, but only in short bursts. That 70% does a lot to pad the game length, but its entertainment value is short-lived.
<br>
<br>What I will say however, is that the game does bridge a lot of the story and character threads between AC3, Black Flag and Unity, making this episode of the Assassin&apos;s Creed franchise bring about some cohesion to all four games. The overarching modern day storyline however sees very little actual progression, and is barely a few steps ahead of where AC4 let alone AC3 left off.

<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with the good: the gameplay is the best the Assassin&apos;s Creed series has ever seen (up to this game at least. I haven&apos;t played Unity or Syndicate at the time of this review). The ship combat is perfect, the variety of different locations you can visit is astounding (Native American villages, cities, small towns, forests, icy wastelands, tundras, etc.), and pretty much everything else involving the gameplay is great as well, except for the overload of weapons and tutorials.
<br>
<br>I guess Ubisoft realized that all they had to do was upgrade the engine of Black Flag (their second best gameplay style) and voila, they&apos;ve done good. However, the story, a major part of the Assassin&apos;s Creed series, is definitely where the game falls flat. Rogue is supposed to effectively bridge the gap between Black Flag and Assassin&apos;s Creed III. Ubisoft definitely failed in that department. Many characters are either missing or barely in the game. Achilles and Ad&#xE9;wal&#xE9; definitely don&apos;t get the screen time they deserve, while others like Robert Faulkner, Ziio, Thomas Hickey, Charles Lee, Benjamin Church, John Pitcairn, George Washington (a major general during the time in which this game takes place), and others have apparently gone missing. Speaking of Faulkner, where is the Aquila in this game? It&apos;s supposedly been replaced by a random ship called the Morrigan.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s some other flaws in the story though, such as Shay&apos;s and Liam&apos;s relationship not being fleshed out enough, some characters randomly being thrown into the story with no explanation, Haytham having no personality, Shay&apos;s distrust of the Assassins not expanded upon, etc.
<br>
<br>If you just want to free-roam in an Assassin&apos;s Creed game, play Rogue. If you want to experience a great story, play another game in the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=5379174">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>In line with Assassin&apos;s Creed 4: Black Flag. Gives a new perspective, since you play the templar part as well. Good to revisit characters from previous games, and to havd a little more insight about their story (ex: Achilles Davenport and Haytham Kenway). Overall good fun. Moving on to AC Unity now.</span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_6891702"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">A lot of people hated Rogue, but for my opinion is a very good game. There are some problems, and in fact there are A LOT of problems. The main character, Shay Patrick Cormac, is one of the best characters in an AC game. He is the perfect character for an AC game. In the game, you don&apos;t even play as an Assassin. Shay will become a Templar and then, he will kill his brothers and sisters. The story of this game is so amazing and its mindblowing. It explains everything, and after it, I think there are no good guys in the AC universe. The combat is the same and for me its not a problem, the naval combat is the same as black flag but is still not such a big problem. The game is very similar to Black Flag. Its looks more like a really big DLC than a game itself. After you complete the main mission then you can do the Assassination Interception missions that are actually good. Then you have to upgrade your ship 100% and then you can do the Legendary Battles that are AWESOME. After doing 3 Legendary Battles you have an EPIC legendary battle that is really hard. And personally I didn&apos;t even do that because, the game was getting to annoying. The game is too much similar to Black Flag. Even the graphics didn&apos;t even improve. The ocean is plenty of really low level ships that you don&apos;t even have to bother about. The game feels empty when you complete the main story. You don&apos;t have a good reason to continue to play the game and unlock the guns and weapons and outfits. The only reason that might take you to continue playing is the ship. It looks amazing when you upgrade it. The forts are for me too easy to do. I completed all of them in like 2 hours, and the most of the time it was spent to actually travel to the fort itself. I liberated New York really fast. New York after doing the forts is not necessary anymore. And as Unity had some really bad bugs. Not so bad as Unity but still annoying. Sometimes in some cutscenes I could&apos;t see anyone, they just become invisible. And sometimes I just fell from the world and completely failed a mission because of that. And the game is A LOT harder than others. Not because the combat is harder or because of the AI improved, but because of the guns. Every enemy uses guns. It sometimes becomes annoying trying to avoid bullets that are really hard to avoid if you don&apos;t use a human shield. The assassin officers are hard to get down and I always used my guns to take them out because they got to annoying for me to kill them. Your air gun is one of the best weapons the add into the game. It was really useful in stealth times or when I wanted to make the rifleman stop shooting at me. The animations are still awesome looking. I have a love and hate relationship with Rogue. I was so happy to play as a Templar, but still I was annoyed because the game doesn&apos;t have anything new. And we can&apos;t choose in the final cutscene to die or join the templar order. I hope they make a sequel of Rogue continuing from that moment. And this time make a new come to AC and not such a repetitive gameplay that doesn&apos;t make anything better than Black Flag. Another awesome thing is the Naval Campaing. Its probably the best reason I keep playing Rogue.
<br>
<br>Pros-
<br>Combat animation
<br>Ship upgrades
<br>Legendary Battles
<br>Forts (even if they are too easy they are still awesome)
<br>Strong Story
<br>Awesome main character
<br>Real revelations
<br>Air gun
<br>Playing as a Templar
<br>Naval Campaing
<br>
<br>Cons-
<br>Bugs that make you RQ
<br>There are too much rifle mans
<br>Guns are annoying
<br>Boring sections
<br>They make you a question and you can&apos;t choose what to do
<br>Nameless character in the modern times
<br>Same game as Black Flag
<br>Too much low level ships
<br>New York is boring
<br>Assassin Officers too annoying to kill, you&apos;ll use guns to get them down.
<br>
<br>Final Verdict: 8/10 Awesome
<br>It gets this verdict because it deserves it. Even if there more cons than pros, the game is still a lot of fun. and not implementing the multiplayer its probably a good thing because the Multiplayer could get annoying too.

The story is good and interesting, seeing the world from Templar perspective shows that everything is not so black and white added some depth to the series that usually tended to be completely one sided. But unfortunately the main moments in game lack significance, the bond with Assassins is not made strong enough in the first part of a game and assassinating them later does not bring any strong emotions. That&apos;s one of the main issues with the game, all previous parts were causing strong emotions in main moments, this one doesn&apos;t. All of this betrayal is not used well enough, it should feel much more intensive than it does. Fights with Assassins are not very well done either, most of them are just running around and repeating the same sentence over and over. Something like that may be acceptable in some MMO game, but certainly not in AAA single player one. All the other enemies you fight are also closer to be comical than serious. Visually and technically the game is also a huge downgrade from Black Flag, textures are poor, LOD is extremely low, soundtrack is not in sync with what is going on. World doesn&apos;t seem to be too interesting either, Black Flag made me want to explore and discover and it was taking me ages to go from point A to point B because this is how much I got into side activities on the way, Rogue doesn&apos;t make me want to do anything other than following the main story. Abstergo story is extremely dull and annoying, another point of downgrade from Black Flag where it wasn&apos;t bad. Overall the game is good and has its moments, but taken as a whole this is a huge downgrade from Black Flag, the game feel insignificant despite the intensive happenings in the story, it does not bring any emotions, setting and the world is not that interesting, game just feels average, especially after Black Flag, maybe it would be more appealing if it was released before BF so it wouldn&apos;t feel like a downgrade from previous part. It would get an 8 if it was more polished and better looking, but how everything is downgraded from previous part is just too visible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-rogue/user-reviews?user_review_id=7194543">Expand</a></span>

The story features an Assassin-turned-Templar but I find his rationale for this change a bit less convincing and maybe even stupid. Luckily, there are some modern stories here, good to know. So the story is a question mark, it is not that thoughtful to me. The gameplay is almost the same as Black Flag, but more items to make use of. It feels lazy. The open world looks hollow to me, as if the production was in a rush. There are way less things to discover than any other games. Released on the same day with Unity, I don&apos;t see how this would outcompete Unity as Unity has many more creative ideas whereas there isn&apos;t many here. It&apos;s my first major disappointment in the AC series.

Nothing new in game mechanics. Dead characters, dead NPCs and the open world. It&apos;s not the level of 2015 year. Miserable parody of AC IV: Black Flag. Nevertheless, I loved the final scene in France.</span>
