The graphics look clean and symmetrical to style across characters and environment. The music and sound are very well done and provide an eerie feel to the play. Missions stories are extremely well done building an enthralling story and capturing the essence of horror and suspense. Be ready to think, this game is not for the mindless. Missions come in several identified flavors that are categorized for the player to choose these will range from Combat oriented, Investigation (puzzles), Sabotage (stealth), Story line, Dungeon, and PVP. You are limited to the number and type of missions you can have at a time. This is by design in order to keep a relevance to the story progression. At first it seems limiting, but by understanding how the mission system works, it makes perfect sense and works well in its design. Development and Combat: What really makes this game shine is its development system as it is vast in its options and styles. This game does have progression system, not a leveling system. It is centered around skills for weapons and talismans (think gear) and a action point screen of over 500 skills segregated in different focuses (weapons) which provide different approaches to play. The system is broken up into actives (skills you actively click in combat) and passives (which enhance and add various functionality to skills in combat). The system only allows you to equip two weapons at a time and you can only slot 7 actives and 7 passives at a time. At first, this limitation feels constricting, like it is too simplistic, but this would be a poor surface evaluation of the system. Active skills are primarily tied to the weapons, but passives can often be used from all of the other trees. The concept is that there is a &quot;synergy&quot; that can be created between given actives and passives. A given weapon will have a focus of concept (healing/damage, damage/support, etc..) and each weapon provides a different approach to things. The skill system can get extremely complex building various conditions to which amplify certain conditions and effects in combat. There are basic states to the combat such as Hindered (slowed), Afflicted (DoTs), Weakened (debuff), Impaired (stun) and so on. Some actives will apply these states and passives can amplify off of them creating buffs, more damage, healing, special conditions, etc... All of these can be applied with a system of building resources for the weapon with some skills, using finisher skills that work off them and various other skills that provide more complex effects and conditions within combat between them. The system is designed around having you select many different types of combinations of these effects (the more you think and design, the more complex and powerful the synergies between them can be). Not only will you design complex setups between your own skills, but you will also do this in designing a group to work together. The days of &quot;you play tank, I play healer, etc...&quot; while may work ok in this game, restrict themselves from the true power of the system. &quot;Role&quot; thinking in this game is a very shallow misconception in the game. You use ALL the skills, not just a specific focus. There is a lot of misunderstanding of the systems in this game, combat is far from simplistic (it is extremely complex in its subtly) and requires a lot of attention and thought to make it shine. This isn&apos;t a button smasher and those who approach it as such have problems and handicap themselves. If you find the system is boring, repetitious and simplistic, you need only look at yourself. You design your class, the responsibility is at your feet. The &quot;talismans&quot; are gear in this game and they operate in an interesting manner. You have 1 head slot, 3 major slots, and 3 minor. Each slot represents a percentage of a 100%, 25% head, 15% each major, 10% each minor and the stats on the items will weight respectively to those areas. This isn&apos;t a system of people wearing &quot;class specific&quot; items solely. You will mix and match regardless of your chosen focus at a given time. Overall, this game is not for your standard MMO player. It requires you to think, to slow down, to experience and be responsible for your play. You have to break conditioned thinking of previous MMO&apos;s to be successful and see the complexity the system provides. If you approach it like previous MMO&apos;s you will have difficulties. An honest score for this game is about an 8 or 9, I gave it a 10 because there are some here giving it a 0 based completely out of ignorance (including some of the critics). This game by far does what few MMO&apos;s do, and while some obscure titles out there may have complex systems, this is the first mainstream MMO that gets most of it right. Defintely worth an &quot;honest&quot; try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2519603">Expand</a></span>

This game has what you need to make it different. the fact that there are no levels and thousands of possibilities to create teh character you want. the fact that the QUEST have finally broken the mold from go kill X number of X and come back here. then go collect Y number of Y and come back here. That is finally DEAD. Granted this game still has those quest. BUT they are FAR and FEW between. As for grouping with others or selecting a server. IT DOESN&apos;T MATTER. because all servers are tied in globally. general chat in each zone is across all servers. you want to group up with somebody from another server. DO IT. you want to make friends with other people on other servers DO IT you are no longer tied down and chained to the server you started on. character custimization at the start is pretty limited. i&apos;ll give those who are rating 1&apos;s and 3&apos;s that. but later on you can literally custimize your character to you hearts content with outfits of all kinds all segmented to cover each part of your characters body. so no one combination will be alike really. Also the Cash shop if anybody says anything otherwise about it having more than just outfits and pets in it. they&apos;re wrong. i spent 10 bucks in the store got 1200 points. haven&apos;t even used all them yet. the only thing in the cash shop is OUTFITS and PETS. That&apos;s it! its not pay 2 win. and if you don&apos;t want to buy cool outfits. cooler than what you would find out in the game world. THEN DON&apos;T!
<br>
<br>The only gripe with the cash shop i have is things are not account wide. so if you buy a cool shirt for one character. ONLY THAT character can wear it. Not any other ones. However this game does highly discourage alt play. and they do that on purpose also by the way. so really its not that bad of a hit. however some will be rolling alts like crazy which is beyond me unless they totally jack up their skill wheel. because there are no RESPECS. Overall this game is pretty good. its finally breaks the mold of that damned and boring tired system of kill this and do that. and it really is a breath of fresh air. the graphics are amazing and according to NVIDIA they are the first to use beta software to allow for more realistic lighting through obscured lines of sight. in fact NIVIDA because of what the secret world has done has released beta drivers for newer level cards (4-6 series). End game is a bit questionable however at this point. But i believe funcom has a good roadmap in front of them. and if they stay on this path. then any new content updates will be amazing. But don&apos;t come in expecting a huge end game because they are trying to break the mold on that as well. doing what GW2 is attempting with horizontal progression instead of vertical so &quot;nobody gets left out&quot; as the GW2 devs say.
<br>
<br>this game is a SOLID. and i mean SOLID 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2504021">Expand</a></span>

The voice acting and musical score are a new benchmark for MMO&apos;s and challenge even the big-budget single-player RPG&apos;s in terms of quality. the difference in the first few hours, getting to know the world of TSW and being sucked in by it compared to getting bored to death of the opening to TOR was palpable. The ability system is deep and customisable, a lot like the original Guild wars system but less cumbersome and easier to map. Combat is satisfying and group play has synergy and depth.  The built-in web browser needn&apos;t break immersion if you use it to research rather than to just google quest spoilers!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2505835">Expand</a></span>

I read at least one review where the complainer had to take the chance to show off how &quot;great&quot; his computer is but he still cant run it...Idk about that, my computer isnt that fancy, (the cpu actually is a lower than recommended) and it runs just fine. There is a little lag sometimes but I think that is common with a lot of MMOs, especially on my internet lol. Anyway The ones that gave this game a bad review had their minds made up before they even played it. This is a great game and if you get into it expecting something new then you are going to be blown away, if you go into it wanting something like WoW then it is not the game for you. The story aspect of it is great and it is nice to see implemented this well in a genre that usually lacks story. I saw a few people complaining about the fact that there is so much focus on the story aspect of the game which confuses me...In console games gamers demand a great storytelling experience (unless you&apos;re a CoD fanboy and in that case you don&apos;t count for so many reasons...but this about TSW not CoD) so why should an MMO be held to less standards? This game gives some badly needed CPR to a genre that is getting kind of stale...you can only get so many characters to level 80 or play so many WoW clones before you realize you are completing random quests that have little to no depth to them and have no real purpose in that gaming world. It is hard to get immersed in a game that gives you little purpose or doesn&apos;t make you feel like you are actually accomplishing something with your character. The story in TSW gives you a purpose. The game also gives fresh new types of quests, challenging combat, fun pvp (admittedly still needs some work but its only been out 1 week), amazing setting, and great voice acting. There is innovation everywhere in this game and it is the best MMO I have played (and yes I have played Tera, WoW, Rift, SWtOR etc..)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2514591">Expand</a></span>

Instead I found myself completely immersed and counting the minutes until I could play again. Now that the game has launched I can say I am very impressed. Yes, there are bugs but that&apos;s just a fact of life in a new MMO. The launch was incredibly smooth and Funcom has released a patch within a week of launch addressing many, many issues. They have also posted a State of the Game update already which is full of interesting upcoming content. I am loving the questing, story/lore, atmosphere, graphics and style, skill system, combat and many other things. The crafting is a bit of a letdown and their cabal (guild) system needs some work, but overall I am in love.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2515422">Expand</a></span>

<br>A lot of my enthusiasm is related to my personal admiration for the types of stories that this game tells. So it is clearly not for everyone. Those with OCD can keep playing and enjoying WoW-type of games with max-levels to reach and crafting skills with recipes to collect. This one is different. Also, it&apos;s quite hard. Puzzle quests are difficult, they make you think. It&apos;s certainly not for everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2503741">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>TSW is a brilliantly conceived MMO. The horror story elements are excellent and really draw the player into Its virtual world.  A big positive is the new skill system which removes the need for leveling. The AP system also allows the player to experiment with different skill sets depending on the situation. A far different MMO from the usual and justly so. Recommended!</span>

I found myself doing research, calling a friend asking &quot;Ehi man, what you about Morse Code? I&apos;m stucked with a quest!&quot; (followed by his &quot;what in the...?&quot;), checking wikipedia, youtube, and more in order to complete the quests, wich are, together with the mood and the versatile combat, the awesome part of this, by me, innovative and very, very smart MMORPG.
<br>
<br>P.s. the main char can&apos;t talk (yeah, sad) but the NPC dialogs are something...stunning and charming

The graphics are excellent and the overall atmosphere in this game is like none other.
<br>
<br>The quests are phenomenal. Instead of being lead from zone to zone you are often given quests by random things that you may find; an arm in the middle of the road or a cell phone you find, for example. You are limited in the number of active quests you can have, which I like, because it keeps you focused on the immediate area and its story.
<br>
<br>There is also a huge range of quest types. They aren&apos;t just your typical gather and kill type of MMO quests either--you&apos;re solving puzzles and using items in the environment. Instead of grind you get great diversity, fun and excitement as you look forward to what&apos;s coming up next. I expect many, many hours of enjoyment from TSW.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2501991">Expand</a></span>

This MMO sets itself apart from a field of rather lackluster and dated games in every way. The combat is fantastic, coupled with a skill-based leveling system that lets you create a truly unique build. The world that Funcom has created for this game is mind-blowing, and the attention to detail is nothing short of incredible. Having experienced the dreadful AoC launch, I was incredibly wary that this game would suffer a similar fate, but to my surprise it has had the smoothest launch of any MMO I&apos;ve ever played. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking to break away from the typical WoW-like MMOs, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2512455">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s questing system is designed to make players flesh out the storyline of the place calmly, instead of going through the rush of plundering hub after hub to reach the max level. The skill system allows for an almost infinite number of unique combinations(although min-maxers will possibly find the best for each role), and designers have incredible freedom with bosses thanks to that. In TSW, we might as well see bosses that requires, in a raid of 10 players(NYI), 8 healers, or, say, 5 tanks, and players will be able to roll with that just by swapping their skills and armor. The combat is your tried-and-true hotbar tab-target, but with a bit more action with the active dodge(just a bit though). This is a game that will make players think as they quest. So far, I&apos;ve had to decipher morse code messages, decode enigmas, hack computers and even overload a giant capacitor. Where in other games can you do that? All in all, TSW has the potential to break the shell MMOs have been stuck in for a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2502106">Expand</a></span>

TSW was the first game that actually got me to learn the lore and go through the quests while listening to them. It&apos;s intelligent - challenging - and has plenty of tongue in cheek references for all of us who love science fiction / horror.

This is the first MMO that hasn&apos;t felt like a chore to me - it&apos;s a solid game without the MMO, and even better with it. Is it revolutionary? No, not really. But it&apos;s not just another WoW-clone, either. Contrary to what some are saying, the combat is quite fluid and fun, and the flexibility in character development adds a lot to it. No need to make multiple characters for different classes - just develop what interests you. You can max everything on one character. As others have mentioned, the story is just leaps and bounds above other MMOs. There&apos;s a bit too many solo instances, but not enough to really dampen the fun of group questing.
<br>
<br>Negatives: the inventory system is HORRID (grid based, and lots of similar looking icons. no sorting). Crafting, while fun, is somewhat pointless (as you&apos;ll generally get gear drops that are better, and crafting requires kits which don&apos;t drop until after the item you&apos;d make with them stops becoming useful. When they add the trading post, this will not be an issue.) PvP is sort of a mixed bag - one of the modes is just a lackluster, laggy, non fun deathmatch, while the other encourages more group play, but is still sort of spotty on the fun factor. I imagine a lot of this will get better over time.
<br>
<br>Honestly, my biggest complaint right now is probably the monthly fee is pretty high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2511597">Expand</a></span>

The character (ability) customization is second to none.  The varied playstyle between the multiple &quot;decks&quot; (classes) is very wide.  And Investigation and Sabatoge quests bring incredibly unique elements to the MMO genre.  The problem is this: If you don&apos;t give TSW a long enough chance to really sink your teeth into it, it&apos;s very easy to just pass over and I don&apos;t feel like Funcom really gives you a good enough idea of what the game is about until a few hours in.  Granted, this isn&apos;t FFXIII where you need 40 hours of patience.  Just a couple.  Try out a few of the investigation (Green) quests and the Sabatoge (Yellow) quest in the starting zone.  Look across all the decks of all the classes.  You will see just how deep the rabbit hole goes.  I didn&apos;t plan on playing this game past GW2- but I might end up playing both.  I am very pleased with how TSW is turning out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2502542">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have been playing MMO&apos;s since EQ1 and had given up on the genre after the SWTOR debacle. It is a bit like an adventure game MMO (like Monkey Island opnline or something). If you do not like puzzles or adventure games then you will probably not be hooked like I am. I was getting really really sick of the &quot;kill 10 rats&quot; quests in other games and this game solves that problem.
<br>
<br>It is worth buying even for the month of obsessive fun you will have. I am unsure how it will work out as a subscription offer on a monthly basis, but am prepared to give it a couple of months to see if it does. It is giving me many more hours fun than a night out at the bar and is much cheaper.
<br>
<br>They are giving out buddy keys, so check with a friend if you want to try before you buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2513839">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On top of that you have lush visuals, creepy sound effects and 8+ years of lovingly hand crafted environments that are just teeming with atmosphere, extremely solid voice acting from major actors and strong writing.
<br>
<br>Honestly if you don&apos;t like MMO&apos;s and wont give them a chance this might not win you over, but if you enjoy MMO&apos;s and don&apos;t get frustrated when your hand isn&apos;t constantly held in character development and quest/puzzle solving... The Secret World is a dream come true.
<br>
<br>Also I&apos;d like to quickly point out how shocked I am at other people&apos;s comments:
<br>
<br>1)&quot;TSW has bad graphics&quot; What game are you playing and are you playing on a 10+ year old system? My PC is 6+ years (with a video card that currently costs $100), runs TSW at medium to high and it looks stunning. Like Skyrim stunning, I guess if those style of graphics just aren&apos;t your thing, you are out of luck.
<br>
<br>2)&quot;TSW has bad character development&quot;  9 weapon types of which you choose two which give you access to about 120 abilities to mix and match any which way you choose, 7 passives and 7 actives at a time, but also another 60 or so abilities that don&apos;t require a weapon that you can mix in without changing weapon types. If that wasn&apos;t enough you aren&apos;t locked into your two weapons at any time! Switch to any of the other 7, (9 in total) brings the game to almost 600 abilities... Not deep? It couldn&apos;t really get much deeper.  This comment might refer only to the fact that the skills (another system on top of abilities) system is very simple, but changing this would only allow people to unintentionally gimp themselves and that&apos;s a can of worms I hope the gamer world could some day agree to be over.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been playing MMO&apos;s for 15+ years...think MUDs like at play.net, UO, AO and EQ. I&apos;ve played every MMO I can get my hands on from then till today... My personal opinion is that The Secret World is a wonderful addition to the MMO genre where there are very very few good new entries, and a lot of silly dumb games.
<br>
<br>Thanks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2504678">Expand</a></span>

The concept of the game was great, filling a niche of MMO that had never been tapped into with a modern setting and horror basis, but to be honest I was a bit concerned about the execution of such a novel idea.  I became more concerned and more than a little disappointed once the first beta weekend had hit.  The setting and concepts were great but gameplay and interfacing was very rough around the edges.  I was out of town for the second beta weekend, but gave the third another try.  Wow.  I have never seen such dramatic changes made to a game, especially of one of this size, in such a short time.  Gameplay was polished, bugs were dramatically reduced, and more importantly, it became very clear that the developers had listened to the players&apos; feedback and responded immediately.  Now that the game has launched, I&apos;m happy to say it has exceeded my expectations in every way.  The setting and story are top notch, the visuals are great and combat is very well executed.  Launch day, by the way, was pulled off flawlessly.  Very few bugs were noted and by the second day of early access they were gone.  Given a recent notable launch that did not go smoothly, this was a very pleasant surprise (what a concept, I could actually log into a game that I had bought and paid for).  I unfortunately can&apos;t speak as to the endgame/high-level content yet, but given the amazing atmosphere of the Kingsmouth territories I can&apos;t wait to see Egypt and Transylvania.  Questing is almost always more than just &quot;kill 15 boars,&quot; and actually has context within the greater story arc.  Judging by user reviews here so far and in-game chat, the community of this game has become very passionate about it in a very short period of time.  They don&apos;t need to hear how great this game is and how &quot;different&quot; it is in so many cool ways, but those people still on the fence do.  If you have any level of interest in the genre, give this game a try, odds are you&apos;ll be hooked very quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2502396">Expand</a></span>

Great story and game design.  Beautiful graphics, best I&apos;ve seen in an MMO.  Keep up the good work TSW!</span>

MMOs have always been focused on the combat, but no matter how different you make it, you&apos;re still going to be fighting things thousands of times and get bored of it.  TSW changes this and instead of focuses on immersing you into an incredible setting and story.  The stories are incredible, every single character I&apos;ve met has been memorable, the environments are just spectacular, and the monsters will scare you.  Plus, there are no levels and the skill system is completely freeform, pick and choose what you like and run with it.
<br>
<br>This is really a game that needs to be experienced.
<br>
<br>Side note though:  This game received a Mature rating for good reason.  Don&apos;t expect fantasy cuteness here, there is constant cursing, drug use, sexual innuendos, and lots of blood and gore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2502421">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There certainly are some niggles and some issues, but IMHO they are all outweighed by a true gamers game, a game that takes both story and gameplay systems seriously and which seems to have a depth and a SOUL all of it&apos;s own! If you love being treated like an adult in your games, and you&apos;re fond of well-crafted story, humour and gameplay I can definitely recommend that you take this baby out for a spin!

The UI is ridiculously well designed and intuitive. The Graphics are top notch, while Funcom&apos;s Game Engine is the most advanced, and has been for a long time. The questing system flows so that you are rarely without something to do, either solo or with friends or pick-up group. dungeons are boss only, no trash mobs, or very little. Crafting is intuitive. landscape is incredibly well done, and attention to environment detail is ridiculous. PVP is great for all levels, and you can theoretically do all your leveling and buy all your gear from pvp&apos;ing. Armor is replaced with Talismans, that are fully customizable and upgradable repeatedly, where a new upgrade just pushes out the old one. players are rewarded for being versatile and experimenting with their setup, and punished for being lazy and trying to be a one-trick-pony. you can save dozens of different setups and switch to them on the fly. Weapons can be skinned, modified, upgraded or even built from scratch and then broken down again when you are done with it. playfields are huge in scope, while the compass system and maps are well done and easy to follow. teaming is easy. dimensions are broken into shards, where anyone from any server can team up with anyone from another server, great if you want to farm an area and its already full. transportation in tsw is fast and convenient. there is little penalty for dying, except that you can either run back and find corpse or Resurrect elsewhere at a well of your choice, or when in a dungeon fighting boss. if you die fighting a boss in a dungeon, you are locked to an anima well, but you can click the camera option and get a birds eye view of the fight from any teammate still in the fight, which helps to learn the tactics if you die and are new to that boss. ----- In conclusion; this is the best MMO in history for those that love the genre, and just hate grinding. you will meet some of the most fleshed out characters in this MMO, characters that remind you of real people. All voice acted. You will constantly be rewarded everywhere you go, and experimenting with weird and uncanny builds will only serve to benefit you in the long run. If you haven&apos;t bought this game yet, do it. just be warned: you will not be able to stop playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2503883">Expand</a></span>

Its still a classical mmo, but the feeling is fresh. Funcom have learned from the Conan scandal and here we see something much better. Great way to spend the time.</span>

<br>However, they pale when compared to what the game offers - a truly unique themepark gameplay experience in a genre long thought to be stale and essentially trying to stay alive by perpetually copying itself with merely a few minor aesthetics upgrades.
<br>
<br>TSW deviates from the formula of success that World of Warcraft introduced to the world, the one formula that spawned a (felt) billion of poorly disguised carbon copies.
<br>First of all, the character - not restricted by classes, you can literally learn every skill there is (sadly, these skills are exclusively combat-related, but combat is the game&apos;s heart - the one point where it does not deviate from traditional MMOs), and there are plenty. There is no boring and ultimately chalengeless grind to maxlevel, consequently. Usually, MMOs exercise considerable effort not to frustrate even the lowest common denominator, for a frustrated customer is usually not a paying one. As early as the second area (and definitely once you reach the Blue Mountains), TSW ehaves noticeably different - it is relentless, unforgiving, and punishes mistakes swiftly and without mercy. It might even kill your puppy dog without remorse if given half a chance. Baseline: It is HARD. An example: Halfway through the second map, you are met with a soloboss that has the following abilities on top of normal attacks: A channeled PBAoE that hurts anything further away than 8 metres, a channeles PBAoE that hurts anything closer than 8 metres, a mine-spawning mode with a lot of quickly exploding large-area-mines, a casted cone attack (oneshots people), and a casted Area-insta-kill (have to LOS that one).
<br>With that arsenal, in other MMOs, you&apos;d be a runner-up for instance boss at the least, possibly expansion boss - here, it&apos;s a single player fight. ;)
<br>
<br>Then, there&apos;s the lore and storytelling which is, frankly, awesome. You pick up a book, you usually don&apos;t get a simple quest text but a beautiful rendering of a page (sometimes, handwritten), you get postcards, kid&apos;s scribbling, photographs...then there&apos;s the audio and graphics that mesh together nicely to create an at time chilling experience. A haunted house with ephemeral mad cackle that turns to sobs and back to cackling in one go, a blackouted underground parking where the only source of illumination is your helmlight (the cone of light bobs and weaves with your character&apos;s movements), a corroded funpark with a hood-wearing, chainsaw-wielding clown...
<br>
<br>About dungeons - they are HARD. I admit that the very first instance (if you are not overpowering it) for me was harder than WoW&apos;s Yogg-Saron encounter. You have to know exactly what you are doing there.
<br>
<br>Then, there&apos;s the investigation quests - if you like WELL thought out puzzles, mind games, browsing the internet for research (the game encourages to you - there are even some sites set up specially for the game like www.kingsmouth.com) and wracking your mind, you&apos;ll have a blast.
<br>
<br>I fear that it will not be a huge commercial success - rather, it caters to a very specific audience of more mature gamers and distances itself from today&apos;s usual fast-food MMO recipe of style over substance. Already, channels are overflowing with &quot;how do I beat X&quot; and &quot;where do I find Y?&quot;, and a lot of people are feeling frustrated. It will not be long before they depart and return to their comfort zone where everyone is a hero with minimal effort and almost no chance of failure.
<br>
<br>I could talk about this game for pages, really, but I will leave it at that - if you are a passionate gamer, relish a challenge, don&apos;t approve of the age-old formula of the endgame grind and itemization spiral, plus you can connect to a weird, contemporary horror setting reminiscent of Lovecraft, King &amp; Co., give it a try. At the very least, the game makes for a rock-solid solo title with a more than decent playthrough time.
<br>
<br>Normally, I would give it a score of 9, maybe even 8 (There are shortcomings, though most of them are fixable - if they WILL be fixed is the question, given the developing studio&apos;s track record :) ), but for the courage, in this day, time and market, to risk publishing something that creative, that different, that caters to me and people like me (nerds who enjoy being challenged and who crave the sense of accomplishment after completing a hard task following hours of excruciating failure), I&apos;ll give it a 10.
<br>
<br>Well done, Funcom. After AoC, I never thought you&apos;d pull THAT one off.
<br>Rarely have I been as glad to be proven wrong.

It is story based, but challenges your mind and emotions instead of trying to be &quot;in your face&quot; and &quot;epic&quot; all the time. The pacing is masterfully scripted. Hands down the best story written for an MMORPG, and probably even for a game, that I have seen.
<br>
<br>Progression wise you never feel like you&apos;ve hit a wall that is due to anything but the build you&apos;ve chosen and skill. In The Secret World, though it&apos;s a theme park, you can play it like a sandbox most of the time. You will mostly focus on a mission at a time and immerse yourself in it rather than gathering up dozens of quest and doing them robotically like in other MMOs.
<br>
<br>The best part about The Secret World is that it puts &quot;RPG&quot; back into MMORPG. There will be choices. There won&apos;t be any disconnecting lines of dialogue blurted out by your own character that you would never say in a certain situation. And most of all, you can tailor your character to your own liking no matter what.
<br>
<br>There is honestly nothing here to complain about except the chat system, that can be annoying from time to time. So if I could, I would give it a 9.9 - but if there was ever an MMO that deserved top marks, it&apos;s this one.
<br>
<br>Ladies and gentlemen, we&apos;ve finally seen MMORPGs evolve!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2502719">Expand</a></span>

The answers aren&apos;t handed to you on a plate and at times that can be frustrating but that&apos;s all part of the game&apos;s draw as you try to figure out the next piece in the puzzle.
<br>
<br>The character progression can be a bit confusing to get your head around if you&apos;re used to the talent trees of old but once you understand that if you don&apos;t like a weapon you can just equip a new one and start learning skills for that without being penalised by paying for the privilege (1 G anyone?) its quite liberating.
<br>
<br>The PvP on offer in the form of persistent warzones is also an interesting new twist. It&apos;s open 24/7 as your faction tries to take control of as much of the map as you can. The main reason for this is to get a faction wide buff (even for those not taking part in the battle). Fighting against the other two factions is with up to 225 people on the map at any on time (75 of each faction) means you&apos;re always watching your back and there&apos;s never truly a winner. If you haven&apos;t got patience or want things handed to you on a plate this isn&apos;t the game for you, if you like a bit of mystery and enjoy figuring things out then you&apos;ll be more then welcome here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2503462">Expand</a></span>

I am not asking for branching dialogue options but at least have him acknowledge when spoken to with a one liner. With that out of the way, the character development is great, the instances are fun, the setting is unique, the launch was the smoothest I have seen in an MMO. Beware though this is not an MMO for everyone; if you are looking for elves, floating question marks on NPCs, a 30 entry long questlog with quests &#xE0; la kill 10 of this, gather 5 of that; look elsewhere. It also has a steep learning curve when it comes to the Ability wheel synergies.
<br>Also neither I, nor any of the other reviewers can really comment on the longevity of the game. The end-game revolves around raids and heroic dungeons, the former are still not in-game, the latter need tweaking with regards to difficulty and rewards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2503440">Expand</a></span>

<br>One of the issues with this game about which people incessantly complain is that it also has &quot;kill X number of mob&quot; and &quot;fedex&quot; missions. I have yet to see an MMO that does not. If this doesn&apos;t appeal to you, go play a flight sim or a Facebook game as MMORPGs may not be for you..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2504207">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It is the best MMO, and among the better games in general I&apos;ve ever played. The story and narrative is incredible. But the best part is the game design, it&apos;s completely new. There is no grinding to get to the end game, or to good content; the good content starts straight off the bat, and there&apos;s little to no reward for rushing through it.
<br>
<br>The missions typically require you to actually use your brain, eyes and ears, and can some times be difficult in a very satisfying manner. Same goes for combat. It&apos;s not ridiculously hard, but it does give you a serious challenge. The game doesn&apos;t hold your hand.
<br>
<br>The world design is amazing. People in it feel real, have character, and have their own agenda (that may or may not align with yours). And it&apos;s all jam packed with lore, and more mood than I know what to do with.
<br>
<br>The combat controls are fairly standard for an MMO, but attacks can channel while you move around, and a lot of emphasis is put on moving around. There is the occasional buggy quest (so far seems to mainly stem from too many people trying to do a quest all at once), but overall the game is very polished.
<br>
<br>In summary, it dares to break from WoW and defines a new generation of MMOs, and sets an example that will very difficult for others to follow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2502113">Expand</a></span>

Thing is, Tornquist is amazing and i had high hopes that we were going to receive an amazing adventure game. It kinda annoyed me that in the end it was an MMORPG by Funcom. Well, whatever. 5 years later TSW was launched. I didn&apos;t play a single Beta Weekend. In fact i just avoided the game all i could. I was simply bored of MMOGs. After 6 years of WoW, a few months of TOR and a lot of other crappy MMOs: Aion, WAR, AoC, Fallen Earth, Tabula Rasa and so on... I was so tired of the genre. Then TSW came. I bought it in a impulse. Didn&apos;t even read about it. And it really impressed me. The graphis aren&apos;t really great and character creation could be better but if you are an adult gamer you should not be bothered by it. Gameplay is simply amazing. The combat is fun, the classless system is perfect and the skill system is so amazing i find myself thinking of the many possibilities of different builds. The world is really, really nice. And the setting is amazing. Anyone who really likes conspiracy theories, Lovecraft or some good ol&apos; stories should pick this game. Questing is so much fun, from the average kill those barstards to the innovative investigation and sabotage missions. Once i even had to search the internet for a way to learn morse code to finish a quest. It was simply amazing. All in all one of the best MMORPGs i&apos;ve played so far. It brings all the innovation the genre needs and it should be played by any fan of MMO Gaming. A must have for adventure fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2504451">Expand</a></span>

But  people will either adore it or hate it. Many people will misunderstand a lot about the game.  Simple things like breaking the now traditional hub &amp; spoke mechanic will have people wondering why you can only take 1 quest.  There&apos;s a reason. A good reason. TSW is about paying attention to the quest, the details, the surrounding.  Not rounding up a batch of quests and doing them in the most efficient order to level up.  If you skip reading quests or watching cut scenes in games, you can&apos;t succeed in playing TSW.  &quot;Broken&quot; quests are almost always a quest someone doesn&apos;t understand because they didn&apos;t read/pay attention to what they were supposed to do. There&apos;s more to this game than running from A to B.  Not that (at launch) there aren&apos;t broken quests, there&apos;s been a 2 or 3 in each starting zone, but they are in the vast minority compared to what you see in chat.   People have to be willing to tackle challenges by changing and adapting.  Being classless means that if you can&apos;t defeat a boss, you change your skills up and try again.  Some fights are incredibly infuriating and difficult until you realize the linchpin to success and adapt for it.   Combat may be the standard hot key tab target variety, but picking 7/7 skills adds an incredible variety and constant new play styles.   It also means that while the holy trinity is crippled, it still exists, just that you can shift roles on an instant to satisfy the need.  Maybe one fight you need all dps, the next more healing, or crowd control.  You are expected to shift your build and adapt, and if you don&apos;t, you will fail.   This is harder to see early on when you have so few skills, but because more interesting as you do amass more options.  By design you are supposed to fail when fighting a boss.  When you do fail, you re-evaluate, make changes and try until you get it right.  The world itself is amazing, the story intriguing. A one-more-quest type of insatiable game.  It is challenging, and after playing I often feel tired, in a good way.  In an age where each MMO has had more and more features to make things easy, TSW goes against the grain, and a lot of people will never get over that.  But again, the game is challenging without being impossible. It just requires you to pay attention, something which is pretty rare these days. If you are impatient with quests and just want to get to killing, this is not your game. You&apos;ll be lost, or googling every 5 minutes, or asking questions in chat which people will ignore because the answer is right in front of you.
<br>
<br>If mood and setting and character means something to you, try it.  You may fall deeply in love with the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2505958">Expand</a></span>

<br>Scenery and atmosphere are just amazing. - Great graphics and proper sound effects pull the player right into a very exciting , entertaining and well elaborated story line.

The setting, and lore are amazing, as are the cutscenes and voice overs. The investigation missions are really fun, especially if you muddle through them without resorting to guides. Graphically, the game is a mixed bag -- the world is very immersive and creepy, and the creatures look quite good(though are a bit repetitive). The humans on the other hand? Not so much. Faces look very weird/ugly, and most of the hair looks like Oblivion-mod stuff, all wispy alpha-map stuff that. The characters run and jump very oddly, even moreso when they have their weapon in hand. Character creation is very limited, though there is a good selection of clothing to offset this a bit. Sadly, many of the more interesting options must be purchased using real money from the cash shop(despite the fact that they charge you $15/month). There are no classes, which is a nice change, though the skill wheel is a bit overwhelming when you start. Despite the huge assortment of skills, combat boils down to spamming a resource builder, pressing 2 resource spenders, and repeating(with the occasional cool-down skill peppered throughout). Crafting seems largely useless, and there is no auction house or mail system(though apparently that&apos;s coming soon). As someone who has been following the game since it was announced years ago, and is a huge Ragnar Tornquist fan, I am a little disappointed... I was hoping to spend years playing it, but probably won&apos;t make it til the end of August. FunCom seems dedicated to improving TSW and I hope they can make this game the gem it deserves to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2504130">Expand</a></span>

<br>[+] Love the story and setting
<br>[+] Diverse types quests. Those who complain about having to look for walkthroughs are playing the wrong game. You are _supposed_ to have to think about this game!
<br>[+] The classless system and no limitations on available skills means that (eventually) you can unlock several roles worth of skills and try multiple combinations (Game allows for 7 active and 7 passive skills on the character at any one time). For example, team needs a DPS? You switch to your DPS skill set, tank? put your tank skills on.
<br>[+] Most quests can be run again after a timer, so you can help friends out and get the quest rewards again (beats most MMOs I&apos;ve played where you get little or no benefit when helping out a friend).
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>[-] Few character customizations as far as facial and body features. (though supposedly will be coming post-launch)
<br>[-] The number of points to get to having several viable &quot;builds&quot; on a given character will be quite high, but I&apos;m not sure how fast those points will be coming in.

We&apos;re not talking a complete reinvention of the genre here, but Funcom has gotten pretty damn close in their latest foray into the world of massive multiplayer games.
<br>
<br>Where the game truly strikes gold is in the variety of quests and assignments availiable to the player. Already from the get go you have access to a wide variety of locations, each with its own special atmosphere and foes. The game does a very good job of keeping the interesting boss fights coming at a steady rate, and for the hours I put into it (nearly 100 beta hours) I never once felt like the pace was getting predictable.
<br>
<br>The visuals are just about as good as one can expect from an MMORPG. As with the gameplay, variety is where the visuals really show their colors (pardon the pun). If all you&apos;ve been playing the last few years is WoW you will need an upgrade, but most new-ish PCs will be able to run the game at high settings without too many hiccups.
<br>
<br>The game does need a little polish, but nothing significant is really amiss. This especially holds true when compared to previous MMORPG launches - the dreaded Age of Conan included.
<br>
<br>In closing, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys coherent online worlds but might be a bit frustrated with the rinse-and-repeat mindset that seems to be at the core of most MMORPGs today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2502763">Expand</a></span>

<br>TSW sucks you in to its world and never lets you go.

If you can get past the clunky interface and the occasional bug, the content will reward you. The dialogue is well-written and well-acted -- superior even to SWTOR -- and the world is rich with character. Investigation missions are thought-provoking and satisfying, and the incorporation of real world clues to solve the puzzles is a neat innovation. Combat is fun, fast-paced, and challenging. There are some features that could make the gameplay a little smoother -- auto-revert to sprint, for example. But the game is not about holding your hand. It basically drops you in the middle of this campy/scary world, and gives you the freedom to explore, figure things out on your own, and develop your character however you like. I highly recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2503407">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t have a chance to play in the beta, but I tried to keep abreast of what players of the game thought through various third party sites. I downloaded and installed the game on the release date and began my adventure as a Dragon. I just have to say that I was blown away by the rather proficient way the character I had chosen is by degrees drawn in to his adventure. Modern gamers and people in general have &apos;seen it all before&apos; when it comes to cinematics and attempts at theater, so there is already an inoculation against immersion conditioned into us by environmental factors. But I have to say that the credit to the opening sequences is that it has the power of mystery to draw one in to an otherwise unknown world of lore. I say this in contrast to the games of LotRo and SWtOR, and to a lesser extent WAR, where there is an already established franchise that can at times impede player expectations and directs gameplay in directions that would otherwise appear artificial. The first hub, Kingsmouth, appears menacing and I will say that since I did not have all the time in the world to explore it, I am unsure as to how much open terrain there is there. It appeared that it was fairly open, with possibilities of exploration when I have the chance. One nice feature is that there are some &apos;easter egg&apos; style missions scattered about. This is what suggests to me that the game will not be an on rails theme park style journey. I like that.
<br>I haven&apos;t had a chance to group up with others, though there were quite a few players in the opening zone yesterday. Chat channel was alive and buzzing, people were friendly and helpful. I look forward to exploring some of the group content in the near future. The skill build system is unique or perhaps is something entirely new to me. Sooner or later I suppose there will be some cookie cutter builds but for now it feels good to have that burden lifted from me, no game should feel like a harness. My only con, and it is not really a con in the usual sense, comes from my own negligence. I give kudos to nvidia for putting together a driver package specifically for the Secret World. I installed it and my older graphics hardware runs the game just fine. However I have come to the realization that it is time to update my hardware, if not for this game but for other games in the future that will demand more from my gpu. This is a minor gripe considering that I have had my graphics card for almost three years and have been milking its longevity. Again, kudos to nvidia for providing the support for this game. I am not sure how AMD people are faring thus far. All in all a very solid game, a very smooth launch it would appear, and I look forward to playing it with friends and family for quite some time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2504072">Expand</a></span>

It was very smooth with only 1 bugged quest (that I know of), which was fixed on the second day by the developers. 100% server up-time with a stable connection.
<br>
<br>The world is rich, unique for this genre, realistic, atmospheric and genuinely quite scary at times. I am running it on a very high end PC at 2560x1440 and I am gob smacked by the graphics almost constantly. I have noticed no network latency from their servers even with large numbers of players together. The quests are excellent, with very few obvious courier/kill x of y mechanics being used. Some of them are fiendishly difficult to solve and many come without quest markers or any other guide to completion beside the intended clues e.g.  newspaper clippings, dialogue, photographs, rumour. I really respect their decision to keep this level of difficulty and strongly believe this will help build a mature interesting player base. The 5-man dungeons I have completed are good fun and fairly quick to run, with boss-to-boss encounters for the most part. The skill system and ability wheel are simultaneously quite simple to grasp and very complicated, with deep customisation available. Don&apos;t worry there are suggested builds but also anything is possible.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t write any more at present as I can&apos;t stay away from the game any longer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2503563">Expand</a></span>

Funcom&apos;s new MMO The Secret World needs polish and has a few really annoying bugs, but the core game has me hooked.  While combat may not satisfy traditional MMO gamers, TSW actually has a very  deep combat system.  TSW&apos;s story and incredibly detailed, beautiful game world make for a compelling MMO.  Crafting is very much modeled after Minecraft which is interesting.  The quests are real brain drainers at times, and the challenge is a welcome one.  At times the player even has to use Google to do a little research.  If you enjoy stories of the occult, alternate universes, gothic horror and conspiracy, The Secret World needs you in it&apos;s army.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2506771">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is by far the best MMO I&apos;ve ever played. Ragnar Tornquist did an INCREDIBLE job with the story and the game&apos;s lore, I&apos;m even motivated to check out his other games.
<br>I&apos;ve played pre-access and I&apos;ve gotten a lifetime subscription. The setting and atmosphere are incredible and the missions are usually sculpted into amazing ice sculptures while most other MMO&apos;s just churn out ice cubes. Seriously, watch every cut-scene. You won&apos;t regret it.
<br>
<br>The combat system is also very in depth when you look into it. On the outside, it looks like just normal button mashing with a bit of active dodging. However, the real gem of the system is found in creating many different synergies between two weapons and 14 out of over 500 abilities.
<br>
<br>It is definitely not for everyone, it targets a niche crowd. However, that is because it IS different than most MMO&apos;s.
<br>It doesn&apos;t hold your hand very much, however, and that could be seen as a good thing or a bad thing. Personally, I had no trouble at all playing the game. But that is because I had already done my research and knew how to play.
<br>
<br>Some investigation quests can be VERY tricky but, in they end, they make you feel smart and determined. Things I wish more people were these days.
<br>
<br>Also, EA is only handling the physical distribution of the game. They have absolutely no control in the development process of the games past, present, or future.
<br>
<br>For the cash shop? You&apos;d be surprised at how well Funcom has managed to keep it strictly cosmetic with no affect on the gameplay. You cannot buy items or money and you cannot sell, disassemble, or trade anything you do buy. You may not like the fact that there even is a cash shop to begin with, neither do I, but I find the game to have made up for itself and more just because it is so different.
<br>
<br>The launch has been the smoothest MMO launches I&apos;ve ever experienced and so far I&apos;ve not regretted my decision to get lifetime membership one bit!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2507416">Expand</a></span>

I stopped playing that long ago and have been searching for something with 3 factions, solid engaging PvP, etc. I saw The Secret World and thought it had a lot of cool ideas and potential to deliver engaging PvP. So as to not write up a 5 page essay, I&apos;ll cut to the chase, I LOVE the PvE in TSW. I haven&apos;t had such a good time doing missions/quests (since Everquest because it was one of the first for me). The combat is definitely a step up in my opinion than other MMOs because it&apos;s a hybrid of having to move around, monitor states, etc, to get the most out of your combos. Though the PvP doesn&apos;t hold a candle to DAoC&apos;s PvP, I can still enjoy the game and PvP as a secondary activity. Congrats Funcom, I was skeptical at first because of my experience with Age of Conan; you&apos;ve done well and erased that apprehensive feeling about your company. In short, I love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2504332">Expand</a></span>

Fantastic atmosphere, fun missions, combat and story. Stability is great with a few minor bugs. Thank you, Funcom for delivering something new a fresh - Highly recommended.</span>

It is by far the best the genre has ever offered up.  It is obvious the developers sat down with a mission to not only fix all the recurring problems of the genre but really think outside the box and come up with something fresh.
<br>
<br>Character progression is open and flexible like nothing that&apos;s been done before in an MMO.  The attention to detail that&apos;s been put into the quests is amazing, after maybe 20 hours of play I&apos;ve only found about 3 or so &quot;kill x of this monster&quot; type quests.  Normally in an MMO try as I might to follow the story I just end up sinking into a grind fest - however the quests here are interesting, quirky and the cutscenes that accompany most of them feature deep characterisation and often hilarious lines.  Many of the quests feature puzzles that make you really think.
<br>
<br>Everything is structured so that you can play how you want to play and all the boring crap from the genre is removed.  Grinding for levels is non-existent, crafting requires no levelling (just the required items), dungeons have a minimum of trash mobs, character progression is completely open, gear is handled separately to clothing so you can set your character up to look how you want him/her to look without sacrificing that awesome bit of shiny gear.
<br>
<br>Truly ground breaking for the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2504026">Expand</a></span>

Questing and leveling are a refreshing change from the standard formula, and the setting is immersive and unlike anything else on the market.  Fans of customizing a character will love the skill-wheel system, as there are no true classes and you can change literally everything about your character&apos;s abilities.  Everything has a touch of the Horror genre to it (which you&apos;ll feel in depth from the very first area.)  Quests can be both very hard and rewarding, some of which require you to do actual research in the in-game browser (or just look up the answer to a puzzle in the many guides that exist.)  All that said, the game falls a little flat in the endgame.  PVP is mostly unsatisfying and stacked toward premade teams (which are in the same queue as soloers), the endgame Nightmare-level dungeons can be both prohibitively difficult and excessively grindy, and the move to buy-to-play has ensured that endgame content will continue coming out at a slow pace.  Not perfect, but well worth the purchase price, and very easy to sink a large amount of time into.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2511464">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is the thinking gamer&apos;s MMO. It&apos;s not WoW and twitch-generation 11 YO kiddies who like to parade their shiny armors on the Orgrimmar bank won&apos;t like it. It&apos;s a game that doesn&apos;t place emphasis on loot, on raiding, on e-peen. It&apos;s a game where you&apos;ll enjoy the atmosphere, the GREAT writing in quests, the stories it tells. It&apos;s a game where you won&apos;t be forced to play a strict healer/tank/DPS role to be effective. It&apos;s a game where you can ultimately have any skills you want and make your own builds.
<br>If you&apos;re looking for something that no AAA MMO has been since WoW came out... buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2511941">Expand</a></span>

The launch went completely smooth, PvP maps are very well done (and very very large), the graphics are amazing, the ability that every quest in game is a &quot;daily&quot;  quest is awesome in my opinion too.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t found anything in game that would warrant a lesser score. Even with a few quests being &quot;broken&quot;, you can still complete those on another dimension or run something entirely different that you know how to complete to get the XP you would have from the other quest.
<br>
<br>I very much recommend this game to anyone, as it will appeal to the &quot;old school&quot; generation of MMO Gamers, and the new school ones as well!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2506699">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1) Probably one of the most stable launches from an MMO that I&apos;ve personally experienced. Huge props to FC for pulling it off, showing the world that it can, in fact, launch an AAA MMO. 2) The environment and storyline are at equal with some of my most favorite single player RPG&apos;s. 3) The game is beautiful - meet the recommended specs and you won&apos;t be disappointed (though, there needs to be more options for character customization, but that is something they are dedicated to expanding as a base product of the game... and the animations they will improve upon moving forward as well)
<br>4) I love the premise of the game. Conspiracy theory? Occult? Myth and fantasy? Modern day setting? Uh, yes please. 5) Puzzles and investigation missions and general missions that just make you think. A good many of them just require you to pay attention and just think in context of the zone you are in. I really find that attractive in a game.
<br>6) The crafting and skill system in general I find to be extremely attractive as well. The crafting is a step different from the typical things MMO&apos;s do and the skill system provides for a lot of really interesting theorycrafting down the road.
<br>7) I&apos;ve been following the game for over 3 years (some of my friends, over 5.)... and I can safely say it hasn&apos;t disappointed me. Now, this isn&apos;t to say that there aren&apos;t some problems: The lack of character customization is a concern for many, but as stated, they&apos;ve already have a plan to expand it. The interface seems a tad clunky and perhaps my biggest personal annoyance is the clunkiness of the inventory space and how all that is handled, but I am patient about such things. There are some bugged missions that are a consequence of so many people  trying to do them at once or just bugged because they are bugged, but the latter are few and far in between. Some aspects are more intuitive than others and this could frustrate some.... and as a result... TSW simply won&apos;t be for everyone. For some, it will resonate deeply with and it will become their favorite game ever... for others? It will be a &quot;meh&quot; game or worse, something they will resent. Now, the cash shop is a bit of a concern for some, as I get the argument, but absolutely none of the items that come from it grand power to the player. All of it is aesthetic, just as Funcom said it would be. If you are wary of playing an MMO at launch, then give TSW a bit to percolate. However, if you have a good grasp of what to expect from an MMO launch - jump right in. The water is fine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-secret-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2507848">Expand</a></span>
