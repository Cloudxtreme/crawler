The developers went far and beyond for the Linux user. I love the game, we just have to continue spreading the news and experience. You&apos;ve raised the bar. Kudos and thanks a lot!</span>

Indicative of their general attitude, the developers cheat horribly in the online matches and delete forum threads discussing it when the community tries to take a stand on the issue.</span>

The huge amount of RPG elements added - in order to make Savage 2 more beginner friendly than Savage 1 - turned a good FPS and RTS experience into a medocre FPS, poor RTS and poor RPG experience. The game is a lot less rewarding and fun.</span>

However, it falls short in several key areas. The game is buggy and lags a bit too much - especially considering that S2 has self-published this as a digital download and should NOT have had to rush this game out the door before fixing those issues. An even more glaring sin is that you have to buy the Collector&apos;s Edition to get ANY kind of manual at all - paper-bound or digital. Yes, you read that right, you won&apos;t get a manual with the game, just some crummy advice on the website and a tutorial that is broken halfway through it. Lovely. Gameplay is a bit too frenetic and the learning curve is going to scare away a LOT of players, particularly without a manual. The Commander mode, while nifty, doesn&apos;t seem particularly functional and it seems like every other second you&apos;re running into some kind of preventive rule against building anything. Probably the worst issue is that it&apos;s slippery slope gameplay, in that most of the time one team will start to get rolling and rarely will they lose once the tide is turned in their favor. So, all in all, just not quite the game that Savage fans had been hoping for. The potential for some enjoyment is there but overall, it&apos;s just not terribly exciting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/savage-2-a-tortured-soul/user-reviews?user_review_id=409009">Expand</a></span>

S2 has since made numerous improvements to the game, as well as bug fixes. This is the only game on the market which offers such a unique and refined blend of action and strategy that it deserves a 10. I cannot think of a reason to give this game anything less.</span>

I like how its PvP which is what interests me in games. You can&apos;t play pure FPS but you do have to use it, people complain that the guns do barely any damage, they dont do alot, but they could make you win by an extra swing of the sword, or claw.</span>

Some people say it&apos;s too luck based and that the melee fighting is too fast to react effectively. But that is not completely true. When you start playing it might seem like that but with some practice you can really become better. Of course if you charge at your enemies and start clicking mouse buttons at random you don&apos;t stand a chance, but if you don&apos;t panic and wait for your enemy to do something, you can react effectively. The fact that some players kick my ass while other players barely put up a fight proves that it&apos;s not random. Also a player who is playing for 20 minutes in a game has not a big advantage over a player that plays for 3 minutes. Some classes cost more than others, but they are not overpowering. Two Shape Shifters can bring down a Legionnaire if they use spells and teamwork. It&apos;s not just a graphic improvement of Savage 1. The units are better balanced (as I already mentioned), the melee system is vastly improved, ranged weapons have become less important (which was really annoying in Savage 1: if a group of people attacked with ranged units melee combat was impossible), thanks to the automated steam mines and mine groves you don&apos;t have to mine yourself anymore, Stamina system is better (more stamina with faster reload but attacking costs stamina too, predifined classes (some consider this bad but I think it&apos;s a good thing because a legionnaire with a markman&apos;s bow was somewhat overpowering, now you have classes made for archery, made for melee combat, etc). I guess you hate the game or you love the game (you can see it at the scores people give), but I really love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/savage-2-a-tortured-soul/user-reviews?user_review_id=410768">Expand</a></span>

There a lot of different possibilitys to your charachter and let him become more individual.

Since its release S2Games has overhauled the melee system. The game has been changed in many ways, all of it for the better. Its balanced, much less buggy, a much more complete game, and the visuals have remained as stunning as ever. It has elements of RTS, MMO, and FPS, but you must keep in mind that Savage 2 is a very unique game. You cannot play it as an FPS without embracing the other elements, and the induvidual attributes of it would not make a complete game. The true beauty is how they blend together into the seamless gameplay. The gameplay is skill based, very fast pace, and incredibly addictive. Oh, and did I mention the game is completely free now? Savage 2 has an incredibly great community, there are upcoming events to help newcomers, and always people ready and willing to lend a hand. The game has only been, and continues to be made better, and the community stands to reinforce that. This game is worth whatever ammount of time your going to spend on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/savage-2-a-tortured-soul/user-reviews?user_review_id=422945">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> I like it. Yeah it has a few minor bugs but its true that the dev team is quick to fix problems. I find it interesting that even though there are big ads on websites like gamespot and ign. They have not reviewed it or even given much coverage. Its a quality title and the price is nice at 30 bones.</span>

For being a game released in 2008, the engine itself is a joke. For the most part, the game is mainly a third-person combat game because all the ranged weapons are awful, so the FPS part of it is non-existent. The RTS part is very limited, most strategies only consisting of flanking positions by building forward spawn locations, but the maps are not designed to offer any creative tactics due to invisible walls/terrain which cannot be built on. The RPG part of it is also missing really. Sure, you can level up but there is no actual roleplaying involved. The game is advertised incorrectly on their site. Persistent Items do not drop in the game. The only way you can get them is by scratch-off tickets. You receive 1 ticket which gives you a random persistent item when you buy the game. In order to get more, you have to purchase the collector&apos;s edition. After that, you&apos;re screwed. No items drop in the game regardless of what the site says. There is no manual for this game and the site unit information is incorrect. For instance, some units on the pages have abilities that are not in the game. This game has several issues with stability, often causing disconnects or crashes to desktop. Also, there are several issues with binding controls which default when you restart the game. Some keys cannot be re-binded. The player base is so small, you will end up being forced to play against players on the top 20 player ladder who stack on one team, people who&apos;ve been playing this game since the beta and are geared to the teeth with items. They&apos;ve gone so far as to purchase multiple copies of the collector&apos;s edition just to get the right items. At any given time, there is at least 150 average players on 5 U.S. servers. Around 60 off-peak hours. This game fails in every area, is very buggy, is advertised incorrectly, and has a very small player base. Avoid this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/savage-2-a-tortured-soul/user-reviews?user_review_id=409188">Expand</a></span>

I have a very high end gaming PC and this game will lag from time to time on me which it totally shouldn&apos;t. Sometimes has a low player base, but overall an improvement over the original. Wish there was a free to play mode though so we could get more players. (I paid but others are cheap asses.</span>

The FPS part is slower than many fps games and is weaker weapon wise, the rpg element is pretty strong although the customization is limited to chosing your unit, buying items, and uping 4 stats. The RTS part lacks micro for the commander as he just order&apos;s units and acts like a scout/buffer. The fighting part is fast paced although rock paper scisor oriented. However these lesser parts add up to a solid whole. So it can&apos;t be compared to any one game as well it&apos;ll fall sort in that games catagory so it&apos;s in it&apos;s own field. It&apos;s a great game if you like team work. The only problem is the small community.

But you get better with every game and more and more familiar with the complexity of the game mechanics and the fighting system. Playing as a &quot;soldier&quot; on the battlefield is totally different from playing a commander. You can even be a builder (yes, these weak little busy guys, you probably know from many rts games). If the team works well together, you will have a very unique game expirience. On the other hand, this is also the only downside: if you have a bad team, especially with a commander, who dont know what do to, it can get a little bit frustrating. Cause its very hard to run around the map and try to solo everyone. Its all about the team. But this is a problem, that all team focused games (Team Fortress 2, Battlefield) have to deal with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/savage-2-a-tortured-soul/user-reviews?user_review_id=415888">Expand</a></span>

I was expecting something more like World of warcraft. But the online experience is quite frustrating. There&apos;s a huge lack of servers and those available are totally laggy. The playability is a complete pain. I don&apos;t recommend this.</span>

                                        <span> This game is absolutely incredible. The graphics are good for a RTS/FPS game. The lag in multiplayer is so low, its really amazing. When i join somebody&apos;s server and i have no lag it makes the game so much more fun. Also i like how the demo system works. It gives you a trial of the game, then you can just activate it really fast without hardly in work.</span>

This is the best game I have ever played, and I&apos;m immensely disappointed that it wasn&apos;t more popular and that there won&apos;t be a Savage 3. Combining a both first person shooters with an RTS game like Starcraft made for the only game that I have ever seen that actually pulls in people from public matches and makes you feel like you&apos;re ACTUALLY ON A TEAM together.
<br>
<br>With games like Call of Duty, Team Fortress 2, and even with LoL/DoTA2 you don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re on a team when playing with random people. You&apos;re rather unco-ordinated, you honestly don&apos;t care what the rest of your teammates are doing, and you just play the game according to what you see. There&apos;s hardly any communication and forethought in the actions you take, but with this game having a commander completely draws the player into an experience that makes you *Think* about the actions you take and take it into consideration with the team.
<br>
<br>The mechanical gameplay of the First Person is amazing, and the hit detection is well made and well balanced. Being the commander is easily one of the best gaming experiences there is, where the units being human controlled make the experience incredibly unique as they aren&apos;t pre-programmed, and behave uniquely in ways that AI units could never come close to emulating.
<br>
<br>I think that it was a little before its time. If this game were to be re-relased with the current culture of gaming that we have favoring MoBA games, it would probably be one of the most popular games on the market. Add in a matchmaking system that allows you to queue as either a commander or a player, and online rankings, and this game would be the highlight of the decade.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/savage-2-a-tortured-soul/user-reviews?user_review_id=3283515">Expand</a></span>
