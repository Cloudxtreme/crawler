I would rate BS1 in my all time top 5 games and it is head and shoulders above the newest installment.  Most of what made BS1 great is not found in BS4.  Tthere were only several brief moments in the game when I actually felt like I was playing a series that I loved every minute of previously, even BS3.  The story never grabbed me and pulled me in at anytime, I didn&apos;t care about the other characters and worst of all I found the game a complete chore to play.

Another dip into 3D and another disappointment. This game was rushed out, probably a couple of months too early. The environments are large, empty, and few in numbers. Take the Vatican, Salami Factory and Turkish hotel locations - only two mute guards at the Vatican, two men at the factory, and only a &quot;busy&quot; receptionist and waiter in the hotel. They&apos;ve just stuck in the bare mininum to get through the game, and it looks very poor and unrealistic - adventure games released 10 years ago gave more depth than this. And the cause is probably the 3D - that aspect means the locations *have* to be bigger, and take a *lot* more work to get right in terms of content. They just haven&apos;t done it. The player rewards are woeful. Take the final scenes. Without giving away any spoilers, the ending is possibly the worst ending to any game I have ever played, and even if you fail to save the day you don&apos;t even get a cutscene showing what terrible events occur, just another 3 minute long loading screen and right back into the very last &apos;puzzle&apos;. They couldn&apos;t even be bothered to put in a real enemy for you to be fighting against. The (often) lengthy conversations are poorly done - just the same frozen viewpoint of the two characters for minutes on end. Farenheit showed how a 3D game can keep lengthy conversations interesting. Revolution should stop worrying about trying to turn BS in a role playing game in 3D (which requires a ridiculous spec of graphics card - for nothing more than a Point and Click game with very average graphics that still runs slow for 90% of people!) with dodgy control, and get back to what made it so engaging in the first place - the art of storytelling and creating atmosphere. And they&apos;ll only manage that by going back to 2D.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/secrets-of-the-ark-a-broken-sword-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=698173">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On the plus side you do get to see Nico and George again, but other than that, it fails in so many ways.  Graphics are mediocre.  The story line premise doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense.  It is clear that the game developers ran out of money or time, so they decided to ship the game with no real closure.
<br>
<br>Even plain walking around (which you will do PLENTY of) is painful since the camera angles change unexpectedly so you start travelling in a different direction.
<br>
<br>I do not recommend this game.  I would put it in the same category as indiana jones and the crystal skull (the movie).  Just pretend that #4 of both franchises doesn&apos;t exist.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/secrets-of-the-ark-a-broken-sword-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=4209338">Expand</a></span>

The plot is told well, and got me a lot more involved with the game. Although some of the puzzles seemed unnervingly hard, I never felt the urge to use a walkthrough, so the difficulty level is just right. It just seemed as though a lot of care had gone into the game, it is quite long with lots of detail and memorable characters. It is also pretty funny at times.

The puzzles were pretty better than in BS3, and voice acting was amazing. The story was a bit forgetable, but still awesome. But the &quot;eeeh&quot; ending, and Anna-Marria thing etc. were a bit....bad. Still, a must-play :) :) :)</span>

A shame as it felt better than BS3 but it just jars so badly that I can&apos;t be bothered to get through the first part of the story - life&apos;s too short. If you want to play a game as good as BS1 or even 2 then wait a year or two until you&apos;ve forgotten enough of the answers to the problems and play them again.</span>
