Personally I wouldn&apos;t buy this game again after playing through it once.  Doubt I&apos;ll bother grinding through the the other story lines.  In summary:  Pretty looking game but short and repetitive as hell.</span>

<br>&quot;The Cave&quot; is a VERY old school adventure game. In fact, Ron Gilbert designed it as a personal homage to his first 1987&apos;s LucasFilm game: &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;.
<br>
<br>&quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; was a very simple game where three characters had to do a concatenation of puzzles with almost no plot or dialogue and lots of backtracking. The magic of that game wasn&apos;t its gameplay but its amazing ambiance (at the time) and creepy humor, and that&apos;s exactly what you&apos;ll find in &quot;The Cave&quot;. No more, no less.
<br>
<br>If you liked &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; with all its flaws, then you&apos;ll also like Gilbert&apos;s new work. Just don&apos;t expect to play &quot;Monkey Island in a different setting&quot;, because it&apos;s not that kind of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3390415">Expand</a></span>

Also while the game is charming I feel a bit miffed about the secret (and I mean secret) alternate endings, not to mention the game&#x2019;s short length (6 hours). Thankfully the game isn&#x2019;t expensive so if you&#x2019;re a Ron Gilbert fan, it might be worth a look, especially if you can grab it when it&#x2019;s on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3285388">Expand</a></span>

The visuals are for the most part quite nice and there are some lovely colorful levels in the game. The characters are quite nice and their stories are interesting enough and the narrator is a nice touch that could have been used a bit more in my opinion. Now the gameplay is a mix between platforming and puzzles with emphasis on the puzzles. The platforming works fine though the control can be a little bit wonky. The platforming is however never really challenging and is mostly there to spread out the puzzles. The puzzles in the game are quite similar to the puzzles in old adventure games. So you are basically combining objects with each other and all that other stuff associated with point and click adventure games.
<br>
<br>The puzzles in the game are for the most part quite reasonably challenging even though  there are some far fetched puzzles here and there. Some puzzles did contain a little bit to much running back and forth which got a little bit annoying though. I also found myself stuck in the game at one point since i didn&apos;t know that each character had a special ability. But hey the game might have told me about it and i somehow managed to miss it.
<br>
<br>Now the biggest flaw of this game in my opinion is the way the game handled the different characters and their individual levels and stories. Each character has their own individual level that is based upon their story. And these levels were my favorite levels in the game. These levels were also the only levels which really made you use the characters special ability which was a nice change of pace from simply jumping around in the character neutral levels.
<br>
<br>So after finishing the game for the first time (took me around 5-6 hours) i wanted to play the remaining four character levels. But to do that i would be forced to replay every damn character neutral level to get to the levels that i wanted to play. To experience all the seven different character level you would have to replay the campaign 3 times. And the emphasis on puzzles in this game makes replaying the character neutral levels and solving puzzles you already know the solutions for a real chore.
<br>
<br>I cant understand why the would design the game in such a way and it only serves to hid away a substantial part of the games contents behind filler nonsense. And since i am complaining i should mention that the way the handled multiple ending felt a bit forced.
<br>
<br>In the end i thought that this game was quite average. I am not the biggest fan of these kind of adventure games (even though i can appreciate their charm) so its possible that someone more fond of the genre would appreciate it more and be more forgiving to its short comings. I did however have some fun with it and the game is by no means a bad way to spend a small amount of cash for if you got your eye out for it.it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3167603">Expand</a></span>

<br>On a more personal note, I am a huge fan of Ron&apos;s MI1 and MI2, backer of Reds, I watched and read most or maybe even all his interviews and opinions on games, and need for some kind of innovation in adventure gaming  and this was such a huge disappointment... I understand that production values were nowhere near Grim Fandango or TLJ level, so it was silly to expect real modern adventure game, but their priorities and changes they made to classic adventuring formula seem totaly wrong, unncesesary or not done properly. It has mechanics like &quot;only one item per character&quot; that beside being used in couple of puzzles add nothing to the rest of the game except artificially bloating playing time by adding lots of boring and usless traversing. The fact that there is a ton of fedex type puzzles only makes it worse. An inventory shared between all characters wouldn&apos;t have made things harder like Ron were saying, it would&apos;ve make things easier! Not to mention provided additional opportunity for humor.  Platforming they added does its job and ok for the most part  but really, it is simply an additional mildly annoying obstacle to making progress. Puzzles themselves are usually pretty obvious, the only actual problem that takes time is to walk back and forth executing the solution. And there is abolutely no reason from the gameplay point of view for platforming at all! There are no fast trine-like physics puzzles, no fun arcade parts to diversify the flow of the game, no combat of course, it is not used in any meaningful way (except for couple of tinytiny moments). The way it is, it would&apos;ve been much more comfortable to simply move characters with classic &quot;click to move around  doubleclick to move to next screen&quot; fashion.
<br>
<br>Background music is sadly non-existant. Usualy its just &quot;cavey&quot; ambient noises. Occasional tunes do pop up when its appropriate, but all your running around will be done in near silence.
<br>
<br>Characters are mutes, and amount of dialogue roughly equals to an average FPS. Having a narrator helps, but narrator doesn&apos;t try to make characters deeper, or provide additional insigth or context to what is happening, usually he is just a vehicle for delivering occasional jokes.
<br>
<br>Graphics are nice, but nothing breathtaking, a cave is a cave... If it was an ordinary adventure game that would be fine, but considering amount of manual running around the same places and 2D nature of the game, I wish they&apos;d make scenery more diverse. Story... Well you know that there is none. All you have are collectible Psychonauts style pictures, except in Psychonauts they provided an additional insight into living talking characters and here they are all that you&apos;ll ever have.
<br>
<br>Overall its fine for a puzzler, but disappointing nonetheless.. Note that I completely skipped describing the good parts and there definitely are some, like timetraveller bits, and occasional great animation, and some good puzzles, etc. It is far from being a 1/10 game.

I really like the idea of several different characters with their own back story and the execution, presentation and puzzles overall is brilliant. Only minor quibble is the control precision, but that&apos;s easily overlooked. I just wish they could make more frequent and larger scale games of this type. All in all, cool and very funny adventure game!

Don&apos;t expect a Monkey Island because its from Gilbert, and keep in mind this is a $15 game.
<br>
<br>With that being said the game is pretty bold in its mix of traditional point and click adventure aspects and jump and run mechanics. You choose 3 out 7 characters, who all come with their unique abilities, background story and areas. You move around by climbing ladders and ropes. There are common areas where you need all three characters to solver puzzles, and specific character areas that need the respective character&apos;s ability to be solved. The puzzles are never too easy or hard, but need some critical thinking. The game is not very linear, which will catch many modern gamers by surprise, who are used to heavy handed scripted playing. The humor is dark and entertaining, so are the individual stories behind the characters. The art and mood is amazing in this game. There are also countless references to old Lucasarts Adventure games, such as the Grog machine and Chuck the plant. The annoying part of this game is that you often times have to walk back and forth to solve a puzzle, which is compounded by the fact that you sometimes need to move three characters to a specific location. A character summon function would have been neat here. But that doesn&apos;t ruin a excellent gaming experience for a low price. Kudos to Gilbert for trying something money, I hope younger gamers will appreciate it despite lacking the heavy scripting from newer games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2917945">Expand</a></span>

The humour is not great, and feels forced. The game looks good but has little replay value. I finished it the first time in 3 hours. Far too short of expectations. The promised cave &quot;world&quot; is but a few character-oriented puzzle rooms.</span>

I&apos;m grew up with maniac mansion, monkey island and all the great lucasarts stuff. The Cave is different according to these old games, but its quite as funny as they were. The most puzzles are well done, they could&apos;ve been a bit harder to solve, but it was okay. For some people maybe its harder if they dont have much experience in doing adventure games. Backtracking is one of the things, the press most argues about. I really don&apos;t know why. Backtracking was quite normal in the good old days. How long i ran through the forest in Monkey Island 1. I love that, Maybe u see something u missed before or some details  the graphics  art style is awesome... not as detailed as some other games like &quot;trine 2&quot;, but too many details would kill the cave&apos;s atmosphere anyway.  There are problems with gamepad controls for me. I think there is a little bit of input lag. But its ok as well.
<br>
<br>To make it short: I love the game, its humor, the voice of the cave... and all the funny things u are going through with the lovely characters. Thanks Ron  Double Fine. Hope to see more things coming </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2929772">Expand</a></span>

Each character&apos;s backstory is lovingly crafted and though sometimes lacking in morals - they are never lacking in charm. Some clunky controls and a few graphical hiccups will not detract from the experience. Well deserving of a place in your game collection.</span>

                                        <span>I really had a blast. It&apos;s no Monkey Island for sure, but it is a nice Mix between Last Vikings and Maniac Mansion, with a nice soundtrack and top notch voice work. Every of the seven character has it&apos;s own part of The Cave. As you can choose three at a time, this means that you will encounter new stuff in the first three playthroughs, which gives The Cave some nice replay value.</span>

                                        <span>It&apos;s a wonderful game. I think of it as a mix of an adventure game with &quot;The Lost Vikings&quot; gameplay (or maybe Trine, if you&apos;re younger). The possibility of selecting 3 from 7 characters with distinct abilities is the main positive thing about the game, because it gives you a lot of possibilities. I just think the &quot;Cave&quot; humour could be a little less forced.</span>

Each character has its own unique feature (the Adventurer has a hook on a rope, the Hillbilly can breathe underwater, the Knight&apos;s is invincibility whilst standing still, the Monk&apos;s is Telekinesis, the Scientist can hack computers, the Time traveller can teleport through some obstacles, and the Twins can clone themselves). Puzzles are of moderate difficulty but mostly logical. No inventory management (each char can carry only one object at a time) and some back-tracking (not too bad though). Obviously there&apos;s some replayability as it takes at least 3 play-throughs to experience all 7 characters unique levels. The &quot;voice of the cave&quot; adds some humor. Playable via keyboard or controller. I don&apos;t usually like platform games very much, but this was better than I thought it would be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=4751861">Expand</a></span>

Even if you take Lucas Arts games, the ones he worked on are nothing compared to, say, The Day of the Tentacle or Grim Fandango. Even if his idea was used for TDotT, it was Tim Schafer who brought it to realization. Now Tim brought Mr. Gilbert in... and it was a mistake. Double Fine was producing vivid original games, it was on a streak that felt like it&apos;s not going to end. And then came Ron Gilbert and ended it. I hope he won&apos;t be leading any more projects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2948538">Expand</a></span>

Puzzles are not hard at all once you figure the basic rules, don&apos;t expect a Maniac Mansion-like challenge. In fact, comparing this to Monkey Island or Maniac Mansion makes no sense, this is much more linear and action-based. More importantly, while it doesn&apos;t invent anything, this is kind of an unique game with its own unique style, something that you&apos;ll only get from a craftsman like Mr. Gilbert.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2932744">Expand</a></span>

People who give this game low scores give them only because it&apos;s not an ADVENTURE GAME. It never meant to be!
<br>
<br>It HAS adventure elements, like items you can pick up and use with other items in the world. Thanks to this, it has the feeling of a adventure game, but it&apos;s NOT an adventure game. It&apos;s a puzzle game. People say it has no story (it has), no dialogs (it has!) and no adventuring (IT HAS!!!). I don&apos;t understand, they were expecting a point n click classic adventure game? This is NOT the Double Fine Adventure!
<br>
<br>Now, about the story: while it doesn&apos;t have a one long story that you unveil, it has many short ones, with funny and absurd characters (I loved the ridiculous miner, who in his anger constantly throws dynamites at you while a the same time demands you bring him his mining carts back), Double Fine style all the way. But personally I think that there is one, continuous story in this game. It&apos;s the exploring of the Cave itself. The Cave is a really interesting place, with many various locations and simple, but fun puzzles, and going deeper and deeper makes you feel like you&apos;re in a real, authentic old cave.
<br>
<br>The characters you meet remind me of puppets. I think that was the goal, and it works brilliantly. Sometimes it feels like you&apos;re participating in a puppet theater, a very witty and funny one. They look very cartoony and small, their animations are stiff and unnatural, like someone is really pulling the strings. Even their jaws move only up and down (mostly, I think).
<br>
<br>As for the Cave, it just talks trash, tries to amuse you or make you laugh, but it tries too hard in my opinion, thus failing in doing so. But at least it isn&apos;t annoying and talks very rarely. Overall, it&apos;s good that it talks, it gives the game more charm, even if what it says isn&apos;t really funny.
<br>
<br>The puzzle and adventure parts are brilliant too. The fact that you can pick up and use items adds so much more possibilities, and combined with your three folks working together, the puzzles are very interesting and fun to solve, and often not that obvious.
<br>
<br>After reading a few reviews and seeing rather mediocre scores, I wasn&apos;t expecting this game to be good at all, decent at best. But the hell, is it GOOD. It&apos;s brilliant. I give it only 8/10, because of it&apos;s size, but if it would be a full, 49$ product, I would give it a 10/10, just like Psychonauts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2954442">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Visually pleasing.
<br>
<br>Some humor, but not that great.
<br>
<br>Virtually 0 replayability. In fact, having 7 characters, I felt FORCED to replay. That ship part is... outright annoying.
<br>
<br>I must say I was disappointed, but I&apos;m giving it a 7.</span>

<br>good return for 15$
<br>although only 1 GB
<br>so many levels
<br>you choose 3/7 characters each with specific special ability
<br>and you will come across corresponding levels
<br>I chose randomly 3 hilbert,adventurer&amp; twins
<br>the interesting thing is  the cave talks ;he is funny humour is unique to this game and everyone will love it;he&apos;s ;got very good voice unlike bit:trip runner which I personally dont like
<br>lots of levels;took me 2-3 sessions to complete
<br>You control 3 characters ,you have to think of their spl ability &amp; act accordingly
<br>Make al 3 work in order to solve puzzles
<br>I m gonna try with other set of characters
<br>Overall is a good,unique experience
<br>and conclusion there is a message
<br>
<br>+ve:good visuals
<br>cleverly designed game levels make you thinking
<br>
<br>-ve: control movement bugs
<br>you have to play 3 characters together back &amp; forth which makes the game lengthy</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3899770">Expand</a></span>

<br>- You have 7 characters to control, but 4 of them are useless. That&apos;s a design flaw that is probably not an actual flaw but a dick move. A trick to make you believe in its replay value. Which is fake. Not there. Smells of a swindle.
<br>
<br>- After a promising start, the meat of the game becomes incessant, looooong back and forth runs. By multiple characters. What a bore ! It would be even if the Cave had decent controls. Here lies the reason why I didn&apos;t even bother finishing my playthrough. Crooks, I mean... guys, please stop making your games artificially longer with cheap tricks such as these. You fail.

Of course looking at it this way will cause you to pass up a fun little adventure game that is well worth your time. You will not find anything groundbreaking or extremely innovative with The Cave but you will have some fun while playing it and get a good laugh as well.
<br>
<br>The storyline of The Cave is a simple one and in some ways is an aspect of the game that is truly lacking. Of course the game does explain the mysterious cave to the player and yes, it is a talking cave. Beyond this we are are only told enough so that the storyline makes sense. Even then it&#x2019;s still a little crazy. It wouldn&#x2019;t be an issue not to have a storyline for an inanimate object but the game gives the cave a voice and personality so there must be more behind it. The game does cover this up to a point by making the cave have a great sense of humor, so in that respect it&#x2019;s okay. As for the characters storylines, well they are present to a degree and the game does give you glimpses into them via paintings on the cave walls. A game like this doesn&#x2019;t require a massive, complicated storyline but it would be nice to know a little more about the characters. We do know that they are there for adventure and there are a bunch of them though.
<br>
<br>Now as for the actual characters the game does give you some variety. Starting out there are seven characters(eight if you include the twins as 2 instead of a unit) and the player has to choose three of them to play the game with. Of the seven we have the Knight, the Hillbilly, a Time Traveler, the Scientist, an Adventurer, the Twins, and the Monk. Each of these characters has their own storyline while playing and an ability that must be used to complete their part. The game sets the play-through around the three characters you choose at the beginning of the game so choose wisely. Certain combinations of characters can actually allow you access to certain areas that would otherwise be off limits on that particular play-through. For instance if you are playing as the Knight in his &#x201C;stage&#x201D; and have the Time Traveler with you then you can send her to an area early and get a funny little cut scene that you normally wouldn&#x2019;t see. It&#x2019;s small things like this that make the game fun for multiple runs.
<br>
<br>Beyond the small story there is actually a lot of fun to be had running around in the cave and solving puzzles. The entire premise of the game is based around each character having a &#x201C;stage&#x201D; and you must use their power to progress through puzzles in that area. The puzzles themselves were fun and sometimes clever but nothing too difficult. Some of them are as simple as throwing a stick of dynamite, while others required some time hopping between areas to achieve the solution. Either way they were fun to play around with and sometimes hilarious when something went wrong. The only problem is while playing around I did sometimes over think the puzzles causing myself a hard time. Every puzzle in the game can be solved without a lot of effort so be sure to not over think them. The only thing you need to solve them is time.
<br>
<br>Spending time in the game was not an issue for me however. The game simply looks and sounds great. The visuals while cartoonish in nature are very well done and bring the game to life with the theme the developers were looking for. All the visuals from the textures on the ground to the characters themselves were top notch for that style of game. The audio for the game was also well done to match the visual style and overall theme. There are a lot of small sounds that you won&#x2019;t notice unless you pay close attention but they add a lot of depth to the gameplay. The music itself is very fitting for each of the characters in their respected levels as well. It makes it very fun to explore each character and see what else you can get yourself into.
<br>
<br>With The Cave being an arcade-ish title I have to say it was very enjoyable for the time I spent playing it. The game played well and I never really found anything that I didn&#x2019;t like about it. Sure I wish there was a little more story to it but what can a person do. Overall I&#x2019;d say that if you have the extra cash and want a arcade like title to play then pick this game up. It will give you more than a few laughs while playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cave-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=6356391">Expand</a></span>
