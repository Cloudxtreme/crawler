The character models are spot on, but the animation is far too robotic, which leads me to believe that not much time had been spent there at all. If Aardman could do the old shorts with claymation and have very lively, animated movements, why are the character animations so terrible here? There&apos;s also the issue that dialogue gets cut off at times for no reason. Frustrating.

<br>Bottom line? Watch the old show, it&apos;s on Netflix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wallace-gromits-grand-adventures-episode-1-fright-of-the-bumblebees/user-reviews?user_review_id=3192804">Expand</a></span>
