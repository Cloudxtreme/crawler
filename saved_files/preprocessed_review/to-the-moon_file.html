To the moon is a sort of game which makes you howl with laughter one moment while making you weep the next. It uses every single pixel on screen to mesmerize you and astonish you as to how much emotion can be portrayed using a 16 bit look. The story takes the supreme precedence in this adventure/RPG game (though there is almost no RPG elements- apart from a very humorous jab at jRPG early in the game). The creator uses the game mostly to paint a wonderful story surrounding love, adventure, life and death. Some might not like it since gameplay takes the back seat, but I assure you that this is the kind of game which makes most of the movies and tv shows look petty. While the gameplay elements are pretty straightforward for anyone to pickup quickly, there are some small challenges along the way concerning the number of moves to complete intermittent  puzzles.<br>The game does falter a little bit towards the end, making use of tedious chasing sequences at one point but that is small enough to be forgiven.<br>All in all this is a game which raises indie gaming to a whole different level in terms of its storytelling and the thoughtfulness of its premise- I might say as good as Braid and Limbo.<br>Do yourself a favor and play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1978790">Expand</a></span>

It borrows from the style of the 16-bit video game generation of yore, and shows the story of a man on his deathbed, who signs up for a program that can help him relive his life in order to achieve his wish.<br><br>His wish?  He wants to go to the moon.<br><br>If you&apos;re anything like me, you&apos;re going through the first two hours of the game, basically at the brink of bawling like a baby (don&apos;t clump me in with those emo kids), with the last thing on your mind having anything to do with the moon.  It&apos;s a complex story, and the culmination point of it seems farfetched until you let the entire story play before you, and you recognize the beauty of it all.<br><br>Let me tell you something.  Beauty is a perfect word to describe it.  The storytelling is masterful, and complex, and charming.  The characters are lovable.  You play as the two scientists who assist the man in the pursuit of his dream, and often act as the comic relief for emotionally tense situations.  Other times, they show as glimpses of characters who themselves have dark and secreted away emotions and struggles.<br><br>The graphics show how aesthetic and detailed something can be when you focus that graphical attention on a style which is otherwise considered to be outdated.  If you can masterfully produce something in 16-bit graphics, then you can see it as masterful as someone who built a complicated 3D system.  The difference is that you have a much harder time showing a masterful presentation in 3D that ages well, since the medium is constantly being updated.  The odd place of this current-day 16-bit presentation looks easily as masterful as the most detailed presentations of 16-bit classics.<br><br>In short, I loved it.<br><br>So, here&apos;s the part where I provide some criticism.  The game looks very much like an old turn-based RPG classic.  It plays like a point-and-click adventure, and much of the actual &apos;gameplay&apos; is a set of sliding puzzles.  The intent, it seems, is to focus much of the attention of the player to be on the story (which, as previously stated, is a strong point worthy of being pointed toward), but after all is said and done, one wonders about how necessary it was to have the title called a &apos;game&apos;.<br><br>Could the presentation have survived without the gameplay mechanics?  The sliding puzzles, certainly, but one of the best things about a video game over, say, a book or a movie, is that you have the ability to interact with the world to get the most out of the storyline.  There were a few things that I admired that could have only been done through use of gameplay- notes which get altered by untrustworthy narrators, and the like, but beyond that much of the exploration is required to progress the game, and the interactivity between the player and the environment is slim.<br><br>In fact, the game &apos;reads&apos; much like a visual novel.  You do macguffins, and it makes story happen.  But they jokingly acknowledged it several times, and clearly made an effort to keep it at a necessary minimum.  To be fair, the turn-taking RPG itself stuff itself with macguffin&apos;d tasks and elements.  I dare you to tell me that the actual &apos;gameplay&apos; in a Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior game is good.  Enjoying the battle element out of a turn-taking RPG is like liking calculators and Excel spreadsheets for the thrilling gameplay.  You do a thing, which makes you feel like you&apos;re progressing.<br><br>But, gamewise, is there a better way to include gameplay into a title which wants to focus as much as possible onto the story?  Because of the detective-like elements of gameplay, and the articulation of the scientists would be better utilized with some of the elements which made Phoenix Wright into a game.  I mean, sure, I don&apos;t know anything more about law than I did when I started playing the games, but I sure as hell felt like a lawyer.  Some of the clues to the mystery of the man you are helping might be better solved if a gameplay mechanic forced the player to draw some of the conclusions itself.<br><br>The end of the game was a clear and complete story of the man whose life you explored.  But what is opened to you is a very interesting world, prime with opportunity for further exploration.  So long as the charm of the two scientists is not over-explored early on, I expect myself to be able to enjoy the sequels that the game&apos;s conclusion certainly seemed to be hinting at.  Hopefully I can man the hell up before I play them.<br><br>Extra Note:  I want to give special commendation to the game To the Moon for including a character who has special needs successfully into the story.  I won&apos;t be too specific, since every single thing about this game should be experienced through the game itself, but all I want to say is that it was amazing to get a realistic human characterization without getting the &apos;a very special episode&apos; feeling.

I even cried by its end, because it actually made me ponder my personal values. How many games truly manage to have that effect on a person? But the writing can often be hit or miss. It tries too hard to be funny when it shouldn&apos;t, an issue often linked to the character of Dr. Neil, who in many scenes crushes the mood that the game tries so hard to set. The soundtrack and art design are clearly lovingly built, and are a big plus.<br><br>Really, To the Moon is worth playing, but feels bipolar. It feels bipolar in how it is trying to weave a complex tale that requires so much thinking and emotional investment from the player, and at the same time goes out of its way to make vomit jokes. It&apos;s a shame that it doesn&apos;t take itself more seriously. The post-ending also feels direly unnecessary, presenting a confusing and self-serving commercial hook that only dampens the impact of the real ending.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2064034">Expand</a></span>

<br>-The soundtrack is excellent as well. It may not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea, but I really like how Gao uses one song as a motiff that perfectly fits the story at hand.
<br>
<br>-The graphics are a throwback to the 16 bit era, although to me it looked like an early PSX rpg game since the color palette exceeds the 256 on screen palette of the SNES. The graphics are really lush, and fit the story&apos;s purpose. I really hate it when people say that retro 16 bit graphics are bad. That is just a stupid notion. Would you say that Picasso&apos;s paintings are bad? Of course not. It&apos;s just a different style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3473553">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>To be completely honest, i was just expecting an everyday RPG that almost everyone tries to create. I ended up getting a heart felt masterpiece. Best classic rpg ive played in a long tong Im hoping that freebird games actually consider the possibility of creating more games like this and or if not just make more games with our two lovable characters the good DRs.</span>

For me, the lack of gameplay wan&apos;t a bad thing because I get to spent more time thinking about what&apos;s going on with the characters. If you say that the game had no emotional impact on you, then you are inhuman. I personally liked the writing; there was a good balance of cheesy, but entertaining, jokes and serious dialogue. The thing is that if you pride gameplay above all else, and care little for a game&apos;s story, then you won&apos;t get much out of To The Moon.

It takes even more courage to limit your gameplay because of that same focus. To the Moon apparently has a lot of courage. Is the story of To the Moon strong enough it to stand on its own? Short answer, yes. Yes it is.
<br>
<br>Now, let me get something out of the way. No, this game does not have revolutionary graphics. No, this game lacks gameplay mechanics of a traditional adventure RPG. There is no combat. There is no leveling up. To the Moon is not that kind of game. I wouldn&apos;t even call it a game, really. To the Moon is an interactive story. And it was intended to be. And yet I can&apos;t explain the story without ruining it. This is an experience that cannot be told. If you want to understand why this story is worth telling, you&apos;re going to have to pay your money and watch it unfold with your own eyes. The soundtrack to this game is also extremely emotional and is one of the more memorable scores. Piano segments seriously brought me to tears at some points in time, simply because of the pure emotion behind every keystroke. Every song matched the mood it was trying to portray. I have never really been moved by a soundtrack quite like this one. Now, unfortunately, there are some flaws that keep this game from being perfect. Some parts of the game have pointless comedic one-liners from Dr. Neil Watts, who can ruin a mood in an instant. He makes a wisecrack in almost every scene. Mind you, there are some times when his interactions are actually needed and enjoyed. But the number of bad interactions outweigh the good. However, I must say that his personality straightens out in the final half of the game, so he&apos;s not all bad. Also, the puzzles in the game seem to be quite out of place. I don&apos;t think the game was extremely hindered by them, but at the same time they shouldn&apos;t have really been there. All in all, To the Moon is not a game. It&apos;s a story. It&apos;s an experience. And what an experience it is. There are a couple hiccups down the road, but the sheer amount of emotion put into this game&apos;s story and music completely makes up for the flaws of the game. There are few original games out there nowadays, and I&apos;m ecstatic to say that To the Moon is an experience worth enjoying. You&apos;ll laugh, you&apos;ll cry, and you&apos;ll most definitely fall in love with this game just as I have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2959030">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve cryed four times during this game. I can&apos;t tell at which parts whitout spoiling it, but, what I can say is basically I suffered something very similar to what the main character did. I will argue for days with people that say that &quot;To the Moon&quot;s story lacks of depth or originality. George R.R. Martin himself sayi that, these days, is not about telling a original story, but about telling a story in a way that has never been told. &quot;To the moon&quot; told me a story in a way that I was never told before. I would not call To the Moon as a game precisely, it&apos;s more of an interactive novel, with a few puzzles, very simple ones by the way. To the moon is a piece of art for me. It&apos;s basically a story told in a very beautiful way. I was sincerelly touched by this &quot;game&quot; and if you ever lost someone dear to you, I promisse you will be touched too.
<br>
<br>This is currently 3 bucks at Steam. Please don&apos;t draw yourself away from this game just because somepeople are complaining about graphics or not allowing themselfs to be touched by simple things. Anyway, that&apos;s my opinion </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3048290">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a game that made a cynic like me consider believing in love, if only for a moment.
<br>
<br>The text-boxes and pixelated graphics may be a turn-off to some, but let me assure you that this game was more immersive that many of the AAA titles I&apos;ve played. The writer&apos;s craft here is truly astounding. Lines of text aren&apos;t wasted, effects are always used with a purpose. I played the entire experience in a single sitting and was engrossed from start to finish.
<br>
<br>The story is about two people from an agency that can enter and alter people&apos;s memories. They provide this as a service to the dying to give them the memories (and make them plausible) of whatever their life&apos;s ambition was. The dying man in this case has no idea why, but since he was a boy he wanted to go to the moon. What seems like a typical boyhood dream becomes a story of trauma, life-long love, and an exploration of the human psyche. But it does all of this without getting preachy or keeping a single tone. Through the game you&apos;ll laugh at its surprisingly varied humor, you&apos;ll feel like shutting down the game because of the sorrow, and you&apos;ll be on the edge of your seat for the ending sequence as you struggle with very real questions about your obligation to the dying man whose head you are inside.
<br>
<br>To the Moon is a great emotional ride, and even if like me you only take the ride once, you&apos;ll remember the experience for a long time to come. I myself am writing this review a year after having played it, but its impact on me is a fresh now as it was then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3934527">Expand</a></span>

Certainly not the best GAME I&apos;ve ever played, it probably could have been done in movie form and had just as much of an emotional impact. All in all, it was very sad, and the soundtrack is definite fire.</span>

However, this is the issue I had at the start and probably some gamers are complaining or might complain: this isn&apos;t really a game, but a piece of art, and some people might not like this kind of &quot;games&quot;, although it&apos;s mostly a  &quot;2 sided&quot; fight which nobody will win and, personally, I don&apos;t care who is right, as long as we enjoy the software, game or art that is. With that big detail, my biggest complains on the game are mostly three: dialogue, length, and replay value. Now, the game has a very well told story (minus some issues to understand), but I&apos;m probably not alone when I say that the dialogue of the 2 characters, for the most part, are unnecessarily funny, and I mean unnecessary. Sometimes the characters tend to put on jokes on jokes that really won&apos;t make you laugh, but just facepalm thinking &quot;this wasn&apos;t really needed&quot;. The problem here is that the unnecessary funny dialogue RUINS the atmosphere, which is very serious and sometimes even dark, and doesn&apos;t help at all, luckily the story hooks you in so you&apos;ll easily ignore those dialogues and focus on the plot. The length of the game also is very short, clocking in about 4-5 hours tops of gaming to reach the end...not a big deal if it wasn&apos;t that other games like this that can last much more (like visual novels). Also there isn&apos;t many puzzles (and a small action scene) in this game and that means that there aren&apos;t obstacles stopping you at all. This issue can be a big problem, especially when we can find flash games that lasts for double the time, but it&apos;s also unfair to compare games of different genres. Still, hope for some more length...especially when there&apos;s also issues with the replay value. Now, the game isn&apos;t costy, which means the cost won&apos;t stop people, but the game has almost no replay value because, unfortunely, there aren&apos;t many choices to do in the game: the story is EXTREMELY linear and, unless I&apos;m wrong, there is no other ending. Add the 4-5 hour length, you&apos;ll easily get a good &quot;game&quot; but that probably won&apos;t be played again for a while, which is a pity because adventure games and story driven games (visual novels, again), have at least more than one ending, which gives us more longevity and more ways to experience a story. I&apos;m still giving a 8 because not only it was a very touching game and a bitter yet sweet story, but also because the concept is &quot;kinda&quot; original and I can&apos;t wait to see this concept amplified and to see what other stories we will see like this. It&apos;s still a game to try and to enjoy despite everything: even with flaws, the rest of the game will easily make you enjoy the money spent, even for a short time: it&apos;s definitely a story to enjoy and I can&apos;t find a reason to avoid it or tell people to not play it, so... see you to the moon!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2637199">Expand</a></span>

I haven&apos;t been this emotionally invested in a game since Final Fantasy 7 with the Mass Effect franchise falling closely behind. I will eagerly await the sequel to this game. The gameplay only felt slow to me once, and very shortly at that. I believe that it fit into the game very nicely, it made it so you focused on your surroundings and does not draw away from the story at all. This game falls very nicely in the &quot;games are art&quot; category. Please do yourself a emotional favour and buy this game. I very much doubt you will regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874349">Expand</a></span>

For a game all about sad, the banter between the protagonists is awesome. At first Neil seems like a nut and he&apos;s just there to be retarded, but you find out more about him too and he progressively takes his job more seriously, as Eva takes it less seriously. It all balances out in the end and I really enjoyed the plot twists. Shame it&apos;s so short, only about 4-5 hours.

I got started today and couldn&apos;t stop playing until I got to the end. maybe 7-8 hours later. The interactivity with the characters has some surprising empathetic moments of game play - you might be surprised at your responses. The &quot;horse&quot; scene came closer to conveying &quot;joy&quot; in a game than anything I&apos;ve seen. The music is especially on point in facilitating the story - and the story has complexity that keeps you pushing forward to unravel what&apos;s going on. I don&apos;t give many 8s, but this is very well done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822401">Expand</a></span>

This game will make you enjoy storyline instead of gaming experience. I guess it is what indie game is. I know graphic is old, that makes the game sorta lame in the beginning, but when you start to get in to the storyline, you will be watching a movie.</span>

<br>It takes a person who can appreciate art, who is not overly serious all the time. Some people might not consider it a &apos;game&apos;, because it plays more like older RPGs without the battle system (and just the town exploration/social stuff).</span>

Lately I have been getting sick of the go go go, kill kill kill games mixed with sparse storyline.  This game is pretty much just story with small puzzles along the way.  This game is definitely not aimed at those who are still in the young and invincible mindset, as the primary focus is on mortality and exploring the memories of one man throughout his life, so if you have not yet acknowledged the reality of death and the uncertain, tragic and beautiful nature of life, then they will not enjoy this game.  Ignore the negative reviews, play it alone and with headphones late at night.  I am not the type who cries often, but this title brought tears to my eyes at a few points and really makes you look at your own life, and your own memories of past and future.  How everything was linked together was done in an incredible matter, especially the use of objects to tell a story in how things change, but yet some things always remain the same.  Brilliant game, well written story.  It&apos;s $2.99 on Steam, buy it and support the developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3025260">Expand</a></span>

<br>Alright with that out of the way...
<br>
<br>This game is amazing, the story is by far the best aspect. Accompanied by the music and dialogue you have one of the best adventures you could possibly have in a video game. You&apos;re constantly enthralled, and the simplistic game mechanics only lend your mind even further into what&apos;s going on in the story as opposed to the gameplay. Most people would think this would be a bad thing, simple game play and an emphasis on story. But if you&apos;re a true lover of a great epic such as this then you need to play this game. It has a perfect culmination of flowing storyline that will keep you guessing until the very end.
<br>
<br>It can make you laugh, it can make you cry, and it can make you angry. Everything a good &quot;Role Playing&quot; game should be. Kudos Metacritic for showing me this amazing game. I will never forget it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3154427">Expand</a></span>

The main characters are incredible. You play as two scientists who give dying people a last wish, Joey&apos;s wish is going to the moon, the two main characters have to accomplish that wish. You go into the mind of Joey and starts when he was around 50 and it ends when he was 5. During the story you go taking objects that all have a relationship with his memories, discovering his mysteries, the main reason of his wish of going to the moon, his family problems, and what has to change in his memories so he could go to the moon.
<br>
<br>The controls are pretty obnoxious, you control the game with both keyboard and mouse, but instead of using the &quot;WASD&quot; keys, you use the arrows, and it makes you be in weird  uncomfortable position. The puzzles aren&apos;t challenging, point and click.
<br>
<br>The OST is one of the most beautiful i have ever heard, it has a really deep, sad piano music, that go just in the right moment when its most needed, which make this game more engaging.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3277653">Expand</a></span>

Other than giving you a variety of puzzles, it just gives you one, cliche&apos; puzzle. Also, the game thinks it&apos;s much more funny than it really is. The dialogue is full of easter eggs and jokes which, to be honest, aren&apos;t really that funny. And lastly, the gameplay itself. The gameplay really is not that good. All you do is witness Johnny&apos;s memories, solve cliche&apos; puzzles and find &quot;orbs&quot; throughout each memory.
<br>
<br>But, the story, yes is good. But try to buy this game when it&apos;s on sale, 9.99 seems a little too overpriced for a game like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3783865">Expand</a></span>

This game has it all.
<br>Yet there are some aspects you should know before starting this. It is more like reading a novel then actually playing a game. The few gameplay parts are pretty standard and repetitive Sequences where you are looking for pieces of memories that will let you continue in the story. Which means you are running around ingame trying to interact with every object there is which is maybe the weakest part of the game.
<br>
<br>Yet the story is just brilliant. Exploring the life of a person and finding out which events lead to other events is just so much fun.
<br>
<br>At the end this game left me with a deep sense of satisfaction and some sadness as the story finally unwinds.
<br>
<br>In my opinion this is a must play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3660567">Expand</a></span>

And that&apos;s where the game ultimately succeeds but not without some glaring flaws.
<br>
<br>My only real complaint about the game was that the writer of the story seemed to be intent on breaking immersion at every given opportunity!  This centers largely around the male doctor character of the game (Dr. Neil) and how he has the maturity of a 10 year old.  He&apos;s constantly trying to make jokes which are bad 90% of the time.
<br>
<br>Perhaps this was the writer&apos;s attempt at some levity to what is a deeply moving overall story?  If so, I can do without that levity.  It&apos;s extremely hard to believe (even though we are supposed to suspend belief) that this doctor has the intellectual prowess and dedication to become a scientist capable of helping create, or at least navigate a machine that can enter the memories of the human mind and alter them, all the while he&apos;s making jokes that Bart Simpson would find immature and needless.
<br>
<br>At times this alone almost caused me to stop playing, but I decided to try to shrug this character off and I&apos;m glad I did, because underneath lies a story that pulls on the heart strings like few others in gaming.  If you don&apos;t get a little watery eyed at the game&apos;s final scene you might want to check your pulse.
<br>
<br>Overall it was worth the time put into it, but it&apos;s hard to ignore the glaring fact that Dr. Neil&apos;s immersion breaking lack of humor continuously injects itself into the situation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3675772">Expand</a></span>

Things that initially seem silly become critical and emotional.

The story really delivers this powerful story perfectly in my opinion and as a whole it may be one of the most enjoyable games I&apos;ve ever played purely based on the way it made me feel throughout the entire storyline. If I am looking for more action based games or with more to do this is not a game to play, but if you want a great story above all else this is the game for you. The game delivers many moments of sheer brilliance, my favourite of which may be one that doesn&apos;t strike much for many in when Jonny plays his wife the song &quot;For River&quot;... I can&apos;t help but give this game the full 10/10 as for me its one of the greatest games I&apos;ve ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4872224">Expand</a></span>

So I often find myself felling not to thrilled about a lot of games cause lot of them are essentially the same thing but with much better cosmetics. So I decided to try something radically different and TTM looked interesting. But before everything else I wanted to play something that has SUBSTANCE! And TTM delivers just that. Nice concept, dialog between characters is extraordinary funny. Main story line has depth and is meaningful. Soundtrack blends with main story into a masterpiece. This game is a proof that going back does not mean devolving, but rather picking up some long forgotten elements that not many new games have and building on it a new experiences for gamers.

It was not a very in depth explanation, but for some reason I can&apos;t explain I knew I had to experience this game. When I finally purchased it and launched the game the extremely beautiful theme song started playing and I knew I was in for something special. There is not much game play but it really doesn&apos;t need much the story and the music are the stars of the show. You might ask yourself why does it need to be a game then. It&apos;s because the 16 bit graphics adds to the charm of the characters that might not be there if it was any other way. It&apos;s also a tribute to how well the writing is that so much emotion can be conveyed through these 16 bit sprites. If you appreciate story or music in any way shape or form you owe it to yourself to experience this masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2055635">Expand</a></span>

You have to value storyline over button-mashing, and you probably have to be an adult to appreciate the themes addressed in the story.  A truly remarkable game.

This game looks old, with a visual style resembling the SNES era. If these aspects drive you away from this game, you sir are a fool.

And this is the first and only game that has made me cry. No kidding.

This game transcends &quot;work of art,&quot; supersedes &quot;classic,&quot; and sits somewhere up there in the realm of &quot;masterpiece.&quot; And it does it all without relying on any of the gimmicks or tricks the you see a lot of games get by on nowadays. Sixteen-bit graphics. No stat system. No equipment system. No combat. No player  death. There is nothing to distract you from what this game is really about: One of the best stories I&apos;ve ever read.<br>To The Moon is the story of two doctors who set out to fulfill an old man&apos;s dying wish by changing his memories. Through his mind, they embark on a journey that spans a lifetime, stepping backward through the years from old age to childhood to discover why their patient wants so badly to go to the moon.<br>With breathtaking visuals and a moving musical score, this game is practically guaranteed to put a tear in your eye. This is why I play RPGs. For games like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1980429">Expand</a></span>

Often one gets the impression that the developer included only as much game-play as could be included without holding back the story in some way. Typically this would not be forgivable for the medium, but the game-play that is present is integrated well and in service of an amazing story. The story is told through sometimes funny, sometimes poignant dialogue that combines with simple, yet effective graphics techniques and some of the most memorable and touching music I&apos;ve experienced in games. The way that the story is told and the plot threads are tied together made my 5 hour play-through feel meaningful in a way that no other games do, it felt like it enriched my life. With stronger game-play components that maintain the level of story-telling future incarnations in this series can take adventure games to the next level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1840953">Expand</a></span>

In fact, if this was a film I can imagine it being &quot;eternal sunshine of the spotless mind&quot; kind of great. Yes, it looks like a snes game. Yes the gameplay is poor at best. And yes, I give this a 10/10 purely on it&apos;s ambition. Which consumes and overwhelms everything around it. Negatives be damned, this is a masterwork. A private, intimate, masterwork.</span>

The game lacks in any real game play elements but makes up in an engaging story. The idea is that a company comes to you on your death bed and makes your one dream come true within your memories. In order for them to do that they must follow your memories back as far as they can seeing many major events that occur in ones life. The events are what really pull you in and make for an extremely emotional tale. The random comedy tossed in really helps keep a sad story up-beat but comes to a very good ending. This no name indie title is worth your time and money, and I am looking forward to the next one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1978784">Expand</a></span>

No game I have ever played has came close to matching the story here, it is simply superb. There is very little gameplay in the game, but the little there is you want out of the way as quickly as possible so as to get back to the story. I&apos;ve been touched for life by this game.</span>

However, the story alone is well worth the price-tag - if you&apos;re willing to shell out 12 bucks for a 2-hour movie at the theaters (or 20 for a DVD/Blu-Ray), do yourself a favor and get this game.  But be warned - it will, most likely, cause you to break down into tears at some point.  For me, that moment was when you do finally find out why the old man, Johnny, wanted to go to the moon to begin with.  The moments after that were more of a denouement after that emotional high-point, but seeing as I&apos;ve spent the past day mulling over that moment... well, suffice to say that it works.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2788465">Expand</a></span>

I do have some (hopefully) constructive criticism to share in hopes to make it, or the next episode, an even better game:
<br>
<br>&#x2022; The music was, imo, stellar and was the driving force of the game. I can&apos;t even listen to any of the songs without getting all misty eyed and I&apos;m not ashamed to say it. ^_^ So please keep that the main focus!
<br>
<br>&#x2022; The humor was a welcome surprise and really helped give contrast to the game so you weren&apos;t just constantly having your heart strings pulled to exhaustion. Please consider that balance for the next episode but I encourage the developer to include more &apos;mainstream&apos; references for the non-gamers who will inevitably play your game.
<br>
<br>&#x2022; The pacing of the story and revealing of key plot points was done rather successfully, but I had hoped there was some additional information for those who seek it. Not story line essential info but &apos;extracurricular&apos; information for the ones who were curious about various details. Maybe further flesh-out characters with optional details that are not important to the story line as long as it didn&apos;t risk muddling the flow of the main story.
<br>
<br>&#x2022; The ending wasn&apos;t obvious (thank you) and was one of the most bitter-sweet I&apos;ve experienced. But I admit that the &apos;action sequence&apos; near the end (with the zombies) felt out of place when juxtaposed with the rest of the game. I guess you could say it felt a bit rushed, I felt that too much was happening &apos;behind the scenes&apos; to get to the ending and should have had a bit more player interaction (with the story line itself, not zombies).
<br>
<br>&#x2022; The game was categorized as a &apos;Role-playing game&apos;, which I realize nearly every game you &apos;play&apos; a &apos;role&apos; in the &apos;game&apos;, but most gamers were expecting a bit of what was joked at (final fantasy style battles). To The Moon was more of an interactive story that, frankly, I&apos;d love to see be made into a feature-length movie to both expose more people to this wonderful story but also raise awareness about autism and other personality effecting disorders.
<br>
<br>&#x2022; The game-play was perhaps it&apos;s &apos;weakest link&apos;. I understand there&apos;s only so much that can be done but I did find myself a bit frustrated in a couple points of the game. Finding some of the clues/memory-links felt a bit tedious, maybe adding a visual cue (a glow or sparkle) would help, or incorporate it into the story by adding an in-game &apos;scan&apos; option that the main characters have access to (while they&apos;re in someone&apos;s thoughts) that the player can choose to use if they want to.
<br>
<br>&#x2022; The &apos;flip puzzles&apos; were both difficult and easy. Some were painfully obvious, others I just got lucky. An effort was made to point out the &quot;ideal&quot; number of moves but the puzzles lacked some sort of reset button if you messed up, and was there wasn&apos;t any obvious benefit or prize for actually figuring out the puzzles within the ideal range anyways. The &apos;overall&apos; counter seemed like the only score in the game, yet it was quickly forgotten about near the end of the game. I think these puzzles should have been optional for those who aren&apos;t keen on puzzle games, which brings me to my last point...
<br>
<br>&#x2022; The difficulty of the game, while subjective to everyone, seemed to be all over the map. The casual point-and-click stuff was obviously very easy, the puzzles were hard, the (only) action scene near the end of the game could be very difficult for non-gamers, etc. I would suggest to add in difficulty options, ranging from &quot;Tell me a story...&quot; which automates the action sequences and removes the flip puzzles (leaving only the point-and-click stuff), to some sort of a &apos;hardcore mode&apos; that turns up the difficulty on the puzzles, etc. (for those who like a challenge)
<br>
<br>&#x2022; The graphics may be a turn-off to some, and while those people may be somewhat shallow for judging a book by it&apos;s cover, it would be a good investment to try and improve on them a bit. Personally I enjoyed the 16-bit style but I&apos;m also over 30 years old and grew up on SNES games. I liked how the lack of detail allowed people to, more or less, imagine what the main characters looked like so it was more to their ideals. Perhaps they even linked the likeness of the characters to people they know in their actual lives. So while better graphics would be a boon to the game overall (especially in inspiring interest  probably more sales) don&apos;t let it get in the way of other more important things, like the story  music.
<br>

<br>To the Moon is an eBook. It is more &quot;on rails&quot; than any game I&apos;ve ever seen. There&apos;s virtually no player choice; there&apos;s virtually no interaction with the environment. Basically it&apos;s &quot;Here&apos;s a scene. Enjoy that? Good. Now walk to the next one.&quot; All the gameplay is just a glorified &quot;Next Page&quot; button.
<br>
<br>This game has received &quot;Universal acclaim.&quot; That&apos;s because it&apos;s an outstanding graphic novel. And it really is. I teared up just like everyone else. It&apos;s beautiful without crossing the line into saccharine. It&apos;s thought-provoking and heartfelt and touching. The soundtrack is breathtaking.
<br>
<br>But why was it released as a game?? What about this story makes it best told as a game?? It seems it would have been just as good, if not better, as a novella. Or movie. Or graphic novel. Or play. Or puppet show. Why is it a game??
<br>
<br>I tend to think that a &quot;game&quot; needs to meet a few minimum qualifications. Maybe &quot;It is possible to fail&quot;? Well, here, no, it&apos;s not. Maybe &quot;The player must make choices&quot;? No. No choices are made. Maybe &quot;Some degree of skill is required to progress&quot;? Nope! Pretty much zero.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3820644">Expand</a></span>

Dear Esther and now &apos;To the Moon&apos;.  It&apos;s a mushy love story that you can&apos;t help but become involved - interactive fiction at it&apos;s best.  This &apos;game&apos; will not leave you feeling flat once completed.  Very uplifting, definitely a 10 in my books :)</span>

To The Moon is definitely a MUST BUY! This indie title consists of a four hour adventure that takes you through the mind of an old man named Johnny. You live through his life all over again and experience his hardships through life and why he would like to go to the moon. It&apos;s one of the most emotional experiences you will find in any title on the market. The game play is not very innovative but is used well with the story but the soundtrack and story make up for that. The soundtrack is one of the best I&apos;ve heard this year. (Props to the creators for getting Laura Shigihara for working on this project) To The Moon is worth playing and is up there with titles like Limbo. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if you see it come to Steam, XBLA, or PSN in the near future. Spend that $11 in your pocket right now because this is a masterpiece you rarely see these days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1980971">Expand</a></span>

To the Moon has, I dare say, probably the best written story of all games in existence and it&apos;s not about saving or even changing the world. Accompanied with a beautiful piano soundtrack, you will be led through the life of a dying man who has one last wish: to go to the moon. You play as two doctors, Eva and Neil, that set out on a mission to make his wish come true, though only in his mind. Eva and Neil make a very interesting pair, being extremely funny when they can be and serious when they need to be. It&apos;s unbelievable that in this day and age of high-tech graphics, To The Moon can convey so much feeling through so few pixels. It plays like a point-and-click game and can be controlled completely with the mouse, but this is not recommended. The only slight downside about the game is that some of the puzzles feel unnecessary and flow-breaking. Still, this is just nit-picking. &#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1988653">Expand</a></span>

Can&apos;t really call it a game, it&apos;s much better than that.  It breaks the boundaries.  A strong story proves that great graphics simply aren&apos;t needed - I&apos;m pretty sure I have never been moved to tears by anything resembling 16-bit graphics, this is certainly the first time.  Zero bugs or quirks, the app ran perfectly start to finish in a single sitting (which took around 5-6 hours, with some RL distractions in there).  The pacing is great, the puzzles are not a distraction - the first two or three might be a little difficult, but quickly your brain will become accustomed and you will see solutions before even starting, allowing you to proceed to the story without wanting to shut down the game and come back later due to a difficult puzzle obstacle.  The puzzles just help you to feel like you&apos;re involved somehow, just the right amount for a story like this.  They&apos;re such a small part of the game, it&apos;s better to really look at this as a digital story told using game mechanics.  You should not pass this by.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2085162">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a game with little gameplay but very good story and music. If you have been playing Skyrim or WoW like me, why not take a break and play this indie game, you will certainly not be disappointed.</span>

<br>
<br>This came clearly has a very simple gameplay. You just search for objects, click on them, solve a picture with moving tiles and move on. So it&apos;s more like an interactive movie.The funny thing is that this was something that was absolutely ok for me and the reason is the storytelling.
<br>
<br>This came has such a beautiful, well told story. It is very interesting to follow the clues, think about motives and than realize what&apos;s behind all this. It&apos;s also quite moving. The music is good and fits into the game perfectly. I also think that one of the advantages of this game is the  play time of about 5 hours. I don&apos;t need games which I can play for 50 hours. I need games which trigger emotions and where i can follow the story easily and do not listen to lots of dialogue which is not important after all.
<br>
<br>The game is getting a little bit of track in the end and there are some &quot;action sequences&quot; which were not necessary, but in the end it was worth playing and worth the money. I still think a lot about some of the situations and actions of the main character and his wife. After all this game is a full recommendation for grown up gamers who just want to experience a great story. A story which would be perfect for a movie. Play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/to-the-moon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2147055">Expand</a></span>
