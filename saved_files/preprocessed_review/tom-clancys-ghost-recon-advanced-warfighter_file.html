Despite the good realism the action is intense. One of the most beatiful FPS games. Only thing I miss in the city is civilians.</span>

I really thought it may be like the Ghost Recon&apos;s of yesteryear, but I was wrong. Ghraphics are awesome, but there&apos;s more to a game that what you look at.</span>

<br>2. Tactical command over your squad is a little &apos;iffy, and doesn&apos;t quite work that well. ie the AI isn&apos;t great. For example, trying to get a squaddie to move to a corner and provide cover down a street often results in them walking out into the open street. FSW was much better at getting squaddies to move to covering positions.
<br>3. Overhead tactical map is good. Similar to the previous Ghost Recon one. Gives you the impression that you have great control over you squad, however, its a pity the AI fails to deliver.
<br>4. Cool weapons!
<br>5. The maps are reasonably open compared to FSW, such that the missions are less linear and you can complete it by going down different approaches. Greater replayability and flexibity to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/user-reviews?user_review_id=58483">Expand</a></span>

You might say that I am persistent. Like hell I am. I cheated big time. Way back years ago, I managed to get to the mission where you need to destroy the power station before my frustration with the game overwhelmed my desire to find out what happened next. Now I am all for reality in any computer game I play but for all but the Hardest Core competitive gamers this one is ridiculously difficult and unforgivingly brutal in sending you back to the beginning of missions to continue. I tried many strategies but the AI for all its brilliance is super-uber intelligent and I am sure that even those truly hardcore gamers would have to admit that we are up against an army of super soldiers here. One the other hand as I mentioned I cheated. I did a little research and swapped the local file in the root menu of the game with one that I downloaded which gave me infinite ammo and made me unkillable. Even so I did try to play as if my player could die and indeed I certainly would have died multiple times in each mission despite my efforts.
<br>
<br>But over a few weeks I worked my way through the entire game. Even though cheating did remove an important dimension of the game it gave me the opportunity to complete it and otherwise it would never have happened in a month of Sundays for me. The need to cheat aside I think this game is a masterpiece of detail, realism, movement and atmosphere. One can truly be drawn into the story of a Mexican Military Cue during a North American Leaders Summit. True gravity given to the story line by the death of the Canadian Prime Minister early on as events unfold. Broad open mission areas toping off the finest first person shooter this gamers has ever played. Bar none including the overrated new stuff like Mass Effect 2 which I also just completed. GRAW was a way superior experience. I am now taking the wrapper of GRAW 2 which I purchased when it first came out!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1363173">Expand</a></span>

Two of my friends don&apos;t have 360s and wanted to play the PC but they had outdated systems, according to the syst reqs for GRAW-PC. But if you do have a proper setup, it&apos;s AWESOME.</span>

They included a map where you can place them but there are so many crooks and crannies that again you can&apos;t accurately place them.  So many times they end up standing in the middle of nowhere with no cover.  Enemy AI even on the easiest level is quite tough and will pound you into the ground for the slightest mistake.  I prefer Full Spectrum Warrior&apos;s command structure (3rd person basically) over this First Person type.  Also the saves only in certain places is a definite pain in the rear.  It&apos;s a console game through and through that just didn&apos;t translate well onto the PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/user-reviews?user_review_id=70942">Expand</a></span>

The combat is very interesting, with all the different angles it is very versatile, and the world has diversity, I would highly say that this is superior to any call of duty game, be warned however, the multi player just plain sucks. in GRAW2 however, the multi player is WAY better. Very often you will be completely convinced that you are an elite unit of the united states government.<br>Very fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1470953">Expand</a></span>

I have no idea how someone can get such an excellent game and turn it into such a mess..<br><br>Honestly, this is the worst game I have ever played... It looks great, the graphics are great but it annoys the hell out of you..<br><br>Gameplay.<br><br>Still after several hours of playing I cant get the keys in a configuration that is comfortable. In the first Ghost recon you could send the team exactly were you wanted to. You could tell to drop stance, lay on their knees or stand up. So you could protect them from their low IQ.<br><br>In this one, you cant. they do whatever you do. So, they are exposed and die on you all the time. So you have to do everything and only use them as cover. Now how stupid is that???<br><br>Weapons. You cant drop a weapon, you cant pick up ammo from other weapons even if they are of the same type, the rpgs you pick up show to have a missile on them but once you pick it up it says its empty, (bug), when you throw a grenade you can control the strength you throw it with and it leaves your hand as if you re using a grenade launcher.. etc etc..<br><br>On the hardcore, they tried to make it extremely difficult but the wrong way.. Just as you get into the line of sight of the enemy you get instantly killed. just like that.. Sometimes you are being shot at but the radar doesnt show you were the shots is coming from!! Guys, please.. realise that in reality you have a much wider vision, and hearing and you can understand were the shots come from.. you have to complement for the tunnel vision of gaming somehow.. ok???<br><br>the team.. on the hardcore, the &quot;IQ&quot; /abilities of the enemies goes up.. but your team is just as stupid and useless.. the are being shot at and all they do is shout : Im taking fire!!! Well yes you moron you are in a war what do you expect?? do sthing about it!!<br><br>on Ghost recon 1, you could walk around the enemies and flank tyhem while sending your team the other way.. on this one, no. they had to touch cvause sthing was bothering with you having the ability to think.. So, the map, doesnt get wide enough for you to control the team and as a result if you move too far from the rest you cant seem them on the map. and if you try to move them blindly, they ll go stright into the line of fire and get instantly killed.. nice..<br><br>If you wonder around now, and you get a bit off further away from where the game ecpects you to be, you get a guy on the screen yelling at you that you re leaving the battlefield and they ll shut you down.. and if you insists just a little more you die and start all over again.. nice hah??<br><br>Overall this game is a disaster.. I really liked the first Ghost Recon.. so much so, that I ve been playing for more then 3 years.. On and off of course.. This one? I ll finish, but I dont think I ll ever install it again..<br><br>there s no tactics, no gameplay, and no fun in it..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1441798">Expand</a></span>

If it shipped with dedicated server files, more MP modes and maps, Anti-cheat and a few more MP tweaks, it would have scored a 9 from me. If they would have also went with a more traditional graphics setup (read AA) as well, it would have scored a 10.</span>

While the PC version is a good game, the polish is somewhat diminished when being familiar with the 360 version of the game. I&apos;m aware that this was done by a different studio and with a different engine (unsure why they didn&apos;t just change the compiling destination with the supposed XNA dev kit), but there were many minor differences that took away from the game (ie adding additional respawns in PC co-op, picking up weapons of dead soldiers in PC co-op etc). A great game for sure, if i was only familiar with the PC version I would have given this a score of 9, however being familiar with the Xbox 360 version, I can only give it a 7. If you have a 360, it&apos;s worth the extra $10 to pay for the console version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/user-reviews?user_review_id=387330">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty level I feel is a little bit too high, especially considering the weak save system - and I&apos;m no amateur gamer. There is not many weapons, though you can choose simple upgrades to put on them (grenade launcher, silencer, the like). You cannot use the weapons of fallen enemies, though you will pick up ammo, provided you are using the one weapon they supply ammo for. The AI can be a little clumsy, but overall it gets the job done. GRAW definitely isn&apos;t groundbreaking, but has been a nice, if somewhat frustrating, diversion. I recommend the buy if you have a gaming PC, patience, and determination to get through some very long missions.

<br>You Cant literally become... the other AI&apos;s(like in the first one). so its tougher to keep them safe. So attacking at the same time they attack is very very important. Timing is important you need to kindof protect them by killing enemies when the enemies are distracted with them. The AI is not as dumb (as complaints) so far but I&apos;ve seen them do silly things. So a few times i just told them to stay where they are and let me handle things.
<br>I&apos;m in Normal difficulty. I&apos;d recommend the game. I move the players around on the map (i thought the map didn&apos;t exist or they took it out but they didn&apos;t). You still have that same map. You can move them around away and create distractions. But dont get them too close to fighting they will die.

<br>You must use MLAA and FXAA injection to make the game look good graphically.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4267267">Expand</a></span>

A crosscom and high tech body armor to be exact. While I&apos;m from the circa 2011-2002 Ghost recon crowd, I&apos;d have to say the genre peaked with this. While it isn&apos;t the squad tactical shooter most had hoped for, this is what GRIN/UBISOFT gave us and we had to be content. I railed against this title until I saw where its successor took off to.
<br>
<br>on the day of release, mine came in the mail and I was excited. The troubles came in the form of crashes due to C++ stack errors and eventually it got fixed. I guess the sad thing was, after the games release, UBISOFT sectioned off just a few developers to fix the nagging issues. UBISOFT initially lied about system specs as well and even people with the cutting edge systems had issues with lag and gameplay.
<br>
<br>This game should be perfect for ANY system that is meant for gaming now (as i write this it is late 2014) as this game was released around 2007. The best part of the game is there is an editor so people can create their own maps and missions and it is quite intuitive. Even GRAW2&apos;s Editor isn&apos;t polished as GRAW&apos;s is. GRAW was the best while GRAW2 was the worst due to lack of polish and UBISOFT wanted to shove it out the door and make money. (isn&apos;t always about money?)
<br>
<br>I bought my GRAW for .01 cent and $4 shipping so it can be had cheap. We are now stuck buying copies from whereever has surplus of GRAW for sale. 9/10 stars</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4855436">Expand</a></span>

This game had better quality, better graphics, decent multiplayer, and everything a tactical shooter should have in it. This game shines with its wonderful design and gameplay. Get it on PC for the best experience.</span>
