<br>
<br>Quarter of my screen gets cut-off with black bars because of the aspect ration issues. Half of the screen gets filled with subtitles of my &quot;pawns&quot; yelling some nonsense over and over and over and over and over again during battles or giving me same one-liners like &quot;hurry up&quot;, or &quot;come here&quot; outside battle.
<br>
<br>The control scheme is plain awful on keyboard - backspace to confirm? What? Why?
<br>
<br>I mean - i don&apos;t doubt that underneath those issues and weird features there might be a decent game but i just don&apos;t want to deal with a shoddy pc port again.
<br>
<br>I get that people love this game and played it on consoles but as a pc player who&apos;s playing this for a first time - i just can&apos;t recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6018249">Expand</a></span>

It has some interesting combat aspects when you run into a &quot;boss&quot; but otherwise it is a dreadful bore. You can only have up to 6 attacks at one time which makes combat monotonous and insanely repetitive. You can switch in new moves but in due time they get boring too. It reminds me a lot of old action adventure games on the NES except that those did a better job of progressing story and action. The amount of repetition in this game is unbelievable. I played about 15 hours into the game and I think I have seen a total of about 10 enemy types... You go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and its just the same thing over and over. Kill x number of these and collect x number of those. The quests are like a boring MMO but the game itself plays a lot like a aRPG like diablo 3. I wish it had something more unique or interesting to offer but I didnt see it. The story is also completely uninteresting and not engaging in the least. The &quot;pawn&quot; system (aka party system) is doorknob dumb as well. You can only customize one other party member and though you can have two others, they are just randomly generated tools that you throw away whenever you level (because they themselves do not level).
<br>
<br>I think the game tried to be too many things and in the end was not good at anything. It is very similar to Dragon Age Inquisition which suffered from basically the same thing though I think DAI was slightly better than this. The aRPG elements are too repetitive and boring and given the way the party elements work, its practically impossible to die unless you take a cheap hit from a cheesy enemy. Tactics? What tactics lol? Traditional RPG elements like character building are meaningless since the game is heavily item based and since you can switch back and forth whenever you want rendering RPG system irrelevant.  Quests are copy and past from the most generic MMO you can find. The open world aspects tried to mimic the Elder Scrolls but instead everything is a narrow corridor and the game felt extremely closed. Exploration is meaningless in this game.
<br>
<br>Lastly, and I didnt grade it down for this though I should have, this is clearly a console port. The UI and controls on this game are atrocious and completely unacceptable for modern PC game. No wheel scroll. Backspace to save an option? You cant target anything directly, they just need to be in the vicinity and when there is more than one, you cant specify which to hit easily (insanely annoying). Cant aim range attacks unless you have a target locked (fireballs will just fly off into space). Cant hotkey attacks, instead you can only use 3 buttons and combine them with control or alt. Etc.
<br>
<br>Last, and again I didnt knock it down for this but... the graphics are horrendous even at the highest settings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7430463">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Imagine Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age had a baby, and that baby was raised by Dark Souls and Shadow of the Collossus in the same house as The Witcher.  Yet, somehow it still maintains its identity as its own thing. While it doesn&apos;t have a particularly strong story, it&apos;s well made up for with a sprawling, beautiful landscape with clever level design and monsters galore.
<br>
<br>Lastly... You see that big cyclops? You can climb it, and poke it in the eye. Can&apos;t find what you&apos;re looking for? Veer off the path. There are many elements that are not immediately obvious, but are quite rewarding when you learn how to use them.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s no surprise this gem from 2012 is once again a hit in 2016.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6331309">Expand</a></span>

<br>Fighting epic monsters , there overpowered and cheap with there moves, but I spent some time just hunting them down, that dam drake come to mind, I like the idea of high level monsters making you think twice.
<br>Class crossover , this creates a persistence that makes me want to play an archer then go back to another class.
<br>
<br>This is an RPG ,just as addictive as many RPGs I have played : it plays well, the PC version suffers no large bugs I can see(ui mouse cant cant complain)
<br>
<br>these 10/10 rating just need to go, as this game is not one of those; it is a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6063684">Expand</a></span>

Aside from that, almost every other aspect of Dragon&apos;s Dogma is fairly average or mediocre.
<br>
<br>In terms of the PC port - it&apos;s adequate but more needed to be done. Good framerates are easy to attain, though we are talking about a game that originally came out in 2012 and certainly looks the part. The UI is very obviously controller centric in its layout and there is no mouse wheel support in most menus. It&apos;s also just a cumbersome interface to trawl through in general. For example, the inventory and equipment screens are separate for no reason, no quick keybinds for quests or map screens, unrebindable &quot;insert&quot; and &quot;page up&quot; buttons for changing tabs (seriously, whose idea was that?!), no proper quicksaving or quickloading (you have to exit to the menu to reload a manual save), and only having one save game file (hope your save game doesn&apos;t get corrupted). Overall, there are just a lot of UI design flaws that needed to be addressed and a good deal of QoL improvements needed as well.
<br>
<br>While I did praise the combat mechanics, it&apos;s a shame that a lot of its potential is wasted on repetitive encounters with &quot;trash&quot; enemies like goblins or harpies that make up 90% of the fights in this game. Fighting hydras, chimeras, dragons and all the other &quot;big guys&quot;, that&apos;s all well and good, but most other encounters weren&apos;t nearly as engaging.
<br>
<br>The pawns system is a mechanic unique to Dragon&apos;s Dogma, and while I kinda liked the idea behind it, I wish there was a more straight forward method behind adjusting pawn inclinations (which by the way is something the game tells you nearly nothing about). As of right now, there are a whole lot of hoops to jump through for what should&apos;ve just been something I could easily adjust in a separate menu. Instead, I have to use inclination potions (which the game doesn&apos;t tell you about either), act a certain way in combat, or sit in a knowledge chair and get a randomised set of questions directed towards your main pawn that may or may not impact your pawn in the way you wanted. All this pointless busywork just so I can get my pawns to hopefully not act like an idiot and die when facing a dragon. Ultimately, even with the most suitable inclinations, pawn AI is quite underwhelming, as demonstrated by their complete inability to defend themselves or evade attacks.
<br>
<br>Moving on to the overarching narrative, lore and worldbuilding of the game, I was also fairly disappointed in this aspect. The setting is fairly generic fantasy stuff, littered with uninspired kill &apos;x&apos; amount of &apos;y&apos; quests, escort &apos;x&apos; to &apos;y&apos; location or collect &apos;x&apos; amount of &apos;y&apos; item quests. Sure, there are a few quests centered around certain characters that go beyond this boring formula, but even those are lacking in character development and narrative punch compared to other RPGs. The rather mediocre cutscenes with poor writing, lack of lip syncing and just generally low production values certainly don&apos;t help. The whole Arisen arch of the story is only really touched on in the beginning and end of the game, while the middle section of the game is essentially you being an errand boy for the Duke. The big revelations that come towards the end of the game were difficult to take seriously due to the aforementioned poor writing with characters uttering supposedly deep platitudes about free will, endless cycles and destiny.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been pretty critical in this review, though I feel I should mention that despite all its flaws, there is a rough charm about Dragon&apos;s Dogma that ultimately led me to finish it. There is a good combat system here, and it was fun, but I just wasn&apos;t a fan of pretty much everything else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6976457">Expand</a></span>

This is a typical experience playing as a mage: you have fireballs and lightning bolts and a staff that can throw projectiles... but your character won&apos;t aim any of this stuff until you get within close range of your enemies. Worse still, your spells take time to cast. When you have enough time that can mean that you&apos;ll blast your enemies without taking a hit, but if you don&apos;t then you&apos;ll repeatedly take hits, get stunned, and die. Most fights are all or nothing in this bizarre way, and what you do in them feels like it isn&apos;t very strategic or even really under your control. It&apos;s a bit like playing dragon age inquisition without the tactical pause, except you could at least execute ranged attacks there.
<br>
<br>The talents are a bit imbalanced. Basic elemental skills are there, along with stuff no one tested and no one would ever use such as the ability to silence or blind your enemies. Or how about the ability to enchant your allies&apos; weapons? This enchanting takes so long and is so cumbersome to aim and has so little effect that I can&apos;t imagine a non-NPC ever using it. It&apos;s essentially a supporting character&apos;s talent only. Long story short: most talents are useless.
<br>
<br>Levelling also feels unsatisfying somehow. You have to go to the innkeeper to &quot;buy&quot; talents? I&apos;ve never seen something so off key in an RPG.
<br>
<br>The difficulty curve also feels imbalanced. Since enemies respawn (which really takes a lot away from any game), you&apos;ll fight and pop the weaker goons very easily, only to be quickly annihilated by similar ones further away from your starting area. This sort of thing was acceptable a decade ago when Gothic did it, but I don&apos;t think a modern game can get a free pass here.
<br>
<br>The game contains montages and story telling that sometimes does actually engage a little, but it lacks characters. I consider characters to be one of the central facets of the genre, but the overt blandness of DD borders on the surreal. It seems like half the characters you encounter are &quot;pawns&quot; -- lobotomized cannon fodder with lines of dialogue that are triggered by location on the map or sometimes combat situations. It&apos;s nice for others to comment on what happens in a game, but sometimes they get it wrong and they do it so much it gets annoying quickly. (This is especially true when they tell you to block or counter--which you can&apos;t do as a mage.) It&apos;s like playing a Dragon Age game except half the characters are Tranquil. The other half may as well be Tranquil too, as there&apos;s very little to differentiate them from pawns.
<br>
<br>On the up side, at least some of the scenery is nice. Mountains feel big in this game, and so do castles. The graphics are ugly, but the design of the scenery is occasionally worth some exploration time, even if you must do it while fighting the same respawning mobs over and over.
<br>
<br>As some have pointed out, the UI is terrible. I don&apos;t usually complain about UIs, but this one is the most shameless console port I&apos;ve ever seen. Inventory management takes up a third of my time. Exiting the game takes around 20 seconds to do.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll admit that I didn&apos;t finish the game... which is a rarity for me. I actually stuck it out with Two World II or Gothic 3 for instance, but I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll have the patience for this. If I play it anymore I&apos;ll probably turn into a pawn myself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6106766">Expand</a></span>

I played this game to death on my PS3, it is my favorite RPG of that generation along with Dark Souls. Knowing where I&apos;m coming from, I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt: this game ROCKS on Steam. It&apos;s an excellent port with great performance, and playing the game with a revitalized community thanks to the new platform makes it new for me again. It also benefits from the Steam architecture for online features, like making screenshots become a snap (no pun intended) to take and share. Also, there are already a few mods popping up which are making the game prettier and more stable, so I&apos;m looking forward to see how the game evolves at the hands of the community with time (I currently have E3FX ENB and Don&apos;t Blind Me installed, and the difference is noticeable and very appealing).
<br>
<br>But most important of all, this game is just plain fun. It has hours of combat-heavy gameplay with loads of items to acquire and modify, the pawn system makes AI party members unique and interactive to your actions and adjustments, and it has THE MOST AWESOME boss battles in RPG history. As much as I love Dark Souls, slinging magic and slashing enemies time and again pales in comparison to fighting a cyclops and commanding your pawns to buff you and rain lightning on it while you CLIMB up to the cyclops&apos;s face and stab it in the goddamn eye. Every battle with a large monster is an epic affair, accentuated by bombastic battle music that changes as you are beating the monster and it becomes scared and desperate (YES, YOU READ THAT RIGHT, MONSTERS GET SCARED WHEN YOU&apos;RE KICKING THEIR ASS).
<br>
<br>Now, I have to include a few caveats: the game wasn&apos;t perfect originally and it isn&apos;t now. The graphics were average when it came out, and now they are pretty dated, the dialogue is a little laugh-inducing and it can be a confusing and daunting game to get into starting out. But at $30, this game is an absolute gem of a bargain for the amount and quality of gameplay you&apos;re getting. I recommend it wholeheartedly for anyone who wants a new RPG experience distinct in flavor from games like Skyrim or The Witcher, and if you are a fan of the game from back when it was only on consoles, the PC port will make you fall in love with the game all over again. My highest recommendation. Also, PLEASE get the game, guys, to encourage Capcom to bring Dragon&apos;s Dogma Online stateside!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6028491">Expand</a></span>

<br>Exploring is a pleasure (which is something amazing), melee combat (my major experience so far) is a blast and cooperating with your chosen allies is also very cool. The visuals really are stunning and character building is complex and dense, which is very desirable to me. The difficult (you can choose Easy, Normal or Hard &#x2014; I&apos;m on Normal) is also very adequate, so far: I have trivial encounters that sometimes still surprise me a bit; and then I have the occasional damnit-hard fight that so far can be won through careful and skillful battling, which is so cool; A must buy for die-hard RPGers, specially people who like some action with their RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6023083">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If on the other hand you have no problems playing a mute main character and want nothing more than to bash giant monsters over the head this might be your game. Because there are a lot giant ancient monsters and there certainly is a lot of bashing.
<br>
<br>This game is a little bit like the strange love-child of Diablo 3 and Dark Souls, and if that sounds like your thing then by all means go ahead. But if on the other hand you want a story driven RPG with lots of dialogue and character interaction this isn&apos;t the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6021078">Expand</a></span>

Yes I Platinumed Bloodborne on PS4(also spent hundreds of hours doing the grinding stuff) and I still think this game brings me more fun (and BB is considered the best ARPG for 2015 ON PS4 which I admit and would give it a 9/10 so that&apos;s why I give this game a 10/10). Why? Freedom of choice! Specifically because of the character customization for my character and the combat system, and maybe also for the tune of DD&apos;s world setting. This game is not either Bloodborne or Skyrim, it is more of a hybrid of Monster Hunter and Devil May Cry. It looks similar to Bloodborne in some ways because they are both ARPGs, but Bloodborne gives you a sense of achievement by beating you to the ground then gives you some sugar, whereas in Dragon&apos;s Dogma you don&apos;t necessarily need to be punished but you could definitely get some sweet candies out of box. Meteor rain, magical tornado, master sword arts, shield counter attack, dark matter enchanted sword, yes you could do all of those. Every class and skill makes your gameplay tremendously different (Devil May Cry level combat design, need me to talk more?). For customization, it beats Souls/The Elder Scrolls majorly in two aspects: 1. You have two slots for bodywear and footwear instead of only one for each. This brings more freedom on fashion play. 2. You can choose your body form and the armors will correspond to you. Wanna play as a dwarf? Do it! Wanna play as a sexy sorcerer? Why not? Freedom is king. Sorry if I offended people who put Bloodborne better than this game, this is just my personal opinion. At the end, I gotta write down my list of masterpiece so you might find my score making sense to you if we have similar taste: The Last of US/PS4, Sakura Wars/SEGA Dreamcast, Pokemon/GBA-3DS, Xenoblade Chronicles X/Wiiu, Ninja Gaiden 2/Xbox360, Devil May Cry 3&amp;4/PS2&amp;3, Final Fantasy Core Crisis/PSP, A Tale of Sword and Fairy 4/PC. As for GTAV, Witcher, MGSV, Rise of Tomb Raider and Uncharted, I didn&apos;t have time to actually beat them(various reasons but I will when I have more time) so I wouldn&apos;t say they are not masterpieces. For Bloodborne, it&apos;s very close but I&apos;m just not very motivated to play it again when basically I beat the game and its dungeon. And Dynasty Warriors? They are not on the same level, thanks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6019198">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A medieval fantasy world that actually looks medieval, a story with insane twists at the end, decisions and side quests that actually affect things down the road, and perhaps most importantly... a combat system that actually justifies the term &quot;action RPG&quot; and makes battle so much more enjoyable than in most other ARPGs. Insane mobility as well, with some classes having access to dashes, double jumps, levitation, and so on, and a very climbable world.
<br>
<br>This game does have its flaws, and I don&apos;t just mean that it&apos;s a late console port that doesn&apos;t try to hide what era it is from. On the other hand, this PC port includes the original game, the expansion, and all the DLC that ever came out on consoles with exception of two armor sets that they don&apos;t have a license for anymore, and all that at a very friendly price point. And the age has its benefits; I can play this at a constant 60 FPS in 4K resolution on my (gaming) laptop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6023204">Expand</a></span>

<br>the story isn&apos;t really special and the graphics feel really dated. They could have been more polished and updated. However, the combat and gameplay mechanics are really satisfying and I don&apos;t exaggerate if I say it was the best I&apos;ve ever seen in a Western type RPG.</span>

It&apos;s been a while, but in all honesty I would say that I probably would have given the game a 7 if not for great performance and lots of new content.
<br>
<br>Dragon&apos;s Dogma is sort of like a mash-up between Monster Hunter and Dark souls, putting you in a dangerous dark fantasy world as the &apos;Arisen&apos;, an incarnation of an ancient hero who will kill an evil dragon...It&apos;s essentially the same plot as 50% of other RPGs out there. But, what it lacks in deep story and character depth, it makes up with gameplay...most of the time, at least.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s biggest strength is certainly it&apos;s combat system. Big monster boss fights feel epic, and climbing onto big creatures to kill them is loads of fun. Smaller skirmishes work just as well, with a great skill system combat always feels fresh.
<br>
<br>Atmosphere and the sense of exploration are other things that will keep you coming back. The game knows how to rack up the tension, as well, and the day-and-night cycle will having you take meticulous care of time management. Trust me, you don&apos;t wanna be out in the dark in this game.
<br>
<br>Game&apos;s got it&apos;s fair share of problems...some of them quite annoying. Whereas a game like Dark Souls might be hard, the game seems fair...yet I can&apos;t say all that is true in the case of Dragon&apos;s Dogma. This is the kind of game where you&apos;ll be dumbfounded as to HOW THE HELL you and your party just murdered a huge cyclops boss, only for you to be killed by a single wolf&apos;s bite a little later. The answer to the problem is to go get stronger, but you may frequently find problems with combat...especially if you like to explore.
<br>
<br>Other problems include a pain in the butt interface, some annoying and constant NPC banter (can turn it off, thank god) and poor inventory management. But, if you can forgive that stuff and you&apos;re up for a challenge, I will recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6039776">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you are any fan of action RPGs then this game is definitely for you. Honestly there isn&apos;t much choice for this genre outside the Souls games. However this game was directed by Hideaki Itsuno who also directed the Devil May Cry series so this game&apos;s combat and mechanics are hands down second to none. The combat is better than any souls game and the variety in play styles will keep you entertained for dozens of hours. The combat is also very challenging and Hard Mode is only recommended for veteran players, you WILL be one shot by large monsters even with decent gear. You&apos;ve been warned.
<br>
<br>The only thing that keeps this game from me giving it a 10/10 is the game&apos;s story presentation. This game is all about the action and lacks polish in that department. It&apos;s not bad at all, but comparatively it could be much better. But that doesn&apos;t mean this game lacks in content, with Bitter Black Isle and the main game content you can easily spend over 100 hours before seeing everything. This game was made on a budget and considering what they did with how much money they had it is insanely impressive. If Dragon&apos;s Dogma had even close to the budget that Skyrim had then this game would be heralded as the best game of all time by nearly anyone. Such a shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6019914">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is probably my favorite Ps3 game, and with good reason.
<br>
<br>Have you ever read the manga Berserk? Or any fiction based in medieval times? If you like that era, you most probably will like Dragon&apos;s Dogma.
<br>The game&apos;s world is open ended, so you are free to explore it as you see fit. But do it carefully, as you will find all the typical monsters found in medieval stories.
<br>Goblins, big ogres, minotaurs, dragons, harpies...its all there.
<br>
<br>The battle system is real-time action. You choose a class (fighter, ranger and mage), you equip a weapon and armor of choice, equip skills and spells, level up, etc just like a normal rpg. Whats different here is that you can climb the big enemies. And it feels great. You will never forget the first time you jump on a griffin, grab it by the neck, and slash it with your sword while the monster takes off flying with you on its back.
<br>
<br>The plot is about your main character becoming the &quot;Arisen&quot;, that is pretty much the hero fated to slay the dragon. But that&apos;s not all. The Arisen also has his followers called &quot;Pawns&quot;, human-like dolls who only purpose in life is to serve you.
<br>At first you get only one Pawn, that you yourself create and choose the appearance to your liking. But later you will be able to invite other player&apos;s Pawns to your game to help you on your journey.
<br>When I played it the first time I had this group of friends, and we all played Dragon&apos;s Dogma, and we would invite each others Pawn to our games, gift items and equipments, take each other Pawn on quests and places to teach them about it, etc.
<br>Even though the game doesnt have an actual multiplayer mode, I believe having friends to change Pawns with is the best way to fully experience the game.
<br>But of course, the game is also very much enjoyable playing by yourself, as you can also pick offline Pawns if you want.
<br>You can also search for random Pawns on the nexus made by random players too.
<br>A total of two pawns can be invited to your game, and including your own pawn you can go explore with a party of four members, with the Arisen as leader.
<br>Orders can be issued to your Pawns, and each has a class and can equip weapons and armors just like the player.
<br>
<br>The only reason I don&apos;t give this game a 10 is because a lot of content was cut from the final product.
<br>No, that doesn&apos;t mean that Dragon&apos;s Dogma feels unfinished.
<br>It means that it was THIS close to being a perfect game.
<br>For more info on that just use google and you will know what I mean.
<br>Besides that, I really can&apos;t think of one thing to complain about this game.
<br>Maybe just the plot that is a bit weak at times and fails to make much sense, but tis all part of the cut content situation I already mentioned.
<br>
<br>Another important thing to note is that the expansion &quot;Dark Arisen&quot; is one of the best expansions ever made for a game, in my honest opinion. Be sure to play through it to the end, no matter how hard it gets.
<br>It will all be worth it, I promise.0</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6183922">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately, it really feels like a clunky Dark Souls clone with almost none of the atmosphere or mechanics that made that game fun and interesting. I especially don&apos;t understand the people praising its combat, which feels awkward and clumsy even by the usual standard of modern action RPGs.
<br>
<br>Full disclaimer: I barely made it an hour in. The controls were almost unbearably clunky, and the repetitive screaming of pawns and almost total lack of explanations or plot made me lose interest very quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6705373">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Nothing, not even Dark Souls/Bloodborne can compare to the gameplay offered here. It is fluid and easy to learn, but has depth and requires strategy. Many enemies have weaknesses and discovering them is half the fun. Don&apos;t want the griffin to fly away? Set his wings on fire. It is thoughtful strategies like this, which the game is compacted with, that make it such an amazing experience.
<br>
<br>The score is mostly beautiful, with adrenaline punctuated themes and hauntingly somber melodies played as called for. Your first encounter with a massive enemy is all the more exciting when the song &quot;End of the Struggle&quot; plays and you seethe in the victory.
<br>
<br>My favorite part of the game is how each major task feels like a real journey you may not come back from. If you go ill prepared you will have a very hard time. So don&apos;t be afraid to stock up on recovery items.
<br>
<br>And I can&apos;t end this review without speaking a little about the dragon. For me a little philosophy is necessary to completely enjoy a game and be immersed with it, and the dragon is the focal point of the games philosophy. People complain about the thinness of the story and it is true that it is somewhat slow, but when you learn of the reason why the game has the title it has it becomes a very compelling and thought provoking tale.
<br>
<br>In short, this is a great game and in spite of flaws it excels on so many levels that I could not get enough, so I give it a 10. It&apos;s a masterwork all that you can&apos;t go wrong with purchasing.  Now go buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6015574">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game tried to do so many things, for better or worse. Little mechanics and game situations people who dismiss this as generic fantasy, will miss out on.

<br>
<br>It&apos;s bloody brilliant, that&apos;s all I will say. The story, very disjointed - this one is more about the gameplay but it&apos;s got everything where it counts. It may look it&apos;s age but the sound design is phenomenal!
<br>
<br>I gave it a 10/10 only because I own several 2015, 2016 AAA games and this is what I&apos;m choosing and wanting to play.
<br>
<br>On it&apos;s own, forgiving it&apos;s outdated look I&apos;d say an 8.5 or 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6023812">Expand</a></span>

The game world is huge and  challenging. You have your team which you  could also create or invite npcs into. Lots of side quest and little details, the dark sinister lore is pretty fascinating aswell</span>

<br>
<br>The side quests are boring and very repetitive with very few exceptions.The main quests are better and some are fun and interesting.
<br>
<br>The role playing/romance part is extremely bad executed and you have to know beforehand how it works if you are to romance the right npc and even then it is very difficult.
<br>
<br>I you like role playing this is not a game for you. If you like combating monsters you might like this, for a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6065434">Expand</a></span>

<br>But for me personally, Dragon&apos;s Dogma is better due to its mechanics of combat (many fighting styles and classes of weapons) and something like parkour while you move on the game locations.
<br>Indeed, this game has not the modern graphics and an exciting story, but the game mechanics and a sense of adventure, which gives this game, redeem all of its disadvantages.
<br>I passed this game again on my PC with great pleasure and it left only one unpleasant feeling -  I want sequel, I want Dragon&apos;s Dogma II, Dragon&apos;s Dogma III..., but this is unlikely.

<br>Capcom listened to alot of hardcore and diehard fans, and unfortunately turned the game into more of a ridicious Dark Souls clone which just kinder fails in all departments.   I&apos;d say this is strictly for the fans, other jrpgs fans...get the PS3 version which is just far superior.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6027739">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Best dragon I have ever seen in character, voicing, animation. Most of the enemies are very well done in graphics and animation. Pawn system is very interesting, where pawns learn through experience and comment using this knowledge. (Sometimes they do too much though)
<br>
<br>What holds this title back is it&apos;s weaklish story, uninspired questing (near endless quests about killing a certain number of enemy types, or collecting a number of items) and mostly boring npcs. A few cutscenes are very well done, but those are only a handful. The game play more then compensates, but finishing nearly every quest on first play-through and seen the ending I feel a tiny sting of regret about what could have been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6412480">Expand</a></span>

<br>I Enjoyed this game, i wouldn&apos;t say that it was revolutionary, it is an rpg slash&apos;em/mage&apos;m/rouge&apos;m up pretty much. i played a Fighter with every intention to become a Mysic knight and so started the journey of Sir Gaige. i really liked the idea of Pawns but frankly after a couple of hours you&apos;ll find the kind of pawns that work well with you and yours and repeat from there. i completed the game with around 80 hours under my belt and here is how i feel about it:
<br>
<br>Graphics 9
<br>The graphics are pretty damn amazing in this game, i would say all in all that its probably the strongest point of this game. some clipping and animation issues are expected when clinging on for life to a griffon though and as such you may find yourself flailing around quite a lot when trying to climb monsters. another part i need to mention is the faces the animation here feels lazy especially in cut scenes
<br>
<br>Audio 4
<br>I cant say that the audio really stood out for me, score was mediocre with only really the battle music / boss like enemy&apos;s standing out
<br>
<br>Gameplay 6
<br>If your like me you may find the controls to be a little bit clunky but they really do start to get better after a while, i feel like the heavy attack is mostly useless when you can just use an ability instead, the limitation on abilities is useful for the pawns as you can look at one and predict what kind of a pawn they will be , but i found that some limitations bothered me, most notably when i swapped out to Warrior and found they have 3 less skill slots than the other classes. in short i feel like the classes need more fleshing out as the bow users didn&apos;t quite feel different enough for me at a glance. the combat is quite fast and punishing but its nothing that having a mage cant really troop though, i would have really liked a better taunting system in this game as the shield drum and its upgrade just didn&apos;t do the trick for me.
<br>
<br>Environment 7
<br>The environment in this game really took me back at first, when heading to the city for the first time i felt like it was just the beginning of an adventure in this full and exciting world, enemy&apos;s around every corner and quests taking me across this world! Sadly i found after a fair few hours that this was the only city and i had been to each corner of the map and that was that, with the quests and adventures to match, quests and NPC&apos;s can be forgettable with most being picked up from a notice board. the few that do have some thought and story behind them are still just go to a. and kill b. or head to a. but b. is in the way. The best way i can describe this game is like a balloon, at first glance it looks full, but on closer inspection its empty.
<br>
<br>Story 3
<br>What story? one of the main let downs in this game is its so called story, there is a little bit of a twist towards the end but nothing ground breaking, nothing that made me look back and think that i need to tell everyone to experience that.
<br>
<br>All in all I Gage this game at a 6
<br>
<br>TL;DR?

I&apos;m playing on WASD, how it&apos;s supposed I should reach these keys - with a third arm?
<br>
<br>I&apos;m also not speaking about stupid savegame mechanics - combination of checkpoints with auto-save and a one-position save through menu. Yes, forget about quick-save/quick-load. I accidentally missed a tutorial how to use/choose correct pawns, because this behavior. I talked to some another guy and it ended with a big-boss killing quest, after which tutorial quest was canceled and I wasn&apos;t even able to load a game, because it was autosaved..
<br>

<br>- This must be the laziest console to PC port of all time. The UI and controls are simply terrible and make no sense on a PC, but they didn&apos;t bother to make any changes.
<br>- The constant waiting for auto-saving and loading new scenes is aggravating.
<br>- Single save and having to go through the entire intro to restart a game? Really?
<br>- Absolutely crappy story and no characters whatsoever. The whole idea of pawns is a pure excuse for not giving party members personalities.
<br>- The difficulty of enemies you encounter in the first couple of hours is strange, to say the least. It felt as if the game was telling me that I have to grind until I level up enough to explore even the nearest areas. Why on earth would I want to do that?
<br>
<br>The game crashed on me after completing a particular mission and that was the last straw. I have no interest in playing it ever again and I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t pay anything to try it out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6070235">Expand</a></span>

First off, it &quot;is&quot; an RPG, its not trying to hide it from you, its also not trying to inform you that when it comes down to it- its all about random number generation and stats.  I&apos;d played through about 30 hours and it finally dawned on me that I wanted to start my character building process over.  Why?  Well to put it lightly, I felt like I had screwed things up, configured my vocation poorly, or that my supportive skills outweighed my offensive ones or that I was playing a class incorrectly.  This uncertainty plagues the whole game, since you can&apos;t just have a &quot;magic&quot; character or a &quot;soldier&quot; or an &quot;archer,&quot; no!  The game says:  &quot;You can have them all!  Even if skills you spent hours to obtain are totally made pointless by changing to and from other vocations!&quot;  The Vocations are an intricate and very well designed part of the game.  Had they not been there I&apos;m sure many people would&apos;ve become unbelievably bored with the hum-drum repetitiveness of grinding for levels and skill purchases.  Their complicated even further by having to manage your &quot;pawn&apos;s&quot; abilities and class as well.  Did I mention you have a little supportive buddy you create to come along with you on your journey in Dragon&apos;s Dogma?  No?  Well it doesn&apos;t matter that much since they hardly have the intelligence necessary to count them as &quot;actual&quot; teammates and end up being glass cannons or cannon fodder 75 percent of the time regardless of what skills or vocations you&apos;ve leveled them up into.  Pawn&apos;s are an interesting idea executed particularly poorly, especially when you realize that the game was originally out on the Playstation 3 several years.  So that being said, this game looks like a Playstation 3 game from several years ago.  Its not necessarily ugly, but its not a pretty game.  Some might argue that its general aesthetic, design, and style give it an ageless quality, but they&apos;re probably just Capcom fans in earnest.  I can&apos;t see any Skyrim or Witcher fan going bonkers over Dragon&apos;s Dogma.  Its just not that special.  However, it is quite fun.  Its a unique way of handling an action role playing title, but between optimizing armor, collecting the untold amounts of materials necessary to upgrade your gear, wandering around the landscape looking for things to do besides fighting monsters and picking up everything in sight, it slowly turns into a grind unlike any grind you&apos;ve ever known or played before.  Perhaps its what keeps people so enthralled in the whole thing, but for myself personally it was very hard to &quot;get into&quot; the main story line.  The optional quests were mostly escorts or monster hunts.  The rewards were utterly pointless and trivial amounts of money or random items or experience.  All of which can be gathered anywhere else in the game.  The night and day mechanic was well done, but once again the game pumps up the aspect of how dangerous nighttime adventuring is supposed to be.  Really the only difference are a few tougher enemies wandering around or one or two items you don&apos;t usually find.  I can&apos;t call it disappointing as a title, but its very much overrated in terms of its gameplay.  The whole thing can really really, really- and I mean really- become a chore.  That&apos;s not something I think anyone would want in a game like this.  Lack of fluidity, no real story structure, poor pacing, the linear quest line bars off areas it shouldn&apos;t and totally ruins the thrill of reaching a location only to realize you can&apos;t explore any further until you talk to some character half way across the map.  The vocation system is a total mess and reminded me of the hours of my life I spent attempting to play through Final fantasy tactics, only to sit back and wonder what I was doing with my life.  The Pawns are incredibly stupid, the commands you give them don&apos;t make any real sense, the online is stifling and it feels awkward to &quot;rent&quot; other players pawns just to take down bigger monsters faster than usual.  The armor and item system is impenetrably dense requiring a player to essentially buy everything and upgrade it just to get a fair comparison on what provides what you need per enemy encounter.  On the other hand, the music is quite good.  The voice acting is alright and I mean at least its not &quot;Skyrim.&quot;  At least in this one you&apos;re the &quot;Arisen&quot; not the &quot;Dragonborn.&quot;  At least in this game you&apos;re not just fighting a dragon- oh wait.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6060591">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>Decent PC Port.
<br>
<br>Some of the bigger monsters are fun to fight.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>Storyline, or lack thereof, is garbage. It starts interesting, then you got hours of pressing buttons to skip through text and poor voice acting. Not one memorable character in the cast except the dragon, who inexplicably stops speaking weird dragon talk and starts speaking odd middle-English.
<br>
<br>The combat is incredibly slow paced. I would literally start to cast a spell, get up and walk away from my computer to do something, come back and my stamina bar is still not refilled. It is also difficult to lock on/hold your lock and that is even with a mouse and keyboard. I don&apos;t know how people managed to play it with a controller and still praise it.
<br>
<br>On hard mode (only mode I played) you are one-shotted by everything. I like difficulty, but the difficulty feels artificial when the reason you&apos;re dying is that a poor camera angle didn&apos;t show you the wolf jumping off a hill and one-shotting you whilst you are carefully dodging a cyclops&apos; charge. This artificial difficulty also makes playing a melee character pretty much impossible, or at least too much of a headache to bother.
<br>
<br>Annoying gear grinding system that&apos;s like a poorly thought-out MMO. For good gear you pick it up, pay to have it identified and hope it is the right item. Then grind for currency and items to level it up. Items also have to be used from in-menu, no quick item usage, so I didn&apos;t use any items my entire playthrough. Some of the items seem to be incredibly overpowered as well, namely the maker&apos;s finger, so there&apos;s the potential to just win by using items which I guess is there for if you&apos;re fed up with enemies who&apos;s main &quot;difficulty&quot; is getting through their massive healthbars without getting bored/distracted to the point you get sloppy and take one hit(or some glitch lets them hit you through your cover, always fun).
<br>
<br>Poor graphics that is full of clipping, enemies coming through solid structures(a bonus when they one shot you) and opportunities to get stuck in silly situations. Audio is unimpressive as well, I turned on my own music probably 10 minutes into playing.
<br>
<br>AI companions are useless. They mostly just stand there and do nothing even when commanded to move forward. They won&apos;t start to take action until something walks up and smacks them, but luckily unlike your main character they aren&apos;t one-shotted by everything so they can be used as meatshields.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s also no quick save and normal saves like everything else are sluggish.
<br>
<br>Overall: 4/10
<br>This game is very similar to Dark Souls in pretty much all respects. Overrated, artificially difficult due to slow pacing and potential to get one-shotted by dumb things. Looks awful, plays sluggishly and only a few fights feel fulfilling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6024719">Expand</a></span>

The character creation is incredibly deep and every design choice will, in turn, give different and meaningful results in terms how the character moves, handles weight, takes damage etc. The map is large but doesn&apos;t offer much in variety of enemies or terrain, even things to do, other than killing different iterations of the same 9-10 basic enemy models, which is fine, but it feels like a missed opportunity. Witcher 3 does this way better. The larger creatures, like the griffin or the cockatrice are fun to play, that is, if and when they spawn. For the majority of the early to mid-game you&apos;ll encounter the same old chimera/cyclops around the map, and they get old pretty fast. Graphically, its not at all on par with the newer games of the sort, like witcher 3, but its a port so that&apos;s expected. Good items are hard to come by, especially weapons and even when you find something that works for you, you&apos;ll need to get upgrade materials that can be even harder to find. My issue with the game is that it doesn&apos;t explain itself very well, the quests are unclear at times, and that makes them all the more difficult to finish. Also, if you don&apos;t have an Eternal Ferrystone, and a few portstones, i feel really bad for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6421052">Expand</a></span>

The fast travel system is very basic and there&apos;s no mounts such as horses. You spend an overwhelming amount of time talking to NPCs and finding your way. Your followers are also complete idiots so you will spend allot of time trying to revive them making the game that much more difficult. The contrast is god-awful even with the high def. PC version.
<br>
<br>The Good: Easily one of the greatest combat systems I&apos;ve encoutered. You need to be well prepared for everything in this game and even the slightest mistake can put you in deep trouble. You will find monsters of epic proportions and every win is a well deserved one.
<br>
<br>Verdict: For every bad thing I can find about this game, there&apos;s a redeeming quality somewhere. It&apos;s as bad as it is good, yet the game&apos;s charm and uniqueness is what keeps me coming back. Despite all its flaws, this will go down as one of the top action rpgs I&apos;ve played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6095110">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One thing that gets a solid &quot;10&quot; though; this was one very, very well ported game. Kudos to Capcom for that.</span>

<br>- tons of notice board quests, interesting world, not bad story (there are issues with it however);
<br>- many things to do, longevity;
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- story somehow go away in mid-game, action only is at beggining and near end of game, that sucks;
<br>- small world;
<br>- hard mode (stagger/knockdown raised ressistance and more damage taken is not bad, but there are no changes to enemies HP or AI, and you got 2x more expierience points which made hard mode something like easy mode because of overleving your character - however it can be fixed with mods already);
<br>- some animations sucks too;
<br>- low game difficulty, however it can be fixed;
<br>- sometimes stupid AI of NPCs;
<br>
<br>Maybe forgotten about something, dunno.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6135236">Expand</a></span>

<br>Most RPGs simply aren&apos;t as fun. This game takes a couple of ludicrous mechanics and makes the game insane. It takes the idea of climbing enemies from Ico and makes it availible for most enemies larger than the small goblin. So why is this so fun?
<br>It makes every battle with a boss interesting. because you can climb them and hit them in weak spots, it&apos;s all about taking it down tactically. The pawn system in combat is great. You can tell them to occupy the enemy so you can climb it and stab it in the eye or ask them to defend you so you can heal up. even regular battles are great. The hack and slash combat is fulfilling, well weighted and smooth. The sheer  amount of different classes and skill availible means there&apos;s tons of replayability. It&apos;s not DMC4 but there&apos;s enough depth in it. I wish there was online multiplayer, since some of the moves allow you to launch or buff allies, creating a strong sense of flow in combat. I&apos;d love multiplayer but maybe next time. or in the near future. Come on Capcom
<br>The story is fine. The mechanics are based on the story of you being the chosen one and you have undying followers etc etc etc. A bit bland but the endings aren&apos;t bad. voice acting isn&apos;t good
<br>The environments are kinda boring and most of the time you&apos;ll be looking for stuff like chests and ore to pick up. The map&apos;s alright but the environment looks pretty bad. none of the places feel very new and it&apos;s likely you&apos;ve seen many of these things before if you regularly play RPGs  It was a PS3 game they could&apos;ve really improved a lot of the textures, especially with the character models. For the most part they&apos;re ok but for a 2016 game it&apos;s jarring to see this from CapCom. A stable 60 FPS is good though and it&apos;s decently optimized. Can&apos;t really complain too much about that.
<br>Customization is deep and meaningful. You can also customize your main pawn and choose her class and all. The pawn system sometimes annoys the **** out of me since they LOVE to talk but they&apos;re pretty fun most times. They give you clues and tips and also help you pick up items from the environment
<br>The inventory system is alright but not that great. It lets you manage the inventory for your pawns, your storage in inns and so on. Bare minimum but not much else. Thankfully this version of the game has free fast travel so getting around isn&apos;t too much of a hassle. apparently the original version didn&apos;t have this but praise where it&apos;s due. Capconm has actually improved on it.
<br>The music is pretty good but it gets repetitive really quick. Memorable tracks and all but it really needs more of it.
<br>But the best thing is the worth. 30 USD is good but if can get it in a sale, it&apos;s a bargain. tons of content, lots to explore and decent amounts of replayability.  Steam workshop does have some performance and graphics mods and they do make the game better. Thank god CapCom weren&apos;t anal about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6572149">Expand</a></span>

<br>/ Simplistic Enemy AI, Combat movement, grappling on enemies, their variety
<br>/ Soft lock targetting, skill equipping
<br>/ Sounds and Music, voice acting

<br>- MMO quest design...fetch, kill, escort
<br>- Main story, characters, dialogue, lip sync
<br>- Atmosphere and lore
<br>- World design and exploration
<br>
<br>DD is a very quirky title...too ambitious for it&apos;s own good, but it&apos;s unique and innovative features as well as being loaded with FUN, pull it above, what is closer to being a mediocre title.
<br>Still, it has a plenty of potential and I&apos;m hoping next time Capcom will aim for a more focused experience, that plays to it&apos;s strengths, instead of trying to top Elder Scrolls or other open world titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6157433">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it&apos;s possible, it&apos;s Dragon&apos;s Dogma.
<br>
<br>This game mixes great gameplay and open world exploration like no other game has ever done, the combat system is magnificent, every attack is responsive and while it has some minor issues (you don&apos;t have a command to evade, you can only block with certain classes), it makes an excelent job tranforming every major fight into an epic experience, it&apos;s not dark souls or devil may cry quality good, but it&apos;s pretty damn close.
<br>
<br>The dungeons in this game are fantastic, every one uses different textures and models, making them feel unique, from the big large caves, to the small quarry, you never feel you&apos;re experiencing the same dungeon multiple times (yes, i&apos;m looking at you skyrim). The standards found here are not present in the open world though, it is great and expansive but it lacks the quality of details found in dungeons and it can become repetitive at times, having said this it has a really good implementation of fast travel, you will need to find some stones and place them , only then you will be able to teleport to the stone location, it gives the player a big responsability since he/she needs to place them wisely and they are scarse.
<br>
<br>The game has a particular &quot;feel&quot; given by the artstyle and musics, it reminded me of the manga/anime series &quot;Berserk&quot;, and i wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the developers where actively influenced by it.
<br>
<br>Dragon&apos;s Dogma implements the &quot;pawn system&quot;: You will have your character and other 3, of these 3, one will be a second nonplayable character you create, and two will be the same but from other players. This character will learn stuff based on the quest you do and locations you explore and will be able to share this information with others online, the other 2 character are the same but from other players online.
<br>A real daring system but it works, and what works most of all it&apos;s the ai, IF it wouldn&apos;t work this game would be a disaster, luckly it does, the ai will know what to do, when to use certain spells and items. The game dares to remove most of your interaction with them, other than basic stuff you won&apos;t have to tell them what to do since you will be focussed on the great fighting, it trust its and your intelligence and it&apos;s a pleasure to have when playing at the hardest difficulty.
<br>This game respects the player, his skill and his decision making, it&apos;s hard but fair, and only throught this it achieves the epicness no other open world action rpg was ever able to achieve, when you fight a griffon or travers a &quot;hard&quot; zone or simply move into an uncharted area it&apos;s an adventure, you never know what you will find and what&apos;s gonna happen, and that&apos;s something really really few games can do.
<br>
<br>Talking about difficulty this game completely nails the &quot;night&quot; system, it&apos;s not only a graphic gimmick that obscures the land but keeps giving you vision (usually with the super light moon trick), here when it&apos;s night, it&apos;s night, you better have a lantern and oil or you&apos;re screwed, you will have a really hard time seeing and moving around, you really feel the urge to move before the night comes, again something really few games can do.
<br>
<br>There are some issues dragging this game down though, like a crafting system that it&apos;s too basic and almost seems forced in at the last minute, lipsync issues and loot that becomes repetitive and unrewarding after a while.
<br>
<br>The game features a clean an simple progression into the story, not many cinematic videos that interrupt gameplay, personally i really enjoyed this, but it can be a matter of tastes i guess.
<br>
<br>Undoubtedly one of the best games of the last generation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6693436">Expand</a></span>

Combat is exciting and satisfying with some cool mechanics such as the ability to climb onto monsters, pick them up, and coordinate with NPCs. The pawn system adds another level of complexity and provides an opportunity to impact other players&apos; experiences. The world overall seems well thought out and has plenty of little surprises to keep the game interesting and fun.
<br>
<br>I wish they had put more thought into the PC control conversion, but you get used to it because other aspects of the game make up for it (so much so that I wouldn&apos;t even dock its rating). You can tell that developers put a lot of thought into the subtle details that many games now tend to overlook (a wolf runs through a stream and stops on the other side to shake water from its fur; harvested foods spoil if left in your inventory too long; danger increases with nightfall, etc.). The graphics are still somewhat impressive and definitely acceptable despite the true age of the game. Overall, the game is very very good and probably one that I would consider in my top ten of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/user-reviews?user_review_id=6054306">Expand</a></span>
