Clearly, CLEARLY this title is aimed at a younger audience and features a very reasonable price to boot, yet it wasn&apos;t deep enough or worth the valuable time of the GS reviewer who must be (apparently) making a grand an hour if this game wasn&apos;t worth his efforts or a good score.  
<br>The game features great graphics, zero bugs, tons of unlocks, lots of on-screen action, a variety of settings, solid sound design, and excellently captures the toy series it&apos;s based off of.  Does the fact that it&apos;s easier (since it IS aimed at the younger audience) and some repetition equate to a full 48% off the score?  Makes you wonder about the rest of their reviews, doesn&apos;t it?

Though the gameplay is rather repetitive, it never gets boring because it is constantly throwing new stuff at you. Each boss is unique and even without talking have a personality. It does have a few flaws like the auto lock on which usually isn&apos;t a problem. It can make it hard to snipe though. I think it would also be okay if they added jumping. It would also be nice if the game was a bit more challenging. I&apos;ve completed the game many times with never even dying.
