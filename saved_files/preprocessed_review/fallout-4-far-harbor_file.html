<br>
<br>The story itself starts out great with the fog, the survivors and synth. But it pretty much boils down to nothing quickly. At the end of the DLC you have to pretty much decide the fate of the factions but none of the choices really matched what I wanted. But to clear the quests from my list I had to make a choice that pretty much made my personal opinion obsolete. Hard to get too involved in the story after that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-far-harbor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6781613">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To make it short - i am a little disappointed. However - not so much in the context of Fallout 4 and its content - but rather when i compare it to Fallout NV and its expansions.
<br>
<br>For the most part, i would compare Far Harbour to the Honest Hearts expansion of New Vegas. A big map - tough enemies and somewhat new weaponry and stuff - clearly aimed at the players who are either end game or near endgame.
<br>
<br>Far Harbour does however get beaten .... badly ... by Old World Blues in lore and humor, by Dead Money in terms of lore and atmosphere and by Lonesome Road in terms of backstory and also visual atmosphere.
<br>Far Harbour is not a bad expansion - but it does feel like it barely reaches above the necessary average.
<br>
<br>The new enemies are alright - but quite frankly, i have seen more variety and creativity in the modding community. The new weapons are nice additions - well modelled and fit in conceptually - but they are nothing astonishing. The survival mode ... well .. is part of the patch, but i ll just include it ... is very nice. However - considering it was kind of meant to be like that from the start ... it is a but a little late.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, the Far Harbour characters are rather boring. They are barebone archetypes at best. The storytelling does not exceed other Fallout 4 quest-lines ... so it is nither better nor worse much.
<br>
<br>In terms of visuals - Far Harbour slightly steps it up with thick mist and an overall damp wetness about the place; a good contrast to the very bright and dry wasteland. It does however come at a high price in terms of performance. In certain areas Far Harbour runs significantly worse than inner city locations in Boston.
<br>
<br>On a personal note.
<br>
<br>I believe to remember Bethesda saying that Far Harbour featured the largest expansion map/geography of any Fallout expansion - ever.
<br>That statement kind of stuck in my mind - and of course i went exploring and comparing to what i remember from older expansions (dating back to Fallout 3 expansions) ... and i came to the conclusion that
<br>
<br>&quot;...it certainly does not feel like it is bigger...&quot;
<br>
<br>Like the Fallout 4 map - Far Harbour feels cramped and stuffed full with things. You get factions mere meters from each other establishing bases in such vicinity that it does break (my) immersion. Old World Blues felt bigger in sheer geometry to me - and MUCH better paced in terms of encounters and storytelling.
<br>
<br>However - at the end of it all ... it is &quot;more&quot; of Fallout ... and although there is a lot to complain about in Fallout 4 ... one can enjoy and spend dozens of hours with the game. So this expansion is certainly not what i hoped for - but it is enough to have fun with for a good amount of time. Despite all the negative points, i have to admit that it is still fun to play - so i remain a 7/10 - above average</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-far-harbor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6482019">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, Far Harbor itself doesn&#x2019;t take too long to complete.
<br>
<br>There are many new characters in this DLC, but even with all the unique dialogue there are still many fetch quests on the side. There are a few unique new enemies present in this, but most are re-skins of enemies that already exist in the base game, such as the mirelurk enemies. It has a variety of new weapons and armor, though. Even so, I was extremely disappointed because there weren&#x2019;t many unique boss enemies in this DLC. I didn&#x2019;t find myself using the new weapons that much. There was even a sidequest called &#x201C;Great Hunt&#x201D; that had the most disappointing ending, for example.
<br>
<br>The main quests in this DLC don&#x2019;t take too long to complete, but one good thing is that there are several choices throughout the questline that can be made to affect the questline&#x2019;s ending. I actually did find myself playing the DLC again just to see what would happen if I made completely different decisions.
<br>
<br>Still, if you&#x2019;re familiar with these kinds of Bethesda games, you&#x2019;ll know how they&#x2019;ll recycle dialogues. In many of the &#x201C;non-major decision&#x201D; type conversations, any choice that you make your character say will lead to the same conclusion and will lead to the character you&#x2019;re speaking to saying the game thing. It&#x2019;s really the illusion of choice. It&#x2019;s only a few of the important conversations that completely change how the character responds.
<br>
<br>For the most part, the DLC goes very well until one gets to a certain point in the storyline. If you&#x2019;ve been reading news on this DLC, you&#x2019;ve probably heard of &#x201C;simulation puzzles&#x201D;. For reasons unbeknownst to me, the developers made it mandatory for you to complete these strange simulation puzzles where you move blocks to get your robotic creatures to an objective using crafting. My gripe isn&#x2019;t with the puzzles themselves, but how glitchy they are. Like any Bethesda game, you&#x2019;ll want to be making manual backups often due to their glitchy nature. I experienced every glitch that could be encountered in these simulation puzzles. I couldn&#x2019;t move my character, blocks were disappearing, my robotic creatures weren&#x2019;t moving even though I put the blocks to complete their path, and such. I had to even revert to a backup save of my backup save. In fact, when I played it, it seemed to be a gamebreaking glitch that would halt my progression in the DLC storyline.
<br>
<br>But for the most part, this DLC will add perhaps 5-10 hours of extra gameplay for Fallout 4. Definitely lengthier than the previous Automatron DLC and has a whole new interesting land for you to explore. Though, if you did play Point Lookout, you&#x2019;ll probably getting tired of the &#x201C;foggy island&#x201D; kind of environment.
<br>
<br>Like most DLC, it won&#x2019;t affect the main storyline of the base game. Though, oddly enough, the main quest in the DLC and its characters seems to be argued to be better than that of the base game itself. I would agree with that statement, but only because the decisions in the base game are very lacklustre.
<br>
<br>But, while it may be patched in the future, the puzzle simulation definitely reduces the score of this DLC. Even ignoring the technical issues with those puzzles, it just removes the fun from the actual game. When one plays Fallout, they want to explore, defeat enemies, collect items, and talk to other characters, not play a strange puzzle minigame that is susceptible to many glitches. They really should&#x2019;ve made it into optional content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-far-harbor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6461158">Expand</a></span>

<br>This DLC suffers from bloated map locations with the only purpose of housing a pile of hostiles; now I don&apos;t mind a good old shoot out but it gets ridiculous.
<br>
<br>When it come to game play the base game took a left turn, any DLC that follows suit will have the same elements and same flaws, this does just that.
<br>
<br>Map design  is is horrendous, hilly and platform like is limiting, the base game does this in areas as well, it is retarded, I have been forced to go lateral for one 5th the map trying to move forword, thank god for jetpack mods with no ap limitation. (the main quest will force some platform jumping in first person and floaty as hell) . I learned new colourful words such as **** and &quot;you **** **** good luck soldier.
<br>
<br>Download If you like the base game, its more to explore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-far-harbor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6446511">Expand</a></span>

I am lvl 106 now and Far Harbor has been my FAVOURITE experience of Fallout 4. It really feels like playing a Fallout game again, especially so with survival mode. I have gained 24 lvls doing every single sidequest, none of which crashed the game.  There has been some FPS drops due to my weak PC, but overall optimization is great and loading times are low. Characters feel REAL with real problems and beliefs and you can use your skills in conversations, like in older Fallout games, especially New Vegas. Music is absolutely gorgeous and memorable, as well as locations and new enemies. New companion is very interisting and has deep character. There are some consequences for joining different factions in Commonwealth as well. There are many ways of dealing with main quests as well as several sidequests, that have different story alternatives. This isn&apos;t reskin of Point lookout DLC from Fallout 3, it&apos;s better in many ways. I would recommend  buying Fallout 4 just for this DLC, it&apos;s awesome and Bethesday really did listen to their fanbase when creating it, however it&apos;s quite expensive now, so I am taking away 1 point. Thank you Bethesda for this DLC, stay great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-far-harbor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6474012">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Dialogue and quests are a big improvement over some of Fallout 4&apos;s areas where it fell a little flat. If that isn&apos;t enough for you, how about a HUGE world with a plethora of interesting locations, and (SMALL SPOILER AHEAD) a new Vault? Although I&apos;ve not done the quest associated with the new vault (Vault 118), I&apos;ve heard from those who&apos;ve done it, that it&apos;s one of if not the best Vault(s) in the Fallout series to date.
<br>
<br>Bethesda in my opinion (As well as the opinion of most others) clearly listened to player feedback in terms of adding more RPG elements to Fallout 4. All in all, yes Far Harbor is worth it. And I have no idea why someone would give it a bad or even mixed review. (Unless because of performance reasons. In that case though they should post a review explaining that).
<br>
<br>TL;DR Far Harbor is huge, detailed, has a lot more RPG depth, a lot of new interesting quests, locations, weapons/armor, interesting characters. It&apos;s worth the buy, even if you&apos;re disappointed with the base game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-far-harbor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6416766">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Dear Bethesda, stop hiring accountants and Wall-Street hacks to design your games. RUN THEM OFF! GET THE MONEY WH@RES OUT OF YOUR OFFICE! Games are made by artists, writers, people with talent. When you start listening to finance hacks, &#x2018;Wall Street&#x2019; con-artists, you end up designing garbage that no one wants to buy. YOU MAKE LESS MONEY!
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;m all about capitalism, sorry socialists. The number one killer of innovation, and riches? The money guys who proclaim: We need recurring revenue! We want monthly payments from gamers! Charge as much as we can, spend as little as possible! Companies get rich by developing quality, they don&#x2019;t chase trends, they listen to the artists, designers, smart writers, and the people with talent.
<br>
<br>RIP Bethesda, you were great, but whor@d yourself out. I&#x2019;m no longer a customer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-far-harbor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6464478">Expand</a></span>

Its the only thing that makes you forget from time to time how **** monotone and generic the content is. They even managed to lower the quest variations of the main game. Almost every **** quest is &quot;run to this point and kill everything that moves&quot; while the rest of this poorly cobbled together DLC is &quot;run there and collect this&quot;.
<br>You dont give a **** about any of the new characters or even yourself. You just run trough this turd of a DLC, looking at the clock and waiting for it to end.
<br>Not even the enemies here are unique. They are either just reskins or bigger versions.
<br>The story is extremely predictable. You actually know exactly how this **** is going to end from the moment you put a foot on this island.
<br>They put no effort in the dialogues, in fact you will notice that everything sounds recyceled. Its like you heard the story 3 times before in the main game, just with other words and your dialogue choices doesnt matter. Its like sitting on the toilet taking a crap. If you crap then there will be a turd in the bowel. If you dont you might be able to hold it in for some time but in the end you have to drop it and the result is the same.
<br>Another big issue is the balancing. You can put 200 or more rounds into certain enemies with your strongest weapon and they are still standing. There were a lot of cases where I ran out of ammo and had to stab or bash the enemies to death because a simple knife or the friendlier end of a rifle are far more effective than bullets actually.
<br>And the playtime is not even worth it. Most of those 10h you will be stucked in this glitchy memory level or pointlessly run from 1 end of the map to the other.
<br>
<br>Seriously, I have played mods for the main agme that had:
<br>More content
<br>- Better and more interesting storytelling
<br>- Much better balancing
<br>- Better fighting mechanics
<br>- and less glitches and bugs than this miscarriage of a DLC
<br>
<br>And on top of that these mods are completely free.
<br>How the **** can somebody who creates content as hobby be more successful than a multi million dollar game company???
<br>
<br>With that DLC my last hopes for FO4 died. The next DLC probably will be the same.
<br>Wait until the season pass is down to 15$ before you should even think about it to buy it. This **** isnt worth your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-far-harbor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6594128">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons: There was this one section of the game that was completely random and uncalled for: it was a puzzle section that was really similar to what you would expect from a Portal 2 game. I absolutely hated it, and I don&apos;t understand what went through the developers minds to include this. It&apos;s part of the main quest, so it&apos;s unskippable without exploits, but it ended up taking me 2-3 hours to figure out. Other players have reported similar, even longer times.... It ended up being one of the most frustrating and boring moments, not just of Fallout 4, but of any game I&apos;ve ever played. No one expects this &quot;difficult puzzle&quot; part when they bought this game, and it made the entire Far Harbor experience almost not worth it.
<br>
<br>Tips:
<br>Bring Nick Valentine.
<br>If you&apos;re playing on console, god help you. The cheat codes for PC players to skip the godforsaken memory garbage are as follows
<br>setstage dlc03mq04 150
<br>setstage dlc03mq04 250
<br>setstage dlc03mq04 350
<br>setstage dlc03mq04 450
<br>setstage dlc03mq04 550
<br>
<br>you probably only need the last one, but seriously, whoever at bethesda thought this was a good idea should be fired. it was so bad it greatly influenced my which faction i destroyed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-far-harbor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6708503">Expand</a></span>

Taking inspiration from Stephen king&apos;s novel the entire storyline, map layout and overall ambience will keep you hooked and fully immersed. If the player approaches the storyline correctly he will be awarded with 20 hours of stimulating gameplay. Finishing the storyline can however be achieved in less than half of this time but is not recommended. The only real drawback in this dlc is the Dima simulation missions that felt completely unnecessary and excessively tedious. Please bear in mind that only 3 out of the 5 simulations are needed to progress through the storyline. The last level will temporarily lobotomise the part of your brain responsible for patience and will turn you into a human version of an infuriated Deathclaw.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-far-harbor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6459235">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>It sad me, bc this game will get attack quick, but the true this DLC is really good, it add alot that was missing on the main game.
<br>
<br>Bethesda promise us the biggest land mass THEY have ever done and is true it is, is bigger that Dragonborn. The place is amazing and the whole isle take around 20-25hs to complete so as a DLC is worth the price.</span>

The DLC brings nothing memorable. Possibly 1 of the most underwhelming DLCs after playing some of the best stuff out there recently.</span>
