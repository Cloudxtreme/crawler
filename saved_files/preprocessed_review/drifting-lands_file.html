<br>- some skills are CLEARLY better than others or even almost mandatory (like auto-retreat)
<br>- Huge amount of customization at first turns out to be mostly for show. It almost all comes down to 3 simple stats and a few percentage bonuses.
<br>- the weapons in particular are a HUGE disappointment. Out of about a dozen different weapontypes, i find only 3 remotely useful. In the end i only use either lasers or Railguns. I would have wished for the option to either be allowed to switch to an alternative weapon during the levels or mix and match mechanics of two weapon types.
<br>
<br>neutral:
<br>- the story is forgettable and the storytelling feels like an afterthought
<br>
<br>other thoughts:
<br>
<br>This game fails hard where it wanted to shine - i think. There is no urge to grind for &quot;the perfect loadout&quot;, No will to &quot;play just another level for the chance to get a really outstanding item&quot;.
<br>
<br>Items seem to be tailored to the players level - that means once you get mostly appropriate items - 99.999999% of any further drops become useless. To compare - in Diablo (which the game was advertised to be compared to) - there is a chance to get items that singlehandedly elevate a mediocre character to a very powerful one. In Drifting Lands ... i do not think there is anything like that.
<br>
<br>I only managed to get to Grade 3 though ( out of 12 mind ) - so you HAVE to keep in mind that i only just scratched whats beneath. - but in several hours of gameplay - i have found no items that was really outstanding. No weapon with a unique effect (as in graphics, damage or way it fires) - i found uniques - but they are usually normal items with 1 characteristic that you cannot find on rares - and they usually break when you retreat.
<br>
<br>All in all - at THIS moment - the game is a disappointment, not because it is particularly bad - but because there is a lot of potential that is not used.
<br>
<br>I can give it a 5/10 for being about average. Compared to the countless other side scrolling shoot em ups however ... it is very hard to compete or find a place. I&apos;d go so far to say that is is a VERY good mobile game - but quite underwhelming for PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drifting-lands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7383893">Expand</a></span>
