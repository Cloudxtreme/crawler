<br>
<br>You have no idea who you are and where you are. You just know that you have to run!
<br>
<br>Although lacking an actual storyline, this manages to captivate you and let you get immersed into it&apos;s weird block world. At first it starts out with a simple and relaxed pace and you feel like it&apos;s gonna be one of those &quot;Run and Enjoy&quot; games. But the intensity begins building up exponentionally that towards the end you don&apos;t know where your head is! It&apos;s an exhilarating and thrilling journey.
<br>
<br>The music is pure genius and in my opinion makes up half the game&apos;s worth! It perfectly matches each setting you encounter in the game, using strange avant-garde sounds and electronic alien-like instruments, which at certain points of the game gave me chills all over.
<br>
<br>The graphics are so simple and yet manage to create amazing and beautiful worlds. A real treat for the eyes.
<br>
<br>Therefore, I can honestly say this is one of the best games I&apos;ve played in years. It&apos;s something completely new. It&apos;s a game which seems to have no point at first, but in the end you have to pick up your jaw from the floor and wonder what the hell you just played. It is truly a work of art.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/naissancee/user-reviews?user_review_id=4062835">Expand</a></span>

<br>On an emotional level this game really delivers.
<br>
<br>At first you explore simple yet confined level structures that very soon give way to absolutely monumental feeling set pieces that will have you in awe.
<br>The art style is in itself consistent and works very well, especially when paired with the rather excellent audio design. This visual and acoustic experience seems to always matche perfectly.
<br>The game really manages to deliver a wide range of experiences and emotions, from feeling lost in a huge and fascinating world to adrenaline pumping action sequences and solving the occasional puzzle, it does it all very well.
<br>
<br>The one thing I especially enjoyed is the at times very clever level design. While being a linear game with areas for you to explore it never feels like it is linear. In fact, I could swear I was making my way through at random or at being driven by interesting set pieces.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t however expect much of a story. Not in the traditional sense anyways. Whatever happened or happens is up to your imagination. That is a good thing though.
<br>
<br>All in all, if you&apos;re looking for a game that will take you on a bit of an emotional rollercoaster ride while making you feel small, forgotten and alone, then play it.
<br>
<br>The thing that stayed most with me is the level design. Simply brilliant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/naissancee/user-reviews?user_review_id=3966940">Expand</a></span>

<br>Outwith scenes apart, the physical puzzles inside use the player&apos;s reflexes and speed as well as their wits and puzzle-solving skills to move forward. This offers a pause in the exploration and &apos;admiring&apos; of the gigantic outside vistas.
<br>As the game progresses it adopts a more surreal tone, which, in my opinion, goes perfectly well with the whole Lovecraftian feel the game has for me. The last chapters truly amaze and surprise you as you get nearer to the end. Truly a surprising and refreshing experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/naissancee/user-reviews?user_review_id=4008712">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a little bit of puzzling, and a little bit of platforming, and a whole lot of wandering around through the beautifully designed and expansive monolithic structures. I&apos;m only a few hours in, and this game already has accomplished what it sets out to do: I&apos;m terrified, exhilarated, and I feel horribly alone. I have the sinking feeling that there&apos;s no one else and I&apos;m trapped alone in this richly detailed world to wander by myself. The whole world feels timeless and massive, and the environmental interactions by the character make me feel as if I&apos;m being toyed with by some higher being. While this isn&apos;t the  most compelling game, and might consist of too much walking for some, this game is chillingly beautiful and conjures the most alien sense of isolation I have ever experienced. The lighting and shadows are also pure art. One of the better indie games I have played recently.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/naissancee/user-reviews?user_review_id=3965700">Expand</a></span>

I had particular impressions of the style of BLAME! at times. At others, another great game, Kairo came to mind.  The overall tone is not a happy one, so beware. Loneliness and confusion bordering on madness are the overarching theme.
<br>
<br>The choices the game sometimes throws at you are also very satisfying despite their ambiguity and certainly warrant at least a second playthrough. There are puzzles, there is platforming and there even are eastereggs and traps.
<br>
<br>The sound design is also brilliant, with a constant ambient soundtrack that perfectly compliments the scenery.
<br>
<br>The only negative points I have to mention are the sometimes questionably spaced checkpoints during hectic platforming parts. This is manageable though, if a bit frustrating.
<br>Also, I felt the game could overall have done with a bit more puzzling and a bit less platforming.
<br>
<br>But those are minor gripes and do not take away from an, in my opinion, resounding success.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/naissancee/user-reviews?user_review_id=3967428">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles, at least during the first hour or so which was all I could endure, involve pressing light switches to move floating light sources around that make certain platforms appear and disappear. At first it looks like a clever mechanic like Closure (but in 3D), but it&apos;s really just switches. In HUGE levels, with no particular idea of where you&apos;re supposed to be going or why. It isn&apos;t open exploration, there&apos;s a linear route - and it&apos;s just intentionally not marked out well, or indeed at all. It&apos;s like: if I crawl through this little space here and jump over these boxes I&apos;m in the &quot;next&quot; area, which is much like the last one except the boxes are a different way round. The gigantic scale looks good, but it&apos;s dull to wander round it. Another game that had this problem was EYE: Divine Cybermancy - if you&apos;ve played the particular couple of maps in that with vast outdoor areas that take five minutes to walk across but have nothing to interact with or particularly look at on the way, that&apos;s pretty much NaissanceE. Only, without anything to do at the end of the long walk, or anything to look at on the way other than grey boxes.
<br>
<br>Another puzzle that annoyed me early on involved navigating down a big grey &quot;lift shaft&quot; type thing by hopping from ledge to ledge (long drops kill you forcing a return to the last save), and the puzzle is that the only available light source slowly drifts up and down the middle of the &quot;lift shaft&quot; so that you have to wait 30 seconds between each jump. I hate it when games make things difficult in the game that would be easy if you were physically there - and in this case could feel for the sheer drops at the edges of the ledges.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m being really down on this game. It does have a moody, mysterious atmosphere going for it. But probably so would Halo if you removed the plot and replaced all the scenery with grey boxes and put a sort of pixelly filter over the front of everything. And it could well have profound spiritual revelations waiting further into the game, about loneliness, or whether anything means anything... but I just have a creeping suspicion that I could get the same revelations by walking around a shopping mall at night wearing dark glasses. They seem to be patching it lots, and it&apos;s a genuine indie not a cynical cash-in, I could just have done with more freedom to get lost walking round a huge grey building, the linearity at the start was a huge disappointment. Back to Anti-Chamber for me!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/naissancee/user-reviews?user_review_id=4014329">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, all the positives that others spoke of, mood, emotion, exploration etc. I simply could not find nor feel. The levels are big, but it&apos;s still essentially quite linear. Some parts really are nice to look at, as it the music to listen to. But the large map size means lots of sameness. I started to groan once I had to jump moving platforms. And it&apos;s not an exploration of anything, you&apos;re just running to the end, and the end is, well, a relief but not much else. To be a good platformer, it needs a lot more detail throughout, and inventiveness. To be a good exploration game, it needs more story background also. But where it is now, it&apos;s basically running, jumping, lights, platforms and lots of corridors and edges. It just about holds the attention, just barely, plus the sometimes nice areas, a 4 for good effort but could have been more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/naissancee/user-reviews?user_review_id=4905116">Expand</a></span>

It has extremely minimalistic graphics style, a lot of running, some frustrating physics-based puzzles, no story and an overall feeling of madness.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>- the graphics are stylish. They show how you can make an interesting and even pretentiously looking game by only using geometric primitives (mostly boxes) and only gray color (very rarely with some slight variations of gray). The game has a unique and definitive graphics style
<br>- much of the visual greatness and even a few puzzles are built around the play of light. Overall there isn&apos;t much light in most levels, and the realistic light sources (white boxes) are scarce
<br>- vast levels, especially the city-like level where you go down. I wonder how even Unreal engine could render such a huge number of objects. Maybe the fact that they are just boxes and are all gray helped? Still, they seem to use realistic lighting
<br>- music is mostly good, sometimes even great, though I didn&apos;t like a few tracks (e.g. the last boss chase is annoying in its own, but the music makes it almost unbearable)
<br>
<br>The so-so:
<br>- there just isn&apos;t much you can do in the game. I wonder if the &quot;use&quot; key is actually ever used. You mostly run around, sometimes press buttons by stepping on them or running at them, or touch a light sphere to make it show the way. Also you jump and sprint (with a breath system which could as well be left out because it doesn&apos;t add anything and ends ups up being just a useless chore). Still, the scarcity of actions doesn&apos;t spoil the game, it just makes the puzzles somewhat limited
<br>- the game lacks a sense of purpose or meaning. You solve a puzzle and don&apos;t get any reward or even a feeling of accomplishment - you just run forward to find another puzzle. There is a slight gratification in seeing vast new spaces for the first time, or simply moving on to the next area - but since no story connects the levels, the game feels arbitrary.
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- the jumping physics is somewhat clunky: you sometimes can&apos;t jump up on boxes in front of you. This also makes the sludges puzzle unnecessarily difficult because your character&apos;s collisions and jumps inside the sludge are pretty random
<br>- there seems to be a bug that when running in a wind, you sometimes lose touch with the ground when pressing the sprint key, and you can&apos;t move any more. If you jump, you get instantly flown away and killed. This bug makes the level with tubes and ventilators extrememly frustrating, because you have to restart and retry sections many time until this bug doesn&apos;t happen and you can complete a section.
<br>- a lot of running, and in a few cases the correct way forward is hidden in a huge area - you may spend 15 minutes just running around, wondering what&apos;s needed from you, only to find out that a tiny stars is hidden behind a ramp somewhere. The game just artificially lengthens your playtime by making you run around a lot. I thought it took me 8-10 hours to beat the game but, judging from Steam stats, it&apos;s just 5 hours.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a good game, and during the first 2 levels I wanted to give it a 9/10, especially after seeing the masterpiece 2nd level. However, the bugs in physics and the frustrating puzzles based on it, and the super-annoying final level make me reduce the rating to 8/10. It&apos;s still a very good game though, so if you&apos;re into indie games, don&apos;t get scared by its dull screenshots and give it a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/naissancee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7377015">Expand</a></span>

<br>I personally enjoy it&apos;s frustrating dumbness because the atmosphere and the design is really good. In case you don&apos;t know Pauline Oliveros is a huge experimental music composer that does music since the 60&apos;s or so. She&apos;s part of modern music history and that was the main reason i tried this game.
<br>And as Arainami says so, An apparently famous manga artist did the level design. Which is to say minimalistic but intriguing enough to make you keep playing.
<br>Puzzles are based on variation of space, light and air. cool heh?
<br>
<br>i think you would enjoy this game mostly for aesthetics reasons. I has a strong poetic potential. It is far from perfect, gameplay wise, but still for the weird atmosphere and design, it deserve a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/naissancee/user-reviews?user_review_id=5387395">Expand</a></span>

Mam nadziej&#x119;, &#x17C;e b&#x119;dziecie si&#x119; przy nim bawi&#x107; tak dobrze, jak ja.
<br>
<br>Plusy:
<br>+ klimat!!!
<br>+ sugestywny i tajemniczy &#x15B;wiat gry
<br>+ ogromne, budz&#x105;ce zachwyt struktury
<br>+ projekt i wygl&#x105;d etap&#xF3;w
<br>+ balans czerni z biel&#x105;, &#x15B;wiat&#x142;a i ciemno&#x15B;ci
<br>+ &#x15B;wietna muzyka
<br>
<br>Minusy:
<br>&#x2013; absolutny brak fabu&#x142;y
<br>&#x2013; mog&#x142;oby by&#x107; wi&#x119;cej zagadek logicznych
<br>&#x2013; niekiedy irytuj&#x105;ce elementy zr&#x119;czno&#x15B;ciowe
<br>&#x2013; &#x2026; i sterowanie
