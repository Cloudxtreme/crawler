Definitely worth a look if you can get it cheap though and another good example of the AGS engine&apos;s capabilities.</span>

In the game, the planet has been introduced to a second ice age. Snowing is constant. People form gangs. People loot, kill and rob. We follow the story of Richard and Alice, two people who are trapped in jail and who want to escape. The gameplay consists of either controlling Richard during the escape, and Alice during her flashbacks of her backstory and her son, Barney.
<br>Some people believe that the graphics are primitive, but in my opinion, I kinda enjoy the pixelated, simplistic look. I thought that the puzzles were decent enough. And plus, there are five available different endings to discover! What&apos;s more intriguing is that a single tiny difference in the way you play can totally change the outcome. It also comes with some emotional baggage!
<br>To summarize, Richard and Alice is a great game everybody should try. It&apos;s unique and despite short-length, it surely delivers a great story. Too bad people are so negative about this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/richard-alice/user-reviews?user_review_id=5057498">Expand</a></span>
