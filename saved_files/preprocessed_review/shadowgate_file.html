<br>Pros:
<br>Puzzles generally are logical
<br>Interesting story sequences
<br>Large variety of difficulty levels with the option to disallow saving
<br>Option to use legacy controls or use an updated option selection wheel
<br>Pretty artwork
<br>Option to highlight clickable items

<br>Cons:
<br>Dated graphics (I assume this was meant to give it a throwback feel)
<br>Can be annoying to run back and forth through the rooms
<br>Sometimes puzzle clues are in video sequences that cannot be replayed (Pay Attention!)
<br>
<br>Generally a great game if you want an old school point and click with updated features.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowgate/user-reviews?user_review_id=4876805">Expand</a></span>

When I first saw this version on Greenlight, I could not hit the &quot;yes&quot; button enough. The screenshots and teaser videos was more than enough for me to get very excited. When release day finally came, I was not disappointed. Lots of familiar moments with lots of changes. The art is beautiful, the music repetitious but very nice. Strangely enough, the classic NES soundtrack is available as an option as well (I  personally loved it). For an old man like me, this game is heaven-sent and sends me back to my childhood. Question is, will this game hold up to a very fickle, modern gaming audience? I want to say &quot;yes&quot;, but chances are, it will probably fly under the radar. It&apos;s a point and click puzzle solver, yet it is not anything like Myst. This is something to experience if one has not already. I would personally recommend it, but I have to remember that&apos;s my own strong bias talking, and I have to remember this game will not be for everybody. Therefore, if you want an FPS dungeon crawler with fluid action, this game is not for you. If you do not like puzzle games such as Myst, this game is not for you. Otherwise, give this game a go. It&apos;s a nice experience. Really. === tl;dr === Pros: Stunning artwork, easy to use interface, lots of help, good music, responsive controls. Lots of puzzles to solve! Cons: Point and click adventure. May be too short for the experienced puzzle solver. Some may be turned off by the fanboys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowgate/user-reviews?user_review_id=4426778">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t understand people&apos;s thinking.  If you don&apos;t know what Shadowgate is go back to your call of doody!

Thankfully there are ways to keep the old flame burning. Shadowgate is one of these old flames. Not many games can match the atmosphere and ambiance of this gem. Puzzles that vex the mind or art and illustrations that bring you wonder. Many choices you can make against the harshness of the very game itself. This game will be a challenge to you and if you play long enough you will find yourself hooked.
