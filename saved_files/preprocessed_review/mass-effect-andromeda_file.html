I&apos;m a huge fan of the mass effect series 1-2-3. own 1 and 2 on steam and 1-2-3 on origin and 1-2-3 on the ps3. So trust me when i say i was all in to let some minor errors out of the way and enjoy my time in Andromeda. But enough is enough, horrible looking PC especially on the female side, absolutely horrifying looking NPC and animations, sub-par dialogue and game breaking bugs made me decide to put and end to this torture and stop playing this spawn of corporate greedy hell. It makes me feel like bioware just went out and fired the talented people that made the Mass Effect trilogy and replaced them with people that never designed a character in their lives along with the worst animators they could get, and on top of that they decided to rush the game so the already horrible content looks even worse. The Planets do look amazing, to absolutely stunning and immersive and they are one of the few reasons this game gets some points on my list, though on the other side the very few enemy types you get to fight is depressing. It doesn&apos;t take long to realize from one planet to another the enemies are pretty much the same with some color variations. The gameplay is actually fun and dynamic which gives some satisfaction, but then come the bugs to make you remember this game is no fun with enemies getting stuck on roof, ice, or anywhere were you can&apos;t kill them unless you reload a previous save...and that is just one of the many bugs the game has(enemies won&apos;t attack when you are clearly shooting them, getting stuck, falling in a hole and teleporting to a completely different part of the map, doors inside your ship not opening after entering that room...and a big etc). Your crew relationship feels kinda shallow, Liam is probably the best done but making him only decent, I couldn&apos;t relate to them like i did with Garrus or Tali for example and some of the writing in the game makes you think they hired a teenager to do it, and not a very talented one at that. The music improves and actually makes you feel you&apos;re playing Mass Effect, but when in each cutscene you see the horrible characters with the hideous creepy animations and the sub par writing... making that Mass Effect should shine in those regards it just ruins the experience, i could never immerse and enjoy the ride this game should be, do to this awfully done things. I just regret preordering and not asking for a refund upon the 72 hours after release, since i was hoping at some point it will improve... it doesn&apos;t...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7178659">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I will never again pre-order, nor even buy a BW game until its been well reviewed (by users, not bogus &quot;professional critics&quot;).  Do not be fooled by the 8-10 ratings, EA/BW employees are on here creating fake reviews to try to put lipstick on this boring boring pig.  There&apos;s no way anyone who played and loved prior ME titles could accept this horrible addition.
<br>
<br>I have been a BioWare fan for the longest time, from KOTOR, to Dragon Age and especially the Mass Effect series which I&apos;ve literally logged thousands of hours on.  I would count down the days to their next release.  I&apos;m one of the few that loved ME3, I didn&apos;t have a problem with an ending with the death of the player or even crew, everything has to end sometime and I was ready for a new setting.
<br>
<br>DA I was the first long anticipated release for me of a game I never did a second playthrough despite many play throughs in prior titles of the series.  I hoped the ME series would be spared this, but apparently not.
<br>
<br>There is so much that is wrong with this game!
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve come to expect great story telling from a BioWare title and this fails at that with an awful and boring story that only starts to get mildly interesting towards the end.
<br>
<br>BioWare chose high volume, low value corporate form fitted checklist content over substance and art.  The game is replete with boring, excessive, pointless dialog, delivered emotionless and without the gravitas of the prior titles.  You can easily see this YouTubing some dialog from ME1-3 and compare to some dialog in ME A.  The dialog drones on in monotone from emotionless faces (even with the latest patch), making you want to skip it all.
<br>
<br>The checklist style seems to have bled into the quests, which like DAI are MMO style low value boring fetch quests that have little to no impact on the core story.  In ME1-3, the side quests for the most part had everything to do with the core story!
<br>
<br>There&apos;s even checklists for political correctness issues which are awkwardly forced into the game seemingly for no other purpose than for people to see that BioWare is a very progressive organization.  They don&apos;t contribute to the story, only distract from it.
<br>
<br>The squadmates are bland and completely forgettable.  The new alien species and planets are cliche - desert world, ice world, oversized mushroom world, ....
<br>
<br>Instead of quests ending with plot twists, like Cerberus spoiling your plans and setting up for a Reaper takeover of Thessia, we get anti-climatic alien Sudoku puzzles!  How do these even fit into an RPG?  That is nothing but laziness!
<br>
<br>Oh, and because BioWare apparently views women as some sort of inferior gender that will suffer psychologically by seeing attractive models in a game, they made all character models butt ugly.  I mean really ugly, especially compared to prior releases (they did the same in DA I).  Not only that, clearly they wanted to prevent us from making an attractive player in the character creation by allowing a choice of 8 hideous heads and minimal ability to modify them.  The CC has been gimped, you can make a clown but you can&apos;t make a character that looks like you or is attractive.
<br>
<br>While I like the enhanced mobility of the jump jets and the flexibility on the skills, taking out the pause (situational awareness), ability to load out teammates, and the ridiculous 3 power limit dumbs down the action to a basic shooter.  I think that is the point.  BioWare wants to move this to multiplayer and microtransactions so they wanted SP to be exactly like MP play.
<br>
<br>This game is a boring waste of time.  Do not buy unless you like a space shooter and don&apos;t care about terrible story, voice acting, dialog, etc...  BioWare is just a shell company now, banking on nostalgia to carry them through the next few limp-wristed deliveries.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7245253">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>GOOD:
<br>- Vast, new Galaxy to explore with aswesome new planets and places to see.
<br>- Some interesting side-characters and team mates (sadly, not level of trilogy crew).
<br>- Absolutely great combat system, dynamic, fluid, smooth. Good balance between risk and cover combat at higher difficulties.
<br>- 3 new interesting spieces.
<br>- Exploration is done much better than in DA:I
<br>- A lot of dialogues and side quest
<br>- Quite long game
<br>- Very good overall visuals of everything but character faces.
<br>
<br>BAD:
<br>- Generic, boring story. Same scheme for everything. There is nothing deep or ambitious here. Bioware played it 100% safe, no controversy, no emotions, nothing memorable.
<br>- Many sides quests, but quality is low. Many quests are simple &quot;track, kill, pick up, deliver&quot; or &quot;scan the hell out of this area&quot;. More story side-quests are also mostly generic and boring, not even one memorable quest with some sort of plot twist. BioWare should learn from Witcher 3 story quests.
<br>- Your team mates are shallow, cliche and many times irritating (PeeBee...god...). I din&apos;t want to romance anyone in the end, since your right hand seems more interesting and sexy than any of NPCs.
<br>- Animations are tragedy. This could be forgiven 5 years ago. But we have 2017 and animations are immersion-breaking. Dialogues which suppose to sound tough, emotional, serious are being destroyed by stupid eye rolls, creepy facial espressions and smiles that arre totally oposite to the voice and scene tone. Absolutely garbage. This is RPG game and belive me- you will spend A HELL LOT OF TIME speaking with many different NPCs. Animations will make you skip and speed trough them just to not see this crap.
<br>- Character Creation is easy the worst in any AAA RPG I have ever played. Why did BioWare just not include DA:I CC? I have no idea. It&apos;s like they want to force you to play their &quot;child faces&quot; twins...
<br>- Faces are awufull. Textures are low res even on 2K on Ultra, lightning is tragedy, as characters many times look like plastic dolls, not living beings.
<br>- Exploration, while better than in DA:I is till just a time waste and it just try to force you into beliving that game is longer and has more content than it really has. Jumping puzzles, scanning everything is boring, boring, boring. And why our new car does not have Cannon like Mako had? I have no idea....
<br>- Combat- ther variety of skills is great but you can only equip 3...that is a joke, especially on PC, where you could easy have 5-6 of them. 3 makes combat not as complex as it could be with more active skills.
<br>- Crafting is useless feature, again it is just to force you to play longer (grind for materials).
<br>- Music is just average. Not as good as in ME1 or ME2 by a long shot.
<br>- Game just feels rushed, unpolished, unfinished. If you focus while you play you can see that many thing were not finished.
<br>- Last but not least- main protagonists are absolutely joke and in many situations they seem like sort of &quot;space teens power rangers&quot; that try hard to be serious and mature. You can&apos;t even compare them to Shepard.
<br>
<br>Overall, let me sum this up:
<br>Game is big, but this is illusion, like DA:I was. Empty maps with useless activities, improved exploration which sadly gets boring after first 10-15 hours. Everything feels unfinished, rushed, beta stage. Story is cliche, boring and without any good plot-twists. Honestly - I can hardly remember it after beating it. Nothing memorable really happened. Combat is great but why so limited with active skills? Animations are great in combat and absolutely garbage B-grade outside of it- expresions, walking, lipsync- just bleh.
<br>
<br>Very average game, but touching a little &quot;good game&quot; territory. As a great ME fan (over 1000h in trilogy and 450h in ME3 MP) I am very dissapointed what has become of my favourite RPG universe.
<br>
<br>6/10, for combat mostly and planets/areas.
<br>
<br>BioWare- you should be ashamed. But you won&apos;t since it&apos;s all about money. There is not good people left there and no passion for gaming.
<br>
<br>Try to be like CD Project Red Please. Try again to create game with love.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7101407">Expand</a></span>

Off-key voice acting delivering already cringeworthy lines makes things even worse. I mean, after you get confronted by a hostile alien commander of some sort who tries to capture your ship, all your character can muster is &quot;I wonder who THAT guy was?&quot;.

<br>
<br>I see a lot of folks dismissing the negative reviews as from &quot;haters&quot; or that its just people uptight about the freaky animations but this game&apos;s problems go way deeper.  I for one am willing to overlook animation issues, I wish it was just that.
<br>
<br>I think if you like shooters and can stomach bad story, bad dialog and voice acting, and ugly characters, you will be ok with this game.   If you get this game expecting to be taken back to the space fantasy world of Mass Effect for another thrilling adventure, you&apos;re in for a grave disappointment.
<br>
<br>I was and am ready to let go of the Milky Way, Shephard, and all that.  I appreciate good combat and free exploration but to me those are smaller concerns in an RPG.  I am not willing to let go of mature dialog, great voice acting, interesting characters to build relationships with, a compelling story I can&apos;t put down, fun side quests that contribute to the story, and, quite frankly, pretty people to look at in the game.
<br>
<br>Mass Effect Andromeda throws all that away.  In it&apos;s place are childish and ugly characters, silly meaningless filler dialog, poor voice acting, tedious and repetitive quests, anti-climatic quest resolutions many of which end in idiotic alien Sudoku puzzles, and forced repeated animations (you&apos;ll get really tired of seeing your ship take-off and land from the Nexus, I was within the first day of playing!).  Sorry but Sudoku puzzles are a symptom of laziness of the development effort, instead of creatively coming up with a suspenseful and interesting quest ending, maybe with a plot twist, you stick an el cheapo puzzle there.
<br>
<br>Nothing about this game is memorable.  The quests just don&apos;t seem to matter, the squadmates are bland and lifeless - I wouldn&apos;t care if they all died, if fact I prefer it because maybe I could then get a squad of interesting people.
<br>
<br>Like many other aspects of this game, quests are tedious and unrewarding, boxes to check off.  Most quests are everyone&apos;s busy work they can&apos;t be bothered to do, go here, scan this, fetch that.  All very anti-climatic with little to no bearing on the central story.
<br>
<br>Like in DA I, BioWare makes it a top priority to shoe-horn political correctness issues into the game,  PC lesson number one is some perverted Harrison Burgeron fantasy that everyone in the universe is exactly equally beautiful &quot;in their own way&quot; and to prove it they made all the characters except 1 or 2 ugly, especially the females.  That intentional marring of the game visuals will apparently teach us all a valuable lesson in accepting others as desexualized androngenous beings.
<br>
<br>I very much applaud the fact they make these games appeal to both genders and LBGT, it&apos;s wonderful everyone can find something they like in these games.  But what we don&apos;t need are 20th/21st century earth social issues shoe-horned into a futuristic space fantasy, that&apos;s called immersion breaking.  We play these games because we&apos;re trying to temporarily escape this world, not be reminded of it.
<br>
<br>Character creation is easily the worst of any RPG ever.  It&apos;s &quot;choose one of these 8 hideously ugly heads&quot; and then you can make only slight changes unless you want to add bizarre facial tatooing, geisha-white full face paint, and purple/pink/cyan/cherry red cotton candy clown hair (yes those are all choices!).  You can choose you to be ugly or a clown or both.  It boggles the mind what they were thinking with the CC.
<br>
<br>Some of the combat has been nicely streamlined and you&apos;d be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn&apos;t love the new jump jets.  There&apos;s more skills and more flexibility.  however one key very unique thing, the ability to control squadmates and powers was removed from the game, a critical mistake and I can&apos;t imagine why they did this!  I have literally played SP ME3 and ME3 a hundred times plus out of enjoyment of this combat system.  You can&apos;t even equip your squadmates who are reduced to bots who follow you around and then do stupid things in combat you can&apos;t control.
<br>
<br>They needed to put more immediacy into this game, perhaps made the quest line a race against the clock to save the Nexus from being shutdown/destroyed before everyone woke up, etc... and then focused the planet explorations in a series of DLC or next project.  I don&apos;t know, it just never seemed that important to get anything done.
<br>
<br>The game plays very similar to DA I where you encounter fiends all over the world who constantly respawn like in a shooter.  This was fun at first but since all the enemies are largely the same, it grows to tedium quick.  It also creates the feeling that it just doesn&apos;t matter.
<br>
<br>This game is a terrible disappointment, many of my 80+ hours into it were forced and like DA I, I don&apos;t see going back to this game unless some modders change it substantially.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7198178">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. Writing is childish, like really boring. Here and there it made you smile but it was far less than in trilogy.
<br>
<br>2. Story is just a place holder, nothing epic. Feels like they wanted it to be just average.
<br>
<br>3. Animations, are are a HUGE disaster. If EA will be happy with sales of Andromeda they will create another mess like this and sell it. So be prepared.
<br>
<br>They treat it like any another company, -make the game at lowest cost possible, sell as AAA game.
<br>Witcher 3 is an exception.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7194235">Expand</a></span>

Ive played the original trilogy for almost 600 hours, read all the books and even some of the **** comics.  Love the word an series the old bioware created
<br>
<br>Im at a loss of what to rate this game, at times it can feel like a 7/10 but 80% of the time it feels like a 3/10.  This is not mass effect, its a game made by a bunch of people that werent involved in the original series trying to make what they think is mass effect.  Im still waiting for the story to do something interesting, and im 20 hours in.  It plays it incredibly safe, probably because bioware feels like they are being held at gunpoint over ME3s ending when it comes to taking a risk with the story.  But even if they did take risks, the writing is laughably bad, and the characters dont take what is happening seriously at all.  This completely breaks any immersion.  In past mass effect games i would love talking to squad mates on my ship, in this i actually dread talking to anyone except drack and Jaal, they are the only characters that arent constantly making me cringe with horrible jokes and cheesy one liners.
<br>
<br>The combat is great, but when you fight the same camps of kett over and over it becomes extremely repetitive.  since mass effect 3 bioware has liked to create these bad guys that are just endless, you&apos;ll be killing thousands of the same dudes over and over with no narrative or reason for it.  and your squad mates AI is downright brain dead, in past games they wouldn&apos;t use throw, pull or any biotic power on enemies that have shields.  In this they dont care, ive had peebee use pull on more shielded enemies than health enemies.  And you cant command her to do other wise, so shes basically wasting powers the second combat starts.  same applies to other squad mates.  Not being able to command squad mate powers is a huge downside to gameplay and its great moments, i have no idea why they didnt include it.
<br>
<br>QUESTS; i have encountered maybe 3 interesting side quests, out of the around 30 i have done.  Everything is run to this location, place this item and then do that for 4 more locations.  Quest ends.  Repeat under slightly different conditions, like instead of placing signal towers, your scanning rocks.  These side quests are the definition of repetitive.  I just think its funny that bioware thought this was acceptable after games like The witcher 3 proved that side quests can have the same quality as main quests, and be just as interesting.
<br>
<br>Im not going to mention facial animations as much, yes they are terrible some of the worst i have seen from a AAA game in years.  but since people have been bashing them to death i thought i wouldn&apos;t touch on them anymore.  Honestly the game could have been good if it had done other things right, like if the game had an interesting story i could look past the facial animations.  Its also to bad that bioware continues their same tired tale of you playing as this God character, i thought the pathfinder would be a down to earth normal dude.  Nope.  All the characters in this game basically suck your dick, nobody stands up to you and when they do its so laughably and cliche.
<br>
<br>To end things, i would like to note my biggest problem.  Andromeda never feels alive.  Most worlds are completely empty with just more generic enemies to fight, no towns or settlements (besides the ones you create and fill with NPCs that do nothing).  with one new friendly race, the angara things feel even more empty.  Look at all the races we had in the original trilogy that were working together on the citadel, youll find none of that here.  Plus lore inconsistency galore, why do we have jump jets when the milky way doesnt?  how are we able to use FTL travel so much, and so fast when in the trilogy the only reason we could get around the galaxy so fast was because of mass relays?  FTL has always existed but it in ME but it was much faster to use a mass relay rather than travel for hours to another system on your ships power.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7162768">Expand</a></span>

Terrible story. Terrible characters.  Lots of farming/grinding missions, back and forth, padding to make the game longer.  I laughed, I cried and I yelled at some of the amazing parts of the ME trilogy, that game made me sit in awe with surprise at times when something I didn&apos;t expect to happen--happened, but this game, you wish that the entire crew would just be swallowed by that black hole so you feel something...other than utter contempt at how awful this game is and that BioWare pretty much can never go back to it&apos;s ME 2 &amp; 3 and Dragon Age Origins days.  I actually enjoyed Dragon Age 2 because it could be funny and I had a lot of fun playing it, sure the game wasn&apos;t aesthetic or pleasing but I liked the story...I even liked DAI after I really sunk time into it (but making the enemy in the game come from a DLC from their most hated DA game was a joke, they pulled it together somehow...), but ME:A is just so painful to play, the story, the voice acting, the humor, the dialog choices mean nothing.  I find myself skipping through the dialog.  I have never done that in any of the previous games!  I find that horrible!  It&apos;s an RPG, I purchased based upon a story-a story I want to be in control of...only I&apos;m really not.  That&apos;s more frustrating than Garrus always calibrating.  Combat is fun but wonky...I keep dying in the strangest places due to glitches. I get lost constantly, can&apos;t figure out where I&apos;m going.. Planet scanning is pretty but so time consuming.  I don&apos;t like any character or NPC I have come across.  None.  I can&apos;t even stand my own character.  The menus are confusing, character creation is horrible.  I think the best way to make a character is make it look absolutely ridiculous so you might laugh at something in the game!  It&apos;s just horrible.  I could overlook the dead faces and eyes, but the story and voice acting is an atrocity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7178459">Expand</a></span>

<br>I keep it short:

<br>ME1, ME2, ME3 are about story, characters, species and relations between the latter two.
<br>
<br>ME Andromeda tries to be the same, but it also includes new gameplay layers due to its focus on an outdated openworld concept. The result: It fails at both ME&apos;s core elements (see above) and at being a great openworld game.

<br>Negative:
<br>
<br>The UI is a clunky mess (as happens so often with bioware games),
<br>
<br>Dialogue&apos;s writing is often cringeworthy and fan fiction quality. The delivery of the voice lines shows that the voice actors were clearly forced to record one line at a time without being given any context for the line they were reading. You can hear inflection change several times for no reason within one string of sentences.
<br>
<br>Remember much of the content being fetch quests and chores that made DA:I so much worse than previous bioware games? Those are back again
<br>
<br>Almost none of the characters are likeable or relatable as human beings
<br>
<br>Batman detective mode scanning: who asked for this? really?
<br>
<br>Gameplay: movement is clunky (the jetpack dash is only a bandaid) , hit reactions are mostly absent or just not satisfying (compare andromeda to something like binary domain to see what can be done with enemy hit reactions in a third person shooter). None of the encounters with regular enemies are interestingly designed.
<br>
<br>Body and facial animation quality is all over the place, ranging from kind of poor to making you wonder how it got past QA bad. the lows are REALLY low and there are a lot of them.
<br>
<br>Optimization leaves much to be desired with plenty of framepacing issues. In general the graphics don&apos;t feel like they justify the performance I&apos;m seeing. Many modern AAA open world games look better while running MUCH better than this.
<br>
<br>Outside of the 4 explorable planets the rest of them are just another **** scanning &quot;minigame&quot; (if you can call it that) like in ME2
<br>
<br>Story: the whole setup of ryder&apos;s story makes no sense. Why are you a &apos;pathfinder&apos; going down to the surface to see if a planet is inhabitable when the planets themselves already have a bunch of colonies established on them from other arks... You&apos;re no pathfinder, you&apos;re just some jackass who shows up after people have already started settling. In the end it&apos;s just another trite bioware power fantasy, the same exact forumula they&apos;ve used for every game since KOTOR: you&apos;re the chosen one who has to gather a crew from different locations to go meet the big evil and defeat it once you&apos;re assembled your power rangers.
<br>
<br>Positive:
<br>
<br>Nice views out in space from your ship
<br>
<br>Some of the weapon models look really cool (shame the gunplay and enemy hit reactions are ass)
<br>
<br>Some decent space theme tunes
<br>
<br>Take a mass effect game that has all the usual flaws (bad ui, subpar combat that wouldn&apos;t fly in other 3rd person shooters, some cringeworthy dialogue) but amplified and with additional flaws from DA:I and modern open world game tropes.
<br>
<br>Then remove the things that makes them worth playing (interesting lore, some likeable characters and character arcs, pretty solid delivery of voice acting).
<br>
<br>What are you left with? 3 out of 10 that&apos;s what you&apos;re left with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7108342">Expand</a></span>

<br>Developers discarded a huge opportunity of new and engaging story in another galaxy, instead decide to play safe and made an awkward clone of a previous games, even going as far as reusing previous assets (models, animation, mechanics).
<br>
<br>Writing is abysmal. Logical errors and plot holes the size of the supermassive black hole.
<br>Some examples:
<br>- After travelling 600 years to another galaxy you visit first planet in a prologue, completely unexplored, with recon mission. On that planet there are mysterious alien installations, thousands of years old. Guess what you find there? A scope for your rifle. Not a technology, that you have to research first ot use it. just the damn thing, that you can slap on your weapon. Another galaxy, folks!
<br>
<br>- First contact with an alien race, an important and frightening event (remember First Contact war from the lore of the series)? Nope. Instant understanding and cooperation.
<br>
<br>- Hero is the last hope of colonists, tasked with finding new worlds for the survival of everyone must buy his equipment for credits... Come on, there are million ways to circumvent this stupid situation, there could be requisition points, new tech research for gradual upgrades. Nope, credits.
<br>
<br>- Research and crafting. There is no reason to explore planets and collect resources, when you can forfeit research and development entirely and just buy things for credits. Takes away the exploration spirit everyone hoped for.
<br>
<br>This is just a surface scratching without going into details.
<br>
<br>Dialogs.
<br>Dialogs seems to be written by 10 year old. Characters spew exposition like in a bad movie. Mindless and numb droning of the NPCs will force you to skip the conversations entirely. Blatant mis-casting of the voice actors, which make characters dull and forgettable. Dialog options regressed even further, than infamous Renegade/Paragon system from previous games. Simplified romance options always show up in the wheel with &quot;heart&quot; icon, not unlocked through conversation and interaction. Just choose &quot;heart&quot; repeatedly and you get the romance scene. That easy. No engagement whatsoever.
<br>
<br>Worlds.
<br>Developers tried to create the open worlds, but instead got generic, empty and forgettable planets with dull quests. Uninspired and repetitive alien installations, awkwardly respawning enemies, overall lack of creativity throughout gameplay: these are the flaws that should never be in the first place, with the foundation like previous games and high project budget.
<br>
<br>User interface.
<br>Horrible design decisions, not just one step back, but a giant leap from established and comfortable interface from previous installments. You easily get lost in the menus, sub menus and tabs even when trying to do simple things, such as change quest tracking. Crafting menu is even worse. Unintuitive key mapping - to open a map you press &quot;M&quot; once, to close it press &quot;Esc&quot; twice. Map is buggy, half of the time you can&apos;t even locate your position, the marker just dissapears, making you take a wild guess. Minimap is no more, instead we got Skyrim&apos;esque compass with markers that is just awkward to use, especially when driving in the vehicle.
<br>
<br>Animation.
<br>It&apos;s bad. Forget about stiff faces and bad syncing everyone are talking about. We have awkward movement, disappearing weapons, disappearing helmets, characters sliding instead of walking, NPC models suspended in midair, models clipping through the ground, invisible textures, madly rotating eyeballs, impossible gestures, just to name a few. It looks and feels as if it is an early alpha build. Even minimal quality control should have noticed and reported these massive issues, but alas...
<br>
<br>tl:dr verdict:
<br>
<br>An insult for the veterans of the series and tedious, boring experience for the newcomers to the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7147852">Expand</a></span>

<br>EA just decided to cash in on diehard fans of a dead franchise before the end of 2016 fiscal year and call it a day.
<br>Bioware will be dissolved shortly after they push couple of crappy DLCs for this monstrosity.

The last title worth its salt released by the company was in 2010, with the release of Dragon Age: Awakening, the expansion to the modern classic Dragon Age: Origins.
<br>
<br>Of course I&apos;ve still played every game they&apos;ve released to date, including the infamous money-squandered MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic, hoping that one day they may return to form. But that is a distant dream, an impossible reality as they&apos;ve proven themselves incapable of it. And it&apos;s worth noting that Inquisition is the only game to date that I&apos;ve not finished - as it adhered to an archaic quest design that was mostly found in korean MMORPGS over a decade ago.
<br>
<br>Mass Effect: Andromeda promises a return to the roots, a back to the basics to the much beloved original Mass Effect of 2007 release. It&apos;s no wonder why it quickly became a classic, and in many ways it set a new standard for RPGs back then. It does this by giving the series a soft-reboot, away from the repear conflict as well as allowing a much greater customization of Ryder, as well as the return of exploring the surfaces of alien planets. Even introducing new races where as the old had grown too familiar to remain &apos;alien&apos;.
<br>
<br>It does live up to its promises on a superficial level, only delivering the exposition and mechanical on a barely serviceable level. The mechanical customization of Ryder is the only progress this game makes over any of its predecessors. The level of possible roleplay and directing the character to suit you has been distinctly reduced, even well below Mass Effect 3&apos;s standards, that were already treading on a thin ice and barely classified as an RPG.
<br>
<br>The issue that has sparked the controversy that has reached into all crooks and corners of the internet starts with the animations, Models do not interact without severe clipping, lip synchronization is aft to miss the beat and the facial expressions do not match the tone of the voice actors. It&apos;s reminiscent of a controversy surrounding Star Wars the Old Republic where it was mocked for months upon months for its jank animations.
<br>
<br>And it&apos;s all justified.
<br>
<br>Would it be the only issues, the game would be grand and great, but the exposition and narratives you walk Ryder through are uninspired and you&apos;ll find yourself simply going through the motions, without any of the enthusiasm. The companion characters are shells, left without the necessary development and motivations that one would find in other RPGs of today. And there&apos;s no friction, the companions dont butt heads with displays or representations of an ideal of theirown to challenge or bolster the players thinking.
<br>
<br>It was a great boast of the developers to claim the game holds the most dialogue they&apos;ve ever had in a game, but in spite of that the game was remarkably short on exposition. Most of the time you&apos;ll be going through objecitves that have been found in open world games in the past six or seven years, exploring derelict ruins and climbing towers to scan with the infamous &apos;find stuff easier&apos; vision. It&apos;s a wonder this has not been rid off with modern gaming, given that even as early as Fable 2 with its glitters that merged the aft-used tab-vision into its aesthetic design, and while it could be argued that the scanner does the same, it&apos;s more of an obstruction than anything to have to use it to look at everything in hopes of finding anything.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is bad, and this is in spite of a talented cast of actors. And the only conclusion that can be drawn from this that Bioware themselves did not know the tone or the beats of the game, so you&apos;ll find that the emotional performances delivered by the big name VA&apos;s is all over a place, as is often the case with games that have a poor director in the booth.
<br>
<br>If not for the added customization of Ryder, the combat would be just on par with the rest. But the procedural cover system leaves much to be wanted, where-as the older games had tight controls in regards to the cover, this one takes the control away from you and tries to detect whether you&apos;re in a position to take cover, and if it senses it, it does it. Of course, this leads to many, many situations where you&apos;ll shout at the game to take cover in a place where it obviously should be possible, but isn&apos;t. And there are other situations where you&apos;ll want to remain in cover, but can&apos;t, depending on your aim.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been lenient about the games flaws thus far, tried to write my thoughts down without the emotional disappointment and frustration that I felt often while I played it. And I&apos;m running out of available characters. Simply put, Andromeda is nothing short of the worst game Bioware has ever made. Everything that did go wrong, has gone wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7110737">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. Better combat mechanics.
<br>3. Okay voice acted, some NPC feels generic.
<br>4. Okay sound effects
<br>5. Music/theme is okay but the timing and placement of it is BAD
<br>6. It has bigger open world and environment compare to previous ME&apos;s
<br>
<br>Cons :
<br>
<br>1. Player customisation is limited and horrible and ugly default face type available.
<br>2. The story line is predicted, shallow and boring. This is came from Inexperince writer and stupid game director.
<br>3. Horrible mission design which is tedious, not memorable and repetitive.
<br>4. Amateur and horrible camera angle and cutscene (almost 90% of all cutscene are garbage)
<br>5. All main characters , NPCs are all bland and unattractive at ALL, all of them. Dont ask me how i feel about them when im playing them/interact, i dont feel at all :)
<br>6. This game IS NOT an RPG story driven game, its an exploration and shooting game. The story is there but it has no impact on the game overall.
<br>7. The open world is an empty open world. No Interesting places, No interesting events, No interesting PLOT and NPC ,
<br>8. Bad UI design , a real bad .
<br>9. Bad Optimisation for frame rate per second.
<br>10. Amateur and horrible animation, Horrifying facial expression, Disastrous lipsync.
<br>11. SP Campaign have 0 replay value . Yes it is a ZERO REPLAY VALUE.
<br>12. The game is buggy here and there. LOTS of it.
<br>
<br>B. Multiplayer Mode :
<br>================================
<br>Pros :
<br>- None
<br>
<br>Cons :
<br>1. Boring and grindfest Horde Mode.  Yes there is only 1 mode here just shoot the horde!
<br>2. Money grab EA style for treasure and items, which offers Pistols? Sniper rifle for Horde? I NEVER USE THAT THING!
<br>
<br>I would like to like this game, but I cant. This game is real garbage ever exist since No mans sky. Yet this come from amateur , lazy and greedy people at EA-Bioware.
<br>
<br>Thanks to you EA-Bioware for again dissapoint me as Huge Fans of ME2 and Dragon Age Origins. This game is worth$10 MAX, too many **** in this stuff, too many discrepancies not including the bugs.
<br>
<br>My final verdict is 0/10 (Yes its ZERO out of TEN) TOTALLY DISSAPOINT)

<br>-
<br>The dialogue wheel and dialogue &quot;choices&quot;. Since this topic hurts my very soul, I will go further punishing myself, with a question that pretty much summarizes what I think about it: &quot;- Why did you even bother?&quot;
<br>-
<br>The Combat/gameplay. Well, what can I say, other than it&apos;s no longer a Mass Effect game, thanks to the combat. Pretty much what happened with DAI. Gone is the tactical/RPG/SQUAD based combat. There is no pause any more. There is no tactically using the abilities of your squadmates. THE VERY THING THAT MADE MASS EFFECT DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER GENERIC 3rd Person shooter. Yeah, we&apos;ve lost that. It&apos;s gone.
<br>
<br>Speaking of that,  I am not going into the multiplayer, because It&apos;s not something I&apos;m interested in, nor I care about.
<br>
<br>Also, the watering down of the &quot;class&quot; system, turning it into this &quot;jack of all trades&quot; skyrim type **** I will not go into details about my personal &quot;hate&quot; of these kinds of systems. The reason for this is the same as the reason we saw it in Skyrim - laziness. Because it takes all kinds of effort to balance different classes, and we know that with companies, &quot;effort&quot; means &quot;costing more money&quot;.
<br>-
<br>The infamous animations. I won&apos;t say much about them, because they&apos;ve already turned the game into the biggest meme-generator of 2017.
<br>-
<br>The writing. It&apos;s simply abysmal. It&apos;s very hard to get immersed in this supposedly story/character driven game, when the words that come out of everybody&apos;s &quot;tired&quot; faces are nonsensical and sometimes worse than fanfiction. What HAPPENED with the writing? Also, the whole setting/story is boring and uninspiring.
<br>-
<br>The characters. Well, I&apos;m not going to go into them much, because I know that this could also be considered a subjective thing. For me though, they are terrible. &quot;Bethesda-facepalm&quot; level terrible.
<br>-
<br>The sound design, in particular some of the alien voices. It&apos;s like they didn&apos;t even try.
<br>Also, the &quot;music&quot; some times was atrocious. Like in the Vortex. So generic and annoying.
<br>-
<br>Bugs (some gamebreaking), glitches and overall lack of polish of nearly any aspect, which leads to the conclusion of a rushed product. A rushed 5-year-in-development product, if that is possible.
<br>-
<br>And then we get to the character creator. A very huge thing in these kinds of games. So what&apos;s going on with it? Well, basically it has been completely butcherred, to the point that for the most part it&apos;s non-existent. It&apos;s more like character &quot;selector&quot;.
<br>
<br>We are talking Ubisoft&apos;s The Division level of laziness here. You have 9 scanned heads for each gender, of wich you can pretty much change only the hair, make up (and the choices are ridiculous btw), and a very limited skin tone slider (more on that later). There is virtually NO customization of the faces. You know, one of THE BIGGEST things these games, creating your own avatar. People like me spend many hours in character creators, tweaking.
<br>
<br>We all know that the CC in the previous games were never that great. But at least you could create unique and different faces. Changing different fetaures like eye shape, nose shape, mouth shape, brow shape and so on. In andromeda, you can&apos;t do that. Since the heads are scanned (although as a character artist myself, I can think of several ways to create the system in a way, that this would be non-issue). Which is simply sad. They didn&apos;t put any effort into this very essential aspect of the game.
<br>
<br>To be honest, I did not expected this to happen. The last remaing RPG feature of this game, to simply be crapped on to such extend. It&apos;s honestly the deal breaker for me. Not to mention the fact that Bioware lied, when they said that they will not change the CC much from DAI. But I guess the only thing that they didn&apos;t change (or dumbed down), was the color wheel for some things like eye color and makeup.
<br>-
<br>Now I&apos;m not going much into the obvious &quot;Political Correctness&quot; and SJW agendas, splashed all over this game, one of which is the uglification of the females. I can get geeky and nit picky with this one till we all get &quot;asari&quot; in the face, but I won&apos;t. There is more about it around the web.
<br>
<br>But the thing that goes too far, is the lack of white character presets for the females. Aside from most likely catering to regressive feminists like Sarkeesian, the fact there are purposefully no white presets is simply a disgrace.
<br>
<br>Not because I&apos;m offended personally or whatever **** the apologists will throw at me, but because when you do something like that, you are intentionally igniting/creating racial tension amongst the community. This to me is so wrong, so sick and twisted, that I have no words for it. This thing alone is enough of a reason to boycott the studio and the publisher. And when you see things like this happening, some people like Manveer Heir start to make a whole lot more sense.
<br>-
<br>CONCLUSION
<br>-
<br>As a game that carries the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; name (to sell itself), and all the expectations that comes with that, it&apos;s a 1.

<br>Finished the game hoping every hour that it would get better. It doesn&apos;t.
<br>I spent more time watching my ship take off and land than I did playing the game.
<br>The animations are laughable, facial expressions, zig zag running, clipping, even crossed arms are broken.
<br>The combat feels good but it is repetitive so you have to change it up a lot. The enemies are all the same and very easy.
<br>The dialogue options are fallout 4 level bad and decisions mean nothing.
<br>
<br>I bought this game because I read some positive reviews, it appears that those positive reviews were paid or are SJWs or something...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7191514">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not engaging enough.  Take anything I say with a grain of salt.  You have a pretty shallow story that is interspersed with nothing but mission grinds.  The voice acting is 75% bad and there is absolutely no reason to find any relation with your companions.  The later ones are a bit more interesting, but you don&apos;t have any Morden&apos;s sings moments.  You can&apos;t have any agonizing decisions to make.  DUDE, your decisions have as much meaning as the RGB ending of ME3!  (*flashback eyetwitch*) You don&apos;t have... FUN!
<br>
<br>I shouldn&apos;t go off about the negative without some positives.  Other than the horrible human wax dolls, the rest of the environment is QUITE pretty.  The worlds, while limited in quantity, are still large enough to be interesting, but small enough to remember where you are going, as long as the mission doesn&apos;t unknowingly update.  (Sorry, I said I&apos;d try to be positive).
<br>
<br>The scope is quite nice for a game of this age.  The crafting is lackluster, but having the modding back is nice.  The combat is SUPER fun, but I&apos;d rather have them spent the energy in the story and deal with the old system if there were a trade off.  Has many hours of content.
<br>
<br>All in all, this probably would have been a higher score if this didn&apos;t have the Mass Effect label, but as it does it loses points for not living up to the legacy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7107794">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Starting with the worst and most restrictive character face editor I&apos;ve ever encountered, it just goes downhill from there.  The defaults all look like potatoes, and its practically impossible to change anything except in minor ways.  No changing skin textures, eye shape, eyebrows, shape of nose, mouth, brow colour.  It was only possible to create a white character by selecting the bottom preset face option and sliding the skin tone slider all the way to the left.  So in effect, you&apos;ve got one option.  It was also impossible to save and retrieve the look of the character since the mass effect archive isn&apos;t working at the moment.  Excellent.
<br>
<br>So after that disaster it was into the game.  There I immediately started experiencing all sorts of weird anomalies, with the character - neck stretching, warping and growing an adams apple(on a female) depending on how the character turned their head.  For the NPC  characters that didn&apos;t look god awful off the bat, there was a very strong uncanny valley effect.  It just looks weird.  And don&apos;t get me started on the eyes.  Everyone looks like they&apos;re high on pseudo-ephedrine with massively dilated pupils.  ugh.  And the turians mouths with their detached flapping tongues...
<br>
<br>Story wise, everything you&apos;ve heard is true. The writing is terrible, with cliche&apos;d companions and characters you just cant bring yourself to care about.  I honestly just wanted to hand them over to the Kett or shoot them myself.
<br>
<br>About the only redeeming features this game has is are the environments, which can look incredible, and the combat.  But I&apos;m not playing a Mass Effect game to shoot things. I&apos;m playing it for the story, which is utter garbage.  I gave up on this steaming pile after about 8 hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7142470">Expand</a></span>

This was well expected - everything EA touch starts to rot and stink. This is not the first game they corrupted. It is strange they didnt pervert ME2 and ME3. Companies like EA or Ubisoft must stay in their FIFA NHL field and not to go in area they have no idea what to do. They are able to make niche products, this is true, and many people like it - in the nearest future it will be Mass Effect 5, Mass Effect 6, 7 ... bright and colorful games, but totally without soul.
<br>
<br>But lets support what I said above with some analysis. After recent news I released I&apos;m not going to preorder this, not even buying this at all. But my m8 bought it anyway, despite my warnings, so I can write this review.
<br>
<br>- Graphics: Its quite nice. Really, graphics is fine, when you playing ME it is like you are watching blockbuster movie. This is the only reason I put 4 score here.
<br>
<br>- Plot: this is the main reason why we play ME, right? Right? Well, there are none. Where is Miranda? Where is  Liara? Where are Reapers? Seriously, plot is dumbed down to some Android game. Please, go repair this module, because I&apos;m technician and have no idea what to do, and dont even have tools o0
<br>
<br>- Gameplay: MMO quest system in single player game is the most absurd thing one can ever done. EA got warned after DA:I - do not do this **** again, but no, why we should listen to players? We are EA, we know better how to feed you.
<br>
<br>- Combat system: Well, it is okay. Honestly I dont remember how complex it was in ME 1-3, but here it is look like some japaneese slash and hack colorfest. Teleportations, explosions. Nothing special actually.
<br>
<br>- Animation: This should be the part of the graphics, probably, but I just had to separate this out. This is TERRIBLE. Face animaion is just abysmal. WHY SHE IS ALWAYS SMILING, like WTF. Like &quot;my father is dead, and this is so funny.&quot; Is this some sort or black comedy, no? I even dont mention various graphical bugs and glitches, And have you seen this new azari-Shrek?
<br>
<br>Verdict: If you like WoW-style games - like bring 10 flowers, or kill 20 pigs - you might find this game intresting, if you like games where you need to shoot without thinking - you might find this game intresting, otherwise, especially if you are fan of ME universe - keep out of this, imagine ME3 was the last game, like HL2 and the next part will never come out.
<br>
<br>...omg EA what have you done...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7105643">Expand</a></span>

Andromeda apparently. Characters who present their Religion, Sexuality, and Politics first and foremost, in a game where none of it matters, shatter immersion for anyone who has sour history with the subjects. Couple this with often times utterly non-existent facial animation (saving spotty Lip Sync which are completely separate files that are used universally) and broken animations (arm twists that create an effect that reduces a characters arm to paper, or guns being held backwards) and you have a broken product.
<br>
<br>The only and I mean only redeeming quality of this game as a returning fan of the series is the Gameplay, which is supposed to be a secondary consideration for a BioWare game.
<br>
<br>What happened to the titans of the genre? They fled the studio four-five years ago and left it to the vultures is what.
<br>
<br>Pile on the controversies surrounding developers (Manveer and Aliie) and the Studio&apos;s Leadership eagerness to lie, and protect one deplorable human being and another incompetent animator and its a wonder how this game reached golden. It is golden write -- released?

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7104092"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Quick recommendation: Don&apos;t buy. Not worthwhile for new players, and an insult to the original Mass Effect trilogy, even with its flaws.
<br>
<br>Firstly, I want to disclose that I am a long time fan of the Mass Effect universe. I was not happy with the idea of moving the setting to the Andromeda galaxy, throwing away a rich setting and wonderful characters which had been built up over years. A good justification was needed to win me over. I couldn&apos;t see it.
<br>
<br>Mass Effect Andromeda had five years of development time. The resulting game is something I would be embarrassed to sell with my name attached to it. Most people by now will be aware with the problems with facial and general animation. The game also appears to have a lot of other bugs at the time of release. It is not clear how many will be fixed by patches. This is only the beginning of the game&apos;s problems.
<br>
<br>The premise for Andromeda does not make sense. We are told the trip from the Milky Way took over 600 years. This is too long even when using cryo sleep. People who stayed at home would continue to advance technologically and develop faster, more efficient faster than light travel. They could make the trip in a fraction of the time, and have already set up a new civilisation by the time the original expedition arrives. This isn&apos;t a good start for a game in the sci-fi genre, and the failures of logic and reason get worse.
<br>
<br>Bioware is known for telling good stories and creating excellent characters. It failed considerably on both counts. The main storyline is extremely generic. It adds to a feeling that the game is based on badly thought up and written fan fiction. Worse, we are not given enough reason to care about the characters at our sides. The worst examples being the protagonist&apos;s father and main antagonist. We meet the father at the start of the game knowing nothing about him. He dies in the very first mission without the game giving us any reason to care about his loss. He had the protagonists job of &quot;pathfinder&quot; already occupied, and he had to be removed. Why not make his death occur later in the game, or else make the protagonist be in charge in the first place? You don&apos;t make someone so important die until the character has had enough time to develop. That brings me to the antagonist. He is the big bad, with no depth whatsoever. He only seems to exist to be in the player&apos;s way, and we can&apos;t reason with him. Not even an alien from another galaxy should be evil for the sake of being evil and incapable of reaching an accommodation with the protagonist. The first time we meet his people, shooting begins immediately, and the player is not even given the choice to try to negotiate.
<br>
<br>The dialogue is awful to the point of being unintentionally funny. Voice acting is not much better, although I don&apos;t fault the voice actors for this. They had to work with terrible writing, and it seems as though they aren&apos;t able to get a feel for the setting and context their dialogue was being delivered in.
<br>
<br>Combat is the game&apos;s only redeeming feature. People who enjoy shoot &apos;em up games will probably enjoy this component and the multiplayer section. That said, it is not ground breaking, and the AI enemy is average at best. Squad mate AI in the single player section is terrible. The developers somehow managed to make it worse than it was in the original trilogy. I wanted to shoot one of my &quot;Companions&quot; to save the enemy the trouble, but the game wouldn&apos;t let me do so.
<br>
<br>The following point will matter to long time fans of the Mass Effect series. Andromeda gives the big FU to the established lore from the original trilogy. The trip to a new galaxy should not be possible with the technology available at the time the sleeper ships are supposed to have been built. Only a hand wavy explanation is provided. The expedition members seem have access to technology which didn&apos;t exist in the original games. This wouldn&apos;t be an issue if the expedition left after the events of Mass Effect 3, where we could expect technical advancements to have taken place, even in the aftermath of the Reaper war.
<br>
<br>Bioware wanted to move the setting to Andromeda, and have the expedition leave before ME3 to avoid dealing with the consequences of the ending choice of the trilogy. We were told they especially didn&apos;t want to choose a canon decision. The new game renders this change of setting pointless. One of the choices was synthesis between organic beings and artificial intelligence, a choice which was very unpopular with the vast majority of the fan base. We learn that everyone in the Andromeda expedition has been physically linked to an AI called SAM. Nevermind that AI research was considered highly illegal in the original trilogy. This is a huge slap in the face to the fan base. A canon choice appears to have been chosen anyway, so why bother with the setting change? Why throw away so many characters and places we love?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7104092">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you&apos;re an old-school Mass Effect fan (like I am), feel free to skip this one - or get it once it&apos;s heavily discounted with all DLCs included. There is nothing Mass Effect about this except in name and the &quot;sci-fi&quot; theme. You lost control over your squad, you lost squad customization, you lost paused strategy, and you lost having all your abilities instead of just 3 loadouts per combat. Furthermore, this is not a Mass Effect story you&apos;d love and respect. Facial animation and all the other glitches are one thing, the simple fact that you simply couldn&apos;t care less to the two main protagonists (because they&apos;re as bland as a sack of potato) is another. Unlike Shephard, the game removes majority of you meaningful interaction and decision by removing the Paragon/Renegade option. All four options of your dialogue wheels pretty much saying the same thing with a different intonation or sentence structure. If the original Mass Effect trilogy is an epic full-length premium cinema, this is their direct-to-DVD spin off.
<br>
<br>If this is your first RPG however, and you never played Mass Effect before. Go for it. You have no greatness to base on, and the simplified RPG system of this game will serve you well as a training wheel of such genre going forward. Not to mention there will be more than enough flashy combats to keep your attention glued to the screen before you can repeatedly press skip on the next conversation.
<br>
<br>TL;DR, if you&apos;re a Mass Effect fan, let the taste of that great masterpiece fade with Shepard instead of being marred by this new release. If you&apos;re new to the genre, the franchise, or just looking for a mediocre cover-based shooter masqueraded as a Fischer-Price RPG. This is for you.&#xFEFF;

<br>In the era where we seen The Witcher 3, GTA V, and Horizon Zero Dawn, in what way this garbage release is deemed acceptable?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7104653">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I asked for a refund after playing like 3 or 4 hours because the immersion was constantly broken by something.
<br>
<br>Here is a quick list :
<br>- Ugly characters and facial expressions (one of your team members seems to be constantly smiling, even when announcing the death of someone, everybody&apos;s eyes seem to be popping out)
<br>- Everyone seems to be black, there&apos;s no way to have a white or asian skin for your character
<br>- The character creator itself seems outdated and almost have less options than Dragon Age 2
<br>- Important dialogues permanently cancelled by NPCs you pass by
<br>- A lot of dialogues seem to have been written by angry teenagers
<br>- Broken animations (I spoke to NPC&apos;s in T-Pose)
<br>- Rain falls on characters face, not helmet
<br>- The UI lacks polish and has unexpected behaviors (scrolls not draggable or that reset the scrolling to the top, very simplistic buttons design, almost ugly sometimes)
<br>- You can unlock a lot of powers in each spec, but can only have 3 active at once (sure you can switch between 4 loadouts but then again that&apos;s just shortcuts for shortcuts, let us at least have 6 powers active at the same time, that&apos;s a minimum)
<br>- Overall menu navigation is tedious, especially the quest tracking (very irritating)
<br>
<br>All those things totally broke my experience and as a result I didn&apos;t feel in a Mass Effect game, I felt in a broken imitation and I&apos;m upset because I&apos;ve been waiting for this game for a very long time and I absolutely adore the series.
<br>
<br>I might buy it again one day if there are patches, but for me as of march 26th 2017, that&apos;s not a Mass Effect.
<br>
<br>Also : I pre-ordered, I shouldn&apos;t have, nobody should EVER (except for limited editions and such), so that EA doesn&apos;t start thinking &quot;oh ok they&apos;ll throw money at us even if the game is unfinished, ship it guys!&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7149637">Expand</a></span>

And character development is just bland, it feels like I&apos;m talking to cardboard cutouts. They characters don&apos;t feel like actual people, they are just there to take up extra space. Squadmates aren&apos;t even comparable to the amazing squadmates we had in the previous games. Hell, even JACOB from mass effect 2-3 is more interesting than these guys. The only thing that is great is the exploration and the gameplay but that&apos;s it. Even the RPG elements are trash.... allowing everyone to spec into everything!? Seriously! That&apos;s not a good RPG, if you spec. into biotics, you&apos;d ONLY have biotic powers.... but nope in Andromeda, you wanna have biotic, tech and explorer powers... no problem you can do that with no limitations and no negatives, just wow bioware.... way to really dumb it down for everyone. After 15 hours. I stopped played because I was just damn bored, never felt like that during a Mass Effect game which is a damn shame.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s shocking how Bioware went from the masterpiece of &quot;Baldur&apos;s Gate&quot; to this piece of ****

<br>An empty and boring open world. EMPTY characters - just dolls or mannequins, with an absurd appearance, behavior and history. The plot is so smeared and not interesting that it is lost even against the background of the general sadness of the game. It&apos;s boring. It&apos;s terrible. From ME there is nothing left.
<br>
<br>And all this, apart from the HORRIBLE technical problems. There are many, very many.
<br>Here are just some of them that I encountered during just a few hours of play:
<br>- Stupid bots that do not react to you if you are beyond 40m;
<br>-stretching in textures, literally (I went to the drawer to recharge and got stuck near it, I can not do a step to the side);
<br>-passes and spans through textures (literally - enemy spaceships fly through buildings, bots with heavy machine guns pass through the walls directly to you in the rear, the Transporter passes through the textures)
<br>-Animation of persons. This is generally horrible. I did not look at the faces of the characters, otherwise it&apos;s impossible to play;
<br>- animation of characters in general, very strange at times, although this is the lesser of problems;
<br>- enemies, appear where they were killed, if you moved more than 300-400m from them;
<br>- FPS drops without a reason. You play - everything is good, and BOOM - you have 5 frames;
<br>- The game freezes on downloads. This is generally enrages. The game is sometimes loaded for 20-30 seconds, and sometimes it just &quot;does not load&quot; and hangs. It remains to press - alt + F4;
<br>- very hard downloads while driving on the planets. You go by transport, it hits the wall like a wall and for 3-5 seconds nothing happens, even the camera does not turn. Trifle, but enrages.
<br>
<br>The plot is very weak, barely something is given for the crumbs, but by this time, as a rule, you are no longer interested. And if you seriously digress - the plot does not cling, it&apos;s just not interesting; This is a problem not only of a weak plot, but also of its submission, which is at the zero level. Dialogues are simply dejected, after 2 hours you just skip them, skip DIALOGS in RPG !!!; Sometimes the dialogues look like the ravings of a madman.
<br>
<br>And most importantly, from skipping dialogs NOTHING does not change, you, skipping dialogs - perfectly understand what is happening. In addition, they are very dull, which is partly a consequence of the characters &quot;dummies.&quot; The system of dialogues with different versions of emotional colors - simple does not work. Not only that from different options nothing changes, so also the implementation is very bad, and in fact facial animation only adds firewood in this stove.
<br>
<br>It should be said about some tasks that disappear when you approach them. Or those that do not disappear when you finish them. For example, yesterday did a side task, but the items for the task, which you need to collect for it, have appeared anew. It&apos;s funny.
<br>
<br>Of the pluses - a vigorous combat system, but - due to the fact that enemies are FAT - all the advantages with a jet pack come to naught - because you can not kill anyone while you hang over their heads, even if the enemy is alone. There is not enough damage, but the enemy will pile you with bullets instantly. As a result, playing with jumps and strakes - after 5-6 battles it all comes down to the usual positional fight at the middle distance with a biotic cast. If you sit down to fight closer - they will crush a meat - a dozen enemies, half with armor (to shoot this armor - you need to shoot 2 clips in the head) - they storm and throw meat. It&apos;s not about the requirements for direct hands, tricks and tactics, just enemies have a lot of health, nothing more.
<br>
<br>Cool car. The car is steep and that&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>But all these pluses are boring after 4-5 hours of play.
<br>
<br>In addition, the game is very annoying with the emphasis on tolerance and sympathy for LGBT and feminism. For whom is this? For what? Unclear.
<br>Again - ugly, mediocre people. The editor of the character is made so that it was impossible to create a beautiful protagonist. Trifles, but very unpleasant. And there are a lot of such trifles.
<br>
<br>Do not waste your time and money on this. The game is terrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7105916">Expand</a></span>

<br>SAM is making me uneasy and engaging with it is chipping away at my interest, exponentially.
<br>
<br>&#x2022;The NPC&apos;s are ugly and are laden with a bland androgyny. (I see ugly people all day, don&apos;t need it in my off time. This &quot;is&quot; still suppose to be a fantasy, right?)
<br>
<br>&#x2022;Combat &amp; Jetpack are cool but just not enough to make up for all of ME: Andromeda&apos;s failings.
<br>
<br>&#x2022;The Character Creator is subpar. I can easily spend two (or more) hours creating my custom character in the beginning of an awesome AAA title. One of my MOST favorite parts of a game and really helps get me immersed and truly invested in my story. I was robbed of this. : /
<br>
<br>&#x2022;Story and dialog choices seem... stale. Again, really missing a natural flair, organic humor and playful sexual energy that comes from healthy human exchanges.
<br>
<br>All in all, have been a major fan of the ME series since ME1 but this installment seems as though Bioware has stopped catering to it&apos;s original fan base and has instead joined the ranks of the falling &quot;preachy&quot; element that&apos;s not really concerned about just making something fun and sexy people (YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE) can enjoy but forcing you to be &quot;liberal&quot;. -This game falls flat.
<br>
<br>But I guess the only way to have them understand, (CATER TO YOUR FANBASE, not agendas) is in their wallets. -They might want to prepare to be schooled then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7120314">Expand</a></span>

<br>Can&apos;t get into story poorly written.
<br>
<br>Stunning view of worlds and fun combat though, fun to drive around and MP is like ME3.

<br>Hope to see dlc that add better written characters and animations fixed in a patch,
<br>
<br>Animations need improvement.</span>

<br>
<br>The story would have been acceptable video game foof if not for the franchise of Mass Effect being STORY DRIVEN.  This would still have been overlookable if the game play was stellar.  It&apos;s not, it shines in places, but in others (such as inventory management) it is a step back to the 1990&apos;s.
<br>
<br>Scanning.  Whee.
<br>
<br>Last and definitely not least, in this day and age I&apos;ve come to expect some political/social agenda but this was ridiculous, I felt like I was going through a sensitivity training course at a Marxist daycare, rather than playing a video game.
<br>
<br>How about this:  LEAVE YOUR POLITICS OUT OF GAMES REGARDLESS OF WHAT SIDE YOU&apos;RE ON.  I&apos;d no more want to hear about this dreck than a character droning on about the wonders of supply side economics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7107974">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Additionally, another thing that&apos;s a big turnoff is that there is no character creation option for Caucasian skin. I thought this may have been by mistake, but apparently the game&apos;s devs actually left this out intentionally because of political beliefs. That&apos;s right. This game allowed its creators to inject racism and politics into probably one of the most-used means of escape from the dregs of every day life by people: video games.
<br>
<br>Back to the game, though. It&apos;s rushed, incomplete and buggy. There are a lot of side quests, but their quality is low. The content overall is just poor. Crafting is pointless, combat is over-simplified and limited, and the quality of animation is some of the worst I&apos;ve seen of games in the past couple of years.
<br>
<br>Basically, stay away from this title. It&apos;s probably just a good idea to stay away from EA in general. This isn&apos;t a &quot;one off&quot; for them. It&apos;s become the norm. And lastly, don&apos;t support games that knowingly and intentionally build in their real world hatred and bias into them. Seeing video games politicized is something I never expected to see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7115844">Expand</a></span>

Not enough in my books. I played 2 hours of frustrating ugliness and quit. Sorry I may not be giving it enough time, but everything I liked about ME1 is crushed down and thrown away and all the things I disliked on ME2 are heightened and amplified. I know the parcour fans will love this crap, but I don&apos;t want games with jetpacks. They spent more time on this garbage gameplay than RPG elements or proper animation. Seriously looks like crap.  I can&apos;t give it a one because i didn&apos;t truly give it a try, but its so ugly I just don&apos;t want to play this near platformer. So disappointed in this mess. I will play some more with friends on multi to see if its ANY better and maybe change my review, but as of now its terrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7116631">Expand</a></span>

Think of yourself. You&apos;re on the precipice of a massive high point in an IP&apos;s lifespan and then you just jump. Folks weren&apos;t really happy with the ending of ME: 3 and the descent just continued from there. While this is Bioware Montreal&apos;s first endeavor, it was a flop. The animation is so poor that the first ME game looks better. The movements are jittery, the voice acting is lack-luster, and the only good feel you get out of this game is the combat and even that is lacking in many areas. Overall, while there is a long story line, it feels too basic, too blase.
<br>
<br>You go to this new exciting place ready to explore. What happens? Oh look a galactic threat. This isn&apos;t the &quot;adventure&quot; that was promised. This isn&apos;t the new and exciting narrative that should of been. This is just another cookie cutter RPG splattered with a recognizable label and filled with SJW non-sense to try and keep it &quot;current&quot;.
<br>
<br>Yes the game has some high points. The environments look great, the lighting is pretty well done, and over-all the alien races remain true to their appearances.
<br>
<br>But I just can&apos;t get over some of the horrible design decisions. The romance options continue to be abyssmal for same sex audiences, and the new alien races introduced look like feet and feet with barnacles. The model designers for your character obviously had &quot;diversity&quot; in mind, but its just so difficult to make anything that somewhat looks like a human being capable of showing emotion. The basic Sara Ryder model looks like she has high spectrum autism. The male Ryder looks like some noir M&apos;lady or some hipster you&apos;d find in a coffee shop in east LA.
<br>
<br>Overall the design decisions were horrible. I can&apos;t possibly continue to berate how destroying this is for this franchise and honestly, I think Bioware and EA need to seriously consider their designers and team for well known IP&apos;s or they will continue to see a decline in their audience outside of the COD and sports crowd.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7177238">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But the same issues that were brought out when the first trailer came out (Facial animations), the ones we were told would be fixed, are still there, and are even worse than I expected. It is downright immersion breaking, because of flat lifeless expressions, characters that sound emotionless, writing that is Below average at best, and often atrocious. The open world of this game feels similar to DAI and Ubisoft games, that have you running around gathering stuff, and doing other boring activities that feel like a chore rather than being fun.
<br>
<br>Gone is the sense of control you felt over your actions, as the Paragon/Renegade option has been replaced for being too binary, and instead replaced with a bunch of options that are meant to convey your tone, but end up saying the same thing. You hardly have any control over your characters actions. No matter what you do, you are always going to be the good guy. The ability to be rude, which was an integral part of what made  mass effect so fun, is gone. You want to play as a dick? No, you are not allowed.
<br>
<br>Your companions are forgettable for the most part, with perhaps two exceptions, and one of them being memorable in a bad way. Peebee is perhaps the most irritating and badly written character I have ever seen in a game. All the characters lack any sort of seriousness despite the danger around them, and the conversation sounds like some sort of disney channel show set in high school. She just spouts off stupid one liners and bad jokes, and in place of having a binary option of paragon and renegade which influences how characters react towards you, you are instead given a binary option between professional and casual that determines how peebee reacts towards you. I found myself wishing I could somehow get her killed or kick her off the ship after the first mission with her, as I found her so irritating and cliche.
<br>
<br>The characters that have human faces are especially bad, as they look like they have been clubbed in the face as babies, and have a dazed expression that is interrupted only by their eyes making odd and rapid movements in all directions. Their faces are almost always fixed in one position, and the lip syncing is so awful it makes you cringe.
<br>
<br>The combat is however, pretty good. At least at first. It also has some big flaws, mainly glitches that leave you stuck floating along slowly when you land after using your jump jet, or your character unable to find a position behind cover because he slides along another feet after you take your finger off the move key. For some reason the developers have chosen to remove the ability to control your teamates beyond telling them where to go.. You cannot use their abilities for combo detonations anymore, and you yourself are limited to three hotkeys, which makes having more than three abilities in a profile somewhat pointless.
<br>
<br>The story is very dull, and lacks any of the seriousness and feeling of wonder that I loved about all the previous games. This is a surprising thing to realize when there was so much potential here in this setting. Instead this new galaxy you are thrust into is almost identical to the one you left, with the reapers replaced by another similar species, and a one dimensional evil species that you end up battling for most of the game.   You find yourself trudging from planet to planet, fixing the weather by doing sudoku puzzles and a bunch of irritating fetch quests.
<br>
<br>I never expected this game to be so poor, but it is. I found myself struggling to play it after a certain point, and was so bored I went back to playing ME 1. I reccomend waiting till this game is patched and the price goes down to match its quality, which is  to say when it is around 10 to 20 USD. If you are a fan of the previous games, prepare for disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7114525">Expand</a></span>

I even ignored all of those people who were poking fun at the game&apos;s (admittedly terrible) animations.
<br>
<br>...But it&apos;s impossible to like.
<br>
<br>ME:A is nothing like previous Mass Effect games.  In fact, it&apos;s pretty much their opposite.
<br>
<br>- Mass Effect was story-driven, whereas the story in ME:A feels like an afterthought
<br>
<br>- Mass Effect had gravitas, genuine humor, and meaningful choices.  ME:A is just childish and silly, its attempts at humor fall flat in cringeworthy fashion, and none of your character&apos;s choices feel meaningful.  Oh, and forget about the Paragon/Renegade spectrum -- it&apos;s paragon-only.
<br>
<br>- Mass Effect had well-defined, interesting, and meaningful quests.  ME:A wants you to run around ridiculous open worlds on fetch quests, and quests like &quot;scan 16 rocks.&quot;   ME:A also forces you to play an awful lot of sudoku, which is totally infuriating.  (Between the sudoku and the fetch quests, I had had enough, and returned the game for a refund.)
<br>
<br>- Mass Effect set a very high bar with its NPCs, who grew and evolved along with Cmdr Shepard.  (Especially Garrus and Tali.)  ME:A&apos;s NPCs are uniformly terrible.  Especially bad are Peebee, who is basically an ugly and annoying version of Liara, and Cora, a human who LARPs as an Asari commando.
<br>
<br>Now, as for combat, people say that the combat in ME:A is fine.  I&apos;m not sure I agree.  I think that playing as a sniper is more rewarding and more interesting in ME:3.  In ME2 and ME3, engagment distances were kept short due to the way the game was designed, but it was still possible to find a nice little nest and pick enemies off at a distance.  In this game, due to the &quot;open world&quot;, you can spot enemies from hundreds of meters away... but it&apos;s almost completely impossible to HIT anything past 120 meters in this game with the Black Widow sniper rifle, which is incredibly frustrating.  (This is funny, as WWI infantrymen were effective at up to 1200 meters with their old 30&apos;06 rifles, and engagements at 500m were, and remain, downright common.  For more info see the US Military monograph: &quot;Increasing Small Arms Lethality in Afghanistan: Taking Back the Infantry Half-Kilometer.&quot;)  Also, the fact that you&apos;re limited to three skills, and can&apos;t control party members, really limits your options.
<br>
<br>And there&apos;s no cannon or machine gun on the Mako/Nomad.  This is also frustrating.  A very questionable design choice.
<br>
<br>If you like grinding MMOs, you might like this.  If you like the Mass Effect of old, stay far away.  This isn&apos;t really a Mass Effect game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7141997">Expand</a></span>

The facial modelling, animations and expressions are really not the problem here, it&apos;s a minor-minor forgivable problem really. They really are adequate, not good, but the characters get the job done. The real problem with this game is death by a thousand cuts. Any one of them would be forgivable by itself. But there are dozens of minor problems all the way from every single aspect of design to outright bugs. There are so many annoyances, i&apos;ll list several below.  I accidentally wrote this review in the PS4 section, so I&apos;ll add to it this time around. And before I poop on the game further I&apos;ll say one nice thing..  The galactic nav-system from a graphical point of view is probably the best in the series.
<br>Combat:
<br>The combat is super weak and totally unsatisfying. The cover system is a major step-down from it&apos;s predecessors, and doesn&apos;t viscerally lock you in place. Compared to other cover based shooters, this game is sub-par by far. On harder difficulties the enemies can melt you whenever you accidentally break cover, which is super easy to do for a plethora of reasons. Your NPC companions are best used as distracting meat shields while you dish all the damage. Combat is by the numbers with cover playing more as an annoyance than anything else. Encounters usually boil down to dying once or twice until it randomly plays better. The player just doesn&apos;t have firm control over the battles. Cheese tactics reign supreme here. Just hide and force the AI to chase you down a corridor. The combat is just horsesh**. Coupled with inexplicably abysmal frame rates in combat I&apos;m just not sure what EA intended to push out the door. (I&apos;m running a GTX 1070) Saving and loading stabs me in the gut constantly, because the game is constantly killing me and erroding my progress. If you create a game that is constantly wiping your players due to unpredictable behavior, you should include a quick save/load. This leaves you having to reloot everything you just did from 5 minutes ago. The unpredictable behavior that is causing these deaths comes in the form of input/graphical lag, an inability to know when enemies have flanked you due to not having a proper 2d radar minimap, and weapons missing targets at critical moments because even fast guns have slow projectiles.
<br>Level design:
<br>If you are going to encourage people to explore your maps don&apos;t create death traps and ledges that look like they need to be explored. I&apos;m constantly annoyed rooting around for loot. Half the time I&apos;m rewarded, half the time I die or relize a ledge or platform which should be clearly out of reach that I just got to goes nowhere or can be accessed later. It&apos;s a waste of time, but I&apos;d rather not have to ever come back and explore the terrible levels for something I missed. They are so bad I never want to come back. I NEVER had that feeling in ME 1&amp;2. Along with level design is the god-awful vehicle. Just give me 4 tires, is slowing to a stop like a tank every time I need to turn a feature!? There is a reason we use vehicles with 4 wheels NOT 6. The reason this is in the level design section is that there is clutter everywhere, so turning as it turns out is VERY important. Essentially your average speed could be 70k/ph in practice it&apos;s probably 35k/ph.
<br>I have to stop this rant, it could literally never end. There are problems EVERYWHERE. This is a game in early beta. It was never polished. The best thing I can say about it, is that it never crashed one time. Which is pretty awesome, as for the rest of it....
<br>Conclusion:
<br>This game amounts to nothing more than minimum viable fan service. ALL you have to do to make a successful ME game is take the best parts of ME 1&amp;2 and turn that into an exploration game. Stop trying to make this an epic cinematic experience. These story lines are all used up. I don&apos;t need a super villain, I don&apos;t need to bang all my crew mates, just create a survival type game where I get to explore space, uncover mysteries, and upgrade my gear, base, ships etc.. Just use the ME universe, reference what you already made, and boom happy gamer (assuming you actually play test it). Please make Bioware great again. I never thought I would say this but Trump you&apos;re the only one who can save the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7135262">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay wise it&apos;s the old ME but better, a lot better... however the amount of issues ruins the whole experience.
<br>
<br>This game is not worth your time if it costs 60$, I don&apos;t have to remind you that this is AAA product, and in it&apos;s current state avoid it like plague, this game is buggy, unoptimized, and feels like it was rushed.
<br>
<br>After patches, and when it will cost 30$ you can buy it, don&apos;t pay more for this crap - it&apos;s simply not worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7122863">Expand</a></span>

It seems that everything they make these day is the same stream-lined, no brain, repetitive garbage that we got to enjoy in Dragon Age Inquisition. The difference is, it somehow worked in that game. Perhaps the characters were more interesting, perhaps the main story was just a little bit better. Here - everything just falls flat. And I mean everything.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t understand why people got so obsessed with some graphics issues like the animations etc. This is just a minor annoyance. As a whole, this thing just screams sub-par. NPCs have absolutely zero interesting things to say, companions are incredibly boring, the &quot;planet restoration&quot; quests are just repetitive sudoku-like puzzles, that you&apos;ll be begging to skip and the main antagonist is the same bunch of angry, misguided aliens that we already got to defeat in a 1000 different games.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on in that company, but there&apos;s serious management issues here and I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll be able to recover from this disaster. Oh well, goodbye Bio, you made some of the best games in the world, and now it&apos;s time to wrap it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7121176">Expand</a></span>

Look elsewhere for Sci-Fi gaming goodness.  The combat is fine but the exploration is only on a few planets out of a hundred.  The rest are simply a click to finish exploring.  Add bad animations, bad voice acting, remove emotions, lower companion customization and controls, and you have Mess Effect: Andromeda.  I also missed the awesome soundtrack of the first game.  Overall a missed opportunity for Bioware.

Both lead characters, the male and female Ryder, are abysmal. From shoddy animation work, to poorly detailed character models, to unacceptably poor dialogue and voice acting, this is a disappointing outing all around. The Bioware of today is not the Bioware we knew and loved - it&apos;s merely a shell of its former self.

I feel like spending money on this title would just encourage them to make more and more game like it. Unfinished, buggy, chaotic and boring. Mass effect: andromeda just feels like a slap in face for the fan of the original trillogy. Never again EA, never again...</span>

The 3d models and animations make it abundantly obvious that the people working on them are not qualified to be doing that kind of work, the writing is amateurish and often times laughable, the characters are shallow and often quite uninteresting, but luckily the core gameplay is good. Content is...lackluster to say the least and the game ends up having a lot of bugs as well as the same issues that ME 1-3 had with conversations that should have been fixed considering they worked on this for 5 years. Honestly, if this is what Bioware puts out, then I can safely say I won&apos;t be purchasing another game made by them. As for this game, It&apos;s already been approved for a return so I won&apos;t be bothering with it again either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7132536">Expand</a></span>

Lore says they are using translator modules to communicate, so if Mordin wants to go all scientist salarian on me I can understand the nitty-gritty details no problem. Cool.
<br>
<br>But why on earth do those alien things from a different freaking galaxy speak perfect, fluent english, the second I walk out of my ship? And why do they look humanoid? And wait a second, are these *latin* letters on their computer monitors? Arabic numerals too?
<br>Yup, &quot;RW-DRB32&quot;. That&apos;s what it says.
<br>
<br>So apparently 13th century europeans moved to a galaxy far, far away and interbred with the Twi&apos;lek or something, who knows really. Trying to interpret any of this gives BioWare too much credit, they clearly didn&apos;t even try to make any of this interesting. When I first met the baddies and my AI tells me they are DNA-based I thought that that was a great little piece of foreshadowing, but turns out it was just bad and lackluster writing.
<br>
<br>And lacklusterness is the common theme in this game. The dialogue is plentiful but pretty bland, my crew are pretty bland (although they do have their moments), the side quests are pretty bland, the bad guys are pretty bland, and the game in general is.
<br>
<br>ggwp BioWare, bland/10. The combat is pretty good but if I&apos;m only doing it for useless and boring quests then that&apos;s not enough to pull me into a game, I&apos;m sorry.
<br>
<br>PS: This whole game is blue/orange, what the hell. The menus, the people, their outfits, the plants, the rocks. To top it off they put a blue filter on top of the screen in half the areas, so even the greens are blue. I know it makes for good contrast but man, this game is overdoing it big time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7184759">Expand</a></span>

<br>i would give it a 3/10 for the graphics and the combat, but i will give it 0/10 because it has Denuvo and they sell the game buggy as hell</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7205739">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played some more out of a sadistic curiosity to see if it really does get better later. It doesn&apos;t. I&apos;ve now nearly completed the game from what I can see and it hasn&apos;t gotten interesting yet. This may sound odd, but I think Bioware is officially dead, and by picking apart this game I get a pretty good post mortum analysis. Everyone has already pointed out that the team that made Andromeda doesn&apos;t actually have any members of the staff that worked on ME2, but it goes deeper than just that. The people EA have let work on one of their shiniest franchises are majority hacks. I pointed out earlier that it feels like a fanmade romhack and I think thats really what this is. The main story is pretty **** but at least its follow able, but the side parts of the game is really what tear it apart. Space in Mass Effect has never felt so empty. No locations feel like living spaces with unique atmospheres like Omega and the Citadel did, and none of the party members are likable what so ever. Creepy faces aside the writing is just not good. It&apos;s average, and average for the video games industry is really, really bad. So what is a bioware game without good writing and set design? Bad, really, really bad. Save your dough, Mass Effect and Bioware are dead. RiP good Franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-andromeda/user-reviews?user_review_id=7115824">Expand</a></span>
