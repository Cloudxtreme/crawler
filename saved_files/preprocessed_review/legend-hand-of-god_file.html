I also liked the detailed enemy designs, although the animations themselves could use some work, with better voice acting, and honestly, after a while it got a tad bit tedious and tiresome, either just form the constant grind of the action or the repetition in how the environment is designed, something made the experience feel like it was just one big grind after playing for an extended period of time.  If the game fixed the horrible VA, fixed the pace, and made the levelling system a bit more detailed, it could&apos;ve received a much higher score such as an 8.  But as it stands, it&apos;s little more then something to tide you over till Diablo 3 arrives or maybe just something to experiance for yourself and see if you like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-hand-of-god/user-reviews?user_review_id=1753514">Expand</a></span>

Am actually expect pile of trash after see reviews but was surprised how good it is. Am spend the same time on this game and Titan Quest am definitely must say that LHG keep me more and am still remember some moments where TQ feels completely empty and boring. Where maybe TQ have better design in locations and classic Diablo like inventory style. But in real content and gameplay LHG somehow win with TQ and few other H&amp;S games. Am would give it 10 just for first good impressions, where in general its probably around 6 because few things could be better.
<br>
<br>And am give it zero because I hate respawns in RPG games because you dont feel any progression by it. I mean you just walk there and when look back its again full of monsters? LOL This is ridiculous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-hand-of-god/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796133">Expand</a></span>
