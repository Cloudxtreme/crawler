The unique concept, ambiance and endless re-playability makes this a rare gem, I highly recommend it.</span>

Obviously the previous guy who rated this a 2 just doesn&apos;t &quot;get&quot; the appeal of this kind of game.  It&apos;s based on an old model of PC gaming (called roguelike) where you die once and the game is over--completely.  There are no saves, no continue spots--you&apos;re dead and you have to start all over.  But that&apos;s exactly what makes this game so damn addictive!  I have the Battlefield 3 beta on my computer and I&apos;ve barely played it because The Binding of Isaac is sucking up all of my time.  Because every playthrough is completely randomly generated and you&apos;ll never play the same levels twice, dying is not a big deal.  Death feels the same way it feels in Super Meat Boy; you die, and die, and die again--but you get better each time, and it makes you want to start the game right back up again.  Like SMB it&apos;s a throwback to a time long ago when you needed actual skill and quick reflexes to complete a game, and it&apos;s precisely that which makes it so appealing to me.  Oh...that and the absolutely awesome and hilarious abilities and powerups, which I definitely wouldn&apos;t want to spoil here.  The game is full of surprises and has a very dark tone about it, feeling like a mix between The Legend of Zelda and Splatterhouse.  The fact that it&apos;s only 5 bucks doesn&apos;t hurt either, but it shouldn&apos;t give you any indication of the quality of the game.  I&apos;ve paid 50-60 bucks for games that weren&apos;t nearly as fun as this.  Just buy it, play it, and enjoy some excellent old-meets-new gaming for less than the cost of a sandwich.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1770534">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s priced on its length -- I don&apos;t think you can criticize a 3-6 hour time of gameplay with a $5 price tag. This game is definitely not short on content within those few hours, however, and it&apos;s never tedious. NPCs are diverse, but never &quot;too&quot; difficult (not that you probably won&apos;t die a few times completing the game the first time). Each play-through is different, and each time, you learn new mechanics, new items, and new secrets - which is much the same draw as Nethack. There&apos;s never a shortage of novelty - you don&apos;t get into a &quot;groove&quot; of hitting the same buttons under the same conditions -- there&apos;s NO grinding because after entering one semi-randomly-generated room, the shooting mechanic could dramatically change. The review faulting it for &quot;cartoon gore&quot; and being depressing is a bit obscene. It&apos;s so cartoonish and absurd, the idea that you can fault its liberalism with gore compared to the gore in a game as Modern Warfare, where you&apos;re shooting at representations of much more lifelike people, is silly. The story is witty, and surprisingly well-done considering how short and non-linear the game is. Most important about this game is its achievement of creating a non-linear roguelike which FLOWS. Everything flows very well -- nothing feels clunky, and having power-ups affect how your character looks (often in ways you wouldn&apos;t expect) is a great addition. Addicting, mysterious, and an enjoyable diversion, the game is well-worth the low price tag, and an experience I won&apos;t soon be forgetting (something I can&apos;t say for the $50+ generic brown FPS games I&apos;ve played).<br><br>I&apos;m deducting a point for the vagina-anus monster, however. That was just wrong on all levels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1781573">Expand</a></span>

But when I dived into the game, I found the same satisfaction of playing, like I did with Demon&apos;s Souls on Playstation 3. You will die a lot, but that slow progression, and the satisfaction from defeating a boss for the first time is great.<br>The soundtrack get&apos;s a little repetitive after a while, although it is a short and good soundtrack.<br>For being a fairly short game, it still has a great system where it lays every new level map randomly + different bosses for each playthrough + all the loot.<br>Even though the game is depressing in many ways and there is an awful lot of blood and tears, there is a twisted and hilarious sense of humor in the game, and I found myself laughing at different bosses and loot I got.<br><br>So all in all this is a fun game, and definitely a must-buy if you are a fan of the roguelike genre, and since it is so dirt cheap I also strongly recommend it for newcomers and computer gamers alike.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1771443">Expand</a></span>

The way you can feel about a cult movie or punk rock music is what he has infused into his games. His games seems like they were created on Psilocybin.<br><br>This game is always mentioned with it&apos;s price, and I assume that bolsters a more lenient rating... I find that unfortunate because this game has more personality and &quot;balls&quot; then most games have the funding to allow.  The Binding of Isaac will take a few play-throughs to get the gist of how it operates, afterwards you&apos;ll find yourself craving more and more. At first I didn&apos;t like that you couldn&apos;t save, and the idea of a self-generating dungeon didn&apos;t sound that cool... until I played this gem. I don&apos;t feel that is its selling point, the power-ups are that selling point. Each dungeon has a gold room in which you obtain a power-up... and you&apos;ll scramble immediately to find this room to see what hidden treasure awaits. The power-ups are fantastic; for example, you can join a demon cult, have a tag-a-long dead baby (brother or sister), spit pee (instead of tears as you start with) amongst many others that I have yet to discover. Each dungeon and each play will give you something new, and not only that you can couple and stack your power-ups. Power-ups affect your appearance, your ammo, and your special attacks. Some complain about keyboard controls, me being a console-only gamer after about 5 games the control setup became a breeze. Don&apos;t let this game pass you up if you grew up appreciating any 2D games. The replay value is the highest I&apos;ve encountered. Add that it&apos;s about religion and how ridiculous that is... well... I&apos;m sold.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1772879">Expand</a></span>

However, if that&apos;s not the case I suggest you pass this game by.  The gameplay is mindnumbingly uninteresting.  The style of this game while somewhat unique is rather lame.  Controls are horrible, you basically just mash the keyboard.  The use of a gamepad isn&apos;t support, the menu system itself points you towards using another peice of software to map your keyboard keys to a gamepad.  Now that&apos;s just lazy programming.  Don&apos;t let the high score fool you.  People have a tendency to over compensate when rating inexpensive games.  This game has only two things going for it in my opinion.  First the introductory sequence is enjoyable, but only so much as anyother well done flash animation.  Which makes sense since it is a flash animation.  Second it is hard.  Which is refreshing in this day and age of super easy hand holding games.  However forcing you to reply the same boring game play over and over each time you die beings to quicly feal like torture. 0.99 would be a far better price as the content much more closly resembles a smartphone app priced at that level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1823016">Expand</a></span>

People saying this game is repetitive and has boring gameplay are so wrong. This is a very challenging game, yes, but if you rely on your items, you are surely a very lazy gamer, and one that has missed the entire point of this game. Binding of Isaac is an absolutely amazing game. I was so frustrated with this game when I first played it, and I actually felt like just stop playing it after the first hour or so. But when I first got used to the enemies, bosses and trololol bombs, I really began enjoying it. The bosses are fun and varied, most of the mini-bosses are really entertaining and rewarding. Rewarding is the word for this game. Instead of going with the flow like every other game out there, this game actually rewards you when you should be rewarded. When you complete the game for the first time, you find out  that the boss isn&apos;t really the real final boss, and you have to fight even harder to complete it. In this game you really feel like you are rewarded for what you do. Over a hundred items are available in this game, and there are a ton of combinations for these. No save points in this game! This ups the game difficulty to a level at which most gamers are not able to cope with. If you are a soft-core gamer, do not play this game. If you are up for a challenge.

<br>It seems a lot of people are complaining about bad controls. The only reason they are bad with the controls  is their own ignorance. If they played the game for more than 10 seconds they could of figured out that YOU CAN AIM WITH YOUR MOUSE. Literally the exact same controls for almost every PC game ever. WASD, aim with mouse. Pretty standard stuff. Some people have also been saying that &quot;it&apos;s a keyboard mashing game.&quot; It&apos;s as much keyboard mashy as any other game. The only time you have to spam click is with the Chocolate milk item to get your full fire rate. Besides that, you can HOLD DOWN your mouse to fire at full speed. Like I said, pretty standard stuff here.It seems the other problems people were having all had to do with difficulty and interest, which are all very understandable, however, if you put just a little more effort into it, (and use your mouse to aim)  it won&apos;t be so terribly difficult, and the farther you get, the more interesting and engaging it becomes. Others have complained about how there is no strategy. Sure, on the first to levels. After that you have to deal with patterns and dodging, strafing, circle strafing, arcade farming etc. There are also different characters you can chose from. Anyways, with all that out of the way, I think the game is great, ad get the DLC it&apos;s awesome too. Sorry if it&apos;s long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=3113434">Expand</a></span>

I played about 3 games and I just got bored of it (to those who wonder if I beat the game, my third try got me to the second to last level). Also, having the ability to only shoot in 4 directions just annoys the hell out of me, along with the projectiles slightly carrying the movement of Isaac. Makes for inaccurate gameplay that feels like throwing arrows and hoping one hits. This game connects with many people, but I guess I am not one of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=3295091">Expand</a></span>

It extends the game by a lot. The game takes only a bit to master and adjust to the controls. The story can and has been interpreted many different ways. I find it very entertaining.</span>

Having played Super Meat Boy and loving it i then saw The Binding of Isaac was by one of the same makers so i gave it a chance, at such a low price it was worth the gamble. At first i didn&apos;t think it would be that good especially with only having 4 chapters to complete (now 5 after the halloween update) which i thought i would have completed by the end of the day, how wrong i was, each chapter is split into 2 levels and can be easy or very hard depending of how your rooms have randomly generated, because of random generation this game allows for an unending amount of replayability with the same amount of fun if not more each time you play. So many different enemy each being able to show in multiple colours with a different effect for each one, over 100 items to collect that you wont collect in just a few playthroughs, each item when used with other items can lead to amazing or not so good combinations. Bosses that will get you on the edge of your seat not to mention the addition of alternate bosses, mini bosses, the four horseman and Satan. If you don&apos;t like this game then i would say it&apos;s the genre you don&apos;t like, but if you love this genre of game then prepare for days and days (not hours) of endless and rewards gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1854252">Expand</a></span>

Each playthrough is different, and at over 35 hours logged in playtime on Steam, I am still finding myself smiling at new items or boss battles that appear for the first time.

Binding is an especially dark and twisted game that incorporates elements of adventure, shoot-em up, and RPG-style gaming. The dungeons are randomly generated as well as the power-ups, enemies and bosses you will encounter along the way. Combine this gameplay with dirty and vulgar Flash-inspired visuals, religious themes, and a great soundtrack and you have a title that is priced surprisingly at only $5.00.
<br>
<br>Binding places you in the role of a naked young boy, Isaac, who is trying to escape his Mother who has been charged by God to kill him to prove her devotion and unwavering loyalty. Dark enough? Isaac escapes into a labyrinth-like basement and must survive several floors of bloody and deformed horrors, each floor culminating in a boss fight. The game is difficult and definitely not forgiving. There are no save points and when you die, you will start at the beginning. However, you&apos;ll find that every playthrough will be a different experience and that the game is surprisingly addictive. Most gamers that get hooked will want to play this game all the way to 100% completion.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re not turned away by the style or tone of this game, definitely give it a shot. Binding has considerable replay value and at a price tag of $5.00, I think most gamers will not be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1827233">Expand</a></span>

At first glance I marked it off as a stupid zelda clone but the more I played it the more addicted I became. The visual style is extremely pleasing and while seeming almost cartoony, manages to fit in with the dark humor and creepy setting of the game. Now as for the difficulty, the game is hard when you first start without a doubt. You will die. Often. But as you progress you will unlock better items that can spawn in the various rooms of the game and your skills will grow. Making it to the final boss and beating the game for the first time was one of the most rewarding feelings playing a video game has ever given me due to simply how many attempts it took and the time that was put into it. The music in this game is amazing, and is bound to get stuck in your head for weeks. Over all I loved this game and would recommend it to just about anybody. Cant wait for the new expansion coming out latter this month!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=2405692">Expand</a></span>

Seriously, I&apos;ve stacked many hours on this game, not because it was some epic, ultra-game, but because it was fun. Take it at face value, people. It&apos;s a 5 dollar game made to chew up just a little bit of your time when you&apos;re bored, not meant to consume your entire day. Anyways, as for the game itself, it&apos;s a roguelike, top-down dungeon crawler that follows Isaac, a young boy escaping his religious mother in a basement full of monsters. You must then try and survive and, ultimately, destroy your mother. The game generates a new set of dungeons and assigns new unlockables each time you play, so your experience will always differ. It is also worth noting that the soundtrack is top-notch, and the soundtrack version should be purchased, especially when it&apos;s only 89 cents.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1795191">Expand</a></span>

The randomly generated rooms and doors you will pass through are not only what defines this game, but is what will keep you exploring even if you beat the level and have more to explore. absolutely this is at par or above with retro gaming, also making it a &quot; Super Hard mode &quot; like what super meat boy did to the Mario genre. By far for 5 dollars i would have bought the soundtrack alone in this game for how amazing of a job was done on it. absolutely this game will give you over 20+ hours to beat the main line with all the unlockable players, but will give you more than triple than that by beating the game multiple times for new endings. The Binding of Isaac is by far the most fun you will get for $5 and will leave you wishing it cost more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1793514">Expand</a></span>

It starts out with a very dour story regarding a fanatical mother who hears the voice of god commanding her to sacrifice her son Isaac, who then flees into the basement to escape her wrath (only to encounter a variety of demonic creatures).  After the opening cinema, the player starts the game and is introduced to all of the necessary keyboard commands via a series of cave paintings in the first dungeon room.  From there, trial and error will teach you the rest that you need to know.  The rouge-like style game consists of a random series of procedurally created dungeon rooms, monsters, secrets, item drops, and treasure chests.  The monsters and bosses are hideously gruesome things that display Edmund McMillen&apos;s fantastic diabolic art style.  There are countless homages to past classics such as The Legend of Zelda and Robotron: 2084, however TBOI&apos;s treatment feels very original and fresh this day in age.  As a fan of Edmund McMillen and Team Meat, I would have been prepared to pay at least $10.00 for this gem.  The fact that it sells on Steam for $5.00 is just icing on the cake!  If you are a fan of A) Team Meat,  B) Zelda,  C) gruesome artwork, D) fiendishly difficult game play, or E) all of the above, you owe it to yourself to give The Binding of Isaac a try.

What starts out as a simple top-down &quot;shooter&quot; becomes a quest to unlock and secret your way through various dungeons on a quest for completion. I would recommend this game even if it cost 15$ because it is just so fun.</span>

This is ridiculous and incredibly unfair to all ambitious and imaginative independent developers who create games which are so much more than the boring games you can only play on high-end pcs. Of course, you won&apos;t get a game like &quot;Rage&quot; for $5. The Binding of Isaac may be a &quot;small&quot; game, but it has an immense replay value and I&apos;ve already invested more time in it than in the mainstream ego-shooter priced ten times higher.<br>Also, do not listen to the reviewer who claims that The Binding of Isaac is immature.

The &quot;use Joy2key&quot; joke was not really kind.<br><br>Being a really random game, needs some extra bosses I tired fast of fighting the same boss over and over... Some bosses take a lot to come too... -Not enough bosses to feel random enough.<br>-The menu looks really unfit<br>-at fast speed Isaac is too fast to the point he slips too much<br>-I found some references to internet Memes. And I will say I hated that... The game didn&apos;t need that and is just distracting from the main deal.<br><br>The last one... The game needs some balance about what can you get in the way to the end. Sometimes you will be so unbuffed because a rock was always blocking the way to a key, you will miss some items. and crucial ones..<br><br>Now the good things and there is a lot<br><br>-The game really feels retro... Not like Fez (that looks pixelated but I didn&apos;t feel it retro) or terraria (the same deal) If you die is game over... You must start again. The game is nintendo Hard and as intense as those games from the 90&apos;s.<br>-The random  factor hides too well the fact there is not much content in the game. But that&apos;s not a bad thing. That really expands the gameplay.<br>-The artistic job. I can&apos;t really describe this game... Sometimes I laugh hard And sometimes the game just creeps me out (I will not spoil when) I think a game that is capable of do two opposite things to the player IS JUST GREAT.<br>- The religious references are cleverly put into game.<br>- The music clearly fits with the levels and the progression... Every theme is more serious and dark than the last. to the point where the 4th area is just really depressing and horrifying compared with the cheesy 1st level music.<br><br>I will rate it 8. Mainly because of the unecessary memes that are the only thing that really don&apos;t fit with the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=2338874">Expand</a></span>

While the game can seem repetitive from a distance, it actually holds an immense amount of replayability. There are dozens of items and many bosses that you won&apos;t see on just one play through. In order to see everything that &quot;Isaac&quot; has to offer, you would have to play it at least sixty times due to the game&apos;s rogue-like aspect. When you die, you cannot just reload back to the beginning of the level. You have to start over. But that&apos;s the beauty of this game. The game&apos;s length is balanced perfectly, so that even if you die when you were so close to beating it, you&apos;ll still want to start over and not have a care in the world. Sure the game has a lot of biblical references and it doesn&apos;t necessarily treat those references with respect, but if you can get past the bucket-loads of poop, tears and blood and actually see the humor in it all, you&apos;re good to go. My only problem is that the game suffers from bad fps on some computers. My other computer AND my friend&apos;s computer are both high-end pieces of hardware, yet &quot;Isaac&quot; runs terribly. Not sure why this is, but it&apos;s still playable (sometimes...) and it&apos;s a steal for only five bucks.

This is why it keeps you in front of your screen - it&apos;s really challenging;) .. And after you beat all 6 levels, there&apos;s at least two bonus ones. Not mention the unlockable characters.

The graphical style is simple and lacking in much detail, but it works perfectly with the narrative. The story is both fun and dark, without taking itself too seriously. The game&apos;s difficulty is something of a barrier, but not too detrimental to the gameplay. Dying so many times can get frustrating, but getting right back in it isn&apos;t too tough to accomplish. There are so many power-ups and items that you will be hard-pressed to collect them all. Also, there are many items that will change the visual appearance of your character, which is really fun. Unfortunately, many items are not provided with a description of their usage as you find them, which means that you may be negatively or positively surprised, depending on the outcome. The bosses and mini bosses are well done, and of adequate difficulty in comparison to the rest of your enemies throughout the game. The map system is excellent, and extremely helpful, especially to someone like me who has trouble with spatial directions and remembering locations. The game&apos;s performance is not good. There is plenty mentioned about this, by many people in the Steam forums if you are curious. At the highest quality and resolution, in rooms populated with many enemies, there will be severe slowdowns effecting the gameplay to the point of loss of health and deaths being blamed on this serious problem. The only way to remedy this is to set the detail quality and resolution lower, and then experiment with the changes. The keys are fixed, and you will not be able to rebind them. This is a problem for me, as I am not accustomed to using WASD to move. As you progress through the game each time, you will unlock different characters with specific statistics and abilities. The Binding of Isaac is hard, even given its roguelike characteristic. As I write this, I have played and died a total of 68 times, and only reached the final boss three times (dying in that battle as well). Needless to say, this is an incredibly difficult game, mostly because of its roguelike and retro nature. With that said, the genre is exemplified perfectly with The Binding of Isaac. It is a game that you keep installed for the long run, going back to it every so often in hopes that you will finally be able to beat it. Just like in the old days of the original roguelikes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=2099745">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I really like this game. It hasn&apos;t got the best graphics or gameplay, but the atmosphere is epic. It&apos;s got a very dark sense of humor and every single enemy and item has some fun aspect about it. Don&apos;t let its looks deceive you. Try it, and stick with it for a while even though it&apos;s a bit hard at first. You&apos;ll find it&apos;s a lot of fun... probably. :)</span>

Cheap and tons of hours of game play.  I like the graphics, the crazy no-holds barred humor and the challenge of doing everything.  I play little flash games like this while listening to audio books or youtube all the time, I cannot keep my concentration only listening while doing nothing, I get overly bored. After you beat the game, there is new features, new challenges, new characters, bosses, items, rooms, enemies, bonuses, secrets, and all those new challenges, new characters, bosses, items, rooms, enemies, bonuses, secrets can unlock  new challenges, new characters, bosses, items, rooms, enemies, bonuses and secrets.<br><br>You get the point.  I can copy and paste quite a bit to fulfill my 5000 character obligation, but I won&apos;t, cuz I have sum games waiting.

Once you play this it is very addictive and can consume you til you beat it.  The randomly generated dungeons give it a new feel every time and the rpg aspect makes you want to keep customizing Isaac but not get to attached to it because you die quite a lot.  It has a lot of fun equipment to defeat bosses and enemies so if you get the right items you can beat it easier.  this game is definitely worth the 5 dollar price and was really fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1773820">Expand</a></span>

How&apos;s that work then?<br><br>Rogue, for those not blessed with the beard of brian, is a turnbased RPG of such profound depth that it&apos;s basically impossible to finish.  Each game is procedurally generated, and each turn has so many possible actions that they take an entire keyboard of hotkeys to interact.  So how does that translate to the twitch-gaming we&apos;ve come to expect from the creator of Super Meatboy?<br><br>The answer is that it doesn&apos;t.  While Binding of Isaac does share familial resemblance to Rogue, it isn&apos;t in the depth of options available.  At any point, it&apos;s still Smash TV-esque run and shoot.  Where it is like Rogue is that you will collect many things, and you will die.  A lot.  And it won&apos;t always be your fault, but you&apos;ll still start one more game just to see what kind of hellish abomination of death and destruction you&apos;ll become this time, before once again you meet a bigger one.  It&apos;s a game to be played, not a game to be won.<br><br>It&apos;s not without flaws, the controls do feel like they should be tighter, and to be honest you generally feel like your weapons are just pissing up the wall - occasionally literally.  It&apos;s not a game that will dominate your life, but it is probably a game that you&apos;ll still be coming back to in six months&apos; time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1987983">Expand</a></span>

Coming from the makers of super meat boy, this is a sad comedic gore fest full of surprises.  Note that You will die a lot at first but as you keep playing, there are a lot of things to unlock and discover. This game&apos;s price value is also a must get for your steam game collection. At 5$ you can&apos;t go wrong no matter what. Dungeons filled with disgusting and gory, yet funny and sad enemies, will leave you wanting more and more. I found myself a lot of times putting other games aside to go play this game. I will end this review short and simple. To end this review, I suggest every gamer to go and buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1818255">Expand</a></span>

My experience from nearly 100 times attemps with a K/D ratio of 0.4 tells me the game that the game itself is far more deep and sophisticated than my expectation would be-- Edmund&apos;s art and sense of humour did convince me to continuously look into those about the cultural, biblical, anecdotal, satanical references. Its a shame that those who cannot play but also read(observe) beyond the lines are criticizing this game here.<br>The Binding of Issac does have some programming issues, bugs are reported constantly yet they are fixed allegedly on the day after. They are the only downfall of this game I believe, but I admire the developer&apos;s spirit of correcting them, unlike Techland and any other irresponsible producers.<br>People talked about the inventory management and its mimicry towards Zelda and smashTV etc, I have played every single titles they talked about yet I am feeling the oringinality here, simply because of the depth of the story (which some of them dont get at all), references, and neatly designed &quot;1-life-playthrough&quot; concept; sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you dont, just like Dungeons of Dredmor and authentic &quot;rogue-like&quot; games, yet whoever says the combat and drops is just about mashing keyboards, you are insulting the time and enjoyment I input in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1842085">Expand</a></span>

<br>But it&apos;s fun, it&apos;s rich, it&apos;s various. The music is amazing, the graphisms are lovely horrible.
<br>The game play is fantastic. You learn at each party something on the game, a new item, a new tips, a new mob and his I.A.
<br>Its a real pleasure... and I&apos;m impatient to play it again.</span>

But i will warn you it is not for the faint of heart. This game will punish you for all of your mistakes with death and suffering. However, the satisfaction you will gain from besting a ridiculously hard room or boss will make up for it in full. The games controls are simple. And i would like to point out to other reviews that complain about having to click the mouse to shoot (which is repetitive). The controls at the very beginning of the game tell you to hold down the arrows keys to shoot, which makes things much easier. This game is full of different items, tarot cards, and pills that will keep you guessing on what they are going to do. This game is a challenge at its finest and will keep you on your toes all the way through. I highly recommend this game to any one looking for a challenge or to anyone who is smart enough to not give this game a zero just because they can&apos;t read directions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=2090216">Expand</a></span>

Extremely creative - imagination is the main ingredient here; I&apos;ve logged more hours in this than my recently purchased Arkham City (which is amazing in it&apos;s own right) -- but the nature of this game is easy to pick up, hard to put down. The difficulty spikes rapidly, and even though you die a lot there are constant unlocks and madness to be discovered by repeat play. Every so often you&apos;ll get the perfect storm of items that will vindicate the often punishing difficulty. Ironically, when I finally beat the game, it was with a mediocre character build - which goes to show that you can never get too comfortable, as my over-powered creations quickly died when I got too ****<br><br>Not much can be said that hasn&apos;t been said by other users that enjoyed it - it&apos;s a zelda-style dungeon (think SNES link to the past) mixed with a 2d shooter, with heavy rogue-like elements (procedurally generated maps, randomized bosses, and a ton of items that drastically switch up the game play, making each game a unique **** of destruction and depravity!)

It&apos;s clunky, ugly and annoying, but there&apos;s something so irrisistible about it, I can&apos;t seem to stop playing. I really enjoy it, but I don&apos;t always understand why. Isaac is a very random game. That must be said right from the start. There will be times when you&apos;re struggling through room after room on your very last hit point, and then a sudden change of luck will allow you to progress straight on through the final boss. This same randomness that makes the game compelling can also be its most annoying characteristic. You&apos;ll have games when you luck into dozens of coins, and have nothing to spend them on. You&apos;ll have games in which you discover room after room of hearts you can&apos;t pick up, and nary a bomb or key in sight. The binding of Isaac is nicely balanced, however, and as long as you&apos;re willing to keep plugging away, you can be fairly certain your luck will eventually change. Battling through room after room of monsters can grow a bit tedious, and the controls don&apos;t exactly help in this regard. Isaac is a &quot;dual-stick&quot; shooter...without the sticks. You can use the keyboard or mouse for shooting, but movement requires the keyboard. It didn&apos;t bother me too much, as it apparently justified the hours I spent playing Robotron with a keyboard via MAME, but I could see this being a huge turn off to some players. Simply put, the lack of gamepad support is a bit baffling.  The game&apos;s use of Flash as a development platform is also a bit odd, and results in regular slowdown, even with just a few enemies and objects on screen.   Other technical issues plagued the game at launch, but thankfully those seemed to have been smoothed out, and the developers are even promising new (free) content in the near future.<br><br>The Binding of Isaac&apos;s style is unique, to say the least.  It&apos;s gross, cute, creepy and funny, and frankly, it did take me a while to warm up to it.  There&apos;s just something so ...squishy...about all of it.  But that same ugliness makes the game all the more satisfying to beat.  It&apos;s like an ugly bug that you love stomping on...over and over again.  It&apos;s addictiveness should not be underestimated.  Despite a few minor issues, The Binding of Isaac is a fast, unique and strangely compelling game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1792229">Expand</a></span>

The fact that it only costs a fiver is just icing on the cake, there&apos;s not many games out there that provide such huge playtimes with so little a cost. Buy this !</span>

<br>
<br>Although the game is extremely short, there is a surprising amount of replay value due to its randomly generated maps, monster combinations, and item drops. You really never know how you are going to fair on any given playthrough which keeps it from feeling repetitive. With practice and persistence, you will unlock new items that make the game somewhat easier, but also more fun. Experimenting with item combinations is a treat, plus it&apos;s hard not to break a smile from some of the crazy power ups as well.
<br>
<br>For a $1 game, Isaac holds priceless value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=2198105">Expand</a></span>

When you see the trailer it doesn&apos;t promise you much, basically you go through rooms and kill different type of monsters. This is only the surface. As you spend more and more time with Isaac, you start to feel that you are in a very deep game, which continues to surprise you even after 30+ hours. You have to go through dungeons without dying and it&apos;s not an easy task. To complete the game you&apos;ll need to learn how to deal with the different monsters, how to preserve your resources and you&apos;ll also need to make a lot of strategic decisions. If you die, you start over. Luck also plays a heavy role which sometimes can be frustrating. It&apos;s possible to go through the game with weak items and powers, but a lot harder than with all the good stuff. So completion is not just the matter of skill in my opinion. I think the art style is great, it&apos;s simple but also very appealing if you can appreciate the bizarre and grotesque. It&apos;s not for everyone. Some may even feel disgusted. The only downside I can think of, is the time consuming nature of the game. It&apos;s hard to put it down if you get the hang of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=2496802">Expand</a></span>

The game was Rogue-Like concept this makes the game much more challenging and addictive. The art of this game is quite simple yet also depressing, its not every day you would play a game with a absurd amount of blood, tears and turds but this just portrays how unique and fun it is. The Binding of Isaac randomly spawns the structure of the dungeons, monsters, items, bosses and power-ups for each game play so each play through would bring new challenges. I could rant on about how good this game is, I highly recommend this to newbies or veterans who just want to reminisce.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1832611">Expand</a></span>

<br>The power-ups you collect don&apos;t change the game-play in any way, its always a boost to health, damage, or bullet type, there are almost no power-ups that actually dramatically change the way the game plays, its always the same &quot;Walking around crying on turds&quot;. I can respect the attempt to create a different, dark, and gruesome art-style that this game tries to portray, but in terms of game-play it really isn&apos;t that enjoyable past your first couple play-throughs. Yes, there are many different items to collect, but even with the items, power-ups, and enemies, its still always the same boring, meme-filled garbage for every room and every floor.
<br>Really, all in all I can respect the premise and idea of the game, but the way it was executed was poor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=2825094">Expand</a></span>

Santan, God relation, Devil stuff, pacts, but this game was a pretty creative one. Good soundtrack, good time to enjoy, good money spent, good graphic (yes, it is a good graphic. The game is so simple, so addicting, it doesn&apos;t have to have THAT graphic).
<br>People just have to be patient. Not always I get a good item, then, I die fast. So well, let&apos;s just play again and try to kill mom once, twice, until you have patience.

I&apos;ve played roguelikes. Hell, Nethack is one of my favorite games of all time and I consider it the best RPG ever made (Keep crying, Skyrim and FFVII fanboys). This is nowhere close to a roguelike. For one thing, Roguelikes don&apos;t constantly rely entirely on luck. Skill has no place in The Binding of Isaac. They had to leave it out for more references to poop and Newgrounds videos. If you get dealt a bad hand, you can&apos;t make the most of it. You will get killed to the point of frustration. At least in Nethack, you rarely can blame the game for your bad playing.
<br>
<br>The graphics? Do I even need to explain why they are bad? I don&apos;t mean in an artistic sense, even. If you like naked formaldehyde babies in a &quot;cutesy&quot; art style, then you might like this game. Also, I never want to meet you. I mean in a technical view. It is literally made in Flash. Flash is an AWFUL animation program, especially when you want to look professional. You mean to tell me that Edmund McMillen couldn&apos;t use any of his Super Meat Boy money to buy actual animation software? How lazy is he?
<br>
<br>Speaking of Flash, did you know that this game is also CODED in Flash? So when your game crashes or has inconsistent performance (Achievement sounds loudly blaring when you turn off sound and music), thank Flash for that.
<br>
<br>The &quot;indie sense of humor&quot; (toilet humor and &quot;funney innernet joeks&quot;) is in full. References to meme faces, poop, and a bunch of Newgrounds games make up the humor. It&apos;s like Epic Movie except people who aren&apos;t entrenched in internet culture won&apos;t get the jokes and nerds like it because it &quot;appeals to them&quot;. Give me a break. Binding of Isaac sucks. It&apos;s $5 and often goes down to a buck. Not even worth it at that price. You can get a real roguelike like Nethack for free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=3731493">Expand</a></span>

I tried to like this game but I can&apos;t.  It has a lot of interesting features:  dynamic, randomly generated rooms (to an extent), a ton of items that can mix and match for new and interesting powers, and an overall cutesy (yet disturbing) aesthetic.  That&apos;s about all it has going for it, though.  Completion of the game has little to do with skill and more to do with whether or not you got lucky with the randomly generated items.  You are never given a description of what items do, so choosing and using them is a risk.  For example, using a particular tarot card during a boss fight can teleport you out of the room, forcing you to go back and restart the fight with the boss now at full health.  Little things like this kill the fun for me.  Most characters are terrible, while Cain is comparatively broken.  Even still, using him doesn&apos;t guarantee victory, as victory is only achieved through random luck.  Even if you get very skilled at dodging monsters and avoiding hits, the game will often give you items and stats that don&apos;t scale your character&apos;s strength for the next level.  Sometimes characters can be so weak a mini-boss takes 4-5 minutes to kill, while other times the same boss might die in 20 seconds.  Considering an average playthrough can take upward of an hour+, only to (usually) die, it&apos;s hard for me to find enjoyment.  I&apos;m not against high difficulty and I dislike the coddling of players with today&apos;s games, but I also dislike games that are just plain unfair and don&apos;t reward skill.  Binding of Isaac is one of these games.  For $5 it&apos;s not a bad buy and it can kill time, but unless you want to spend hours playing a dressed up dice game, it might be best to avoid it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=2246611">Expand</a></span>

As another reviewer mentioned, the control scheme (think Smash TV) really seems to fit a dual analog controller.  So, what do they do about it?  They tell you to Google it in the options.  That&apos;s right.  In order to control the game, you need to Google the settings.  At least the program they suggest is designed for the game, right?  WRONG!  The program they suggested doesn&apos;t even have dual analog support.  The very least they could have done was have a link in the options that links right to a program that actually has dual analog support.  Total time played:  27 mins.  Total time spent actually doing stuff in game:  5 mins.  I am just too frustrated to spend any more time on this game.  Too bad, because if the options worked, I would have given it a much higher score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=2521483">Expand</a></span>

Now, the enviroments were bland and the plot was not that good either. I expected more from this game, but I can&apos;t say that it wasn&apos;t a good buy, because trust me it was a GREAT buy.</span>

His interesting art style, paired with Danny Baranowsky&#x2019;s amazing musical talent make this a this game a wonderful piece of art.
<br>
<br>The game starts up with a background story cutscene before the title screen, with the ability to skip past it. However, if you have not seen the cutscene, I highly advise that you do so. It gives a humorous take on the story of Abraham being ordered to kill his son Isaac in the bible. Isaac&#x2019;s mother, a christian fundamentalist gets orders from God to purify her son and she does so by taking all of his belongings away to remove any chance of him sinning, but God is not pleased with that so she must kill him. However, Isaac escapes into a trap door in his bedroom that leads into the basement. This is where the game begins. The keys W,S,A and D are used to move the character and the arrow keys (or clicking the mouse) are used to shoot tears from your eyes at your enemies. You go around defeating these mutant creatures, like headless bodies that leap, floating heads that spit blood at you, maggots that charge at you, flies, spiders, and much more. The game is designed to get progressively harder as you get farther along, but this isn&#x2019;t always the case. Occasionally you will run across a tough boss (such as Widow) on the first or second depth and you have a hard time winning (although this may be different for each player as the game is generally skill based). The enemies are mostly just annoying instead of difficult, and the bosses aren&#x2019;t balanced very well. These aspects don&#x2019;t detract from how addicting and fun this game is. It will piss you off from a cheap death, but you&#x2019;ll just play again because it is just that good. When it comes to death, you will restart from the beginning no matter how far into the game you are which makes this game so difficult to beat, but that&#x2019;s the point. You can die one thousand times and, unlike most games, you will have a different experience each time you play. The game is procedurally generated which means each level is generated at random every time. This gives the game its replayability. Every time you play, you get a different map layout and different items. Some times, you may get an item you&#x2019;ve never seen, other times you&#x2019;ll get one you&#x2019;ve found plenty of times. With so many items in the game, you&#x2019;ll play it with a different style each time. The way the items work is pretty cool too, the collectible items stack so you keep the abilities of the items you get until you die, then there are the activated items.You may only carry one activated item at a time, and after each use, you have to charge the item again by beating rooms. Then there are the pills and tarot cards which may only be used once after picked up. These items aren&#x2019;t always helpful, and the pill effects change every time you play, so if you get a blue pill one time and it&#x2019;s a health up, the next time you play, that blue pill might be something harmful like health down. There are also trinket items which work like the collectible items, but you may only have one at a time like the activated items. With all of the items, most of which give a cosmetic change to the character, by the end of the game you will have a  up looking mutant baby, but you will be powerful. Even with your stats maxed out, though, the later levels are still very tough. After you beat Mom, you go into her womb and eventually fight her heart. Now that&#x2019;s pretty  up, but hey, it&#x2019;s a game so who really cares? After beating Mom&#x2019;s heart, you go to either the Sheol, or the Cathedral where you fight either Satan, or Isaac (respectively). That&#x2019;s right, you can end up fighting yourself. The game is pretty  up and weird, but that just makes it more interesting. Now personally, that&#x2019;s about as far as I ever got, but I know there is still another level (the Chest). From what I read, the Chest is only accessible by taking the Polaroid trinket to the final boss room in the Cathedral and beating Issac. The Chest is filled with bosses and the final boss is  and fights similar to Isaac.
<br>
<br>So all in all, the game is brutal, but very very fun, and very addicting. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good challenge that they can play over and over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=3106317">Expand</a></span>

Most of them feel like a power up of a shooter (Geometry wars/Asteroids) than one of a rogue-like (Angband/nethack/torchlight).<br><br><br>Said that, the game is cool if you play it like a twin-stick shooter (which is SO MUCH BETTER PLAYED ON A CONTROLLER), but the game does not support gamepads, only via a joytokey-like software, which is exactly what you should expect from a Adobe Flash-game  in a website, but not from a Five dollars PC game on Steam, it&apos;s feel lazy and like the whole game was hurried up to be sold, make some money so the life goes on and the joke is on the customer who could have been misled.<br><br><br>The games is good, have true good music, weird but cool theme/story, and some fun power-ups, but is worth $5 at the maximum, maybe $2.5 would be more fair.<br><br><br>If the game had been well-executed in the gameplay, it would be very good, but it lacks several amenities of a good game like the native controller support and better menu/general interface.<br><br><br><br>The game feels looks and plays like a flash game, a good one, but a flash game nonetheless... If you are expecting a true rogue-like game, go play torchlight or others you will pay little more but will be WAY more pleased.<br><br><br>IF you like twin-stick shooters, the game is very interesting and has good variety of gameplay, but, please! Play with a controller.<br><br><br>You will like:<br>Twin-shooter novelty;<br>Cool Graphics and music;<br>Lots of power ups, weapons and items;<br>Random generated dungeons equal a lot of replay value;<br><br>You will hate:<br>NOT rogue-like;<br>The stupid I.A.;<br>No native controller support;<br>Bad menus, can&apos;t control with the keyboard have to use mouse;<br>Very difficult;<br>No, seriously, VERY DIFFICULT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1785535">Expand</a></span>

As you explore these interlocked rooms, you control your character with WASD and fire with the arrows. You can pick up various drops: coins, health, power up items, and equipment upgrades. As you progress, you encounter new enemies, bosses, and random mini-bosses. But that&apos;s about the extent of it. There&apos;s really not a lot going on here. There is no reason to call this a bad game.  It is good at what it does, but it is an extremely minimal game. Some would praise the twisted story and artwork, whereas I am constantly torn between what I see as a hint of a twisted vision (i.e., art) and just a bunch of poop and gore in an experience that is barely a game. I am not surprised to find that the binding of isaac has good scores here, since like I said it&apos;s definitely not bad. But I am surprised that the vast majority of people consider this an 8 to 10 range game. It&apos;s a good game, but I don&apos;t think it is worth even $5. I can play more interesting games than this for free in my browser, and I wouldn&apos;t even lose much in quality. In short, this game certainly has style, but as a game, it is more of a Newgrounds sort of a game than a commercial game. Definitely try the demo before buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=1827889">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m 8 hours in and I still can&apos;t pass level 4 and I haven&apos;t beat the game yet, and it&apos;s not because I suck at it, this game has little to do with skills, it&apos;s because &quot;I&apos;m not lucky enough&quot; to get the essential drops that will help me kill a boss that fires constantly in 8 directions while jumping around dropping flies and vomiting acid, all at the same time, and you only have 2-3 hearts meaning you can only endure 2-6 hits before you are death.
<br>
<br>Very good game ruined by insane difficulty and luck-based chances of winning. Don&apos;t waste your time with this, specially if you like, you know, beat and see the endings of your games. It gets 2 points because of the concept, gameplay and good music.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=3225330">Expand</a></span>

The exploration is reminiscent of old-school roguelike games (like ADOM or Nethack), and the combat is reminiscent of old-school Zelda games, only with shooting. The story is slightly interesting, but not anywhere detailed enough to call it a major aspect of the game. So what you get, in the end, is a mediocre shooter-game with some RPG elements. Unfortunately, as modern games evolved to become more gamer-friendly, this one didn&apos;t seem to get the message. It&apos;s extremely punishing and unforgiving of mistakes. You die, whatever the circumstances, and you start over from scratch. No continues, no extra lives, nothing. You don&apos;t even restart the same level; you restart the game. Add that to the fact that the game is completely and entirely random and you get some levels that are painfully easy and some that are painfully difficult, and it&apos;s a complete matter of luck as to whether or not you can finish the game. I didn&apos;t have the patience to keep trying because the game didn&apos;t lure me in. It&apos;s sad. I really wanted to like this game, but I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-binding-of-isaac/user-reviews?user_review_id=2078086">Expand</a></span>
