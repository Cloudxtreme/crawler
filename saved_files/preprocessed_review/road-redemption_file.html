<br>- Graphics is like CS:Source. It&apos;s not beautiful but take too much system resource while running.
<br>- Gameplay, item... are poor.
<br>- Physics simulation is terrible.
<br>In conclusion, the first RR is better!</span>

<br>The spiritual successor angle they were going for reeks of marketing and not a reflection of actual gameplay, much like another recent title, Strafe. The rubber banded combat (enemies stick to you until you kill them, rather than attacking when it is strategically viable and racing ahead otherwise) feels boring, forced and lifeless, unlike the extra layer of gameplay that it provided in Road Rash. Beyond that, the feeling of progression found in the original Road Rash trilogy is completely absent here, with the game acting more like an arcade game than even the originals. Additionally, the multiplayer pales in comparison to its supposed predecessor, despite the fact that it is older than some of the fans of this game.
<br>
<br>In the end, Road Redemption feels less like a spiritual successor to Road Rash, and more like a cousin of Ride to Hell: Retribution. The only thing it shares with the former is motorcycles and combat, but it shares the glitches, poor design choices, bad voice acting and incredibly repetitive gameplay of the latter. This is not worth twenty United States dollars, not even ten dollars. The only time I think this could be acceptable is as a four dollar phone game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/road-redemption/user-reviews?user_review_id=7582186">Expand</a></span>
