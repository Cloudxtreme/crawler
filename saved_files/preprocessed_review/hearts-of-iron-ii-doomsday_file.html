Now I consider it the best strategy game ever designed. To call it an advanced game of Risk scarcely does it justice; no game, WW2-themed or otherwise, has so accurately emulated the actual conditions of war on this scale. So accurate are the mechanics that you will often find yourself in the same predicaments that faced the major powers: Germany running out of men and oil, the Soviets without good leadership after Stalin&apos;s officer purge, or the USA unable to intervene due to the isolationism of its citizens prior to Pearl Harbor. The game is set up so that events happen as they realistically should, though you can choose to diverge from history and create your own World War. You can also play as any nation in the world, and while many of them aren&apos;t very fun or interesting, it gives a great deal of variety and lets the player be creative. There is little I can think of to complain about this game, other than the fact that its complexity might prove to be too much for casual gamers. Most of the outstanding complaints I have of the original game have been addressed in this most recent version. (For those of you who do not already know, Doomsday is a standalone expansion and includes the original Hearts of Iron II.) Any fan of strategy, or any player with a lot of ambition, would do well to invest in the game, as it will give them hours and hours of fun and replay value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-ii-doomsday/user-reviews?user_review_id=401519">Expand</a></span>

That, and it&apos;s half the price of the original game! Unimpressive, utilitarian graphics and sound, and a debateably enjoyable soundtrack based loosely on martial music from war movies and classical music, are coupled with a very clever AI system and some very well-polished options for international diplomacy. Too bad the game gets a bit crashy at times, but you could do a lot worse for the money.
