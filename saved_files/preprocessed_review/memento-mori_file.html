There is just no humour in the game at all, it is all so serious. And the subtitles have some bad mis-spellings (how did someone miss that). The major con is that it really doesn&apos;t pull you along enough to want to keep on playing. After an hour each time, you get quite bored, but come back to finish it (which at least is a better aspect). A solid p-and-c game and recommended to anyone who likes that genre. For everyone else, it might all be a bit slow and linear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/memento-mori/user-reviews?user_review_id=3915298">Expand</a></span>
