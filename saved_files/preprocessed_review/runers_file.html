<br>
<br>If you like top down bullet-hell Rogue-likes (think Binding of Isaac, but with more bullets), then you will love this. Don&apos;t be fooled by the graphics; Runers comes with a ton of content. Not only are there hundreds of different rune combinations and spells, there is also an insane variety of enemies and bosses, and a ton of customizability, offered by your starting choices and then your randomized trait offerings as you level up and enter new floors.
<br>
<br>This game will not let you rest. You will not grow lax while playing this game. You will be dodging madly, holding down the mouse madly and slamming your fingers down on keys, trying to outrace the frenetic speed of the game. The difficulty scales nicely through the game, and there are five different levels for all kinds of players.
<br>
<br>This is an amazing Rogue-like that uses every bit of its potential to shine brightly. It&apos;s pretty easy to get over the graphics when the gameplay draws one in so completely. It is basically glitch-free, with nothing game-crashing, and has an amazing amount of randomization and customizability. Each game you play, you will gain experience, knowledge of new spells and rune combinations, and hopefully a few more spells for your RuneDex. You&apos;ll get small but not-completely-insignificant in-game boosts and understanding of enemies and patterns, and you will build upon your past games to get better in future ones.
<br>
<br>This game has seemingly infinite replay value and is just amazing. I recommend it anyone who likes Roguelikes, bullet hells, or even just good, solid replay value. This has the potential to become a classic with a fan following rivaling that of Binding of Isaac. Mastertronic got this right the first time, and the developers are still improving, correcting, and bug fixing with impressive speed.
<br>
<br>Runers is beautiful. Go and get it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/runers/user-reviews?user_review_id=4461202">Expand</a></span>
