<br>There&apos;s 3 hours of actual content that&apos;s stretched out to seem like there&apos;s more.
<br>And I didn&apos;t even do most of the side quests, which required even more crawling and backtracking through all the areas you had already crawled though.  I think it could have lasted another 24 hours at that rate. That&apos;s not really more content. That&apos;s pretending like you have content, and needlessly dragging out something that&apos;s already boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4133868">Expand</a></span>

<br>the game also has the a very good atmosphere.  gameplay is not good but not bad too and the Rig parts are where the gameplay shines especially that fight with Laroche in the final hours of the game.
<br>there&apos;s also a radio in the rig but you won&apos;t get the chance to listen coz it&apos;s TEMPORARLY UNAVAILABLE for about 95% of the game. Damn that really pissed me off
<br>the game took me 13 hours and 26 minutes to finish with doing some side missions too
<br>i can only give it a 7.5. and i could&apos;ve given it a 8 if the gameplay was better than this,coz killing humans really sucked in this game and if it had a bigger world and more sidemissions</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3835240">Expand</a></span>

The soundtrack reeks of Serenity, but is a solid selection and the use of environmental effects in playing it is just one of the subtle details the game offers. Yes it&apos;s a different game than 1 or 2. But I like change and all of its imperfections. And this one isn&apos;t so off-the-rails as, say, Dead Space 3 is to its predecessors. Pros: Mechs! Giant enemies! Glowy spots for obvious shooting targets! Cons: Lots of walking. Awkwardly placed cutscenes. Limited arsenal... Wait for it to come down in price and pick it up at the 20  30 level. Money well spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3868997">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Many of you have criticized Dead Space 3 for the fact that he almost lost the atmosphere of the first part. So, Lost Planet 3  this is the correct Dead Space 3, for those who want the atmosphere, interesting characters, the attention to detail. Dead Space 3 was very beautiful and epic attraction, but Lost Planet 3  that&apos;s how DS was to look for the lost cold planet.
<br>
<br>I repeat  do not listen to the negative reviews, try to play by yourself and decide whether you like the game or not. If you do not want to buy  ask friends to give you a game disc. But  give the game a chance. After a terrible Lost Planet 2, the third part  it&apos;s a giant step forward in the development of the franchise. And I think  it&apos;s very right step

<br>The game was immediately marred by a loss of personality. It decided to go for a &apos;gritty realism&apos; atmosphere, in opposition to the high-flying epic action of the previous games, and that combined with uninspired and repetitive level design packed with backtracking seriously damaged the experience. As a matter of fact, for a long time, I was hard-pressed to describe this as a Lost Planet game, rather than a generic sci-fi third person shooter.
<br>However, it&apos;s my opinion that the game&apos;s benefits outweigh its generic feel and repetitive levels. First off the game is visually gorgeous, and unlike the first two, very well optimized for PC. This comes off best in the extremely high-resolution facial animations and PC-exclusive high-resolution textures. Second, the game&apos;s writing is outstanding  a merit the first two games lacked  and is packed with believable and likable characters that I found I quickly started to care about. Third, three enjoyable series stables have returned  the towering mechs, adaptable grappling hook, and creative multi-stage bosses and minibosses, and while all three have gone through some measure of change, most notably the mechs (or rather, singular mech) but this isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing. The mech you pilot through the game, the Utility Rig, becomes almost a character of its own as you customize it and unlock various attachments and upgrades that will aid you in your journey.
<br>In conclusion, the game often wound up being drab and repetitive, but I&apos;ve always said: repetition doesn&apos;t matter as long as what you&apos;re doing is fun, and doesn&apos;t outlast its welcome. The basic shooting that composes most of the game is uninspired, but the epic boss battles, well-realized story, and incredibly fun mech piloting do just enough to balance the experience out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3488144">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately LP3 is a prime example of what happens when a balance between story and gameplay are not kept at equilibrium; combat and gameplay feels toned down from LP2 with not much in the way of exploration or exciting action. If anything it feels less fluid and more of a chore come the later battles, instead the game opts to tell you how to win without letting the player come up with his or her own strategy like with the previous games in a desperate attempt to advance the plot. While the aesthetics are nice to look at, levels are very tiny and linear with no room for exploration, missions are laughably short and Loading Screens are painfully plentiful. It really feels like the developer didn&apos;t do its research by missing the entire point on what the Lost Planet series was built on and ignoring Capcom&apos;s own attempts at perfecting the IP. Hopefully Spark Limited takes the moment to learn that while imitation is considered the best form of flattery, gutting a series from what it&apos;s known for in place of something that instead deserves to be in its own IP is what alienates your gamers from the series it enjoys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3466664">Expand</a></span>

True, it has some tedious parts and lack of rig-weaponry; somehow, it doesn&apos;t feel right. I enjoyed the maintenance tasks with the rig  which is well suited for those, but for combat is unsatisfying. Yes it tries to be Dead Space-like, but I felt some Rage and Mass Effect in it. No achievements so there is little to no replay value for me right now even if I left out a bunch of collectibles. The key configuration is a bit awkward and didn&apos;t allow me to remap most of the keys, i.e., use E for multiple actions was rejected, even though some keys were by default mapped to many actions at one. Still, its a buy on -25% sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3466826">Expand</a></span>

You have control of a Rig which is like your personal Mechwarrior, but you also leave the rig and use your weapons like pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, etc. Great game and enjoying every minute of it so far.

Own all games in the series on PC and X360. And i must say i`m totally disappointed with Lost Planet 3. This game is a garbage on all aspects   animations look like PS2 or previous century PC, &apos;almost&quot; open world is downloading every 2 minutes giving us stupid video logs nobody cares about, all details that were essential for LP are taken away (free anchor, VSs, roll&amp;shot, jump&amp;shot, grenade shooting, rockets launcher, stun animation and many, many more) and are not replaced with anything valuable. This game shouldn`t be named Lost Planet. It has nothing to do with LP franchise but snow and few character names. But that`s not all. Game is horrible bugged and glitched. Many people can`t even start it or it crashes all the time and there is no patch 2 months after premiere... Multiplayer is worst experience i`ve ever had in video games. People who has DLC characters are invisible for these who don`t have it, same with some weapons, rank and progression is reset to 0 very often, Akrids act like bricks, lagg is everywhere even at people with very good connection indicator,  you never know where your anchor will stick, FPS counter limited to 60 no matter what options you`ll set and what PC you have,  etc. etc. etc. I could count endless things that are broken in this game. Won`t recommend this game to anybody even my worse enemy, The only good thing worth mentioning are locations and ice. EDN III looks really good and traveling with RIG is pretty fun especially when you`re allowed to play your MP3 (unfortunately  game allows you only sometimes, when it wants it, not when you need it). Conclusion  Don`t buy it. Don`t even think about this garbage. Go play Lost Planet 1, Lost Planet Colonies or even Lost Planet 2 (not perfect game but compared to LP3 it shines like a diamond).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3762427">Expand</a></span>

We Russians are different for her special opinion, which is different from the opinion of others. And I can safely say from us,and that was good. Bad warhead and uninteresting open world , developers compensate for the excellent atmosphere and storyline. The game is far from perfect but on a solid 7.5 I and my Russian COMRADES were satisfied.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3922327">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is my favorite Lost Planet game because it has mature and interesting story. It tells a lot about the inhabitants of E.D.N. and about thermal energy.</span>

<br>
<br>DO NOT BUY THE GAME at least you play some &quot;demo&quot; first or see some reviews... Sad day...

The game has a good soundtrack, and believable and honest characters. I started the game with a somewhat negative opinion after looking at the reviews on here, and within the first 2 hours I can honestly say most of those negative things about it just aren&apos;t true.
<br>
<br>-Does not play like deadspace, there is about an hour of the game where it&apos;s deadspace-esque in a dark unexplained ship.
<br>-It does feel a bit like work, but hey, you&apos;re on the planet working to pay for your family to have a better life. But after a few hours it becomes so much more then work, and you start getting more and more pieces of the true operation that&apos;s going on on the planet.
<br>-I did not have any crashing or freezing issues in this game(my build is decent but not by any means high end)
<br>-There are not that many cut scenes. (57:13 total time for all cut scenes in the game)
<br>
<br>Overall I would definitely recommend this game, I picked it up on humble bundle for 1$ and if you can get it for a low price it is definitely worth checking out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=5617072">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And yes, the story of this is a little better written than the previous games.
<br>
<br>HOWEVER...
<br>
<br>The gameplay is lackluster, they took things that made the previous games enjoyable and scrapped them, trying to appeal to a more Dead-Space/Gears of War audience.
<br>
<br>The camera is tighter making it infuriatingly difficult to spot when an enemy is approaching from behind, the grappling hook is practically gone (now instead used on selected ledges when you get a button prompt), the weapons are sluggish and ineffective, enemies weak spots are small and pointless, the Akrid have lost most of their bug like charm.
<br>
<br>The fun Vital Suits are gone, instead replaced with the big RIG, which as an addition would have been kick ass but it feels like a feature downgrade. The HUD is temperamental, the Multi-player is a meagre 5v5 (and only a short while after release, apparently barren to) compared to the 8v8.
<br>
<br>The reason I loved Lost Planet 1 and 2 (and I imagine most fans will agree) was their gameplay, sure it was a little slower and at time, cluttered and anarchic, which could be kind of infuriating but also fun, but it was different, it wasn&apos;t just &apos;Generic COD clone #425&apos; or &apos;Third Person Shooter #233&apos;, it was Lost Planet, what Spark has tried to do here is gather more of an audience by replicating main stream games, and, without the budget those games are packing or the ground-up focus those games have, they&apos;ve plummeted short.
<br>
<br>The art is disappointing, while in Lost Planet 1 I could see and hear the crunches of the snow and in number 2 the jungle and desert environments were stunning, in here they just feel kinda bland, you feel like a guy walking over a movie set built to look like a snowed in wasteland, not like you&apos;re actually there, all in an attempt to make the game feel more survival horror, a-la Dead Space, again robbing the series of its own style.
<br>
<br>What about the story that everyone&apos;s talking about? Yes, the characters are a little more relatable (or some of them are, whatever, I&apos;ll get to that in a second), yes the writing is better than Capcoms attempt, but the purpose of a game is to play, an area where this game falls DRASTICALLY short.
<br>
<br>The writing and story is better and the voice acting for both the main character and Gale is pretty good, but some characters just sound bored, some of the voice actors did a terrible job, sounding like they&apos;re reading lines for a radio advert or something.
<br>
<br>And on a slightly more personal note, the need to make everything darker and grittier is  infuriating, seriously, I liked my slightly cheesy story with giant mechs, stirring speeches, a clear bad guy and glowing orange aliens, just because every other game decided they were going to paint the scenery and the story with an extra thick layer of grit doesn&apos;t mean you have to jump on board because hey, all the kids are buying that  up.
<br>
<br>So overall the writing is slightly better, if only slightly, but the gameplay is butchered in an attempt to mimic the &apos;big games&apos;, the enemies, environment, weapons, characters have all lost the things that made them unique, several key elements of play from previous games have been cut down to simple button prompts, removed entirely or over emphasized (such as weak points now being an absolute rather than a reward), and everything that made the series fun in its own way has been removed.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer has been butchered, practically completely hacked off and is plagued by long waiting times and miniscule lobbies, a player backing out just before the start of a game will leave everyone else in the lobby in a state of Limbo as players can&apos;t leave, new players can&apos;t join and the game wont start until there&apos;s a full lobby (only remedied by completely quitting the game and restarting), with simple things like a mute player option missing, because a boolean is a hard thing to add.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is still slightly enjoyable and some attention to writing is good to see, so while this isn&apos;t my cup of tea (and if you&apos;re a fan of the first two, probably not yours either) some people may find some enjoyment in this fairly generic shooter (hence the 4) but if you&apos;re a fan of the series give this a miss, it was built to try and please fans of the mainstream action games, not fans of the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3519771">Expand</a></span>

Lost Planet 1 was mediocre, Lost Planet 2 was flat out bad, but Lost Planet 3 is like a love letter to Aliens inspired by elements of Dead Space 1 with hub environments, side quests, interactivity within the hub environments, great atmosphere, excellent graphics, great gameplay, etc. Again, what were the reviews going on about? It&apos;s a travesty that this has such a low Metacritic score. This has far more depth, far better voice acting, far better characters, far better gameplay, etc. than prior Lost Planet titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3652842">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s just terrible. Seems like they wanted to make it look like Dead Space, but they failed, the gameplay is boring, like the plot. A great step back in the franchise.</span>

<br>
<br>HUGE step back in the franchise, avoid it, the campaign is typical attempt to appeal to us &quot;westerners&quot; with it&apos;s new (horribly boring) story. Another reviewer also said it, Lost Planet 3 is trying to be like Dead Space now with it&apos;s atmosphere (even the menu music sounds like Dead Space&apos;s!), and they fail miserably. Wait for this game to be $5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3456104">Expand</a></span>

The main story is interesting enough but the side stuff is boring and annoying. you have your mech and can go on missions and stuff, there are upgrades for your mech ass well as weapons. I just wish they had put more effort in side missions, made it more open world.</span>

Seriously fantastic. I was going to leave a praising review until I got to the crab boss on Mission 4. So, there were other crab creatures like it that were killed without the rig and in the rig. But this fight is cheatingly special. You&apos;ll find the YouTube videos of other gamers highlighting the stupidity of the game creators but not like me. So, firstly, the morons who keep going into the &quot;over the shoulder&quot; view. Fine... Just dont be stupid like in this game. Be sure when adding this stupid view you can toggle it off because it causes problems when fleeing attacks. Such as, not being able to see where the heII you&apos;re going because the camera angle blinds you and although the crab is no where on the screen when fleeing to the left you somehow still get hit. Who knows why? So, you always MUST dodge to the right thanks to the over the shoulder stupid ass view. (retards). And although you may spend 45 minutes fighting this crab boss his shell will not bust off. No matter how many times you run out of heavy ammo and shoot it with the crap pistol. The crab actually glitches in place and you can shoot every part over and over again (the weak parts). and you guessed it!! Nothing happens.... The back of the crab doesnt shoot off and you basically have no choice but to stop playing. Its a great game up until that point and then its a total piece of SHlT... So, since I cant get my money back from the PS store I hope I can fix these dumb asses who keep going with the over the shoulder view. They are too damn stupid to understand the logistical concerns when cutting off 180 degrees of view from your in game player... idiots these days.. messin up our music and games..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=6308313">Expand</a></span>

<br>To start with, the story telling is very good. You control Jim Peyton, an every day guy who travels to E.D.N III. You know, simple, everyday stuff. From the start, you notice he is not one dimensional. He is driven by other things than just money.
<br>Scenes with his wife, Grace, are perhaps the best part, as you start to care for Jim even more.
<br>The map, unfortunately, is small, but it seems rather large in comparison to the slow mech you drive. You trundle around in it for a large portion of the game, and engage in fights with giant Akrid, the denizens of E.D.N III. The fights mainly consist of QTE like button presses, but the swipes from the enemy must be blocked and countered before the QTE starts.
<br>The on foot section is fine, it&apos;s not great, it&apos;s not bad. In honesty, the only weapon you really need is the shotgun, accompanied by the frag grenade. You fight Akrid still, on foot, and have to shoot them in their convenient orange glowing areas. Some of the fights are genuinely challenging for a start, but then they just get annoying when you fire an explosive round at an Akrid, you kill it, but the explosion kills you and you have to start over again. It&apos;s standard third person shooting, and the cover system works fine too.
<br>It&apos;s a good game, but it&apos;s nowhere near great, and I just feel it could have been a lot better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4186603">Expand</a></span>

The third game failed to give the same progressive or linear story the other two gave and it seemed like it was an attempt to create an open world for the player which I did not feel was achieved. I also did not appreciate the lack of larger bosses and VS suits.  The Akrid were extremely lacking in this game and it felt like instead of surviving on a planet infested by giant glowing alien bugs I was on an alien planet dodging bad guy humans and there just happened to be a few Akrid along the way. I was also longing for a battle between me and other VS suits that did NOT involve me in an over sized mech drilling platform. In comparison to the other two games, this was a disappointment to me.  If they decide to make another game in the LP series, I really hope they go back to their previous game play styles.  If you have never played the LP series, get the first and second game and play those first and THEN play this game.  If you have played and liked the other games in the LP series, you may not like this one as much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4327999">Expand</a></span>

If being stuck on an ice-planet with a giant mech and aliens sounds like fun, go ahead and grab Lost Planet 3 when it&apos;s on sale.
<br>Total installation size on my hard-drive (with all DLC and HD cutscenes pack): 27 GB.
<br>
<br>Jim Peyton is just your ordinary guy out to earn some money for his family back on Earth by taking mining contracts for the NEVEC corporation on a frozen ice-world. This expedition by NEVEC is supposed to be the first to ever set foot on this world, but as Jim finds out, his bosses have been less than truthful about many aspects of the operation. There are several elements that you might expect: strange alien creatures, a frenemy that becomes a friend, a stoic person of wisdom, a cold and windy setting. After about four hours of gameplay, Jim is out on a mission for NEVEC when Lost Planet 3 suddenly goes all Dead Space; he finds himself exploring decrepit structures while strange creatures pop out and attack without warning. Apparent betrayal, a mad scientist, and an evil corporation round out the cast, and while you&apos;ve probably seen it all before, Lost Planet 3 implements these elements well. Few things about the story surprise, but it is told effectively, and the voice acting is top-notch.
<br>
<br>For much of the game, you climb into your giant mech (called the &#x201C;rig&#x201D;) and go out into the frozen wastes doing missions for the NEVEC corporation. Some upgrades can be purchased for the rig, but it&apos;s not customizeable in the traditional sense. The weapons Jim can wield have decent punch and there are about a dozen to choose from. I stuck mostly to the simple assault rifle; decent damage and a large magazine made up for the twitchy iron sights (which hurts the effectiveness of the sniper rifles). No real weapon customization, just bespoke upgrades that can be purchased at the stores.
<br>
<br>Enemies come in two varieties: human and alien. The humans are your standard gun-wielding soldiers who hide behind cover or charge your position with shotguns. Most of the time, though, you&apos;ll be fighting the alien Akrid. There is a good variety of Akrid; my favorites were the weird six-legged ones that dive behind cover and just barely peep out at you, before rearing up like a cobra and spitting volleys. In the early part of the game, the boss battles involve fighting several of the larger, tougher Akrid all at once (when in doubt, shoot the glowy bits). Later on, there are some individually unique (and enormous) bosses (still shoot the glowy bits, though). Some of the &#x201C;lesser&#x201D; bosses are re-used a few times. The battles are not over quickly, and offer a fair bit of variation and challenge. Be alert for QTEs; they don&apos;t form the core of the battles, but they are important for the finishers.
<br>
<br>The graphics are Unreal 3, and except for some strangely low-res clouds, are great (I recommend disabling Motion Blur in the Options menu, though). The backdrops are large, ice glistens, and snow blows convincingly. There is a free DLC of the cutscenes in HD (the DLC is a 7.5 GB download), so those also look excellent. The soundtrack (by Jack Wall) is great; instead of going for a big orchestral score, Lost Planet 3 instead goes for a quiet, reflective approach for story moments, and scratchy, screechy strings in the horror moments. Once you&apos;re out in the rig looking for resources, though, the mood changes to catchy Celtic-style folk tunes.
<br>
<br>A number the YouTube reviews of Lost Planet 3 are outright negative, and if you don&apos;t play the game for more than four hours, you&apos;ll probably agree with them. I stuck with it and was rewarded with a good game that in retrospect has been treated unfairly (perhaps because it was too different from Lost Planet 1 and 2? I haven&apos;t played those games at the time of this review). Recommended on sale if fighting aliens on an ice-planet (with real boss battles) sounds like your cup of tea &#x2013; &#x201C;on sale&#x201D; because a truly great game doesn&apos;t require &#x201C;sticking with it.&#x201D;
<br>
<br>Notes:
<br>- Multiplayer is dead. Don&apos;t plan on getting 100% of the game&apos;s achievements unless you can get some people together to help you out.
<br>- There is a technical issue with the mechanical claw of the Rig. Left mouse-button attaches it to an object; if that object needs to be rotated, the screen prompt is &#x201C;tap WASD to turn the claw.&#x201D; THIS IS WRONG. The correct way to turn the claw is to repeatedly tap the F key. This is a common enough issue that a quick forum search revealed the answer, but how the heck does that slip by the QA testing?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=6491822">Expand</a></span>

<br>Sadly where game fails to impress is the gameplay side. You spend long time amounts of just walking place to place in your rig, many missions and side activities are just busy work making you do rudimentary stuff, plus do backtracking several times to places youre fine with visiting just once. Shooting mechanics and overall gunplay is pretty big step down from previous 2 games, physics dont feel as robust, Jim feels weightless and guns feel very light with barely any feedback, gun sound effects also lack any punch and are just bare bone basic, making shooting sequences not that fun. Fighting akrid themselves dont feel as satisfying as before, boss fights dont feel as cool and human Nevec enemies are just plain boring foes to engage with.
<br>
<br>On PC game runs pretty much faultlessly at 60 fps on my GTX 650, except for rare odd micro freezes at times, also for a UE3 game it looks pretty well with decently detailed environments for a obviously lesser budget game, nice light effects and good looking snow in which your footracks get registered. Aswell if you pay attention Jim has some pretty good facial animations and overall structure adding to his believibility factor.
<br>
<br>This game has its sharm in places, i cant denie that, but its also brought down by generic game design which stops it from being something more better, mostly lacking that fun shooter gameplay finesse of previous 2 games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-planet-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7683019">Expand</a></span>
