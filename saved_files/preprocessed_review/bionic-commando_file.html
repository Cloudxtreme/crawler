                                        <span> I love this game. GRIN have nailed the swinging mechanics and its just a lot of fun to swing around the dilapidated city. The game is pretty linear and there are only a few ways to dispatch of enemies but if you can get past that you will find and amazing game with a great online component. Please buy this game so we can see more like it.</span>

And if you look at the top critic reviews, none of them mention Rearmed. Morale of the story, its an awesome game if you look past and dont compare it to the old 2D incarnation.</span>

I did not expect the ending and though it might not appeal to some audiences, I like to use my imagination and predict what happened next. Also I was just amazed at the fluid and seamless animation of the character swinging at extreme speeds all over the place. It&apos;s very awesome to see the realistic physics, GRIN did a great job at the swinging mechanic. It&apos;s true that you have to pause and look up controls for the keyboard in the beginning, since the on-screen instructions show xbox buttons, but after a few minutes you basically got it. There aren&apos;t that many buttons to press anyway. I do not understand why people are complaining about the controls and the port to PC. No bugs. Controlling was a piece of cake for me. (I used to play Gunz, a game that requires extreme mouse and keyboard micromanagement) But anyone that considers himself a competitive gamer (or has basic knowledge of where keys are located on a keyboard) can master the controls pretty easily. There are a only few methods to kill enemies (or it may be a lot, my opinion), but that is a good thing. I hated it when games would have a million ways to kill enemies, and I had a hard time choosing and utilizing them all. With this game you can actually be kind of creative with how you can use the skills. Plus it&apos;s simply awesome to be swinging cars around and punting them at people. Gameplay was repetitive at times, but it&apos;s just so thrilling and dynamic that I never got bored of it. Graphics were beautiful too. Bottom line: for you to enjoy this game properly, you must be able to think fast and aim quick; that&apos;s it. Excluding the wasd buttons, there are only about 5 other buttons to worry about (which is very few, compared to other games like Crysis or GTA and etc.). I think this game definitely deserved a better overall score. The efforts gone into this intricate game is amazing. Even the Menu interface is a wonder of computer coding and graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bionic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=739746">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, It&apos;s a solid action platformer, reminds me a lot of Batman mixed with Darksiders. The action is fun, the boss fights are fun, and flying around takes a bit of practice but looks awesome when you pull it off.
<br>
<br>That said the inconsistant gravity and weird weapon scanning (weapons do damage before bullets &apos;hit&apos;) makes for some weirdness.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s a solid game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bionic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=4504498">Expand</a></span>

No other game does it better, not even the Spider-Man games. There is a learning curve due to the free-form nature of the swing mechanic. But once you master it, once you grasp where to attach your grapple, know what point in your swing trajectory to detach your grapple, understand which direction to shift your weight to, and think far ahead to identify your next two or three grapple points, once you master all that will you truly feel like a &quot;rad&quot; Bionic Commando.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bionic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=3881629">Expand</a></span>

But it is an absolute riot to take down 5 enemies without touching the ground. Boss fights are awesome, and so&apos;s the general game. Go and buy it, RIGHT NOW.</span>

Now most of this is only superficial. The game works great with mouse and keyboard and i had no problem whatsoever with getting the game to work. But i think that it is just plain respect-less that they didn&apos;t take the small time required to fix this. Now with that out of the way lets focus on the game. The gameplay in the game is surprisingly fun. The swinging is really satisfying and the combat is quite enjoyable. There is also a couple of quite cool areas that you get to visit in the games campaign. Sadly is the games campaign kind of short (around 5-6 hours) and its story is pretty bad. The checkpoint system is also pretty messed up. Its quite far between checkpoints, collectibles doesn&apos;t stick and enemies that was already dead when the checkpoint was triggered has a tendency to respawn behind you which can be kind of awkward. This combined with the radiation manages to take the fun out of exploring which is kind of a shame since the swinging is the part of the game that works best and that is the most fun. Some other things that annoyed me were some quicktime-events and that a couple of things in the game wasn&apos;t properly explained. I might sound a little bit to negative here so i should point out one last time that the swinging is pretty damn great. And i enjoyed the game despite its problems.The game do however have its fair share of flaws but i will despite that recommend checking this game out if you are into the genre since the game has its moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bionic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=2825525">Expand</a></span>

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it is utter garbage. How bad is this game, let me put it this way, on screen indicators make reference to the X or Y buttons on your non-existent xbox360 controller for the PC!!! Idiotic. The controls for grappling are so frustating you swear the idiots at Capcom never even playtested the pc version of their POS game. If you buy this game, you&apos;re merely supporting their negligent attitude towards the pc platform. For some reason, the moronic japanese developers just don&apos;t know what the f-kin mouse is for, or don&apos;t know what good HCI principles entail. Frustrating experience. Two thumbs down for this garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bionic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=742007">Expand</a></span>

The letters on the screen A, B for jump, punch what ever doesn t match the keyboard keys. To make a action with combined keys, is too diffucult, and sucks. For example, make a stupid HACK action, it took half an hour. The game was designed for Playstation, not for PC. And stupid interfaces makes the game bad</span>

Some bonus that doesn&apos;t do anything at the end... Try it before buy it!</span>

If that is what you are going in for, this game hits the spot perfectly
<br>
<br>If that is *not* what you&apos;re expecting, though, it could feel like something of a let-down, because while it starts out looking like a fairly story-driven FPS, runs through the standard Super Soldier stuff like Metal Gear Solid/Rambo/Deus Ex/Commando etc. (you are the ultimate warrior of bygone days, called upong to reluctantly return to service and save the day), it really is just a platformer. I think this could cause some to take a dim view of the game, which is understandable.
<br>
<br>Anyway, the whole thing is better than I was led to believe, and is a solidly implemented nod to something *like* the original in 3D. Swing, kill, get out of the line of fire, kill, swing, get a better gun, swing, kill - like spiderman with guns, as a platform game.
<br>
<br>Swinging on the arm is done brilliantly, guns work well and you get upgrades regularly (one at a time like the original game, some would have liked to see a pack full of weapons to switch between but in fairness that might not make sense given the character). Boss battles are well done, satisfying and interesting without any of the tedium and brokenness that seems to plague many games&apos; boss battles. There is one possible exception on the boss battles thing, but a) it is spoilerish and b) doesn&apos;t ruin the game.
<br>
<br>Overall, this platformer scores well. Before you play, watch some videos of the original 2D game and see what you are signing up for - and if you decide to go in knowing that Splinter Cell it ain&apos;t, this game is good, solid, old-fashioned fun.
<br>
<br>Overall, graphics aren&apos;t particularly fabulous, it&apos;s a (fairly) repetitive platformer, and nostalgia would not have carried it alone, but it scores an 8/10 from me for one reason, something that is missing so often from games: Playability</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bionic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=5409488">Expand</a></span>

Even while playing youre being shown Xbox 360 prompts instead of your keyboard bindings. Tho once you remember all the main prompts it not much of a issue and game isnt that long either. Graphics look fine, but nothing out of ordinary, game has some cool lighting and water effects tho. Things like anisotropic filtering or AA will have be enabled from Nvidia control panel or whatever AMD has similiar to that.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise its a bit tricky to learn the controls, but it works pretty fine once you do, even on mouse + kboard and using your hand-grapple hook and swinging around oulling together more and more of them can be very fun. Once you get the sensitivity right shooting guns get very precise.
<br>
<br>Story in this game is BLEH, Nathan himself is very boring character and so is supporting cast. Only thing that made me care about whats going on is what happaned to his wife.
<br>
<br>In the end an OK action game with cool gimmick, if you got nothing to play and can find this for cheap go ahead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bionic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=6782845">Expand</a></span>

For 3/4 of the game you are simply moving way point to way point with no real motivation to continue. You hit each waypoint just hoping for a glimpse of some story line, some excitement, or just something to care about, but it&apos;s kind of a snooze until the last quarter of the game where the music starts playing the old themes, you actually get to fight a real boss and enter a enemy stronghold, then it just ends... It ends with a lot question marks. If it wasn&apos;t for the last quarter of the game I&apos;d give it a 7, but the last bit made me love the game enough to get past snoozing through the first 3/4 of it.
<br>
<br>The music is wonderful and incorporates the orginal themes which will really get you excited once they start playing. Combat is fun and fluid and incorporates guns and your grappling hook. Instead of discovering secret items to become stronger you complete challenges for more health, faster reload, more armor etc. There are collectables but I recommend skipping them your first play through as the game is slow enough at the beginning. The world you play in is gorgeous and sprawling both horizontally and vertically. The grappling mechanics are fluid and a lot of fun. You can jump of a building and dive to the bottom into a swing or crash into an enemy to kill them. Gravity doesn&apos;t hurt you, the only thing that will is water. The gameplay is really really good, it just lacks pacing and story.
<br>
<br>I bought this game bundled with bionic commando rearmed on sale for ~$5. I actually like &quot;rearmed&quot; better but if you love the series play them both because it&apos;s a cheap bundle that goes on sale often.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bionic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=7672087">Expand</a></span>
