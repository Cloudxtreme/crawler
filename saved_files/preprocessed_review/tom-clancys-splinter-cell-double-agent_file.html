I bought every splinter cell game at retail price, and i can&apos;t play any of their games anymore with my current computer. But this game in particular was buggy from the start, and to date it&apos;s still a nightmare to play. I installed XP on a seperate Drive, installed the game, updated both windows XP and the game, updated every driver, and still the game crashes constantly. And even IF it manages to load a level, you have to play it with horrible sound and missing textures/glitches. (Core i5-760, GTX460, tested on Windows XP SP3, 270.61 nvidia drivers).<br><br>When i bought this at release day i had a 7800GT, and it didn&apos;t display the graphical glitches i endure now. But the 7800GT was nowhere near capable to run the poorly optimized game, and the games graphical settings kept resetting them after i tuned them down. So the only gameplay i ever saw of it was a slideshow basicly. It seemed like a nice game, with moral choices, and timed sidemissions when you where in New York. But this gets interrupted by random crashes, and when you forgot to save stuff you had to do the same stuff over and over again. I think it&apos;s hard to justify the 50 euro pricetag it had at release (Yes i bought it at release, because i loved splinter cell), but even if you payed 10 euro&apos;s for it, you&apos;d still be ripped off. It&apos;s a buggy port, that never got patched properly, and to date doesn&apos;t work. Not even the steam releases. Why isn&apos;t there some sort of quality control that needs to be passed first? This is daylight robbery! My suggestion is, buy this on the console, i&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s a fun game. The PC port is just an abomination of a game, that should NEVER have been released.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1609927">Expand</a></span>

But the only problem is that it is glitchy as all hell. I&apos;ve had problems with directional keys not working for activities liek safecracking, I&apos;ve had countless random crashes, and I&apos;ve had lots of visual errors like the screen going blank after leaving it on the pause menu for 10 minutes or longer. Frankly, I suggest you wait until the game gets some more patches (if Ubi gives a damn about their PC customers). Lucky for me I got it on clearance for 20 bucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=396679">Expand</a></span>

(ATI Radeon 4870X2, 4gb DDR2 ram, Vista 32bit, 750i SLI Gaming motherboard with a case that has 6 fans, and a 9800 quad core PCU) Like everyone else I also had the fun of dealing with the crashes. Mainly on the cruise ship level where it just wont load the level at all, due to some insertion of my character into the level error. Not enough dialog from the enemies telling you what they know, getting clues and info... just wasn&apos;t there. To this moment I haven&apos;t completed the game, not due to difficulty, but due to the crashes. I spent more time with the crashes then i did playing the game. Graphics contained little to no Anti Aliasing, nice bloom effects by the way... i was blinded by them when ever there was a sun in the sky. Lighting in the level DID NOT tell you where the lighting really was, to know where to stay away from so the enemies wouldn&apos;t see you. For example, it would look like you were in a dark area, but the light down the hall is apparently illuminating you. Sneaking up on enemies was entirely to easy, i ran up to half the people i killed and they had no clue i was even running around. whistling wasn&apos;t as effective as Chaos theory, also whoever came up with the idea to use a green dot for hidden and a yellow dot for not hidden, is a retard, you can&apos;t just have black and white you need to have some gray area to know when your approaching a lighter area of the level versus a darker area, ESPECIALLY when the game doesn&apos;t show you light from dark that well, as stated above. I bought this game for $9.00, thank god, cause thats as much as its worth. Ubisoft, i dont know what the hell you were doing when you were releasing this to PC, but you had to have been drunk to have even remotely thought this was even 10% ready. Well done on ruining a great series, might i suggest recall and redo... to late at this point though. Also in response to a Anonymous person who gave this game a 10 and said the following &quot;Well, this game is flippin&apos; awesome! But, I read the reviews above and everyone is complaining about the P.C version!!! EVERYONE knows that if you&apos;re going to get games with top-of-the-line graphics, you have to get it for a console, unless you have an extremely good video card! I&apos;d say you&apos;re free to your opinion, but you don&apos;t need to complain if you have a console where you can truly enjoy the game. These people are basing their ratings on how the game RUNS, not how it actually PLAYS. I suggest you put the proper rating for the playing, and then write about how it runs.&quot; Couple things wrong with this comment, 1. Mr. Anon, if you scroll to the top of this web page and read the header, go on do it. Ok now what did it say? &quot;Tom Clancy&apos;s Splinter Cell Double Agent by PC Games&quot;. PC games, hmm so this probably means that this isn&apos;t a console forum, well how interesting. 2. My computer kicks the crap out of every console to date so when you say &quot;top-of-the-line graphics&quot; this isnt one of thoes games. I run Crysis full spec. Crysis hasn&apos;t released to console since consoles don&apos;t have the power. Sandbox 3 creates compatibility on a lower graphical standard FOR consoles, so don&apos;t go there. 3. Mr. Anon. Since we are talking about the PC version of this game. The playability of the game IS effected by how well it runs. So in short your comment is really not thought out, and is truly a great mark of stupidity. If you don&apos;t know what the hell your talking about don&apos;t say it. I think everyone can agree that its annoying to see a comment as such. My frustration of this game,and its inability to work, and the actual game play not being worth playing plus that awful comment just lead me into a frenzy of this long wall of text you see before you. I think you already know my oppinion on getting this game, but for those people like anon who are just complete dumbas*es i don&apos;t recommend this game.

From my experience of playing it (since I&apos;m a pretty big Splinter Cell fan) I&apos;ve made a list of the bugs/glitches.
<br>
<br>Some of the ragdolls spaz out so ridiculously that they can actually cause damage to you by slapping you with one of their limbs. The safe-cracking controls are too sensitive and take pure luck to get it right. The Kinsasha missions have their brightness really screwed up (it&apos;s too damn bright), as well as giving you two loading screens when trying to quickload, only to be finished off by having the damn game crash. Sometimes the game crashes even by trying to open the radar! By the way, if you don&apos;t have the patch  you don&apos;t get the equipment rewards (which is  considering it gets difficult to bypass the later hacks) but even then some of the things don&apos;t work like the electronic lockpick. If your system is slow and old, some of the cutscenes will repeat over and over like the bomb on the cruise ship failing to detonate or the game doesn&apos;t even load up because the intro cutscenes keep repeating. Then there&apos;s having to wait about 15 seconds in an unskippable cutscene when you finish a game or the training course to get back to the main menu. Some of the video settings are screwed up as you can&apos;t even tell if they&apos;re properly calibrated. Sometimes you won&apos;t even see if the shadows are there, because of the otherwise bastardized HDR effects, which ruins the gameplay when you need to hide in the dark. Pressing Escape is considered a dangerous move in the game, for instance: if you suddenly press ESC as you&apos;re trying to access a computer, you&apos;ll get a view of pretty much the whole map from an indeterminate location and as you try to press ESC again  it crashes the game. The SC-20k and the Riot Shotgun both reload in the same way as the SC Pistol  well done, developers. Another great glitch is if you decide to blow up the cruise ship and then Enrica decides to let you inside the bomb lab at the end of the game, but that option gets you nowhere as you can&apos;t even continue  Sam just freezes in place and you can&apos;t move him, leaving only the choice of killing Enrica before seeing her as viable. And here&apos;s a goodie for the people who play with HD screens  if you don&apos;t have the game set at 800x600 at the ending where you have to disarm the final bomb  you can consider yourself stuck. The ending of the game where the SWAT bust through the windows simply won&apos;t play and you&apos;ll just be left hanging there like an idiot until you close the process of the game and start it up again. The overall controls just feel like you need some sensitive analogue stick to do it right, because: 1. Sometimes you can&apos;t properly get into crawl spaces, 2. You have to use your mouse to navigate on the profiles&apos; &quot;Medical Info&quot;, &quot;Activities&quot; and &quot;Personal Info&quot; sections (and the mouse is invisible.) 3. And, the safe-cracking. Then there&apos;s dialogue.. Which can sometimes feel VERY awkward. Even Sam delivers some of his lines really strangely.. and so do the NPCs. The sound is quite messed up too as the music is sometimes either really quiet or really loud and the gunshots are really quiet, while Sam&apos;s screams and bullet ricochets are louder. Sometimes you can hear the body-picking-up sound repeat twice at the same time. The game seems like an evil little imp that decides when it wants to be more buggy than other times. I once tried to load a game on the Shanghai level and it came up with a box saying &quot;Please insert a storage device.&quot; (Obviously from the Xbox port.) There&apos;s also an annoying part at the start of the Okhotsk level, when you try to sneak to your fallen equipment, Sam will sometimes not grab the ledge when you fall down the cliff and repeatedly die. And besides that, when he falls  an EXCESSIVE amount of blood just splurts out, making it look like he was slaughtered by a giant lawn mower
<br>.
<br>Overall, it seems like the game is a completely horrid mess. But that mess only surrounds the awesome remains of the Chaos Theory engine which is the gem of the series, in my opinion. There are some different and cool new moves like being able to grab someone by being right behind the corner. I can&apos;t really say I hated the JBA HQ missions, since everytime you have different objectives and to see how many and how fast you can do them is quite a fun challenge. The trust system is OK on the more easier difficulties. Because of these positive things, I&apos;m going to be merciful and give the game a rating of 3.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;d give it a much higher rating if I played it on the XBox 360 version, but since I didn&apos;t know what the Quality Assurance team had on their hands beside that version and a big bottle of Crown Royal... Well... You just put those three together and you get this vomit-covered buggy PC port. Don&apos;t bother getting it unless you&apos;re prepared to have a headache and getting prescribed on anti-depressants.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=3582785">Expand</a></span>

While there is the addition of swimming in Double Agent it is only used in two levels so it feels more like a gimmick than an addition to Sam Fisher&apos;s arsenal. I never bothered using any grenades or other gadgets because of the horrible inventory system obviously meant for gimped console systems without a keyboard or mouse. Compared to Chaos Theory there are practically no enemies to interrogate and hardly any dialog. Would have been a nice sequel if there had been more levels, lines and darkness. Also, between each mission you have to sneak around a compound and do a certain amount of objectives in a certain amount of time. If I weren&apos;t such a stickler for hearing all conversations and seeing everything extra I would have skipped every compound mission.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=421097">Expand</a></span>

The game randomly crashes to the desktop while trying to load or returning to the game after adjusting settings. This is particularly frustrating in the second to last mission (which is actually 3 missions in one). For some reason, every time you load last save, or any save for that matter, it crashes. The only way around it is to exit to the main menu and load your last save again. However, this process takes a full 2 minutes (yes, I timed it) and will be repeated ad nauseum, especially if you&apos;re trying to get 100% stealth on hard. In the JBA missions, you can&apos;t be on the same staircase as other npc&apos;s or else the game will seriously lag. [***SPOILER***] You can&apos;t even finish the final JBA mission because after you disarm the bomb, the game hangs as if something is supposed to happen but never does [***END SPOILER***]. It&apos;s a shame to see such a well respected series spit out something as putrid and neglected as the PC version. I hope at least the console versions don&apos;t have as many hang ups as this one. Hopefully, Ubisoft will spend more time finessing Conviction so the consumers won&apos;t be used as beta testers again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=82909">Expand</a></span>

The game however also feels somewhat unfinished, as what could have seeded the ground for some awesome gameplay mechanics, somehow drowns in show-stopping bugs (falling through the floor as you spawn in the initial Okhost level, consistently through 4-5 mission restarts), unintuitive and unfinished levels (you will be surprised how often you try to scale an object which looks climb-able, only to see your character slide off on impact, or otherwise just don&apos;t know where to go. The in-game 3d map is a farce.), graphical obscurities (the training level was having an extreme, unplayable shade of white, even after the latest drivers. Perhaps some HDR-effects out of control?), broken/unintuitive mechanics (why am I losing trust with the JBA when they&apos;re not even remotely aware of my secret expedition to X?) or even just the whole lot of gameplay opportunities which the developers could have explored a bit more (I was, for instance, frantically trying to find a path down to my downed teammate in the first mission, and was quite disappointed with the fact that I was unable to make the choice of saving him or not while the clock was ticking and I was attacked from all sides, as it would have made perfectly sense according with the mood of the game.) All in all is SC: DA a sad, sore attempt at something which could have been a worthy successor of Chaos Theory, an sure GOTY-receiver even. Something is just missing. It feels like they had a complete, high quality product to begin with, but then took away 20% of it, applied high-quality rendering effects (which paradoxically has a broken on/off switch in the menu) and then shipped it off.. The development team could definitely have used another year working out the quirks and; atleast made the PC-version look and act like a native PC-game, instead of having unchangable keyboard-layouts and very, very controller-catered menues. My advice is clear. Avoid this product. I won&apos;t call it a game, as that would be an insult to the medium.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=421351">Expand</a></span>

You must open safes, pick locks, rifle through cabinets, and (the best part--NOT) solve a ridiculous 3D suduko cube, all of which are pointless other than dragging out the story. The rest of the game is sneaking into structures and sniping the occasional adversary. The genre is listed as action/adventure, but it is actually just an exercise in stealth.

Graphics looked great except the lack of anti aliasing. Jagged edges are not attractive. Installed the most recent patch but could not enable anti-aliasing without video trouble, 25% of the screen sort of working! One bug I actually noticed in the game was on the cruise ship, leaving the bar there is a double door entry to an elevator area. The left door actually has 2 doors 1 90 degrees offset from the intended door. This can trap players and 1 of the AI&apos;s. Could have been much better, I am sure it will get there in a few patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=396056">Expand</a></span>

Ubisoft could&#x2019;ve achieved perfection. Instead, they failed miserably. I&#x2019;ll never forgive you for this capital sin&#x2026; it&#x2019;s not like you care anyway.
<br>
<br>I have the original retail 2 DVD version, and played the game back in &#x2019;06 when it came out. I remember having lots and lots of crashes, disappearing saves, lighting issues&#x2026; I also remember going through a very rough time during the Congolese mission, where all the issues combined to give you a perfectly anti-epic experience. But I persisted, I was enjoying the story and the gameplay at those parts that it wasn&#x2019;t bugged, and eventually finished the game. It took probably more than twice the time it should theoretically take, but whatever.
<br>
<br>This last month, I became sick with nostalgia, heaven knows why, and decided to get the Splinter Cell collection from Steam. I honestly thought the game had been polished after so many years. I couldn&#x2019;t be more wrong. All the problems persisted, even with the latest patch. The Congolese mission is still incredibly buggy, making you CTD lots of times during loading screens, and making you pray that at least your last 1 or 2 saves didn&#x2019;t become corrupted; there&#x2019;s still a door in one of the JBA missions that doesn&#x2019;t open, with the &#x201C;interact&#x201D; button appearing and disappearing almost instantly. You know IT IS supposed to open, since you have an optional objective hidden in the room behind that door. Oh, and this was new for me, the ending cutscene was stuck in place, with the music playing, and the keyboard not responding to my commands. Seriously, what the hell? Last night, after googling around, I discovered that by setting the screen resolution to one of the native 4:3 ratios would probably solve the problem. And it did. But why allow widescreen resolutions, if the engine can&#x2019;t take care of them properly?
<br>
<br>I was able to find a workaround to all of the problems I went through, but finding them made me waste valuable time; I was able to find a custom-made 1.02a patch, that reduced the CTDs during loading screens and kept the save corruption to a minimum &#x2013; I was actually able to play and complete the Congolese mission in about 1 hour, while without the patch, 1 hour was the time needed just to pass the palace part, due to constant crashes and saving corruption; regarding the door in JBA HQ mission, editing the splintercelluser and splintercelluser1.ini files by assigning to keys the cheat codes &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; and &#x201C;walk&#x201D; did the trick; and finally, the ending cutscene played when I decided to force windowed mode and 800x600 resolution. But gaming should be about having fun playing with no worries, not searching for solutions to problems that should never exist in the first place, and worrying if the game is going to crash during your next save or loading screen.
<br>
<br>With the knowledge of these workarounds, as well as the installation of the custom patch, I give this game a 6.0; but there&#x2019;s so much wasted potential here&#x2026; this game could get so much more. I hate you Ubi.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=6444016">Expand</a></span>

<br>Chaos Theory and the original Splinter Cell are two of my favorite stealth games.  The change to the &quot;stealth rating system&quot; and poorly placed save points along with the technical issues when you do save (it will not find your saved files on a regular basis) made me uninstall this game without finishing it.
<br>
<br>Some may enjoy this game but I find it a giant leap backward for the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=3273518">Expand</a></span>

(keyboard/mouse controls can actually be text-overridden from the SplinterCell4User.ini, but it&apos;s just more of a pain in the brain and the changes won&apos;t appear in the game&apos;s control settings)... Apparently the game designers/programmers at UBI didn&apos;t give a damn about all the PC users that are still out there, they only seem to care about the console-end of their games anymore.. All of this mouse/keyboard control crap also goes for SC-Convicted, which sucks just as much... Also the in-game weapon selection menu for Double Agent isn&apos;t as nice, Chaos Theory&apos;s weapon selection menu was a little better... anyway, on the other hand, the graphics are still nice and perform well on my setup! (E6600 + 9600GT).. Despite the problems, I somewhat still enjoy the overall game play of Double Agent, but not as much as Chaos Theory... To conclude: UBI seems to be ruining the entire essence of the Splinter Cell games, starting with Double Agent and then especially with Conviction (The stealth-play in the most recent SC game is evermore degrading)... UURRRRRR!!! UBI-dumb-a$$-wipes... There goes my share on the next SC series, cuzz I&apos;m done with UBI&apos;s poopee compositions!...

Steam forums confirm there is a known issue with very few people actually having success in playing this game. It&apos;s better on the XBOX anyway--the PC version lacks controller support.</span>

<br>
<br>This game is so broken that youre not left with the choice of enjoying or hating a game, this game is ppure torture on PC!
<br>
<br>First of all just getting this game to run on a higher resolution and with a somewhat semi fix of the games lighting requires you to use a search engine. Once youre past this you might think the hard part is over, well think again whoever tested out this pile of trash must have done it on godmode.
<br>
<br>The games after the lighting fix still causes problems at some spots but the biggest annoyance is no matter how you toggle the games brightness settings still cant manage to find a setting that manages to give the player a fair chance to use the games shadows. There is tons of moments where you might think youre about to enter some shadows but then the in game indicator still shows a yellow light which means youre visible, this is how you will get &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; for the most of the time.
<br>
<br>Some other bugs:
<br>
<br>AI is really bizarre, sometimes they cant see when youre in front of them after getting semi detected while at other times youre spotted from far distances in crouching position about a hallway away semi hidden between 1-2 pillars of cover. other times they will wander around like headless chickens circling a limited area just waiting to be put out of misery.
<br>
<br>Door bugs. There is a couple times where walkign through a door is a problem, the same goes for grabbing ledges to climb and cutting fences.
<br>
<br>The safecracking puzzles doesnt always respond to keyboard directions, i had to pick up the xbox controller 1-2 times during these to finish em.
<br>
<br>The game crashes heavily towards the last few missions, also you cant see the games ending without reverting back to a in game menu resolution if youve have changed the config file to support a higher one than 1280x1024
<br>
<br>In the 14 hours i used on it i had to restart the game about 50-60 times after it crashed to desktop.
<br>
<br>There doesnt seem to be a way to disable Xbox controller vibration when using keyboard/mouse, it will start vibrating at times so its either unplug it or put it at a soft place like i had to do lol.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer did not boot up in any way, didnt have a chance to see which version of the game i had nor if it had the latest patches,atleast for the EU steam version that is i played on.
<br>
<br>Theres more bugs/problems i cant remember.
<br>
<br>The game itself is the worst in the series up to this the 4th game i have played so far. It had some good ideas like missions taking place in the hideout of the bad guys in the game where youre undercover and decisions making a difference on how youre perceived between the good/bad guys youre working for.
<br>It still feels somewhat of a barren version of the older Trilogy though, theres really no reason to use most of the gadgets in the game except for the the 2nd last mission or when a objective requires you too.
<br>
<br>The menu system is one of the most unintuitive i have ever seen going back and forth the game is a hassle and if that wasnt bad the save system is even worse, theres not indicator besides a image of the map, due to the many game crashes it has you will save very often and finding through these saves requires almost a monocle next to you since you have to look closely at the time stamps. I couldnt use my windows watch and had to look at my phone next to me constantly to find the right save file since minimizing the game is a risk factor due to crashes/lockups.
<br>
<br>If youre gonna get this game get it for some other system, i have only played the PC version even though i had heard alot of complaints about it but i preferred playign the old ones with keyboard/mouse and after finding it on a winter sale how could i go wrong ? it went so bad it turned into pure torture to play through this.

<br>
<br>As a PC port, the game is troubled. Although I did not experience any of the infamous frame rate issues and crashes that plague this game, and in fact got it running at over 60 fps maxed out, the port is still quite poor. Mouse support is down from the already lacking Chaos Theory. Now computer terminals, keypads and hacking systems are navigable only by keyboard, making it a lot more awkward to use. Also missing is the ability to enter keypad codes with the number buttons on your keyboard.
<br>
<br>Additionally I found the default keyboard assignments bizarre. Shift to jump, Space to use. I can only assume that these were decided by a developer unfamiliar with typical PC controls. Changing key assignments is clunky, and on numerous occasions I found my alterations had not saved when, upon trying to knock out a guard, nothing happened and I was instead shot.
<br>
<br>As I&apos;ve said, the game ran fine on my PC, but I get the feeling it&apos;s very picky about what hardware it works with and what hardware it doesn&apos;t, as with GTA IV. You should probably only buy it if you find it cheap and/or you&apos;re feeling lucky.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=84301">Expand</a></span>

In game characters can see you from like 10&#xFEFF; feet away especially in snow maps and you&apos;re in snow camo! You have to agree with me with this one. Can&apos;t even finish the game because of horrendous glitch wads. Balancing mission objectives between the JBA and NSA in my opinion is too far-fetched, tedious, and complicated. It cannot get anymore non-simpler than the other games in the series. Don&apos;t waste your money on this folks. If you want to play a better Splinter Cell game, Chaos Theory is much more worth the buy and fun, especially with co-op play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2633902">Expand</a></span>

This is on a modern computer, no strange hardware, fresh install of xp with all the patches. My computer easily exceeds recommended configuration. Shelved it while I wait for them to fix it. Very disappointed in the commercial reviews. Even when they mention the bugs and crashing, many of them still scored it high.</span>

I love the fact that you&apos;re a double agent and have to make your decisions so that you satisfy both agencies, it really makes you think. All in all, it&apos;s a great addition to the Splinter Cell series, if not THE greatest. By the way, my PC: 1.9 Ghz CPU, 1.5 GB RAM, Nvidia 6600GT. It doesn&apos;t even meet the minimum requirements, but the game still runs quite smoothly on high details. Talk about great optimization... I haven&apos;t experienced any of the bugs or errors listed here, so I guess I should consider myself lucky.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=73057">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been a fan of the multiplayer since it first appeared on Pandora Tomorrow and playing it non-stop. Double Agent&apos;s versus mode is so bad that the SCCT community has started to clone SCCT as an open source project. &apos;Nuff said. The single player is the same, boring trail and error fest you&apos;ve grown accustomed to in the previous Splinter Cell games. Unfortunately it&apos;s filled with bugs and bad design ideas. Both games have a terrible interface which is much more suited for a console title. It&apos;s a port and it requires a very high-end system, even though you won&apos;t see anything here that you haven&apos;t seen before graphically.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=394391">Expand</a></span>

The controls are clumsy and very clearly based on a weak console port. The menu-mouse has a ridiculously high sensitivity that isn&apos;t adjustable (the sensitivity setting only affects the mouse in the game engine.) The game forces you to watch an idiotic 20 second cutscene every time you go to the main menu, loading games doesn&apos;t work if you aren&apos;t dead, and it doesn&apos;t even quit properly! It ignores ALT-F4, doesn&apos;t Alt-Tab, and it takes up 10GB of hard drive space to screw all this up. Save your cash, this game&apos;ll be worth the price of entry when it hits $20.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=394927">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> All my comments have been posted by other users such as poor interface, buggy conversion, games saves that won&apos;t load et cetera et cetera; What I&apos;d like to know is how come so many &apos;professional&apos; reviews rated it so highly when so many users have such poor experience. You only need to check out the Ubisoft forums to see how many disgruntled PC users there are.</span>

The specifications required to run this game are astronomical. I personally did have a PC which absolutely slaughtered any other game I put in front of it. But when this came along from my &quot;insert generic .com game sales company here&quot; preorder, it was unplayable. And upon checking the specs required to run the game, I see my processor was 600MHz too slow and Gfx was out of date. However, after upgrading my PC, this game is found to be one of the most entertaining titles I have ever played. The multiplayer mode is finally what it should have been to begin with. The spies are now forced to use shadows and play like spies should have to play. The mercs are better tooled up than ever and all the levels have been made to look fantastic. The single player, although short, is entertaining enough for a few hours. Not that ive been playing an awful lot of that, the multiplayer is just astounding. What I would suggest is that before you buy this game, you FIND OUT if your PC can cope with it. If your PC can not meet the recommended requirements (forget the minnimum requirements) then do not buy this game. Otherwise, there is no reason whatsoever why I cant justify every penny I spent on this quality release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=394252">Expand</a></span>

And Splinter Cell: Double agent is a great example of that. There is a lot of things wrong with the game and not many that were done right. I finished the game but there were times I thought about not trying to.
<br>
<br>Lets start with bad then shall we.
<br>
<br>The game crashes. And it crashes a lot. And there is no pattern just when will it crash. Sometimes in the middle of the mission, sometimes on mission load, sometimes on intro or outro of the mission. And sometimes it works just fine for an hour or longer. But on other times crashes after ten or fifteen minutes. Quite annoying. And once you decide to exit game, it can freeze itself forcing you to restart the windows in order to regain control.
<br>
<br>The graphics are aged and it shows. Fact that highest resolution is 1600x900 does not help either. To top that the first mission is really ugly which makes matters even worse at first. You get used to it later on and it&apos;s not that bad as the first impression.
<br>
<br>Audio seems fine most of times. Though lack of subtitles is extremely annoying. This was almost a reason not to play the game.
<br>
<br>The game does not introduce itself very well. It lacks that modern tutorial/guide style so present everywhere. This is somewhat refreshing but leaves a lot for player to figure out. Some things I&apos;ve learned on almost ending missions. But the lack of waypoints saying exactly where to go was a bit of back to the roots trip. When you actually had to figure stuff out instead of going after the flashing blip.
<br>
<br>The story is rather bland. The start of it a disaster I would say. It gets a bit better later on but it is not to original or interesting at that.
<br>
<br>Mechanically it&apos;s not too good as well. The three vision mode, night, head and electronics are pretty much useless. I don&apos;t think I used them even once in a meaningful way. Shooting and combat are bad. Most annoying thing being - why the hell is a pistol more accurate than a rifle? I mean really. Grenades are useless as well.
<br>
<br>As a stealth game it fares much better. Sneaking is satisfying as much as stabbing the guys in the back. Most of the missions can be completed by remaining stealthy which is nice. Safe cracking is a nightmare though. The controls for it are terrible.
<br>
<br>That should be about time to tell something good about the game. So what it does going for it are pretty well designed levels and missions. They&apos;re interesting and challenging. Some of them are approachable by different ways I guess though it&apos;s not the same amount of freedom as Hitman games for example.
<br>
<br>Also the JMB headquarter levels are very nice - especially with the trust mechanic. This is the only part that makes the game worth playing. Time you are given to complete some additional objectives really adds to the double agent atmosphere.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d say 6/10 if you disregard the crashes. Not really something I can wholeheartedly recommend though I&apos;ve played worse games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-double-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=6673196">Expand</a></span>
