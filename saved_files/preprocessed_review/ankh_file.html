<br>But what I can say is that the german version is a very very good game! It really reminds me of the good old Lucas Arts adventures that we all love so much, because it has a similar style, great gags, logical riddles and VERY good speakers that fit to the characters, which create a very convenient atmosphere. The only reason why I don&apos;t give it a 10 is because it is a little too easy for an adventure-verteran like me. But that is probably just me and it still is a great game that I will definitely play again in a little while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ankh/user-reviews?user_review_id=71283">Expand</a></span>
