<br>
<br>One job has you starting at the bottom and working up till your a master detective. This was the first job I chose. It&apos;s actually pretty interesting. Each job has a bar that you have to fill up in one day to do the best performance you can. Do more tasks, fill the bar, easy. The tasks for a detective can get repetitive, but you have to look at it as this. You do the same crap over and over again in a real job in real life. Sure they could of added plenty more interesting events that goes on, but for me it&apos;s perfect. Soon you will be collecting evidence from a crime scene, then gathering your clues and setting up an APB. It&apos;s pretty cool that you get to interrogate the people you take in. You can be a good cop or a bad cop. It&apos;s basically the same thing around for the other two jobs, Scientist and Doctor. You work your way up by doing whatever.
<br>The big shiner for this DLC is definitely the choice to buy a retail store and sell items you make or buy for a higher price. It works great and is an addition I want in the next Sims game.
<br>
<br>Overall, GTW is a great expansion that filled my needs, but it being 40 dollars is up to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4-get-to-work/user-reviews?user_review_id=5170675">Expand</a></span>

Im loving the new careers, but I would like more being added in the future (vets in sims 4 pets, teacher in sims 4 university... ) I also think that intead of adding aliens and some other small things I would have enjoyed more to have a more detailed content (careers and retail) and made for example aliens its own EP (with several species, new worlds (in which sims can live) resources, factions, styles of architecture... etc instead of just having two fancy consumes and a bunch of makeup. I think some things are missing in the expansion pack, for that reason I prefer a really immersive and condensed retail/career rather than scattred pieces of gameplay. The fact that there are no locked doors, lines in the cash register, HOME BUSSINESSES, and more EMPTY LOTS (it wasnt so difficult to add the three working lots and a bunch of emppty ones in magnolia promenade...) I mean, the experience is so limited that the rest of the content isnt so enjoyable!
<br>
<br>As well, hospitals look so boring! There is a lack of the tension environment of a real hospital! areas full of sick patients, lots of doctors... In the Sims, its just a line of 5-6 people and nothing else. That was dissapointing.The career should have gone in a more management path, as it would have been amazing if we could actually MANAGE something or run our own hospital or prison, not just clicking some interactions. This expansion pack could have brought theme hospital and prison architect into one game, but it just didnt. And where is that little machine that would require customers to pay in order to enter in aa lot (in order to be able to maange your own gyms, bars, etc...) Just a few more objects would have made this EP the best, it just didnt.
<br>
<br>Retail isnt as good as in the sims 2. I really miss the &quot;persuasion skill&quot;, and customers just dance and make circles to talk. The general experience is a bit shallow. I do love the new employee interface though. But employees actually dont work. Cmon EA, you can do better...
<br>
<br>MY CONCLUSION: Rushed expansion pack. Ea managed to transform the best EP ever (OFB) into a not-so-fun remaster. Feels really limited and the doctor career is just clocking action bubbles. Again, a bit mediocre. EA, intead adding a bunch of incomplete stuff, make a fully-detailed and WORKING, immersive EP not including, for example, aliens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4-get-to-work/user-reviews?user_review_id=5162323">Expand</a></span>

OFB was one of my favorites and while this EP doesn&apos;t live 100% up to that it brings back those feels. Was a little sad to not see restaurants and things like customer loyalty and reviews, but the new things like photography and clothing boutiques make up for that! With the business aspect combined with active careers it makes for a great change to the base game. The active careers are what i have always wanted! While we did have ambitions in the Sims 3 it just didn&apos;t do it. Working with your Sims in the workplace not in a rabithole is amazing! I was getting fairly bored with the base game and im excited for the expansions to begin, they bring so much to the game!

<br>
<br>Although the content of the - what I like to call - &quot;mini expansion&quot; (because it really is bloody small), is exactly what the title indicates it will be, what the HELL happened to the rest of the careers? This simply doesn&apos;t cut the mustard, and dear lord lest we forget, for readers from the UK at least, that the game was being sold for SIXTY QUID with NOTHING ELSE included, along comes this fresh piss in the wind, and they want nearly THIRTY quid in some places for this tiny little addition!
<br>
<br>Electronic Arts has a long way to go if it really wants to appeal properly to the UK consumer market. Some people might be either die hard fans or just too stupid to spend more money than they have sense on simplified versions of the Sims, but not me. Nuh-uh. I got this bad boy borrowed.
<br>
<br>Three careers. One activity. An awful lot of wasted money.
<br>I would actually not be offended by it if it wasn&apos;t for the huge twenty quid difference the EA company expected the UK consumers to fork out for the base game alone.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately if you get this and you&apos;re already disappointed by the EA base game and how much of a veritable pot of gold you had to chuck out to get it, if you have half a brain cell, you&apos;ll be massively **** off by this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4-get-to-work/user-reviews?user_review_id=5184266">Expand</a></span>

Even tough the world is so small, you have a lot of opportunities and you can spend time seeing each career and seeing which one suits. For me, this is the best ever EP, so... keep it up!</span>

I created 3 female human sims and one female alien sim for my family to experience the new careers with.
<br>
<br>The Careers:
<br>
<br>Started with the doctor career first, it was pretty basic to start with, just talking to your co-workers and bringing the patients their food but you could cure them of their illness if you wanted, which I did..of course I did :P
<br>
<br>I got promoted to an orderly the second day I went to work with my sim and it was actually vastly different which surprised me and I was quite pleased about that. You had to admit people to a hospital bed and it was surprisingly realistic, people just kept on coming into the hospital waiting to be admitted to a bed and it was hard for me to keep up so it did feel hectic, the way it should since that&apos;s how hospitals actually are. Once the patients were admitted to a bed, you had to basically give them a general check up (ears, mouth swab, etc). Since you&apos;re just an orderly at this point, some of the information would go over your sims&apos; head so you had to give some of the information to someone of a higher rank (e.g doctor). My sim failed to get a mouth swab the first time which I thought was kind of amusing since she drops it lol but she got it the second time I tried.
<br>
<br>By the end of it, I did &apos;poor&apos; work apparently lol. Hey! I was doing my best! It&apos;s stressful being in the medical career ya know! :P Overall, I did enjoy it but at the moment it isn&apos;t my favorite career, which surprised me because I was expecting it to be, but I&apos;m sure it will be some peoples&apos; favorite :)
<br>
<br>The second career I tried was the detective one. I was interested in it but not as much as the medical career (I wanted to be a surgeon once), but I was curious about the detective career nonetheless. On the first day your duties were to get a case file and then travel to the crime scene. My first crime scene was what looked like a &apos;break-in&apos;, there was graffiti and broken electronic appliances in this sims&apos; family&apos;s house. The next step was getting a witness report from one of the sims&apos;, I got more than one since I thought it would be better to get more reports to help with the case file. After that, I tried to collect as much evidence as I could at the crime scene, taking pictures of the evidence and swabs of the evidence, etc. After I was finished, I returned back to the police station and processed all the information in this machine (I can&apos;t remember the name of it). Which was pretty cool, bright lights and such :P The evidence got passed on to a sim with a higher rank since you&apos;re only at the bottom of the career ladder and it&apos;s only your first day After that the duties were to process criminals at the station, taking their mughshots, fingerprints and searching them. Sadly I couldn&apos;t do that because there weren&apos;t any criminals at the station, which I found a little odd but oh well.
<br>
<br>The second day was a repeat of the first day but I ended up getting promoted by the end of my shift, so I decided to try it again for a 3rd day running. It was quite different this time. I was able to make my own case file from scratch, travelling to another crime scene and getting the evidence. After I did that, I had to go and try and find the culprit who did the crime, asking other sims if they&apos;d seen the sim who matched the description I had. I found it quite challenging because there were a few sims around who fit the description so it took me a few tries to find out who it was. If you falsely accuse a sim, it looks bad on your report. When I eventually captured the guilty sim, I had to process him through the police system and take his mugshot, fingerprints, etc. At the end of the shift, I did good work which surprised me considering it took me 3 attempts to get the guilty sim and I didn&apos;t have enough time to do all the things I needed to do with the guilty sim, but it was still fun.
<br>
<br>Overall, I enjoyed the detective career, a little bit more than the medical one. It was fun, involved and had the usual silly sims humor. It did make me want to get deeper into the career like the medical one so they both do a good job of pulling you in and wanting you to get more gameplay out of it.
<br>
<br>Last but not least, the scientist career. I have a massive love of science, always found it to be so interesting. Especially when it&apos;s space related. On the first day, my duties were to talk to some of my co-workers like usual and then I had to experiment with a few machines, which was pretty cool because they&apos;re huge and quite interesting to look at, like the giant laser. Then my duty was to create this device. It was fairly big and it reminded me of those metal balls you had in school to mimic the orbit in space with the sun in the middle and the other planets around it and you spin it to make everything rotate the way it does in space. I thought that was pretty damn cool for some reason, guess it&apos;s just the &apos;geek&apos; in me?
<br>
<br>Anyway, after that it&apos;s your job to create a food serum. I wasn&apos;t completely sure what was going to happen but I gave it a shot. First I had to go and harvest two plants for the food serum, there was a little garden at the back of the science lab. After that was done, you analyze the vegetables/fruit from the plants in a machine (like the dna analyzer in the detective career) and then it makes the serum. Next step was drinking it or giving it to someone else, I chose to drink it myself cause that&apos;s more fun right? :P It was successful and it filled up my hunger after my sim drank it. Which even though it was a simple and basic task to make the serum, I thought it was pretty cool and it got me to thinking what other things my sim will be able to create and what things we&apos;ll be able to invent so I&apos;m quite curious about the science career. So yup, you guessed it. It&apos;s my favorite out of all the careers!
<br>
<br>The careers overall are amazingly fun, creative, involved and funny. I think every simmer will enjoy finding their own favorite and experiencing them on a deeper level as they advance further into the careers. I&apos;m having a lot of fun with them myself so I can&apos;t wait to get further into it all.
<br>
<br>Clothes, hair and makeup:
<br>
<br>The new hairstyles were different but not really my style, there were a decent amount of new ones so I&apos;m sure some simmers will be happy about that but I just didn&apos;t care for them that much since the majority of the styles were short and shaved (Miley Cyrus type hair), but they&apos;ll appeal to some people, just not me.
<br>
<br>I was a little disappointed on the selection of the new clothing because there wasn&apos;t that many and again not my kind of thing, but some tops were quite nice so it wasn&apos;t a complete dissapointment. I just wish there was more choices but hey, for me it&apos;s not that big of a deal since it wasn&apos;t why I got the game.
<br>
<br>The makeup was quite unique and different. A lot of bright, pastel colours. I did assume they were mainly for the aliens since they look quite &apos;cyber&apos; and kinda out there, fairly dramatic. But you could use them on a regular sim, I just wouldn&apos;t because it was just too much but when I created my alien, they looked amazing on her.
<br>
<br>Aliens:
<br>
<br>I did create an alien, my curiosity getting the better of me so I just HAD to. It was a pretty cool experience, there&apos;s a wide range of skin tones to create an alien (I chose a light blue colour). I won&apos;t go into too much detail about them because I find the aliens kind of a special experience and they&apos;re always a really cool addition to the sims when they&apos;re around. They do have a few powers to use on regular sims though and it&apos;s quite funny :) I am aware of the new alien world that&apos;s available once you get high up enough in the science career so that should be interesting to go to once I get to that point.
<br>
<br>Verdict:
<br>
<br>As a whole, the new expansion pack is a lot of fun and I&apos;m quite impressed at how much content there is and the amount of things to do. I&apos;m really enjoying it and I highly recommend you buy it. I haven&apos;t really found any negatives to be quite honest. The important thing is the gameplay and I loved it so I find no fault in it. It&apos;s added a lot more hours of fun since the base game is quite bare and gets boring after a while and The Sims Get To Work definitely helps with this problem many simmers have found issues with. Looking forward to more expansion packs in the future!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4-get-to-work/user-reviews?user_review_id=5141805">Expand</a></span>

I am probably going to sell get to work to a millionaire or something (the only person who would buy it) , unless I find a good price for the original sims 4 on ebay or something. The sims 4 original costs &#xA3;49.99. What a rip off. I checked Amazon and it says nothing about needing the sims 4! It may be obvious to you video gamers but I thought that sims expansion packs were a seperate game. It definitely was with the sims 3 pets! If I got the game it would cost &#xA3;73.99. I dont know why so many people buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4-get-to-work/user-reviews?user_review_id=5188617">Expand</a></span>

This is an interesting addition to the game and it was definitely needed to make include more depth into the game. This is the expansion that was always missing from The Sims 3. The Sims 2 had something similar (Open for Business), but it didn&apos;t include interacting with professional careers. The new careers that are added are interesting. I have a guy who is 5 stages into the doctor career and one that is about 5 into the criminal detective career. It&apos;s a neat new mechanism and if you decide that you don&apos;t want to go to work with them one day, it doesn&apos;t force you to. I think overall that this was a vital inclusion for the series to make people like 4 a little more (although I&apos;ve loved it the whole time). My only gripe is that it is hard to get through the doctor&apos;s day sometimes if he knows all the characters, since &quot;greeting&quot; characters requires you to introduce yourself. It can sometimes do that in addition to making my other goals impossible at the moment, and can result in a bad work day.. I have not seen such oddities with the other jobs though. The new items are great and now I&apos;m just looking forward to the new additions :)
<br>
<br>However, I am docking 2 points from a 9 to a 7 for the reason of Origin. My sister and I have always loved The Sims and we normally either take turns buying an expansion pack or we split it and then install it on both of our computers.. Well origin puts the code into the first account to use it, so... we could no longer split these games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4-get-to-work/user-reviews?user_review_id=5333773">Expand</a></span>

Some of the careers are a bit stressful but it gets easier once you get the hang of it. The only reason I didn&apos;t give this a 10 is because a) I&apos;d like to see more jobs and b) it didn&apos;t add to the preexisting jobs. It would be hilarious and intriguing to get to be the mascot in the bodybuilding career XD. All in all, I think this was a good expansion; it just needed a little more work for the price tag. But it brought something new and fun to the table for the franchise. Don&apos;t go by the user rating. Anything related to The Sims 3 is being shot down by the haters right now. If you check sites that require actual purchasers to rate, the ratings are much, much higher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4-get-to-work/user-reviews?user_review_id=5316608">Expand</a></span>
