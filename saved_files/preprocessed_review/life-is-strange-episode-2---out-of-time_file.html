<br>This game is, quite honestly, one of the best games that I have ever played. Before I get into the review I just wanted to say, though, that it&apos;s very possible you&apos;ve heard something about the social justice undertones in this series. I can confirm these. On multiple occasions the protagonist mutters phrases like &quot;wow, I should volunteer for [save the bay effort]&quot;, or have hints that the best friend wouldn&apos;t use hair products with animals in it, or that guns should only be for women, etc. The protagonist herself is very reminiscent of a hipster, for a number of reasons too.
<br>
<br>Even will all of this, I can still say that the story is one of the best I think I have ever experienced. Throughout the day you make large and small decisions - never quite knowing if you made the right one. This creates some great self-narrative. The protagonist will mutter to herself &quot;oh wow, that was really bad. I should probably change what I said&quot; which makes the narrative really immersive, since you have to make decisions but still have control over the consequences you&apos;ll get since you can change what you said. This dynamic is really very cool. I&apos;d really hate to spoil anything about the story, and since you definitely should have played he first episode you should know what you&apos;re getting yourself into anyways. Suffice to say the story is really amazing, and that every decision you make matters in the end.
<br>
<br>Onto the dialogue. It was pretty poor. There were some moments where a line was delivered and I felt bad for whoever had to voice-act it. It was just so simplistic at some points. I can&apos;t exactly put it into words. Also, the banter is compeletely out of touch. I heard the word selfie over and over and over again I just couldn&apos;t get it out of my head. Writers- please stop it. Nobody takes selfies all the time. Nobody uses a camera as old as the protagonist does. Nobody in california, where I live, uses the word &quot;brah&quot; unironically. Stop sterotyping your characters. Not everybody is a) a cheerleader/athlete b) a jock c) a geek d) a skater. That&apos;s just not how cultural dynamics are anymore, and also saying that bullies are a serious issue is a cliche too. I feel like, when I am playing the game, I am playing an anime or the sims. I really wish that the less serious moments weren&apos;t just guided by these cliches.
<br>
<br>The graphics are decent. The optimization could be improved, though (I could run this game max settings at about x2 MSAA at ~45 FPS, but on Battlefield 3 I get a full 60 on ultra...) The game does not look anywhere as good as BF3, of course. Still, if you have a nice machine this should be no problem. Everything looks strikingly like the sims, I have to say. That can be a good or a bad thing.
<br>
<br>So it should really speak volumes that I still love this game - every bad element can be overlooked easily. There are flaws, sure. But the serious issues that are confronted during the story and the way that you can effectively set up the ending you want throughout is just amazing. So to everybody reading this, I would say go buy the full series. It is a story you won&apos;t want to miss out on. To the devs... well.. don&apos;t mess this up now! I have faith in you, just don&apos;t end up finishing out a great series like mass effect 3. You really have something going right now.
<br>
<br>Who cares about this review anyways. You should start with the first episode, hopefully this review just tells you to go out and get this one too, and the rest of the series! Full price is absolutely worth it. You can pirate the first episode first too as a demo, too, if that&apos;s your cup of tea. But these devs do deserve your money.
<br>
<br>And before I go, one last thing. I think it was really cool that the devs put in elements that not necessarily every player was going to see. That sort of thing is dying out, but these guys really went the extra mile. I&apos;ll say it&apos;s something similar to how GTA has it&apos;s electric cars switch from gas to electric depending on your speed- it builds immersion but almost nobody&apos;ll know that. That attention to detail is just amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-2---out-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=5110764">Expand</a></span>

This episode took me around 5.5 hours to finish 100% (talking to everyone, inspecting everything, getting all photos - in total, that&apos;s 1 hour longer than episode 1), the story gets darker and you finally get to see that your decisions from the first episode matter.
<br>Basically, this episode is the ideal sequel to the first episode. I can only say: Way to go!
<br>I can&apos;t wait to play Episode 3.
<br>If you like story-driven games in general, you should give this episodic series a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-2---out-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=5117872">Expand</a></span>

My girlfriend seemed to like it, I assume because she speaks English as a second language, up until the puzzles became unimaginative and melodramatic. Who has been saving the life of Maxine&apos;s friend six times a day, everyday, before Maxine got superpowers?

In my opinion isn&apos;t a very good episode, the first episode is a little better but still isn&apos;t a great game.
<br>The graphics of the game look nice. I also like how they have done &apos;some&apos; of the characters, some of them are too stereotype. For example, Victoria being the bully but is nice to you when she wants something out of you.
<br>I found this game to very boring and you are just in a walking simulator at the end of it. You don&apos;t have many choices to choose from (as this is a choice based game), I feel like you only have two choices and nothing in between.
<br>
<br>I am giving this a 1/10 because of the story, the characters and just the way the game is set.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-2---out-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=5188170">Expand</a></span>

DontNod once again nails the mood and atmosphere of the setting with soft guitar strums and moments of idleness punctuating the best parts of the game. While the game inevitably turns into a five bottle fetch quest halfway through, it&apos;s still captivating because of the charming, immature nature of each character which are fleshed out even further in this episode which  hits a fantastic conclusion. While the lip syncing is still way off, your choices still have an impact in this game, and the simple gameplay makes it really easy to begin enjoying this rather short episode. Take your time when you play and you&apos;ll see the charm and exquisite details hidden in this beautifully realized world and the characters that inhabit it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-2---out-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=5371146">Expand</a></span>

<br>Alright, so what has Episode 2 that makes LiS go from a 3 to a 6? Well, first of all, most of the original problems that I very sensibly pointed out such as crap animations, voice acting, cheesy lines and clich&#xE9; story are kind of still there, but a little more polished. Yes, the animations are still garbage, yes the girl says the cheesiest possible lines (haha, she said go-tassium instead of potassium what a comedian), but Out of Time made me look past these flaws. While still mildly annoying, it gets put aside by a good character development and a compelling story. Your decisions do matter and that&apos;s a thing I really liked here, the first episode said they would, but it did not feel good enough. In episode two, it really makes you want to go back (further back than Max&apos;s powers allow her to) and change some things...
<br>The voice acting was a bit worse as well, but the dialogues felt fluid and coherent. Perhaps some parts aren&apos;t ultra-realistic real life situations, but that&apos;s alright.
<br>And even though I said I looked past those things, it&apos;s still no excuse to just release the game as it was. Perhaps if they&apos;d spent another month or two polishing a few details, I&apos;d given it an 8 or 9. But we&apos;ll have to wait for the next 3 installments so I can actually do a decent review on this.
<br>
<br>Good game, go grab it, but for the love of god don&apos;t give up on episode 1! I hated it and didn&apos;t. I really think this game has potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-2---out-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=5206686">Expand</a></span>
