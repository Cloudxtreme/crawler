The questing system is ingenious and eliminates errand running and quest spam/quest grind. Armors look good, characters look good, and are customizeable. Animations are a step ahead as well. Voice acting is excellent, music is excellent. Races are slightly odd, but very distinct, and you can always fall back to Human. Skills are vast and varied, relying mostly on weapons for types of utility. The caveat is that you can only have 5 weapon skills and 5 character skills active at once, and they are mostly the same types of skills. Want to build a pure healer? You can&apos;t. Only one heal skill per player, and typically one heal skill per weapon. Each character will be 80% damage and 20% support, leaving huge gaps in teamwork and group play. If there were more utility, or a choice to go all utility or all damage, the game would be 10/10. It is, after all, the best MMO world ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2602457">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve been purchasing every major MMO release this year and have left extremely disappointed each time. I would log in, see &quot;kill X and Y&quot;, do the standard number mashing combat that you find in every MMO, and end up unsubscribing. I did try to give these games my all and see if I could break past the tedium, but I could not.
<br>
<br>People in these reviews are complaining about broken quests and server overflows. Guys, it&apos;s launch day. The game literally JUST CAME OUT and it&apos;s easily the most anticipated MMO since TOR, so can you maybe just give it a second and roll with the punches? It gets better, I promise.
<br>As far as questing goes, you are technically presented with the standard &quot;kill X of these&quot; quests, but packaged in such a way that if you don&apos;t want to do them, you can just bugger off and it&apos;ll disappear from your objectives list. Furthermore, the quests are shared across all players engaged in that particular activity, so you don&apos;t have to play alone.
<br>
<br>Grouping is also much better than in previous MMOs. Literally anyone standing next to me during a dynamic event is part of my &quot;group&quot; without any invitations or awkward conversation. All XP gets shared and loot is reserved for each character. Truly a step in the right direction.
<br>
<br>Speaking of XP, doing ANYTHING in Guild Wars 2 is likely to reward you with experience points. Chop down a tree to gather crafting materials? Revive a fallen ally or player? discover a new location? Yup, they all give significant experience points. So do crafting, exploration, dynamic events, and more. What&apos;s that? Reviving a fallen player? yes! Guild Wars 2 goes beyond the standard ideas of playing together that MMOs have so tactfully forced down our throats. For the first time, I&apos;m inclined and REWARDED for helping other players back on their feet after they get their butts handed to them, and other players return the favor when I&apos;m downed too!
<br>
<br>Bringing me to another mechanic. When you die in the field, unless you get severely roflstomped, you &quot;fight for your life&quot;. Throw things and bandage yourself while you&apos;re on the ground, and you even have a chance to bring yourself back to life.
<br>
<br>There are so many other mechanics that I could rattle off, but the ones I mentioned are the main draws for myself.
<br>
<br>basically, if you think you&apos;re burned out on MMOs, get GW2. It&apos;s not a re-invention of the genre, but rather an evolution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2587563">Expand</a></span>

I really think this MMO fixes many of the issues that put-off newcomers to the genre.  This is a very accessible, very entertaining game.  The manner in which they have made grouping up seem almost effortless and completely organic, should be a future standard IMHO.  There are numerous other positives I could mention, and very few negatives.  Suffice it to say that if you just haven&apos;t been able to find an MMO that you can really get into, this is the right one for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2612983">Expand</a></span>

The content is overwhelming. You may say there isn&apos;t content, then I don&apos;t know what game you have been playing. Everything from WvW, to PvE, to sPvP is simply fun. I even enjoy crafting, something I never really enjoyed doing in a game. The graphics are phenomenal. I&apos;m playing on a low spec computer and still enjoy the beauty. That is another point, I&apos;m on a low end computer. The game plays decent on it, I&apos;m happy about that. I really enjoy the big &quot;group dynamic events&quot; where 100+ people show up to take down a baddie. That is always a blast to enjoy. I&apos;m also a World versus World versus World (WvW) nut. I enjoy fighting alongside 100+ people taking a keep or a castle while getting barraged with arrows and oil. That is fun. I enjoy it. The classes are all fun to play. And the races are equally amazing. The personal story is very well done as well. Granted, I think after a certain point it starts coming together at the end so it is the same, but that makes sense. The story of an MMO has to have the same ending point. It is very well done. My only concerns are the following. The Culling issue in WvW and the PvE side are just bad. If I am fighting people, how come I can&apos;t see them, but they can see me while I&apos;m getting hit? This is especially bad in WvW where you do find quite a few people at the same time. Another are the bugs. The bugs are endless. Just when one gets fixed, another one pops up. It took me a month to get one map completed because of a bug where the skill point didn&apos;t show up. Kind of hard to complete content that way. Another is the &quot;endgame&quot;. The whole game was supposed to be end game. But instead we have people &quot;farming and grinding&quot; gear which is the total opposite of what the game was marketed to be. There isn&apos;t any reward for going back and assisting new characters or doing lower level content. If there was some sort of reward for going back to a different map, even it is was farming, perhaps the population would spread out again. Kind of pointless to see a 30 man zerg just farming events in the end game areas. If that was what the PvE ends up being, I&apos;ll stick to my WvW. The Class balance is out of whack. Seems to be that if you want to dominate, go Mesmer or Thief. The other classes don&apos;t even matter is seems like. Re-balancing needs to be done for the classes.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game is very well done. The best part, if you get frustrated or bored, you can always come back when new content comes out. That&apos;s always the best part, no worries about a subscription fee. If those small issues get fixed, and slightly more content for the little guy in WvW, it&apos;ll be a 10. Till then, a 8/10 it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2598528">Expand</a></span>

The game does a good job of retaining what makes MMO&apos;s great while innovating and finding new and creative ways to deliver content to players. Rather than the standard actionbar keypressing combat, we instead have a system that allows for dodging and one can use all of their abilities while moving. Instead of a traditional party system with tank, healer, and DPS (where really most people only want to do damage) we have abolished the trinity system and have replaced it with damage dealing classes and support classes, all fun player options that makes grouping up for dungeons easy and fun. Instead of the traditional questing structure of heading to a hub, picking up a huge bundle of quests, completing them all, and returning them, progressing through an environment in this game involves doing a combination of different events including exploration and platforming challenges as well as dynamic events and Guild Wars 2&apos;s answer to quests, reknown hearts. The game also takes a unique approach to PVE with the absolutely massive boss battles and invasions one can take up arms against as they wander throughout the world in the form of dynamic events. The game&apos;s PvP content is also innovative, including an awesome server-vs-server-vs-server option where three servers duke it out. These battles can get absolutely massive - even classic &quot;Huge&quot; battlefields in MMOs like old school Alterac Valley from WoW or Warhammer&apos;s massive battlegrounds don&apos;t compare. Then there are the small details - the little things that improve the game even more. The personal story is a nice touch to add some context to the game, the graphics and sound design are beautiful, being de-leveled upon entering lower level zones to be able to complete the content without feeling too powerful makes group play easy and allows you to play whatever you want whenever you want, having the ability to immediately deposit the items you collect for crafting into a tab of the bank from anywhere in the world is genius, and having an overflow server that prevents players from having to sit in a que just to play the game are all little strokes of awesome that make this game great.
<br>
<br>To top it all off, unlike other MMO&apos;s once one purchases this game there are no subscription fees whatsoever, and the cash shop in no way is pay for power. It&apos;s an incredible value that I would be willing to pay 15 dollars a month for if it were subscription-based.
<br>
<br>This is the most fun I&apos;ve had playing an MMO in ages, and I think a lot of people share my opinion as I can see by the high user score (especially for an MMO, SWTOR and WoW expansions usually get yellow and red user scores) not to mention a really nice critic score thus far. I can&apos;t wait to see what will be happening to this wonderful game in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2598832">Expand</a></span>

After this time I am rereviewing and have come to the conclusion this prince of a game has more warts than a frog in a swamp. The main game is fine except for 2 core mechanics that have been exploited. Instanced nodes and a game wide Trading Post. Goldsellers have hacked into the game and botted in the form of what I refer to as the Naked Ranger Conga Line.  All nodes can be harvested by each player or bot with impunity. A line of 5 ormore bots hits all the best areas before legit players can have a shot. They tag mobs and take drops and then all these basic mats glut the Trading Post. You would think this would bottom the price to nothing, but the forums cried for and got a barrier keeping the price from dropping below a sell price to an NPC vendor. They said that would keep new players from getting cheated on the Post. Instead it allows a set ROI for all the goldsellers and the armchair Economy experts in the forums never noticed. They are more bent on calling anyone expressing the desire for a free market chance a power mad moneygrubber. So this version of Trading post keeps the goldsellers in business while choking the playablity out of the TP. After spending time trying to handle this within the forums and being accused of
<br>trying to gain an unfair advantage by players and having mods and John Smith &quot;you guys got this thread handled&quot; of ANET shout me down as trying to make a ton of money i give up handling this on the inside.  The top tier items cost 400g .... who is trying to make a ton of money? almost RMAH-like. The goldsellers illegal influx of money generated from a stable ROI on basic mats has sent gems values up and gold from gems down. Example - I bought one character slot with in-game gold for under 3g shortly after the game got the TP up. Fair and nice...... that same slot would take over 8g now.  Crafting is worhtless and a money sink ... like its needed.. with only xp having any value. I can farm mats and gain equal exp and more money. anyone who is looking for an enjoyable market experience with free enterprise and the ability to succeed or fail on your own... run fast and far the other direction. This is not your game. The game environment is good. The dyanmic events, POI, heart quests etc ... are wonderful. thats the 6 ... the rest is a zero. sorry to say any who thought GUILD WARS 2 was the no sub solution and successorto WoW will be disappointed. It&apos;s only slightly better in the quest and loses by a landslide in the rest... damn shame too. I had high hopes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2600880">Expand</a></span>

The end game is actually all about grind. It&apos;s too damn repetitive and boring. Also GW2 has problem with bots. The personal story is loads of crap too, your choices doesn&apos;t really affect to the story AT ALL. All and all, it&apos;s a good game, since there isn&apos;t subscription fee.   I wouldn&apos;t really recommend to buy it if you&apos;re planning to rush to max lvl.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2756061">Expand</a></span>

The next game I spent a ton of time on was WoW since launch. I have tried many other &apos;next big things&apos; that turned out to be failures within the first couple months. They either faltered due to poor launch, inexperience, or just lack of content. With Guild Wars 2, those are not concerns. ArenaNet is experienced and has plenty of content here at launch. I firmly believe this is &apos;the next big thing&apos; since the juggernaut known as WoW has been around, I shall explain why. This list is in no particular order...
<br>
<br>1- This game is polished for release. There may be minor bugs here and there, but the game as a whole just works. I&apos;m sure there will be more polish put on this with time. It can&apos;t compare to WoW here, but then again WoW has like an 8 year head start. Give it time. 2 - Depth of character: Open race and profession combinations. Anybody can be anything. The depth of how you can pick your utility skills and traits and have a real good chance of not running into anyone else with a cookie cutter build is very nice, especially since Blizzard killed off hybrids with Cataclysm and more so with Pandaria. 3 - Combat! Skills are determined by what you have in your hand more so than your profession. All buffs (boons) and debuffs (conditions) are of simple design. There is no dedicated Tank-Healer-DPS although there are some classes that excel at certain things more than others. Combat animations are done well and it seems to flow very smoothly. I am very critical on this as this is the exact thing that put me off of wanting in on The Secret World. There haven&apos;t been many MMOs to give you such an active mode of combat. Age of Conan tried and was very unbalanced between ranged and melee. Guild Wars 2 gets it right. You are able to fully Line of Sight some ones attacks or even actively dodge them!
<br>
<br>4- PvP at launch! This is a direct stab at Blizzard. They still haven&apos;t added it to Diablo 3 (still wouldn&apos;t make me want to play it again, heh) and WoW was going for months before it got it&apos;s first battleground. I give major props for Dynamic Level Adjustments up to level 80. There are no such things as lowbie twinks or leveling zone camping and gankfests. Racial abilities can&apos;t be used in Structured PvP also (no Human double trinket domination!)
<br>
<br>5- Robust crafting. This game has one of the most interesting crafting setups I&apos;ve ever seen. It could use a bit more polish such as maybe showing you what you could make based upon components that you could make based upon your materials. I think there should be an option to consider your bank materials as well. I have only scratched the tip of this and am anxious to get more materials to craft more. Also, experience is gained for crafting and gathering!
<br>
<br>6-  Dynamic questing system. You do have a main story line that gives you a clear direction on how to progress through the game, but a big chunk of your leveling will be done through dynamic quests kind of similar to Rift&apos;s rift system and Instant Adventures, but more dynamic. No forced grouping during leveling as the content adjusts to how many players are active and you automatically get heals or assists off whoever is killing the same target as you. The Dynamic Level Adjustment works opposite in PvE than PvP, if you go into a lower level zone, you get reduced to an appropriate level and rewarded as if you were higher level. It is impossible to out level the content and you also can&apos;t get a high level guy to just run you through something! Also, no looking for yellow ?s or !s on the map!!!
<br>
<br>7- The graphics are 2nd to none in MMOs. This is not a factor for many, but after spending thousands on PC hardware over the years, I appreciate being able to fully use it. This is the first game in years to have me taking screenshots because I am in awe of the design. A lot of MMOs don&apos;t put as much thought into design of the whole game as ArenaNet has done with just a single zone.
<br>
<br>8- I don&apos;t know what else to keep on about... You can join multiple guilds. You get nice rewards for 100% exploration of zones. You can &apos;fight for your life&apos; instead of dying when you get downed. You can transmute gear for different looks. You can freely dye armor different colors. .... and quite a bit more than I have space or time to describe.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: Go get the game if you haven&apos;t already!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2609597">Expand</a></span>

If you are a MMO player who loves to explore, then it is a must buy.  There is simply no other game out there which comes close to the level of detail and fun built into the world.  That said, it is not an easy mmo -- the combat once you hit about level 20 is very challenging and you must learn your class mechanics well.  Even that is a refreshing thing though, as it makes me realize how dumbed down every other MMO has become lately.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2586268">Expand</a></span>

But, the biggest factor for me is the design.  The elimination of the trinity, the fact that it is B2P, the focus on skill over gear, the questing system, dynamic events, accessibility due to way points and the beautiful art direction make GW2 a game that I want to support as well play.  I hope that other developers take a good look at GW2.  I genuinely believe that this is the direction that MMOs should take going forward.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2593334">Expand</a></span>

<br>The art style is also gorgeous, and the vistas are awesome. Playing as an Engineer with a flame thrower kit is awesome, and I enjoy the flexibility of this game. I highly recommend it to people looking for something new. Just don&apos;t play it like you would a normal MMO, there are many differences.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2584980">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Guild wars 2 allows me to play mmos again and live my life!!!. Finally an mmo suited for me. An mmo hardcore enough to suit my needs for challenge and casual enough to allow me to play at my own pace! The dream.
<br>
<br>Guild wars 2 has amazing graphics. Beautiful animations and an epic soundtrack. The client is amazingly stable and smooth. Classes are fun and engaging and waaay different than most mmos. Races are beautiful too.
<br>
<br>The game makes you want to explore all the huge world and if you are a completionist.. hell, you will have a ton to complete here. The game was made to play with others, not to compete and fight with people. there is no silly kill steals or node steals, everyone fights to achieve a common goal and it works!
<br>
<br>So far the game has exceeded all my expectations. The mmo innovates on every angle. Dont believe people who say the game is good... or bad. I say go play it and make your own judgement, you wont regret it. Also no monthly fee is awesome!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2584978">Expand</a></span>

I thought this (and often was right) because of the strategy, all the other MMOs had: they copied WoW. Now I play Guild Wars 2 the fifth day and I can say: playing GW2 30 Level I have seen more and had more fun, than in WoW with 6 lvl 85 the last years. The dynamic world and quests, the changing goals, even with failing an event, make GW2 so much fun and sort of unpredictable.  For me, RPGs always were MMOs and not MMOs. MMOs always had a worse story and less of that &apos;I am the hero&apos;-feeling. Not MMOs indeed had the perfect storyline and the feeling of being a hero - but no other gamers. GW2 for me is the perfect symbiosis of both, even decisions are included. Awesome game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2590470">Expand</a></span>

At times it feels more like a single player RPG like Skyrim or The Witcher, than your usual MMORPG. You can play the way you want. Between personal Stories, World v. World, and structured PvP (which puts everyone on an equal playing field) there is a lot of variety. Crafting gives XP, World vs. World gives XP, Harvesting gives XP, Exploring gives XP, even rezzing players (which everyone can do in this game) gives XP. Long gone are the annoyances of most MMOs. Every player in the game is working together. So no stealing mobs, loot, or resource nodes. You access the bank from crafting stations. No trinity of tank, dps, and healer. Any combination of classes can complete any content if they bring the right skills. No more waiting around for a certain class, or forcing one of your friends to play a class they don&apos;t want to.
<br>
<br>Combat is dynamic and intricate in both PvE and PvP. While it does lose some of its intricacies when more than ~20-30 players are involved, it is still insanely fun. If this game fails, it will be because people don&apos;t want something new. At the end of the day, it&apos;s worth a shot. For $60 you have lifetime access to the game. No subscription fees. Easy choice. Try it for yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2585395">Expand</a></span>

<br>No more single task, static questing, but a living world where events are not waiting for you to click on an NPC to happen: you explore, you see things happening, you join them and your actions have consequences.
<br>No more gear grind: both in PvE and PvP, you won&apos;t need to farm gear for ages just to be able to join the action. At max level everybody is on the same gear level, the outcomes of the challenge is determined by your skill, finally.
<br>No more being pigeon holed within one single class role. Every class can finally be ranged and melee, healing or dpsing. Shift your weapons, manage your countless skills, dodge and parry the incoming attacks. This is finally an engaging combat!
<br>No more waiting for a healer or a tank to show up: you want to do that dungeon with 5 warriors or 5 necromancers? You can, it works.
<br>No more subscription fees: you by the game and you play it as much as you want, at your pace. Content will be periodically added, and it will be free. You just have to buy the official expansion when they will come out.
<br>
<br>This game is different in mechanics, is gigantic in scope, is beautiful and intriguing. Do yourself a favour and don&apos;t miss it. It&apos;s not &quot;marketing&quot; or advertisement. It&apos;s how the game is, as a matter of fact.
<br>
<br>(Final note: I read some of the few &quot;0&quot; rated reviews here and I am appalled by the false information they spread. One thing is expressing opinions, one thing is spreading clear lies. Only 5 skills? False. I cannot play with my friends? False. Give the game a try, you&apos;ll see by yourself what&apos;s true and what&apos;s false...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2583159">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This review comes at the time of the end of the 3 day head start. There are a handful of problems at the moment that I presume will be resolved in the near future and so my review will not penalize Arenanet for this troubles -- primarily around guild administrative functionality (lag) and the trading post.
<br>
<br>Graphics. Its the first game in years that has such a strongly realised art design; perhaps since the Mass Effect franchise, and its the first fantasy title in years that compares to Blizzard&apos;s in house design team. Running an ATI 7750 on a first gen i5 quad core, I can maintain ~50-60 fps for 1650x1080 at high settings. There are people with performance problems today, though, but both drivers are continually being updated and Arenanet is constantly tweaking and tuning performance. Tom&apos;s Hardware has a good review of GW2 performance, to give you a sense of what works well and what is still problematic. Gameplay. Innovative. Core mechanics are almost entirely unlocked by level 10, the game is very responsive (tight controls) and content is immediately challenging in the starting zone -- this is very refreshing after &apos;collect 10 boar hides&apos; with rudimentary abilities in other MMOs. The world feels much more alive than other MMOs with static quests or staged events. Crafting is deep and nuanced. There&apos;s a personal storyline for your character, that behaves similarly to SW:TOR&apos;s core class stories. There is quite a large amount of voice acting too.
<br>
<br>The best thing about guild wars 2, is that its a one time purchase. You get a persistent world, with modern graphics and several innovations on traditional MMO mechanics... without a recurring subscription. GW2 looks to put new downward pressure on the cost of MMOs, while simultaneously raising the bar for group play and quality of execution (graphics, music, gameplay). Definitely a top 10 of the year title, and potentially a #1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2584556">Expand</a></span>

GW2 gives you some very nice possibilities to play with your friends, while making possible to play with other unknown fellas, since there is a really coop scenario around. PVE is great, the maps are big enough and have a lot of actions. There are quests, but in a new fashion, much more interesting since in many ways they are free to go around, not having to grab up 80 items and run back to the city. Crafting is awesome, really challenges you to go forward in those maps that you already know.
<br>
<br>The WvW is awesome too, since PvE is connected to it, so there is a huge sense of progress. And even my friend who was a PvP-only guys is already hooked in blasting our way through those pesky invaders!!!
<br>
<br>PvP is very very good, those tournaments are asking to be e-sport. But laggy servers can be sensed in this beginning (to be fair, these complaints are being filed in the launch day). All in all, the game shines while having some minor bugs or uncomfortable traits (like joining friends in overflow areas are still catchy).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2584548">Expand</a></span>

The world changes but not just for me - everyone&apos;s actions affect the game itself.  Exploration is amazing with hidden caves behind waterfalls, jump puzzles, vistas.  Incredible range of choice in character creation and customization.  Everyone is playing GW2 - most fun in an MMO that I&apos;ve had in years.</span>

I never had so much fun crafting and just wandering around for hours in this beautiful world. People are giving terrible reviews for some bugs here and there but dont listen to them every single game has bugs even single player games. And for servers being full they have a very smart way of letting people still play without a que like some other games have. But honestly this game will give you your money&apos;s worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2584830">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Visuals are great and the quest system does an awesome job at making leveling less of a chore and more of a game, crafting is a blast too.</span>

I even bought the two books that were released to fill the lore in between GW1 and GW2 while pre ordering my collectors edition for the day it came out. I thought GW2 would have more of the same as GW1, but sadly it doesn&apos;t. First off, Instances are gone    Poof....   No longer can you explore an area with you and a couple of ur closest friends. Now there&apos;s just a pile of people that you all manage to amalgamate, collectively attacking random things chaotically.  There are no strategies anymore, just annoying-ass mindless spamming of 2 or 3 skills.    Second off, the skill system and combat system is dead. Gone are the days when you could hunt down specific skills stretched across the world of Tyria to collect. Now, your skills are linked with your weapon. Which you then only have 5 per weapon, and are very limited in their diversity. Honestly, every weapon and skill feel almost identical per class. It&apos;s a shame really; I remember spending hours upon hours trying to build the perfect build for PvE. And then when that build didn&apos;t cut it anymore for a new quest or mission, I&apos;d sit around and devise a new build for specific situations. Just as Diablo III had to dumb down it&apos;s game for the masses, so did GW2.
<br>
<br>Next, the new and innovative event system is a clever way of deceiving players of something new. In actuality, the even system is just another grind-fest to kill X number of enemies or collect Y number of items to complete it. Like I said earlier, it&apos;s a very clever system, because thousands of people have been duped to believe they&apos;re not playing the usual MMO that requires you to grind out the same exact quests/actions over and over again, the individuals at Arena Net just covered it with a different set of clothes and a wig to make it seem new. It isn&apos;t. And it&apos;s god damned awful and disgusting that not many people realize this.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of WOW and MMO&apos;s similar to it&apos;s play style, then go on ahead an check out this game, it&apos;ll probably be the &quot;change&quot; you&apos;ve been looking for in a game. Meanwhile, if you were a fan of the first installment, stay away from this game, stay far far away.If you&apos;re looking for instanced games to play check out Path of Exile or Phantasy Star Online 2, those games you&apos;ll surely enjoy.

The graphics are absolutely incredible and make the world a joy to explore, though occasional texture bug do occur. The combat is movement based, and heavily reliant on quick reactions and timing. Players will often be able to kill enemies several levels above them through the use of careful dodging and skill use. The skill system is more simplistic than Guild wars 1, that is most certainly true. For me, this is a good thing; the complex builds and amount of skills in guild wars 1 were often overwhelming. The Guild wars 2 system trades amount of builds for skilled usage of said builds. However, there are still a surprising amount of builds when you factor in traits and gear. The dynamic event system is truly one of the best things about this game. Events take the place of quests and work to assure that there is always something new and interesting happening in old areas. As for pvp: World vs World is one of the most fun you can have in a game even when you&apos;re losing. In the past few days I&apos;ve seen flanking maneuvers, ambushes, baiting, distraction, and day long sieges. The most disappointing thing about WvW is that it is almost always full on high population servers. The only real negatives of GW2 at the moment is that joining in with friends is sometimes difficult due to the intense server stress over launch. I have no doubt that this will be fixed in the coming days. So, why do I give it a ten? Three reasons: 1. Its the funnest game I have played to date. I have never played a game for more than six hours straight before, but this one had more going on twelve. 2. Because I believe that the small issues that it currently has will be taken care of as the game becomes stable. Arenanet is an awesome company that sincerely listens to its feedback.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2584903">Expand</a></span>

You went to the arcade and laughed with your friends.  Once we started playing at home, it began to lose the social aspect.  MMORPG&apos;s were invented to re-capture social gaming.  Too many aspects of them actually became anti-social: obscene hours required to succeed, outdoor missions that penalized groups, kill stealing, ninja looting, etc.  Guild Wars 2 cures these ailments and adds flavors that hearken back to those Pac Man days when you just logged in and had fun playing.  This game is built for friends to hang out and play together.  But it&apos;s also built for strangers to have confidence in meeting new players.  You&apos;re not going to do anything to hinder another&apos;s experience.  Help is welcomed in this gorgeous and innovative MMORPG.  Regardless of past MMO experience, this game is worth the buy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2585407">Expand</a></span>

Gone are the endless &apos;go here, kill , go there, bring back &apos; but rather, their quests are more like the public events of Warhammer Online. Plus, skills are no longer slowly fed to you via trainers, but unlocked through a talent system. You start with 5 skills, which are subject to change with different weapons - for instance, a sword will grant you 3 moves, and your offhand item the other two. So, there is a large amount of combinations to be had. There is also an overlapping &apos;main&apos; storyline, which you&apos;ll slowly go through as a sort of backbone to the other quests.
<br>
<br>Bottom line, it&apos;s just plain old fun in an amazingly well put together game.

<br>Overview: Excellent game focused on exploration and promoting a do what you like attitude towards progression. Throw in two PVP settings that do not impact on one another, (WvW and SPvP) and you get a game with enough variety to keep me gaming for a long time. Additional pluses, no sub. Classes that feel different. Active engaging combat with hidden depth. Excellent Environments. Graphics: Excellent artwork that makes the game and its NPC&apos;s/PC&apos;s all feel part of the same world. The Norn suffer somewhat in the animation department but this is made up for in the excellent Asura who are amazing to behold in their weird whacky excentric movements. The locales are breath taking and the depth of view is good. The animation holds up in WvW. The biggest criticism would be the &quot;AOE Soup&quot; created when their are a mass of people attacking one enemy.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>The non linear progression is what trumps the gameplay category. Want to craft great get some exp. how about doing some dynamic events sure that works too. Whatever you do you get experience (with the exception of SPvP. I have mostly played with an exploration focus so far and even doing jumping puzzles nets some good xp so you are always having fun, being varied and progressing. Add into this the nature of SPvP giving an esports dynamic to the game and you have no reason on to purchase it.
<br>
<br>Content:
<br>For the price this game costs there is no title to date that offers more re playability for the amount of money (NO SUB). The world is filled with rich dynamic events that are exceptionally fun and scale well. The de-leveling system allows exploration into zones you may have missed. The ongoing WvW fights will suck up any serious PvP players. You could even play this as  sole pvp arena style game and still get your money&apos;s worth.
<br>
<br>10,  10  10!! Closing Comment:
<br>It has some flaws but these are outweighed by the sheer volume of content for the box price. a must buy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2584377">Expand</a></span>

The choice of weapon directly affects what skills you have available. Equip a dagger and you have one set of attack skills. Equip a sword and you get something completely different. A very different way to give people the ability to customize their character. The ability to cooperatively play with others without having to group is wonderful. It might be cribbed from Rift and Warhammer, but it seems much better implemented than when I played in Warhammer. The removal of the quest log goes a long way toward making the game less of a grind. Don&apos;t want to do something? Skip it and do something else. Your options are very open as to how you want to progress. During the course of the head start we did encounter some annoyances. The party functions weren&apos;t working correctly, and we couldn&apos;t participate in each others stories. A patch yesterday appeared to have fixed that issue. Arenanet appears to be working quickly to patch the errors people are running into. In a few weeks I&apos;m betting the bugs will be largely absent, and honestly nothing we experienced was game breaking. As far as people getting banned for stupid names and cursing in chat? Good. I&apos;d like to be able to play a game where I&apos;m not constantly inundated with morons spamming the channels and generally acting like idiots. I&apos;m sure there are a few folks that are legitimately not trying to do anything wrong, but the vast majority appear to be folks that can&apos;t act civilly and being banned for legitimate reasons. All in all, a very fun game with a solid developer still working on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2585080">Expand</a></span>

And this is within hours of the official launch. Judging the game strictly on what t brings to the table, I do find that this game is much more entertaining than WoW, Tera, Secret World, and Star Wars... and yes, I&apos;ve played them all extensively and am still subscribed to 2 of the 4. If Diablo 3 with its DRM and other issues is an 8.8, this easily qualifies as a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2584395">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s the only game i played yet wich deserves the title &quot;massive&quot; multiplayer online - rpg. No matter what people will play actually together instead of worrying to steal eachothers xp or loot. While it&apos;s not the revolution everybody was hyping for, it definately makes things better in many ways. Also, without a monthly subscription fee you&apos;re not forced to play as much as possible for not loosing gametime. Perfect for a casual player like me. Only downside for many mmo players is probably the lack of classic questing and the so called endgame for the timegobbling hunt for being the most op geared player on the whole server (and in pvp). Only gear you can archive later on are pure cosmetic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2593026">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You get a ton of value for buying the game. I&apos;d argue that you get more for paying $60 for this than any other AAA MMO, simply because you don&apos;t have to pay $15 a month to enjoy it.
<br>
<br>I love the art style, a sort of graphic-novel meets 3D render ... but it won&apos;t please everyone.
<br>
<br>The developers are fantastic. I think that&apos;s a point worth making here. They admit their mistakes, aren&apos;t afraid to clarify details, and are more open and honest with the players than any of their &quot;corporate speak&quot; competitors. I can&apos;t say if this will last forever, but I&apos;d be surprised if they stopped being &quot;real people.&quot;
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve seen some outright misinformation in a few of the reviews, sadly, so I&apos;d suggest taking a moment to inform yourself from reliable sources, such as the game&apos;s wiki or main website.
<br>
<br>The dynamic event (note that dynamic is not the same as random) system is really great, much like the Public Quests from Warhammer ... only enhanced and more interesting.
<br>
<br>Every class has multiple roles. You can be a warrior that plays a powerful support role with massive fire and explosive damage from a bow, buff banners, shouts and so on, or you can become a front-line soldier. The different weapons offer completely different playstyles, and are well worth exploring. If you don&apos;t like the thief with daggers, try it with pistols. Or a shortbow. Or a sword. Totally different abilities, totally different feel.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m very happy with the game, and I hope that anyone interested in it checks some solid neutral sources before deciding if they should buy or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2583087">Expand</a></span>

The seamless dynamic events let you jump in and help out fellow players anytime also letting you reap the XP rewards taking the normal &quot;click and grind&quot; questing out of the picture. The PVP is second to none!! MASSIVE siege battles and capture points in World VS World is something I&apos;ve been looking for in MMO&apos;s for a VERY long time!! The environment and character graphics alone are gorgeous!!( Bearing in mind you have a system capable of running it maxed out). All in all Guild Wars 2 is an excellent game capable of keeping you hooked and it goes so far above and beyond the original it is literally no comparison. The game is also one of the most polished MMO releases to date! Absolutely worth every penny  and a solid 10 in my book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2584715">Expand</a></span>

Adventuring through Tyria is a truly memorable endeavor. It is not a revolutionary mmo as people were hyping, but it is the next step in MMOs and is easily the best one on the market. Exciting pvp, enormous pve and without a sub fee to boot. Highly Recommended!</span>

Games have gone from being a platform completely forgotten by a developer after release (so the finished product needed to be 100 percent out the gate) to living environments that need to be upkept and maintained. Nobody cares one little bit that you spent extra money to make a machine to play this (graphically intensive game?) That is a red herring, it has nothing to do with the issue at hand. Likely, your account was hacked and you need to visit Reddit to confirm that. The game is great for a non-subscription game, which is exactly why I tend not to play games like WoW, I can&apos;t justify playing a grind game that I pay extra for each month. Anyway, the game deserves a 10 just for treading in a new area in a different way. Also, to counter dumb arguments for jaded, entitled consumers that think the world revolves around them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2606087">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s just another of those games run to this spot and do this, run to the next spot and do it over again.  Then after hit 80 should I expect to do grinds for gear or what is there for me to do other then go and gather all the map locations and point of interests that I haven&apos;t found yet?  Just another leveling game that slows down to a crawl once you hit 80 with no hope other then doing PvP if you&apos;re a person that likes that sort of thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2659564">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve played this game from beta weekend 1 and I can honestly say, Guild Wars 2 is a nearly flawless MMO. Stunning visuals, personal story lines and, most importantly, incredible game play. Areanet has accomplished what was once though to be almost impossible: they have eliminated the &quot;grindy&quot; feeling that you might experience in the traditional MMO. I have personally found that I&apos;m not leveling in an effort to make it to level cap and endgame content, I&apos;m legitimately enjoying the scenery, the lore, and exploration objectives on the map. I often find myself looking down at the corner of the screen to realize that I&apos;ve gained a few levels, this coming from a 4 year veteran of WoW, I never thought I wouldn&apos;t be paying much attention to a character level, but it&apos;s really happening here and it&apos;s awesome! I could go into extensive detail as to how detailed and amazing this game is, but I don&apos;t believe I can convey that experience in a text review, look up one of thousands of YouTube videos on the game, you won&apos;t be disappointed.
<br>However, I, and many others, have found the elimination of trade between two people to be... inconvenient. Arenanet has come out to say that this was a decision made by devs to cut down chat spam and reduce instances of scamming. But I&apos;m not buying it. The least they could do is implement a cash on delivery system through mail, which I do believe will come quickly, likely within the next month or so. I simply cannot fathom why such a simple feature would be eliminated. I could mention overflow issues that other reviewers have based their reviews on, but it has already been announced by the Arenanet staff that the issues with the party system are being worked on and that those issues are a top priority (Honestly guys, the games only been public for a few days now, give the devs a break), I simply don&apos;t feel that I can criticize a game that has only been available to the public for a little over 10 days for minor bugs. I do however still believe trade is an issue, though one that will likely be resolved in time. I don&apos;t believe it is a big enough issue to knock a point off of an otherwise brilliant game. This game is a true deviation from what we accept as the MMO standard that definitely deserves your consideration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2583814">Expand</a></span>

The game itself is fantastic; large, well-designed and interesting areas that always give a sense of accomplishment, well balanced interesting PvP and contrary to most peoples opinions a huge variety of build options. People claiming the game to have little in the way of build options are completely missing how it works or perhaps have not spent long enough at it. Traits, weapon swapping, combos and gear set up all radically change how you play in PvP and it is NOT just generic skills shoved together in your bar. I can&apos;t stand people who will base this game on opening day problems when they are not going to be present in very long but they do inhibit this game achieving a 10. If you have any doubts about buying this game due to the very low ratings from some people; ignore them, and buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2583035">Expand</a></span>

There is something to do for everyone and this game is well worth that $60 + no subscription fee!  Like I said everything about this game is fun and you SHOULD give it try at the very least.  I&apos;m not a fanboy or anything, I&apos;ve noly been aware of &quot;Guild Wars 2&apos;s existence for a few months and I played GW1 for even less time than that and didn&apos;t really enjoy that game much.  So when I saw its fun and you should try it, its because its so much fun and the gamer in me wants everyone to experience this awesome game.  Some reviewers are angry because there is glitches, bugs, crashes, maintenance, etc etc.  These things are always going to happen at the launch of an MMO and if you&apos;re unfortunate enough to experience these things than I am sorry but it doesn&apos;t make the game less fun, it just means you have to wait a little bit longer for them to fix bugs.  Developers can never make perfect MMOs at launch because it doesn&apos;t make sense financially to run Betas and stress tests for 10 years until its perfect, and EVEN THEN its hard to predict the sheer amount of stress at launch.  And for those saying &quot;get a better graphics card!&quot; &quot;these graphics suck&quot; whatever.  The graphics are great and they allow everyone to run the game well, and most importantly ITS AN MMO and its the GAMEPLAY that matters, not the graphics.  If you love graphics so much go play heavy rain or some other stupid game for how pretty it is.  So in closing I encourage everyone to try this game, its fun and you you don&apos;t need a subscription :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2585220">Expand</a></span>

The adventure is squarely in the players hands, and if the player can&apos;t adapt they will see stale game play much like World of Warcraft.  Only when the player begins to explore the world and pay attention to the quirky behavior of the world&apos;s NPCs will it become clear that this is something both old and new.  The controls feel awkward in some ways, because of the way the camera moves, however once the player becomes adjusted to dodging everything begins to come together.  It almost feels laggy until you begin to use skills and dodging to evade instead of quickly strafing to the opposite direction.  If you are looking to get back to the time when players weren&apos;t guided along the rails like mindless cattle, Tyria is the world for you.  Guild Wars 2 is your game to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2588540">Expand</a></span>

Guild Wars 2 turns much of what we know, and have unquestioningly accepted about MMOs, on its head.  The most obvious difference is in the questing.  The vast majority of &quot;quests&quot; in GW2 are spontaneous and dynamic.  You don&apos;t bump into someone who tells you their life story right before they ask you to kill 10 rats.  Rather, you might come upon a farm under attack by bandits - if you or your companions manage to drive them off, it may lead to another stage where you go on the attack, and raid the bandits lair.  If you fail, however, a different quest starts, where you may have to repair the damage the bandits caused.  People passing through the area are free to join in or leave at any time, and the difficulty scales to however many are participating.  Combat itself is vastly different from the usual &apos;stand still and mash buttons&apos; you see everywhere else.  Movement is key, and with no specific tank or healer class, players must be aware at all times and be ready to dodge whenever the boss winds ups for a special attack.  It&apos;s refreshing, and, at times, difficult - there is a definite learning curve. Additionally, combat skills depend on your weapon type.  A mage might throw a fireball while wielding a staff, but if he equips a dagger, it turns into a a completely different, aoe type attack.  Various other quality-of-life improvements have been made.  You never directly compete with other players for quest objectives or resource nodes.  Fast travel works from any point on the map.  The graphics are some of the best I&apos;ve seen in an MMO, and the solo storyline is actually pretty good, varying wildly depending on what race/background choices you made during character creation.  Max level pvp is accessible as soon as you create your character, and is easily the best system I&apos;ve seen in an MMO yet.  Exploration is fun, and there are rewards for doing it.  Crafting has a unique experimentation aspect to it.  And, of course, the biggest selling point - there is no subscription fee!  Now, all this isn&apos;t to say GW2 doesn&apos;t have any flaws.  There are still a lot of launch bugs floating around, ranging from minor (trouble grouping with players) to major (the auction house has been down for days).  It&apos;s still up in the air how &quot;end game&quot; will be received, bearing in mind there is no traditional gear treadmill.  The cash/gem shop is a little sketchy, and the game has many subtle and not-so-subtle ways of nudging you toward it.  Anyway, I&apos;ve been playing the game since beta and I can honestly say I&apos;ve been having a lot of fun.  The burning questions on everyone&apos;s minds (whether or not this will kill WoW, or if they should drop WoW for this game) are largely irrelevant, they are different games with different mentalities and approaches to MMO gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2583935">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are great (don&apos;t listen to the naysayers who compare MMO graphics to single-player games; these games are made for a wider audience, online at the same time).
<br>There&apos;s plenty to see, plenty to do, the mechanics are engaging but not impossible to figure out. Almost all aspects of this game are fun, starting with a very in-depth character and story creator. I feel as if I&apos;m rambling, but this game really does have a little bit of everything, tossing out some of the junk of &quot;classic MMOs&quot; in a &quot;why does an MMO have to have that&quot; philosophy.
<br>My only complaint is that some things ARE more complex than they need to be, or are broken (the auction house - known as the Black Lion Trading Company). PVP is kind of messy to figure out. In many games, you hit a hot button, bring up the pvp panel, and click to join either a random event, a specific pvp map, and always with the option to join up your entire group.
<br>That quibble aside, this is a game I&apos;m going to enjoy playing for some time (provided the content gets udpated in a reasonably timely fashion).
<br>And did I mention there&apos;s no sub fee? Once you buy the box, you don&apos;t need to buy anything else to play Guild Wars 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2592613">Expand</a></span>

Unlike other games of this genera out on the market, this is the first one that encourages open world exploration, teamwork, and also encourages people into being friendly because they are rewarded for such a feat. If you see a other player in peril you are rewarded for helping him, The open world pvp is balanced, (believe it or not) with every class using their special trait in massively open world pvp. Guardians taking the vanguard, with warriors on the flanks, rangers, and engineers behind them ready to unleash a sea of arrows upon the enemy horde. And spell casters to protect the armies with barriers and enchantments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2590028">Expand</a></span>

No one class has the edge over another, and each class has many ways they can be played. You know what else is amazing? No subscription fee. You pay $60 and get your hands on a milestone of the MMORPG&apos;s.

I played it days before it was even launched and I have encountered absolutely no bugs with any function except for the trade market, which I honestly could care less about. Seriously, if you feel in any way let down by this game then you are just being a brat. I love the atmosphere of this game, it truly breathes with the help of dynamic events making you feel actually involved in the new lands you discover. The fact that the game gives you an incentive to explore and reach unexplored points for XP is a fantastic feature. It gives you reason to reach the corners of the world and not just grind monsters. Enjoy it for what it&apos;s worth, nobody&apos;s asking you to pay 10-15 bucks a month for this polished and well thought game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2589908">Expand</a></span>

As far as visuals, the game is often stunning. Technically speaking, the visuals aren&apos;t top of the line but the art style and aesthetic make it a pleasure to look at. The best element they&apos;ve added to this game in my opinion that most every traditional MMO lacks is the urge to explore world. With dynamic events, mini dungeons, and puzzles, and more, traveling and exploring is actually a pleasure instead of a bore and the main element that drives PvE. The dynamic events aren&apos;t as amazing as they were made out to be, however they&apos;re still much more fun and engaging than your typical MMO &quot;Kill 5 boars&quot; quests. Because of all these things grind, for once, is extremely minimal and the leveling process doesn&apos;t have to be an annoying chore but rather the appeal of the game. Bad news is, that for now, a lot of things aren&apos;t up and running as they should be. Guild, trading posts, and more are either screwy or don&apos;t function at all. However, I expect these things to be corrected fairly soon after launch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2583013">Expand</a></span>

<br>There were many things about this game that I really enjoyed, and a few things that I wish were done differently, but so far I have enjoyed all my time playing this game.
<br>

<br>There were many things about this game that I really enjoyed, and a few things that I wish were done differently, but so far I have enjoyed all my time playing this game.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with the things that I enjoyed. World questing events are really fun, and definitely add a feeling of being part of a bigger community. You can just be running around doing another quest when you suddenly get a notification that an event is going on nearby. Sometimes it can be something small, like protecting a wagon from attackers, and will have 8-10 people with it depending on who is nearby. Other times this can mean a massive assault on an enemy stronghold with 40+ people fighting mobs and a boss. Really cool.
<br>
<br>Second, I really like the fact that your level scales down when you go to lower zones, but experience scales to your actual level, so even doing questing in low level areas is a viable way to level up, if you want to play with your noobie friends. You can also still receive upgrades to your current gear in low level areas. And exploring the map actually gains you a significant amount of experience, making it not just another thing to do for achievements.
<br>
<br>The graphics are great. Coming from WoW, which to me feels very cartoonish, this game is a breath of fresh air. I know there are other MMO&apos;s on the market with realism, , but this is the first one I have played since WoW so I can&apos;t comment on other games comparing. A lot of the locations have a very unique and cool feeling to them as well as looking good graphically.
<br>
<br>Not paying a subscription is great. I was tired of dishing out $15 a month to play a game I was only mildly interested. Now I don&apos;t feel bad if I can&apos;t play GW 2 every night because it was a one time thing. There are places that you can spend money to get various aesthetic items, but they aren&apos;t pushing the pay options in your face, and people who pay don&apos;t have an intrinsic advantage over those who don&apos;t.
<br>
<br>As for things that I wish were different, or that I at least missed from WoW.
<br>
<br>No world pvp. Yes you have the PVP zone where you combat against other servers, but you can&apos;t do PVP on your server while questing. I really miss the thrill of having to watch out for people trying to kill me while I am just doing normal stuff. Although without factions in this game, I don&apos;t really thing world PVP is a possibility.
<br>
<br>Another thing is that once you choose a server, all your 5 characters have to stay on that server. If you transfer servers, all your 5 characters transfer. You can&apos;t have characters spread over multiple servers. So if you and your friend created characters on different servers by accident, one of you is going to have to pay to transfer.
<br>
<br>Overall I find this game really enjoyable, and there were other things I liked that I didn&apos;t mention, such as changing your weapon changes your skills, having a separate weapon for underwater combat, and finding secret hard to get to places. I would definitely suggest buying this game if you are looking for a new MMO  to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2585781">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s the first MMORPG that&apos;s lived up to it&apos;s hype in every conceivable way. It shakes things up in ways no other game has dared to in years. And all because World of Warcraft set the standard in 2004. But it grew too large and became a cancer on the MMO genre. No one dared deviate from the formula established by WoW but ultimately this just lead to numerous half-baked clones. Guild Wars 2 is different. It changes things, but it changes the right things. This game IS the WoW-killer. Everyone is afraid to believe in the old legend, but it&apos;s true. This is the game we&apos;ve all been waiting for. This is the great savior of MMORPGs that has finally come to cast down the great beast, World of Warcraft.

It has no subscription which is just outright amazing for the quality of the game! OBVIOUSLY all the people rating this game with a 0 are just butthurt WoW fanboys, who are crying because another MMO actually has a chance of taking away WoW&apos;s community. Seriously grow up guys we can just smell your pathetic bias. Guild Wars 2 has amazing graphics, looks better than most current single player games! The graphics are just unheard of for an MMO (once again, a subscription-less MMO) I think the people rating it down for graphics are either extremely uneducated or have really bad computers and cannot run the graphics to begin with. NEVER listen to a review that gives a 0, as obviously they have a grudge or agenda to try and soil the name of a game, don&apos;t feed the haters! Anyway back to Guild Wars 2, the scale of the maps is HUGE everything feels so immersive and realistic. The zones are beautiful, the citys look exactly like their concept art! The music is amazing! (done by the same guy that did the music for Oblivion and Skyrim) The personal story modes for your character are great and easy to get into, they also change A LOT to the decisions you make. The PVP is excellent, very smooth and entertaining. WvWvW is the best siege simulator I have ever seen in a game, and will provide many, many hours of entertainment. The servers are VERY stable, their overflow zone system is incredibly smart! Crafting is well done, and bag space management is revolutionary! This game is 100% worth the $60 AU (which is all you will ever have to pay!) Thank you for this amazing game Arena net. I am an ex 5 year World of Warcraft player, and Guild Wars 2 is a massive leap in the right direction! I am not usually one to give a 10 in a review but this game has 100% earned it! R.I.P World of Warcraft! Guild Wars 2 is officially the new King of MMOs!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2588547">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are decent: while the engine is a little dated, the art style and concept art that forms the loading screens and &quot;cutscene&quot; backgrounds are absolutely stunning. While the writing and voice acting isn&apos;t on the level that we saw in The Old Republic, it is still more engaging than most MMO&apos;s. The gameplay isn&apos;t as freah as I would have liked, but it still feels more interesting than games such as WoW. The combat is fasted paced, amd the ability to dodge attacks adds a little skill to the game, rather than being purely based on number crunching. The dynamic events get a little repetitive after a while, but they are still much more interesting than tour standard &quot;kill 5 bandits&quot; MMO fare. The game encourages and rewards participation in these events, and everyone gets their own XP and loot. The PVP is an interesting concept, amd once everyone gets the hang of it, I can see some truly epic experiences going in there. It&apos;s also cool how you get bonuses based on how well your server is doing. The only downsides to the game are minor grievances: trading post unavailable at launch, so no economy; you&apos;re limited to only one server, and the guesting feature is not functional yet; servers are extremely crowded and you are often stuck in an overflow instance, separate from your party members and guildies; some guild functions are down. Keep in mind that this games endgame is meant to be PVP. Overall, a good game that a lot of time and planning went into. I look fkrward to seeing where they go with it. And the best part is, of course, there&apos;s no subscription!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2588689">Expand</a></span>

The questing itself is extremely fun as long as you don&apos;t try to play it like a grind, although there is plenty to grind if you so desire. Dynamic missions change things up and crafting is interesting but takes time. I prefer this skill system to Guild Wars 1 because it provides the player with more freedom in building a character, not so much a flavor of the month build anymore. Also cool that weapons effect your skills. Over a very fun game with interesting pvp that can be extremely strategic if you try to do more than just zerg the other team. In my opinion it is much more varied than WoW pvp.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2585350">Expand</a></span>

Regardless GW2 is fun, challenging, and has no sub fee. It is incredibly detailed with a huge variety of things to do at any given time, and has a shocking depth to it&apos;s combat and PvP. There are a couple launch bugs that exclude me from giving it a 10, but since I&apos;ve already thrown 60hrs into the game and only paid $60, I&apos;d say I&apos;ve gotten my moneys worth. ADDENUM: So one thing I&apos;ve noticed in the last few days are all the scrubs quitting. Its working people! All the bads are leaving because the game is too hard for them. What a wonderful community this game is breeding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2591606">Expand</a></span>

Actively swapping weapons for different skill sets was hard to get used to at first but now it works like chime. PvP and WvWvW are both exciting and worth trying out for better experience. However ArenaNet made the same mistake Blizzard did - not being able to manage the opening day horde. Also the trading post (GW2 version of AH of D3) is not working yet. The graphics also look a little bit outdated - even with the highest settings. There are several more minor bugs, glitches to be fixed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2585379">Expand</a></span>

The right combination of instanced loot and shared experience make this the most socially appealing game in a long time.  The World vs World PVP gives casual PVPer&apos;s somewhere to blow off a little steam, meanwhile the Structured PvP matches and tournaments give hardcore and professional gamers a place to play.

Storyline starts out great with your choices having impact but around halfway through it gets hijacked by a Mary Sue who saves the world for you. Graphics are marginally better than the originals and most of the music is recycled from GW. Gameplay is dull with each weapon having a locked set of skills leaving you with 1 healing skill, 3 &quot;utility&quot; slots, and an elite skill. Most skills are bland because the devs have killed the &quot;trinity&quot; (aka an actual class system) leaving everyone being tanky DPS for dungeons and glass cannons for pvp. 4 months after launch and there are still tons of gameplay bugs, elite skills are almost all garbage (so bad that you forget to use them), CC &amp; debuffs are unbalanced and boring (stuns last 1-2 seconds but cripple can stack to over a minute easily), and class customization is non-existent with barebone traits. The world is beautiful and at first fun to explore, but if you go for map completion the hearts are very tedious and all the starting zones feel the same. Endgame consists of unevenly difficult &amp; boring dungeons, chaotic &amp; pointless server vs. server PvP, KOTH PvP with cosmetics-only rewards, and grinding for hundreds of hours for &quot;legendary&quot; weapons. Overall, this is a terrible sequel and has nothing to do with the original Guild War series apart from races and some skill names. The devs are clearly building the game for the &quot;WoW audience&quot; and have not only abandoned their original fans but are actively alienating them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822813">Expand</a></span>

<br>But with the Lost Shores patch they trashed it all. They broke ALL their promises, they went against their own manifesto. They went for an HEAVY grind style, a terrible gear treadmill. On top of that, the economy is ruined and prices are a real problem, especially for new players. So, if you want to buy or craft something now you pretty much have to buy money from their shop, making this a Pay to Win game.
<br>Really disappointed, it had potential, but now it&apos;s just another WoW clone, and WoW still does those things better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2783393">Expand</a></span>
