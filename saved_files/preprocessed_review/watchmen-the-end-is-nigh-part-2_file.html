If the developer had made it 50% longer, and varied the characters and levels it would be a pretty good game. It&apos;s just too short and repetitive. It&apos;s a $4.99 game.</span>

Local splitscreen co-op is something you sadly don&apos;t see very often today and i was thrilled when the game recognized my third party controller without any fuss. The visuals are alright and it is fun to play as the characters from the comic/movie. The rest of the game though is quite disappointing to say the least. The combat system feels stiff and unsatisfying and it gets repetitive really quick. Prepare yourself to fight the same guys with the same boring moves over and over again for that is what you are going to be doing the biggest part of the game. Add that the AI is pretty much broken and you get a pretty worthless fighting-game. From time to time i found the AI standing beside me waving their arms and refusing to attack me. I could literary walk away from the computer and still be at full health when i returned. No stay away from this game no matter the price. I can only recommend it do die hard Watchmen fans and people dying for a cheap splitscreen co-op game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watchmen-the-end-is-nigh-part-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2620566">Expand</a></span>
