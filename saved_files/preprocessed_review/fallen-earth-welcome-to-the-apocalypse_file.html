The game world is truly massive, from the amount of quests you can do to the amount of items that can be crafted.  Unfortunately, this is kind of an illusion to what the game is actually like.  First off, the player base is one on par with Runescape.  You expect a more mature, slightly more intelligent fan base in an mmo like this, much like the CoH or SWG fans.  While you do get a few stragglers from those kinds of games, it seems the majority are completely clueless players who(this is not a joke)constantly ask about how to mount their horses or fire their guns.  When I say constant I mean every 5 minutes. Every hour of every day.
<br>
<br>Now you would think this is because of a lacking tutorial(true to an extent)a lack of available info on a game that has been out for 3 years(incredibly true)or maybe it&apos;s because of the archaic chat system they chose to use.  Not only can you expect nothing more from Game Masters than an all caps message every few minutes or(if you&apos;re lucky!) an answer for how to get onto a horse, but there is literally no legitimate way of getting assistance for in game issues, from your character being stuck, to quests being bugged, to your horse disappearing from under you and teleporting up to 10 minutes away from your location.  If anything you are told to call support, and surprise surprise, you aren&apos;t allowed access to support as a F2P player!  The fact that they ban or mute players for talking in the only global chat they are allowed to have(help channel)is more than a little telling of how the GMs and player mods actually view your contributions to the game.  That is to say, they don&apos;t care. What it all comes down to is just the lack of effort in this community, from the wiki that hasn&apos;t been edited in a few years, to no character planners being easily accessible, to knowledge bases in general being completely lacking...for a game like this to suffer those faults, it&apos;s almost unheard of.  I&apos;ve never in my life seen such a lackluster attitude towards improving a community, and while I enjoy playing this game, mcTwex was right in his review, this game will never become what it easily could have been, an amazing mmo that took great game mechanics from the mmos that defined what it was to be a sandbox mmorpg.
<br>
<br>Perhaps when they realize that a better documented game leads to a more populated game, things will change.  Unfortunately I don&apos;t see that happening any time soon, as the only reason I see for the giant gaping hole in available information for the game is the complete failure on the developers part to foster a community who actually cares about the longevity of the game.  I mean, if the developers themselves barely give a crap, why should the average player?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=2909411">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay, the crafting, the combat are not the problem, it&apos;s just that Icarus was not ready for the sheer influx of gamers flocking in. The game itself has an old west quality that sort of mingles to make civilization feel like something out of Mad Max&apos;s &quot;Barter Town&quot;. However, there are lag issues with creature rubberbanding for hundreds of feet, and server restarts that only seem to fix the problems for up to an hour or so before it reverts to the same deal. Also, the lack of respecs, though they don&apos;t bother me, are putting off my friends from joining, as they say that having to figure out what works in a game through trial and error and starting over if bad mistakes are made is not the way they want to play. Icarus&apos; solution to the lag and bugs seems to be &apos;server restart&apos; and &apos;server maintenance&apos; over and over, many times a day, to the point where every attempt to log in is a 50-50 coin toss whether you&apos;ll be able to get online or the server will be either &apos;down for maintenance&apos; or &apos;logins locked out&apos;. The moment the servers go down, everyone floods the forum and almost immediately, anyone trying to see what&apos;s happening in the Server Status forums starts getting &apos;&apos;. The problems make it sound like the game as designed for 100-200 players and they were honestly surprised that 10,000 people tried to join this weekend. Though it played acceptable until Friday, as soon as the weekend prime time started, the game has experienced all the above problems in triplicate. I&apos;m sure once either the server problems are fixed, or the first month is up and most of the free month players either move on or settle in, things will ease off.... but for now, getting in to play the game itself is more a challenge than playing the game itself. The game has promise, but the servers really need to be fixed so that we can actually play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=736417">Expand</a></span>

This is my second trip to post-apocalyptic Arizona.  I played the game near release because the idea of a &apos;Mad Max&apos;-esque MMO appealed to me, plus the &quot;No Elves!&quot; ad campaign was hitting me right in the sweet-spot after years of WoW and WoW-clones.  The game is set in 2156 in the Grand Canyon region of the former United States.  The earth has been ravaged by wars and the Shiva virus, a killing and mutating force that has created mutants out of man and animal.  In  the Grand Canyon region, survivors are beginning to recreate some semblance of civilization by scraping together remnants of past technology and culture as well as forging a new society among several competing factions.<br><br>The story brought me in, since, as I mentioned, I&apos;m a fan of post-apoc fiction and movies.  Settling into this world should have been an easy fit for me, and it was.  The tutorial level is a great introduction to the game, it&apos;s setting, storyline, mechanics, and factions.  Your goal is to escape Hoover Dam which is under the control of a mad scientist and his private army.  After discovering you are a clone and can be resurrected in any of a series of cloning centers you &apos;volunteer&apos; to blow up the dam in order to save the planet, or something.  Out in the real world, freshly spawned with a new clone body you begin your real adventure into the world of Fallen Earth.<br><br>http://www.mmofringe.com/content/fringe-articles/mmo-games/79-fallen-earth/190-mmofringecom-fallen-earth-review</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1656865">Expand</a></span>

It is an Indie MMORPG, so there are bugs, but the Dev team works very hard to give the player base what they want. The world is very big, the player customization system is very big, and the crafting system is very big. Some of the reviews of this game were not fair because playing the game for 45 minutes does not even come close to the full potential this game has... It is a lot like PRE-CU SWG, which if you played, was huge...but had it&apos;s faults. The combat system is hard to get used to, but you will like it if you take the time to get used to it. The crafting system is very big, if you see it, you can craft it. It might take a while to gather the resources and understand it, but you can do it. All in all, this is an MMORPG not for the weak, not for the people that just want to jump in and be good. It takes a lot of getting used to, and a lot of gameplay hours just trying to understand what you are suppose to do. It is a challenge, so if you are up for one, this MMORPG is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=745030">Expand</a></span>

The crafting ideas are fantastic but a bit nagging; your bags now fill even more horrifically full with random beast parts and foods well before you know what to do with it all. Easily the worst aspect of the game is combat; there seems to be no real &apos;moves&apos; system, the AI is stupid and can see through walls, stone and the planet itself sometimes... and nothing kills the atmosphere worse than humanoids randomly appearing out of thin air, usually quite literally and with zero aggro wait table. Very bad combat (ranged, melee, so-called mutagen skills, pick any) is frustratingly clunky and poorly animated. Think Jeremiah meets helbreath and you will have a good idea of what this is. The ambiance is fantastic but devs still do not take clues from the playerbase; on any given night you can read 5-10 messages a minute regarding people losing their horses... yes the solution is simple but really, would a whistle be too much to ask for?<br><br>Two years in and it is still very much a jagged unfinished work, one that has/had a sick amount of potential and will now go absolutely nowhere. A pure shame and an embarrassment of a game, even after they managed to fix almost all of the ridiculous glitches and lag that the game suffered from for.. two... years.<br><br>Ugh. Just... ugh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1796381">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story is wonderful the graphics are solid if you can crank them out it looks really good.
<br>The towns and NPC&apos;s really make the game come alive and i spent 5 bucks at the game store and recieved a freakin ton of welcome gift items free as well as unlocks for crafting, character slots, chip limit all unlocked and stays unlocked.. i stopped playing wow after 6 years and this is the first MMO  i found that i can really dive into.
<br>Picture Fallout and road warrior as an mmo and thats a rough idea of the setting.
<br>deff 10 from me and there is not more limited trial its wide open to anyone @ 60 hours i am just leaving the starter town if that gives you any idea.
<br>great game  play it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=2551868">Expand</a></span>

(still broken to this day) Lost quest advancement and AP&apos;s and XP&apos;s. (Still broken) Random crashes.(almost daily) Told to be patient this is a new game. It&apos;s been out for over a year. (Closed Beta, Open beta, Early Entry and now Paying Live time) Same bugs same lies. Save yourself the headache and money.

                                        <span> I have found nothing new or fresh about the game. It is just like every other MMO, except it gives less details about shortcuts etc., and the player chat is often overwhelming. Also fairly laggy. Game mechanics are crude and its graphics are poor.</span>

The lag is so bad that when I shoot an enemy they don&apos;t even respond until 3-5 seconds later, so during that time the enemy is not moving making it easy to just head-shot him 8 times which for easy AI&apos;s its a kill. The graphics aren&apos;t bad but the texture of the items are bad.</span>

(a car, dune buggies, atvs, and, MOTORBIKES!). Yes, by sitting in the help channel, it does seem quite buggy from what people say, but ive only encountered one bug, the game is quite complicated, likie going to multiple towns for money, items and to get books, but its not too hard, downsides, however, the graphics are not that good, BUT THEY ARE ENHANCING THE GRAPIHCS! there is only one active channel, the help channel, and u cant really go offtopic on it, not alowed, but people have been requesting more in the forum, so never fear, the quests are slightly repetitive and dying is very annoying, but if u do easier quests, get money, get better gear, ull do better. Overall, fallen earth is a great game, with its downsides yes, but if u get over them, ull love it, its worth a ten, if not more, BUY IT! (note, there are bonus items if u buy it, but they&apos;re limited!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=743405">Expand</a></span>

It felt very similar to the popular game called Fallout. The graphics are great once you start the game, very detailed. The controls are slightly wonky but I think new players will get used to it over time. I really enjoyed the combat system, and how players are able to to go into 3rd person or even 1st person when equipped with guns. My main concern with this game was how easily a person who is new to this game could get muted in the &quot;help&quot; chat because of a silly question. With no previous knowledge of rules implemented into the chat I got muted and the customer support would state the rules AFTER getting muted. For the rest of the time I could not use the help chat as I had more questions based on the game. Which was very unfortunate.

The game went free to play and has gained some ground as far as new players go, and perhaps lost some as a result as well. The great thing about this game is they don&apos;t limit you to the extreme as other games do when you don&apos;t pay. I was afraid when the game went free to play you&apos;d feel the negative impact right away, it never happened. You hardly even notice that the game has changed, or the changes that took place. (aside from the big revamp that took 90% of my skills away). The game is difficult to get into at first and can be very confusing, but the player community is typically very helpful in this area. The game could almost put itself into a survival category, if you aren&apos;t creating your own goods, you&apos;re going to need to make a friend or find a good fast way to make money. (which is easier than it may seem). There are two things that really sale this game for me, the character customization and the pvp. World PvP is amazing and it&apos;s really quite elegant. For example, you turn on pvp or walk into a pvp area and anyone can die from anyone, including friendlies killing friendly. You have to trust your &apos;friend&apos; or faction/clan mates won&apos;t stab you in the back while you&apos;re gathering goods, or trust that other people from a different but not so hostile faction to yours won&apos;t kill you as well. Character customization, if you&apos;re looking for a fat or super muscular guy, or making a woman with a bigger or smaller chest, you won&apos;t find that in Fallen Earth, every model remains the same size and height. However, Where other games have this and ultimately stop at this, Fallen Earth looks past it and makes something far more satisfying, the ability to make your character 100% unique in the clothes they wear. I mean, the minute you put on that cool mask in any other game, all your customization is for nothing (besides being too fat or too thin.) In Fallen Earth, you put on that mask, or that hat, or those boots, and you have become an individual. This isn&apos;t a game that you can make a pretty good guess at a person&apos;s level at first glance, you could make a decent one, but not a great one. This isn&apos;t a game for everyone, the mechanics are different and it is heavily relied on player base, it has an odd mix of being able to survive alone while still needing the support of others around you (or maybe not.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=2305058">Expand</a></span>

This is by far the most immersive world to come along in a while. Next to no instancing, one server, a very deep crafting game, lots of choices as to how you want to focus your character (its stat based, rather than class based); consequences for your decisions, a sense of genuine struggle against a harsh environment, scavenging what you can. Its graphics are not amazing, but not bad for an MMO, and effective at creating a mood. A decent enough community so far. A true MMO, in my opinion, after a long run of MMO-lites. But without - so far - a sense of grind. Instead, its a constant exploration.

Yes, the game servers are currently overloaded because of unexpected interest, but every game (including the mighty WoW) suffers this or similar at launch, and it needs to be overlooked. If its still happening in a month then there is a problem. What should be rated is the quality of the game that has been produced, and please believe me it&apos;s very very good. Following the short tutorial you are thrown into the world and expected to fend for yourself. I know some people like their hands held, and in this case you won&apos;t like this game. But if you understand that this is a post-apocalyptic world then it makes SENSE for you to have to figure things out for yourself. It&apos;s a cruel world out there and only the fittest survive. The crafting system in the game is awesome. 95% of all items in the game can be crafted, and although you can buy weapons, armour, etc from vendors, crafting (or just gathering for sale) really should play a major part in every players experience, as the system is so rich. Being able to queue crafting, craft on the move and craft while logged out takes the pain out of most other MMOs crafting systems. The graphics are pretty good for a mmo. Yes, crysis is better, but this is a MMO. OK, if your rig isn&apos;t fairly decent you&apos;ll have to balance display settings with gameplay for the most crowded areas, but again, this is exactly the same in every MMO. Combat is fun if you like FPS. The variety of weapons available (eat corkscrew thug!) will keep it interesting, and the variety of enemies is good. I&apos;m not much of a PvP player, so have yet to play that and wont comment on something I don&apos;t know about. The world is massive. Really, if you think you&apos;ve seen a big game before you aint seen nothing yet. But it manages to feel filled with things to do, as you can&apos;t ride from A to B without finding interesting harvesting nodes, critters or post-apoc towns. Overall I love this game, and can see it being on my quickback for a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=736459">Expand</a></span>

For starters it doesn&apos;t contain elfs, dwarfs and orcs. That right there is a HUGE plus for me. Second is it is a cross between a MMO and FPS. It is more MMOish than FPS but you still fight like it is a FPS. Also the crafting system isn&apos;t something that feels tacked on. 95% of usable items can be crafted, this means there is great potential for a good player driven economy to exist. The game does have some issues, lag being one of those. However this is the first dev team out of the MANY MMOs I have played that actually listens. They are constantly improving the state of the game and it is gradually getting better and better. The graphics may not be top notch but they aren&apos;t complete crap either. This game has a MASSIVE draw distance, if you can see it on the horizon you can walk to it. If games like Aion had the same draw distance you would need a super computer to run it. Overall I think this is a fresh addition to the MMO world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=737076">Expand</a></span>

Some may find it&apos;s graphics a little bit too old, but it fits very well with overall in-game story and atmosphere and on next day of playing you stop noticing it. Like in every game there are things which could be better, but I was happy to see that developers didn&apos;t go on holiday after release, game is still being updated weekly, each second update is quite extensive, other companies could call them &quot;expansion&quot;. There is very good feeling of being listened by devs. The start for this game may be difficult, but it has everything needed to build a large base of dedicated and capable to pay fans. So I believe that bright future awaits for this title. If you want me to compare it with other modern MMOs, the only title which comes to my head is EVE Online.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=741403">Expand</a></span>

Onto the game. Fallen Earth let&apos;s you take on the consciousness of a clone ( hence why you don&apos;t die, you just..respawn into a new life pod ).

<br>Zero? Seriously?
<br>
<br>Onto the game. Fallen Earth let&apos;s you take on the consciousness of a clone ( hence why you don&apos;t die, you just..respawn into a new life pod ).
<br>Graphics: 7/10 If you tweak them properly and your rig can hold they can even reach 8/10. it&apos;s an old game i guess, so one can&apos;t fault it for that. Animations are solid if repetitive, plenty of emotes, shadows, sun reflections and all that.
<br>Sound: Fallen Earth has no continuous music. From time to time or on random events a really nice soundtrack comes out but too rare to make an impact. I usually just use the Fallout 3 exploration soundtrack in the background: so i guess 7/10 here.
<br>Atmosphere and gameplay:
<br>By far the strongest point of this game. The feeling is that of mad Max combined with Fallout. There is a bit of realism added as your vehicles don&apos;t go into magi space once you don&apos;t ride them anymore but need to be parked in garages - or they remain where you left them. They also use FUEL which is - sadly - too abundant for my taste.
<br>All this, the vehicles, gear on you, weapons can be crafted. There are no &quot;full drops&quot; ever. Just materials.
<br>Your gear also has two levels of wear and tear, one that can be repaired and one that cannot, requiring you to simply replace the gear altogether which is quite nice.
<br>Ammo is also limited and must be crafted.
<br>A nice part of the game are the multi-leveled free-roam secret locations/dungeons, some of which are very VERY complex and have a boss mob at the end with good (material ) loot.
<br>Some of these dungeons require you to solve some puzzles in order to open the door, activate elevators, restore power, etc
<br>Everything you did in Fallout in a pre-war facility you can pretty much do here too.
<br>There is humor and it is hilarious sometimes, sometimes it&apos;s not. They are trying i guess. There are a few quests which offer you a sot of &quot;choice dialogue&quot; in which you choose replies and based on them the guy attacks you, sends you to kill someone else or hands over the item peacefully - which is what MMOs today LACK SO BADLY.
<br>Choice. You are definitely not railroaded here. I suddenly dropped my main quest out of focus and went exploring randomly and discovered some huge antennas with a bunker below them that can be explored.
<br>And there are probably many others that i missed. There are nuclear silos, abandoned farms, science labs and many many towns overrun by monsters for you to explore.
<br>10/10
<br>Crafting: As i said anything can be crafted. Getting the recipe? Why you crafted them of course, unless you buy them ( quite expensive at one point ) or get them from quests.
<br>From the simple 9mm pistol to the rocket launcher ( yes, there is one and yes it is as cool as you think ), everything is crafted, uses up ammo and eventually breaks down.
<br>Components drops from mobs, are harvested from plants or are mined from special nodes.
<br>While the crafting is amazing the downside is the time to craft anything serious is measured in HOURS to DAYS. The devs must have figured this one out so they let you play while you craft ( crafting is done in the background ) and if you make a one time purchase ( highly recommended as it&apos;s just 5$ for cheapest ) you get a queue for crafting up to 3 items ( premium gets 20 or more ) and a removal of money limitations.
<br>There is no &quot;pay to win&quot; in this game. Let me repeat myself to any morons who might try to lie about it - THERE IS NO P2W in this game.
<br>First of all EVERYTHING is craftable. Everything.
<br>Second, the shop has mostly &quot;wardrobe&quot; stuff ( vanity items, no stats ) and/or cooler looking ( again &quot;looking&quot; ) vehicles.
<br>There is no &quot;I win&quot; purchase, there is no &quot;give me advantages in pvp&quot; purchase. I can&apos;t stress this enough.
<br>Crafting gets complicated and a bit crazy sometimes but is usually rewarding - the vehicle research is the most notorious, last 2-4 days for one book. Damn.
<br>
<br>General issues:
<br>Ok there are things to complain. One of the biggest problem - at higher lvls anyway - is the insane respawn rate of mobs.
<br>To explain: i killed a whole batallion of raiders before reaching the objective 20 meters away and completing it took another 30 raiders to kill, they just kept coming and coming !
<br>Worse, there is no aggro wait table. They spawn with an axe into your skull - literally ( fire axe is a weapon in game ).
<br>There are some geodata bugs here and there - mobs get stuck in walls and can&apos;t move/hit you, or you can&apos;t hit them but they can, etc
<br>But these are rare there are so far only 3 areas in 3 sectors ( maps ) that i have found to be bugged like this ).
<br>
<br>Overall the game is DEFINITELY worth a shot, being F2P and all. It&apos;s the only &quot;fallout-ish&quot; mmo out there so it gets bonus points for effort in being original and i recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=4267691">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You can use mounts for fast riding, craft your equipment and raise dozens of skills with a unique skill system. Graphics have nice quality textures but kinda lack of a good animation system. User interface is kinda weird and will take you hours to understand it, same does map. Also, some quests are quite weird in terms of what they ask. They have lots of different objectives which provides quality but sometimes they just don&apos;t work well.
<br>
<br>Combat system is the key of the game, as you can play in almost real-time and kill other mobs or players using assault rifles, carbines or even snipers. I would highly recommend this one to any Fallout fan out there!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=3134546">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it looks as if it was made 7 years ago. But graphics aren&apos;t everything, right? It was disappointing after being convinced to purchase it, that despite all of their efforts to convince me that it was a &quot;tough&quot; game, a serious game, one with no wimpy &quot;elves&quot; etc... it&apos;s itself a silly, childish game in too many ways. (thanksgiving pilgrim hats anyone?) Customer service and tech support is attrocious. I blame lack of organization and a small company not being prepared to deal with so many people. But whatever the reason is, they do not operate professionally, deliver on what they promise or respond to critical issues in a timely fashion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=741521">Expand</a></span>

I spend a lot of time looking for merchants, b/c I haven&apos;t memorized their location in each town, and unlike SWOTOR, they aren&apos;t all grouped in the same place.  There is no easy map of the towns.  You can only see a little bit at a time, and you can&apos;t scroll the map, either.  Worst of all, quests send you to a place, then you have to go all the way back, then complete the quest, and then many of them send you right back to the original place for the second part.  Really?  I spent a lot of time just traveling  not fun traveling, just busy work traveling.  And worse, you need to feed your mounts or gas up your vehicles while doing all this repetitive craziness.  Finally the gfx just disappoint utterly.  They are very low resolution.  Also, this is common to all MMOs, but I wish the re-spawn rate was just a little slower, so I could explore a bit more, before having to fight off the same opponents, in the same area.  On the plus side, the mix of real action and rpg elements, appeals greatly to me and no one does it, so huge kudos there.  The only other benefit is its free.  Also, until Fallout 4 comes out, we are stuck with this.  If you want your Fallout fix, this will do for now.  If they would fix some of these annoying quirks, it could be more fun, and I would rate it a 7.  If they improved the gfx, I would give it an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-earth-welcome-to-the-apocalypse/user-reviews?user_review_id=3524386">Expand</a></span>

There aren&apos;t any &quot;classes&quot; and the faction system initially designed for classes was ripped apart and is now useless to the player.  Oh, and it&apos;s pay-to-play essentially.  Really a great concept but the devs obviously stopped caring years ago and have yet to fix many of the broken mechanics or even respond to help requests.

You have character building, crafting from armor, bladed weapons, guns, mutation skills, medical, science, construction and nature. You can not play the way you want, there is no P2W. The game is 8 years old now and I doubt there will be another like it again.</span>
