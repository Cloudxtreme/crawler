I loved the original CK. It is a totally different sort of strategy. It is to Medieval strategy what Football manager is to the soccer genre. While Total War does the &quot;Fifa 012&quot; bit &quot;Football Manager&quot; is all about the people, their abilities and their relationships. Well same here.<br>Crusader Kings 2 is a VERY sold and attractive game, it even co0mes with a decent tutorial (saints preserve us - Paradox realising that MAYBE some gamers don&apos;t want to spend 2-3 days working out what everything does - the challenge should be in PLAYING THE GAME...not WORKING OUT HOW TO PLAY THE GAME)..Anyway CK II sorts this out. The relationships are fantastic, the character traits very believable, the bloodlines mingle in ways that seem entirely realistic (you don&apos;t always get what you want - but you always understand why you end up with what you have) Pity it&apos;s almost Spring, this game could have kept me going all Winter. An excellent game - the best I&apos;ve played in 2012 so far</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2132010">Expand</a></span>

<br>Which seems like a lot of work for a game doesn&apos;t it?
<br>
<br>Honestly though if you persevere it is completely worth the effort. Wouldn&apos;t say it was perfect, but with the ability to mod out the things you don&apos;t like and mod in the things you do? It is pretty damn near it.

It&apos;s intricate, but it avoids being as tremendously complex as, for example, the Hearts of Iron series. I recommend it heartily. It doesn&apos;t get a 10 from me, but that&apos;s because I give 10s only to the sort of tremendous game that we might see only once every few years.</span>

No other strategy game set in the middle ages have captured my imagination quite as CK2. I love TW:Medieval 2, but after playing CK2, Medieval 2 feels somewhat unsatisfying. In Medieval 2 for example, you play a nation, which is probematic in a society ruled by feudal dynastic leaders. In CK2, you play as a single person (count, duke, king or emperor) and are faced with all the challenges of society which is based on personal relationships, not on abstract notions of homogenous nations. Therefore, the focus is not so much on warfare, but on these relationships which may well shatter your whole dynasty if they turn sour. Your power is never absolute: if your vassals don&apos;t like you, they won&apos;t provide you with money or troups, or will even raise their flags in rebellion. Years and years of civil war are no rarity in this game.<br>Medieval 2 let you conquer the whole of Europe with relative ease in a short span of time, and, more importantly, without good reason. In CK2, wars even against much weaker enemies are expensive and dangerous. In my last game playing as kings of France, I spent 300 years, plotting and warring, until I managed to take back all counties held by England in France. Also, you will always need a reason for declaring war on someone. Claims on certain counties, dukedoms or even kingdoms are inherited through marriage, fabricated or granted by a liege lord or the pope.<br>I very much enjoy this game and I can recommend it to anyone interested in the medieval period, or strategy gaming in general. Its focus on individuals give it a fresh and personal feeling, and the plethora of small stories and tragedies unfolding in the course of centuries is captivating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2317987">Expand</a></span>

This game weights only 800~ MB but this, honestly, far better than for example total war medieval games which are 8~ GB. Yeah, there&apos;s no battlefields, but the combat system is better than ever for Paradox games. Your vassal, courtiers and so on lead your troops in battle. It appears that a good soldier might turn in a noble man for once. That&apos;s what I call reality, and that takes only 800~ MB which expresses me the most. To those who gave this game lower than 7/10: You should play it longer to understand how complicated and interesting this game really is. As I said, first hour of gameplay I was disappointed, but I kept on playing and now I know what I will do next 2 weeks every evening.

Great improvement from the first one, and using the experience that Paradox gained with his other series (Europa Universalis, Sengoku and Victoria), with great graphics and a really great set of possibilities, events and replay factor. Just too dificult to new players, but nothing that some hours of gameplay can&apos;t solve.</span>

The main difference between this title and some of Paradox&apos;s others is that in this game you are not some omnipotent god like figure ruling over your kingdom. You are actually a family member in the game, and you must successfully navigate each character through their life, forging alliances with other family members of all sorts, and as ruler, your most important task is securing a line of succession- failure to do so will result in instantly losing the game.
<br>The game is not for the impatient FPS player who wants instant kills and gratification, if you&apos;re looking for explosions, this is not the game for you. As everyone else has already mentioned, the game is in desperate need of a sufficient manual. The learning curve is rather steep as one has to learn medieval jargon to master the game. Not a bad game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2488464">Expand</a></span>

I especially love how sometimes you feel like you are playing against your (future) self with your heirs. That ambitious son who&apos;s helping you win wars today will also fight your heir on your passing. What a truly great and well thought out game!</span>

At first this game was very intimidating and I was worried it would lose my interest quickly.  Quite the contrary, this game actually made me start researching the basics of medieval times and governments, so that I could better understand the game.  Now, having 60 hours of playtime so far, I am even more addicted now than when I started.  Every time I play the game, I learn something new about the mechanics of the game, which opens a new strategy or approach.  The unique ways the games play out could actually be used to write a legitimate story, with betrayals, intrigue, politics and lust for power.  This game is absolutely not for everyone, but to the fortunate ones who take the time to learn it, it is one of the most engrossing games I&apos;ve played in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2261524">Expand</a></span>

This game is an excellent example of grand strategy and hours of fun for any strategy fan. The AI could be a bit smarter, but then again I have only progressed 150 years in over 10 hours of game play. What the game does need is a high quality video tutorial series, however there are a few on YouTube that are ok.</span>

Game is very complex and it indeed takes a while to figure out, what to do with your feudal lands. I personally enjoyed watching my children grow up with right education. Only thing that really darkened the sky above my growing empire, again family. As soon as you give them some titles, they become unbelievably annoying, but when your youngers keep killing your best heirs. Well, it can make you a little angry. And the rebelling vassals? It was a bit annoying too. I think this feature was, historically, a trouble, but those dummies defy all my enormously powerful almost invincible though benevolent and merciful rulers. It just doesn&apos;t make sense to rebel only to get utterly crushed a few weeks after. I see some space a improving the heraldry, because some of those coats of arms are just ridiculous, if you know a little about it.<br>On the other hand all these cons are greatly balanced by game&#xC2;&#xB4;s pros. Graphic is quite good. I got to like whole warfare system. Claiming lands is also a very interesting feature. Improving your holdings is also a great idea. If only could I see my castles grow... Laws of the realm were simple to set and whole system was thoroughly created. So yes, this game has it&apos;s missteps, but in the full picture works real good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2285188">Expand</a></span>

Or you might be trying to marry off your inbred daughter to the sixth son of the kingdom that could easily destroy you if they felt so inclined.
<br>
<br>Primarily, CK2 is about managing different pieces of territory. Each territory, or province, has its own buildings with their own upgrades. There are groups of provinces called duchies, and groups of duchies called kingdoms (there are even empires made up of multiple kingdoms).
<br>
<br>However, while on the surface CK2 is a game about territory management, the game is really about the ruler of those territories. This is your main character, and they can have a whole host of different traits and skills that make each character unique. Skills measure how good you are at certain activities (like battle strategies or diplomacy) and traits can affect these. For example, being deceptive makes you better at intrigue, but a known lie isn&#x2019;t trusted easily, making diplomacy a harder task.
<br>
<br>The game also has events, which can be anything from seeing a strange light crossing the night sky to watching a jester perform in the summer festival. These events can have effects on your character and their land (sometimes just directly taking away gold from your coffers). At this point, I could explain Gold, Prestige and Piety, and then move onto religion and culture, and then onto government. The amount of different mechanics and systems in CK2 is ridiculous. What&#x2019;s more ridiculous is that all these aspects actually work together (for the most part). This helps to create a complex and dynamic randomised playthrough every single time you boot it up.
<br>
<br>However, there is a disadvantage to this. CK2 has a massive lag problem. As the game goes on, it will slow down more and more. Eventually, the game is bound to break down. There&#x2019;s very little that can be done about this, other than having a great computer that won&#x2019;t be affected. Paradox also have a strange and worrying addiction to throwing in more DLC. For some (like &apos;The Old Gods&apos;), they add enough good content to the game to justify being sold separately. Others, such as &apos;Monks and Mystics&apos; feel rushed, lazy and broken. Finally, the game has major issues with multiplayer. It is famously unstable and frustrating.
<br>
<br>Despite these issues, I still give CK2 a 9/10. There is just so much laying beneath the surface that even experienced players are bound to discover something new every time they play. This game is a must have for any strategy lover!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7588617">Expand</a></span>

This includes many false starts, and starting over, and also returning to previous saves because my noobness was making me wreck my dynasty. For therein lies what you need to know the most about this game, if you haven&apos;t played it yet: It is hard. Especially at first. There is such a steep learning curve. I also watched some videos to help me out in the beginning, and I am sure I am not halfway through being pro at this game.
<br>
<br>So, while there is a steep learning curve, which also means that at first you will have no idea what you are doing, or what to do and whatnot, there is a great deal of satisfaction to be had in doing the right thing. The game is pretty, although the visual element is far from the most important in this game, and it is very fun and addictive. The game is stable, rarely crashes, has few bugs, none of which impede on game play.
<br>
<br>My only 2 criticisms: The DLC is mostly an insult. You pay as much as the game itself (the game being $39.99 and the &quot;full&quot; version with all the DLC being $79.99. More to the point, purchasing all the DLC piecemeal will set you back an impressive $107.70, that is, plus the game itself) for what basically amounts to portraits, military unit models, and dynastic shields. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the Sunset Invasion, Old Gods, and The Republic are worthwhile DLC. I&apos;ll even accept the EU4 converter. But paying for portraits, unit models and shields that should be an integral part of the game? NO. No matter how good the game is, that&apos;s a big NO from me. So -1 for that. Perfect  game 10, crappy money grabbing DLC scheme -1, final rating is 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3522034">Expand</a></span>

Like the title would suggest, the game takes place circa the three major crusades for the holy land. While the game does provide you bonuses for participating in these holy wars, the game doesn&apos;t revolve around them. If you try and only focus on crusades, wars to expand your empire, or waging war out of boredom (Not like you would get THAT bored of the game), then you would find that your coffers would run dry and your domain would be ripping itself apart limb from limb. The game is more-so about survival than world domination. Probably the most challenging thing about CKII is figuring out how to start (At least if your new the the franchise, like me.) While the game does provide many interactive tutorials for beginners, I find that I lost interest quickly when it came to tutorials. The most critical thing that you should pay attention to if you are new to CK is the GUI and options given to you when it comes to unit management and diplomacy. Once you get past the tutorials and learn how to control your domain its very easy to get started. When you first boot up your very first game and encounter the ruler domain select screen, you will see one of the many   game&apos;s strengths- kingdom verity. You can play as any region going as far west as the Iberian peninsula and Iceland and as far east as Persia and Mesopotamia. You can choose to play as a count, duke, king, or emperor. The latter controls all the lesser. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Counties are flexible when it comes to technological and economic growth, but lack a major military force and will have to rely on &quot;big brother&quot; for protection. Duchies Enjoy a better degree of autonomy than counties, but are still overshadowed  by kingdoms and empires. Controlling a kingdom is the base experience of CK. You control a large group of domains and have a sizable military force, but you have to manage your vassals to prevent both minor and catastrophic civil wars. You also need to have a good relationship with the papacy or caliphate if you want a good general opinion of your ruler. Many newer players might want to control Empires since they control the most amount of land compared to other ranks of land claims and they control, for lack of better words, a massive, massive amount of military units. However, you will also have many more vassals to deal with and more civil wars to fight. I highly recommend playing as A king before an Emperor.
<br>I find with modern games that the more time you spend on it, the more visible the flaws are. This game totally deifies this law. The more and more time you sink your teeth into this masterpiece, the you&apos;ll find this game more deep and positively complex than the day you started this game. If you enjoy games like Civilization and Age of Empires, than you&apos;ll instantly fall in love with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2507065">Expand</a></span>

Territories and combat are a little bit like risk territories in that the more you control, the bigger your army is and the more you can expand.  In 1066 AD, the Holy Roman Empire is gigantic with about 40 territories comprising of an emperor and dozens of barons, dukes etc.  France has about 20 territories,  Islam has spread deep into what is now Spain.
<br>
<br>As my tiny little dukedom in Ireland, I decided to scratch and claw my way to greatness with the goal of forming the Kingdom of Ireland.  When you play, the character you control and their stats are key to your survival/expansion/success.  The goal is to play for score through &quot;prestige&quot; earned by accomplishing ambitions you choose such as getting married, having a son as an heir, improving your skills, etc.
<br>
<br>I went along the path of getting married and having an heir.  I had a plan to take 1 neighboring territory and build up my military to seize all of Ireland (about 15 territories) and making myself king.  I was progressing well until my wife killed me with a night of passion with my wife at age 45.  At this point I was sold.  The game continues as I take over with a 20 yr old heir who&apos;s slothful, not that great and completely unprepaired.  My vassels hate me, my tiny kingdom is on the brink of disaster.  Im desparately trying to marry vassels off to get them to like me, or give them honorary titles or whatever i can do.  Really, this is where the game is fun.  Something epically bad and random happens that ruins your plans and you SCRAMBLE to survive as vassels, brothers, sisters, former allies, everybody tries to take your lands, titles and power.
<br>
<br>The game really isnt about combat on the map, its about developing your count/duke/king into a great leader, forming alliances, murdering opponents through treachery, ensuring your lineage, and preparing for your death and your heirs turbulent ascension to whatever throne you have.
<br>
<br>Having played Hearts of Iron 3 (liked it alot) and Europa Universalis (didnt like it) and having paid $20 during a recent steam sale, I can say this is worth my money and worth a look by everybody else.  Once past the hard learning curve, this game is really deep.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m going to only mark it off 1 pt for the way the DLC is done.  3 separate buys for the celtic nations shields, characters, artwork.  Comeon! stop nickel and diming us.
<br>
<br>Really though, this is about the most strategic single player experience you are going to get.  Running and expanding your empire is like peeling the layers of an onion as you discover what works and what doesnt.  When you finially turn a 2 territory Irish petty kingdom into a sprawling 10 territory Kingdom of Ireland with the illegitimate heir of your third daughter with your second wife, you will know the meaning of the word satisfaction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3242622">Expand</a></span>

But once i tried the demo i was completely amazed. It&apos;s one of the most exciting games i have played in years! It is also quite hard at first because there is so many things to do and keep in mind.</span>

Some may find the &apos;characters&apos; a bit shallow compared to a true RPG but the strategy gamer will find themselves developing a deep hatred for certain family members, opposing families, and cultures. It is this emotion which keeps you playing. This is not  a simple game. You will not master in one play through and each complete game can be very long. I have never gotten more play time for the dollar. Managing relations in your realm and out of it while amassing power is not easy. The stronger you become the more enemies you create. You will lose wars and suffer setbacks but these challenges only make it more fun. Re-playability is awesome as each Count, Duke, King, and Emperor supplies new and interesting challenges. Combat is simple but mastering the subtleties will win you battles you should lose. Combing racial units, levies, and retinues yet keeping a positive income is the staple challenge of all these games and CK2 does this very well.
<br>
<br>A solid play for serious strategy gamers and history buffs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3043034">Expand</a></span>

The depth of the dynastic strategy is amazing  though it will take many hours to fully appreciate and exploit the tools given to you for conquering Medieval Europe.  While there are some flaws within the game  the only real &quot;game breaker&quot; would be multiplayer support.  Crusader Kings II plays very well single player  but it truly shines when you play with others.  Unfortunately, Paradox&apos;s metaserver is nonfunctional and unsupported, which leaves you with having to play through your own IP  which is extremely difficult for friends and family who have no network experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3741649">Expand</a></span>

That said, it&apos;s DEFINITELY not one for everyone. The graphics are minimal (you just stare at a map the whole time), battles consist of little more than numbers decreasing for each side and a single game will takes hours upon hours to finish.<br><br>But if the above hasn&apos;t put you off, CK2 is a compelling game. The comparisons with Football Manager et al are pretty much spot on; this is a definite case of substance over style. Building up your dynasty is great fun. You need to scour the world for suitable mates, deal with unruly vassals or ungrateful lieges, put down regular rebellions, come up with tentative justifications to go to war, cozy up to the pope, and so on. There are many different ways you can approach the game, and you&apos;ll need to vary your tactics several times over the course of the game as circumstances dictate.<br><br>I do have a few gripes though, but nothing major. Finding a particular province or person can be tedious at times, and it would be nice to be able to define better filters for sorting through potential spouses for your children. Particular irritating is that some of the tool tips that are displayed are very unclear or misleading, which does not help you when you&apos;re starting out. You&apos;re somewhat thrown in at the deep end at the start and it takes a while to get into the swing of things. There are also a couple of minor bugs at the time of writing, such as your heir being displayed incorrectly (reloading fixes it though). I&apos;ve not had any game stopping issues though, and no crashes after 100+ hours of playing.<br><br>If the idea of building a dynasty appeals to you, you don&apos;t have an aversion to games that don&apos;t rely on fancy graphics and have the time to invest in playing the game, you really ought to check out the demo. I played it for several hours and was immediately sold.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2279834">Expand</a></span>

Ironically enough, fan-created content like the dearth of &apos;Let&apos;s Play&apos; series available on YouTube is actually the best way to get a feel for the various fine mechanics of game-play, and is certainly more engaging than reading pages and pages of text from the tutorial, or power-gamer &apos;How to Play CKII&apos; from the Paradox Forums.<br><br>Putting aside the disappointing tutorial and sharp learning-curve, the game at its core is a fantastically engaging dynasty simulator. Unlike the Europa Universalis Series, which focuses on countries, CKII focuses on Dynasties. At it&apos;s heart CKII is one part Kingdom Simulator, and one part The Sims. Unlike other Grand Strategy games, CKII manages to make individuals one of the most important aspects of the game, and it does so intelligently. Managing your dynasty, interpersonal relationships, plotting against rivals, and managing the oftentimes chaotic succession of lands and titles sounds overwhelming, and yet CKII is designed to remain manageable nevertheless.<br><br>All that said, this game is not for everyone. It&apos;s a thinking game. Battles are very RISK-like, pieces moving from place to place with fights being resolved off-screen. Being a fan of the Total War series, I was hoping battles would involve more tactical play, but unfortunately that&apos;s not what this game is about. It&apos;s about thinking, planning, building -- all that good strategy stuff -- and only a tiny bit of tactical game-play. So if you think you can enter a battle as the underdog and win with superior tactics, think again. In CKII the superior strategist is victorious.<br><br>Paradox is actively improving and supporting the game with patches, constantly striving to improve game-play with community feedback. Bioware? Sit up and take notes.<br><br>Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, my newly created Greater Kingdom of Ireland, Scotland, and England is off to help the besieged Kingdom of Castille reclaim the Iberian Peninsula from the marauding Muslim factions who&apos;ve rolled in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2321559">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay has been extremely simplified (compared to Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings 1 and so on) even thought the game is not easier / casualised at all. I believe Paradox learned something really valuable: how to make the most complex games easy to handle. It&apos;s just perfect. About the game itself: I won&apos;t spend time explaining the game, the fact you start as a Count, Duke or King, that you have to manage your vassals, the relations with every people, the weddings and so on. I will make it short: if you think that thinking stuff like:<br><br>&quot;Ok I need to kill my own children so that my principal heir gets all my belongings&quot;<br>&quot;Mmmh the Duke of Aquitaine is married. If I kill his wife and I marry him with my daughter I could get some claims&quot;<br>&quot;My vassals are angry, how to make them happy? I see the heir to this Duchy is a friend of me, ok I kill this one, I&apos;ll make a plot. This other one... I can help him to become Duc of Flanders, lets start a war&quot;<br>&quot;Damn it, I absolutely have to change inheritance laws, or else I loose the crown of the Kingdom...&quot;<br><br>Well, if you think such stuff is pretty cool and that it could be intrigating , well, believe me, no game EVER  on this planet will make you think more than CK2 about plots, intrigues, assassinations, ways of getting rid of a rival, how to get the crown, how to manage relations and so on.<br><br>Furthermore, nothing is fixed, your vassals may love you, but if you die, and your children gets all, well, they may not like him, start complotting again against you, declare independence and so on. So the game is actually:<br>- never the same throughout the game itself, you never get bored. It&apos;s not because situation &quot;today&quot; is stable that it will be in 20 years.<br>- each time you play the game even with the same Family, the experiences and events will be different<br>- without saying obviously that playing a French Count or Duke is completely different than playing a Polish or a Bizantine family<br><br>Just to say how wonderful the game experience is: It&apos;s the kind of game you start talking about with your wife. And even though she doesn&apos;t care AT ALL about video game, it&apos;s such intrigung that even people who don&apos;t play video games, will in the end ask you, while taking a walk: &quot;oh, did you manage the Burgundian issue about inheritence? Did you kill in the end your nephew?&quot; or &quot;Did you manage to be King the end? And the Duke of Norway, does he still have independence desires?&quot;<br><br>Believe me, it&apos;s maybe a bit hard to handle while starting, but, after a couple of hours you understand all the subtleties of the game and that moment, you&apos;ll have a WONDERFUL game that makes Total War series a pale, tasteless game.<br><br>Why not 10 then? Because you HAVE to go by Steam, and it&apos;s such a pain...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2412909">Expand</a></span>

The main point of the game are not epic medieval battles. Battle system of that game is very simple and could be much better, because you just gather armies of your vassals and than send them to war, which is really simple, but not effective and quite hard to win a war if you do not posses an army of Holy Roman Empire. But this game takes you on a voyage to medieval courts and royal families. Who will inherit all provinces, will the kingdom survive kings assassination and will the vassals rebel? Maybe you won&apos;t be able to have children or will your wife fall in love with your enemy? Game is more a simulator of royal family life than a turn based strategy, but is really fun to play, specially if you are familiar with games like Europa Universalis, Victoria, etc. I must say that game is playable and realistic, but not for those who would like to be military general.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2453730">Expand</a></span>

The thrill of not knowing what might happen is what&apos;ll keep you playing for hours and hours if you pick up this game. It&apos;s not a case of &apos;just one more turn&apos; but &apos;just one more year&apos;. It does have it&apos;s small annoyances, such as the HRE not wanting to break up or some strange religious events, but you&apos;ll see the likes of France and England have some nightmarish situations, and that is what makes the game so unpredictable and fun. This is a gem that you can just sit and watch and it&apos;ll be as much fun as playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2521052">Expand</a></span>

Crusader Kings II is no exception. It&apos;s an amazingly fun and detailed treatment of Medieval politics. The tutorials are atypically helpful for a Paradox game, which is good because the rules are amazingly complex. Thankfully the game does a pretty good job of making it clear what is happening and why. You would think the highly restrictive rules of feudalism would make the game less enjoyable, but the many ways to scheme  both legally and illegally  make for some very creative and rewarding strategies.
<br>
<br>A few notes about the (non-cosmetic) DLC that I have played. Sword of Islam is fun, but a bit shallow compared to Catholicism. Legacy of Rome is rather narrow in scope, dealing mostly with the Byzantine Empire, but is good for what it is. The Republic is probably the best one so far, but I think it still needs work and it doesn&apos;t promote the same variety in gameplay as the vanilla. Overall, I&apos;d recommend only getting the DLC at sale/bundle prices; the base game is still where most of the fun is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3025756">Expand</a></span>

Generally, Paradox games like EU, Victoria and HoI have unnerving interfaces and complex gamplay. CK2 is not that type of game even though it&apos;s interface complex. It has very simple dynasty management mechanics which is about distributing your lands, educating and marrying your children and plotting against your enemies. You&apos;re part of the feudal pyramid. You can play as a count, duke, king and even emperor. If you&apos;re not at the top of the pyramid, you probably have servants and masters. So balancing between these powers is another challenge which works very well with dynasty management.  Main objective is getting most prestige points until the game ends.(1453 A.D) There are many ways to achive this obective like crushing your enemeis with bloody victories, plotting againts other feudals to climb up over feudal pyramid or using marriages as a weapon and spreading your noble blood over Europe like once famous Habsburgs did. Other features of the game like dilomacy or battles lack strategical depth but they are enough to entertain players with supporting main gameplay. Do not expect Total War style battles or EU type complex diplomacy. This game is all about dreaming and feeling the moment as a ruler and leader of a dynasty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4933290">Expand</a></span>

The sheer potential for fun is overwhelming, ex that you control a realm with your dynasty either one already in the game, who has a lot of historical families, or one that you have created yourself.
<br>Given the time Paradox Interactive have used on developing the game with several patches and expansions, the core game have become gradually better. They have created a solid base for future PI games, which did not disappoint with the release of Europa Universalis IV, where they learned from the inputs they got from the player base.  I think that a lot of the big developers could learn from PI, just because they are so good at communicating with their fans.
<br>
<br>There is of cause also negatives in the game, like bugs and chrashes, but it is so rare in my case that it never have been a problem to talk about. There is some problems with the tutorial part of the game, which is executed poorly, but PI have tried to improve on it. But if you feel it still is not enough, then look CK II up on Youtube, there are many very good explanation videos on the game.
<br>
<br>All that said, CK II is a bloody good game, and it deserves all the praise it gets.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3792383">Expand</a></span>

After hundreds of hours of playing I remember how difficult the learning curve was when I began - this being my first paradox game at the time -  slowly figuring out the little nuances that made starting as a small feudal noble and slowly building my family and lands so ultimately satisfying.

The buildup never gets old and the gambles for growth make this an excellent venue for its &apos;ironman&apos; mode. I can&apos;t recommend this title enough times over. While the europa series has a lot to offer I can&apos;t help but keep coming back to this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4809840">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been a games addict ever since. I especially like strategy games. I&apos;m crap when its all about twitch mechanics but give me time to think about it and I&#x2019;ll kick your ass. I love the empire building games where the goal is to build something epic not destroy yet another level boss. Everything from the first Civ games through The X series (shame about Rebirth) and everything in between. I played Europa universalis and although I enjoyed it, it didn&apos;t have the re-playability for me. Rush to the New World and if you get there first game over. So I never bought CK2 until just a fortnight ago when there wasn&apos;t much else happening on steam.
<br>In the fortnight it has took me to get a grip on the mechanics of this game I have to say I wish I had bought it on release. I thought there wasn&apos;t much else that could be done with strategy games. Thought I&#x2019;d seen it all, just variations on a theme was all that I&apos;m likely to see. But this is something completely left field. Its so different. The depth and complexity is both daunting and exhilarating. Its like peeling an onion. You think you have a grasp then all of a sudden you uncover a whole new level of complexity that makes everything you though you knew redundant and opens up new range of possible winning tactics and many time more possible failure modes. I have lost count of how many times I have restarted a game when something critical to winning/losing riddled its way into my game plan. I&apos;ve never actually played more than 100 years in this game but I&apos;m already dangerously addicted to it. I&apos;ve even booked a full week of work to grapple with the more advanced strategies and spend half my day at work reading info on the forums.
<br>Nothing since the first Civilisation games has done this to me. and possible you even then. I&apos;m not sure if I should be happy I found a brilliant, deep, complex, mind expanding game of worried I might have grabbed a tiger by the tail.
<br>It&#x2019;s a shame that undoubtedly a lot of people will spend maybe a day trying to understand this game and give up. If that&#x2019;s is you take it from me a day isn&apos;t nearly long enough and however long it takes it will be worth it. Just don&#x2019;t plan on doing anything productive for the rest of you life ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5135456">Expand</a></span>

But once i tried the demo i was completely amazed. It&apos;s one of the most exciting games i have played in years! It is also quite hard at first because there is so many things to do and keep in mind. It does get easier once you get used to it. The best part of the game is the endless replay value. You can play the same dynasty for countless times over and over again and still have new and fun things to do with it. I also like that it is different from other strategy games which tend to be very generic and rarely offer something new or different. This game concentrates on building your dynasty instead of country like in most of the strategy games. So it&apos;s not your average &quot;whack-a-mole&quot; strategy game where you pick a country and then go on a conquering spree in order to make the whole world part of your realm but rather a very immense strategy-rpg combination where balance and micro-managing your family, courtiers and vassal is important. You  have to plan your conquests very carefully or you end up having your entire family murdered by jealous vassals or other family members who want to have their share of the pie.<br><br>Unlike most of Paradox releases this one works flawlessly from the start. I have played it for 2 days almost without a break and i haven&apos;t encountered a single bug.<br>I have played most of Paradox games and i can easily say that this is the best one yet. I can see myself playing Crusader Kings II for years to come, and usually i get bored rather soon.<br><br>A must buy for every strategy lover.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2143349">Expand</a></span>

If diplomacy, strategic marriages and intrigue are your thing then buy this game, it&apos;s worth it.</span>

Most games get dull and boring after a few hours or maybe a day or two but this game just keeps on giving and there&apos;s something new discovered just about everytime I play. Of course it&apos;s not perfect but it does deserve a 10 compare to the cheese crap that has been coming out getting 9&apos;s and 9&apos;5&apos;s. This should be game of the year and at least strategy game of the year. If you don&apos;t have or get this game in your library then you are just a fool.

It&apos;s big, complex, and detailed. Once you get the hang of it you can chug through rather nicely. For me, the game fails miserably when it comes to a King/Queen dying. Historically, you didn&apos;t see wars stop due to a death or rebellions pop up after every death. In CK2 however, all aggressive expansions immediately halt upon death and rebellions are far too common from the ensuing loss of stability. Tends to create  boring dead zones of time where you can&apos;t really do much other than wait for loyalty to solidify to expand again. It&apos;s just tedious and boring rather than challenging and entertaining. Really frustrating when you get unlucky and run through multiple rulers in a short time frame. Overall the game isn&apos;t bad and is worth grabbing if you&apos;re into complex strat games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3192142">Expand</a></span>

CKII is a slow-paced niche strategy game designed for scheming Machiavellis, not a game that will please the Red-Bull-chugging BF3 crowd. The game is a lot more polished at release than most Paradox titles. It&apos;s also one of the deepest, with a great internal politics system that makes conquering new land an option rather than a requirement for an interesting game session. It&apos;s graphics are among the best Paradox has released, and its system of unique portraits and character traits makes each character -from the highest emperor to the lowliest baron- a unique human being with his or her own personality and motives: rather than playing as an abstract country or a colour on the map, you play as a person and their dynasty. This makes the game unique (in a good way) from any other grand strategy game I know of.<br><br>The only con is the poor buggy multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2143575">Expand</a></span>

Your ruler will have to use everything at their disposal to maintain the peace in their realm while still holding off the masses at the gate just waiting to rule your lands.<br><br>This game takes a drastically different approach to empire management from other games where in other games you are normally a supreme ruler, your word is law and everyone follows almost perfectly. In this game, you are simply the current ruler of your realm. Your vassals, court, and even family have their own goals, often working against your own. Expect to see your own dukes vying to knock your family off to take the crown for themselves, your court angling to assassinate the right person at the right time to get them land to rule, and even your family to plot against you to take your throne. It is not uncommon for a player sitting as the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire to be knocked down to simply holding a county.

I am generally not a fan of the genera, though found myself really enjoying this game. I would like to see a more through tutorial and a better description as to what is happening in the game. I found myself often confused as to if I was wining or not. Recommendation: Get this game. I brought it on a whim to introduce me into grand strategy type games and I was not dissapointed. Be warned, its a political / social simulator, so do not expect explosions and you will not be dissapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2154263">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not easy to get into and initially I found the amount of things I had to remember daunting.  But the music and game play draw you in.  Hours are soon gone and lessons learned.

<br>Long story short, do the tutorials or you&apos;ll regret it, unless you&apos;ve played similar games in the past. Also this isn&apos;t a Total War game, the battles are simple, the complexity is in the way you manage your duchy, kingdom etc, and dealing with all the different characters in it. It&apos;s a fun and addicting game once you get into it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2155934">Expand</a></span>

If your looking for some challenging strategy games, this game really suits you, it&apos;s one of those game you must buy! Moreover, the game have some serious success in the game engine. Graphics are up to date, beautiful for a strategy game and it also fixed the lagging problem happened in Victoria 2, which was a pain in the ass! Even I massed 30k armies with my France, I still don&apos;t get any lag like from Victoria 2 ( Who played VC II will understand ), this is a great success, without the epic lag , I can fully enjoy Paradox&apos;s new game, Great kudos to Paradox!    Though it&apos;s great, I won&apos;t give a max score cause there&apos;s place to improve. I think paradox can add a little mixture between total war series and their series. Not only we can see troops fighting on flat lands on the map, I suggest we can actually command it during an epic battle, like total war, Which will push the game to a whole new level. Just a suggestion, but hope it&apos;s useful. Anyway great game, 8 for graphics, 9 for game-play , 9.5 for non-lag situation , 9.5 for great system. Overall 9/10 for the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2150712">Expand</a></span>

At the beginning i had really a hard time. i never had played a paradox game in my life and this was my first. But when you learn the game you will have a blast. This game is for no kids or teenagers. This game is for the grown!</span>

Very deep, complex and satisfying gameplay. Although it might be hard to learn for a casual gamer, anyone who spends the time will be greatly rewarded. Also strategy veterans will not be dissapointed as the game delivers on almost all fronts.<br><br>(9/10) SOUND: Music is epic (especially with the DLCs), but it does get annoying rather quickly so most will mute the music. Almost like with the graphics the sounds gets the job done well, it will not be winning any awards though.<br><br>(10/10) REPLAYABILITY: This one has a lot of potential to be replayed over and over and over again....<br><br>CONCLUSION: Get this game now if you love strategy, consider getting this game if you think you love strategy and contemplate about getting this if you like history, middle-ages, crusades and most of all being a ruler in a virtual world!<br><br>This game is one of a kind and I strongly recommend it to any shall I say &quot;mature&quot; gamers who prefer real games instead of flashy Michael Bay type gaming trendy nowadays.
