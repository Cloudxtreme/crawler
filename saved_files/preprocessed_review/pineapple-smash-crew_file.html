The game&apos;s core mechanics involves grenades. When you level up via collecting experience cubes found in boxes, you get to choose between two random grenades. Each time you play through and each time you level up, your choices for grenades will be different. The mechanic for grenades involves throwing it, then detonating it afterwards. Some grenades require you to aim them, others might give you an advantage instead of harming the enemy, etc. Although beating the game takes only a couple of hours, the fact that all levels are randomly generated adds to the replayability. Each time you beat a level, you get to pick from a set of 3-5 other levels. You can pick only the easiest levels to breeze through or only the hardest for a challenge. If one of your mercenaries dies, you get a new, lower level merc at the end. The game punishes you by losing not by completely ending the game, but by making it harder to progress. On the level where that merc died, you will lose one grenade slot as well as the firepower he provided. Furthermore, your new merc will start at level 0, making him weak and therefore more likely to die. It is also worth mentioning that not only is this game made by a single person (alias: RickMakeGame) but it is also his debut game in the indie setting. The soundtrack is also amazing. All in all, since it&apos;s only 9.99$ on Steam, I highly recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pineapple-smash-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=2126147">Expand</a></span>

Aside from that, the gameplay is very smooth, Syphus made a solid soundtrack, and the game is generally well done. There is a leveling-up system as well. I&apos;m surprised the critic reviews were less favorable, but I highly recommend this to those who enjoy arcade-style shooters, or retro games like Gauntlet.</span>

For now, i guess it&apos;s hardly worth the price..  Only if you&apos;re retro games fan, you&apos;ll find it amusing.   Conclusion - 7/10. This grade is a bit too high, because i love the concept... But i believe it will be updated and totally worth it.

<br>The dynamics in the game work, the game is pleasing to play, and the gun play and weapons work together surprisingly well to create an engaging and rewarding top down shooter from the 16 bit era which is fast and  frantic(As another reviewer rightfully describes it as).  The Music is also excellent.
<br>For what this game is, it is really good!
<br>
<br>A couple of let downs are in the game design, but these are not really an issue as the main game has plenty to bring to the table to make an engaging and pleasant (and not too time consuming(compare &apos;turn based strategy&apos; as the opposite as a &apos;time consuming experience&apos;)) experience.
<br>
<br>Graphics = 7 :
<br>For an indie game, this does look very pleasing. It looks like a Snes version of the 16bit era game &quot;Phantasy Star 2&quot; as a top down shooter rather than a RPG... Though there could be a little more variation, perhaps my criticism stems from game design rather than Anything else( i.e Most of the game is in a ship of some type); it&apos;s pretty decent though for what it is.
<br>
<br>Sound = 7 :
<br>Sounds are ok and do the job, nothing more. However, it doesn&apos;t sound unfinished either, its decent.
<br>
<br>Music = 10 :
<br>Cyphus is a legend for a reason , I could crack this on my mp3 player with other electronica and perhaps metal I listen to...
<br>
<br>Game-play = 10 :
<br>This is a simple but very effective and addictive game(When you have gotten into it). I would say 8 but it feels nice and a pleasure to play for starters : i.e. 8, however, you cannot ignore how well the simpler mechanics come together to make this a great experience (i.e. the maps, the timing system, the mobs(and there are quite a lot of them) and the weapon types(simple as they are, they work well together).
<br>
<br>Its also worth mentioning that the Game difficulty appears to offer a challenge in the later hours of play. Simple changes in various dynamics have created a decent challenge that keeps the game engaging and does not allow you to play the same game you played on easy. Good Game-play is why I play games!
<br>
<br>I will add that my opinion stems from wanting to play the game that Pineapple Smash Crew  has presented to me: the idea of running through massive levels and trying to keep my team alive before the radiation leak starts, to me works well with the flow of the game: the weapons and fighting, as well as the navigation; and this is why I enjoyed it.
<br>
<br>Game design = 6 :
<br>This works, go into ship then leave, go into then ship leave. However, a lot more could have been done and it seems like the developer left out some content and I can understand that to some people that some levels seem &apos;Samey&apos;. I personally think that I cant say the game suffers too much...
<br>
<br>However, If it set out to do more than it did for an indie development then this would be a real Gem that beats AAA releases. But Ambitiousness could have has left the dev feeling bewildered and it disallowed them to complete their plan.
<br>
<br>Retrospective of this though, the dev chose wisely to make a game that had a few solid and well done elements, rather than making a larger game with many mediocre elements  (which it is not).whcih I will add is very much like many industry games are like  today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pineapple-smash-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=5648420">Expand</a></span>

The controls are really tight and the visuals have a retro look that doesn&apos;t seem like the kind that&apos;s simply an excuse for poor quality. The gameplay mechanics work well and the variety in grenades is quite good. Not to mention that they are fun as hell to use! Some of my only gripes with this game are ones that are pretty big. For one the variety of missions is really poor and the environments can feel very samey after the first two or three hours into it. And while the mission objectives are mixed up with random boss encounters, there&apos;s almost no variety in boss design as I&apos;ve dumped at least four hours into this game and have only found that they only have very slight differences I.E: recolours and more guns strapped onto them. But for the price of 10$ on steam, I&apos;d say that this is a very complete and fun package and I&apos;d recommend buying it for fans of top down shooter and roguelike fans alike.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pineapple-smash-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=3099046">Expand</a></span>
