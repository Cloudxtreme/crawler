<br>Reviews are subjective matter.
<br>First of all, I am a big fan of movie 300 and Spartacus tv Show, so it is natural that i find this game desirable.
<br>From the moment it started, when i saw  the first scene i knew that i would like it.
<br>Graphics as expected are sky high when the game comes form Crytek. Production is very very rich, level design in aesthetic not so much in functional way is astonishing throughout  the whole game. Atmosphere is very rich and sound and acting are incredible. Very immersing experience. In moment when commander Vitallion comes to Marius and says that hi will provide him a lot of cinematic slow-mo combo that produces a lot of blood  and gore and tones of dead barbarians behind him, i knew that i would be a true Roman ;))
<br>Another thing are animations and armor phyzics while Marius is moving and lip sync is incredible.
<br>Now i know that all those pluses that i mention are regarding the form not the matter, but that combat was not so bad after all, reviewers were too harsh, than every now and then it breaks the pace with formations and managing scorpions and giving orders to archers.
<br>I found story interesting enough, even if predictive I was thrilled.
<br>And to mention , this gorgeous game ran on my gtx 770 2 gb without supersampling almost all the time in 60fps while preety ugly ( comparing to this )The Evil Within gives me the hick ups.
<br>I give this game 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4602194">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you think QTE is repetitive, well you can say the same for any Hack and Slash game out there, or any shooter where you are just mowing down stuff all day with guns. People using the repetitive excuse in these reviews are just lazy reviewers repeating the critics main grips. At least make your own observations people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4602333">Expand</a></span>

Great combat but it gets a bit repetitive but it is so great looking that you would still look at those animations a thousand times. For a sequel we would need more variation in combat without ruining the great feedback and power of each blow and more enemies 3d models.</span>

<br>i guess if the developer make it more serious like they did with Crysis, it would boom and loved even more.</span>

<br>First of all, you have to realize that most negative scores are based on the fact that the game is extremely short. I finished it in 2 evenings - so I played for 6 hours maybe. If you take the price of the game and its length then the score is quite reasonable. My review, however, focuses only on gameplay and it&apos;s AWESOME! If you like the times of ancient Rome and slicing your opponents this is the game for you. I love actions games and taking a break from BF4 to play such a gem was really nice. Let&apos;s be honest, there isn&apos;t any other game where you could be a Roman soldier apart from i.e. Total War, which is a different genre. It puzzles me however, why the game is so short, why you can&apos;t walk (you almost always run), why you can&apos;t kill silently and why the creators didn&apos;t develop it further. Because of that, it seems as if the product was not finished. They could have gone so much further, because the world of ancient Rome they created is beautiful. I will never forget the feeling I had when I first saw Colosseum - absolutely stunning! Unfortunately, you don&apos;t get much chance to admire the views because everything happens too fast. Also, slicing your opponents becomes boring quite quickly. A player has no choice over his actions and there is no stealth option whatsoever.
<br>
<br>All in all, Crytek created a beautiful game, which is definitely too short. If they developed it further, created alternative choices of events, enabled stealth kills, using tactics and an open world it would be 10/10 for me. (Personally, I would like to see all the elements from Shadow of Mordor combined in Ryse - then it would be perfect.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4615751">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a game which voice acting and video dialogue impressed me the most. It&apos;s a kind of game that I am looking for; a Roman epic war action game. Hope there&apos;s more of this games
<br>
<br>but,
<br>Though I really like the combat system, yes it&apos;s lacking originality of combat, but it&apos;s still good, but It&apos;s repetitive game play really wears me off. A game that offers it&apos;s players different pace will surely be a Win. And that&apos;s what this game didn&apos;t have. I was hoping this game would feature a camp or base or whatever where you can manage your equipment and choose a region that you are hoping to seize.
<br>
<br>But in the End, it&apos;s just an action game that plays one way story that doesn&apos;t offer much decision making that actually affect the outcome at some stage of the game.
<br>
<br>I applaud the story, think It Is good for Roman setting game, and quite epic at that. I don&apos;t get the impression of so-called god of war wannabe and 300, It&apos;s purely a Roman story that topped with very few mythical stuff. That&apos;s what I like in this game.
<br>
<br>And thank the developers that this game can be beaten in just half a day, so we don&apos;t have to endure the repetitive yet focus consuming game play too long to reveal the Great Story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4768787">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s so much things going right that you are almost temped to ignore what the game does bad. But then it becomes impossible to do so, since the mechanics just keep on getting in the way and spoiling the good stuff. The graphics are simple amazing, not only by the polygon count and shining armours, but because adding to that you have an amazing level of attention given to detail. Animations are very good and facial animations are as close to perfection as they can be. And the story, while not ground breaking, is good enough and well structured. The acting is also surprisingly good. But forget if you think you&apos;ll be given time to enjoy any of this, because by some obscure reason the developers though it would be important to constantly push you forward and even when it&apos;s not the game it self that is pushing you it is the context it self that pushes you at the cost of breaking immersion for not doing so. And the disastrous rhythm makes damage everywhere. Level design it&apos;s not perfect, just OK, but add to it the constant rush and you will be hitting walls, stands and everything around you trying to meet the urgency the game ask of you.
<br>
<br>The much criticised combat system falls in the same mistakes. But let me just point one thing. If you listen someone saying this is just a button masher, you can for sure know that that person never played the game. The combat has some complexity and it offers enough diversity to keep it challenging and diverse. But... again the game ruins it with the rhythm that imposes. Plus some tweaks would in did be good. A midway between this and Dark Souls, with the needed lower pace, would push this game to a whole new level.
<br>
<br>Ryse it&apos;s an OK game. It lacks in many aspects and excels in some. Sadly the bad is so bad that it annihilates the good. This is a prime example of a game made without passion and heart. A game that tries so hard to offer entertainment that ends up leading you to a general feeling of boredom and indifference.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4814787">Expand</a></span>

Similar to a blockbuster movie it doesn&apos;t hurt to just get on with it and enjoy a piece of entertainment for what it is.
<br>
<br>After the first few levels you have seen every mechanic there is to discover in this game anyway. And the longer the game goes the more you feel like a passenger, a means to an end for the game to play out in front of you. You are being reduced at many points to just hit one of two buttons at the right time for the animation in front of you to play on. At that point the game might as well play itself. Almost out of worry you as a player could be in the way of how this story needs to unfold.
<br>
<br>It looks great. It has great animations. Good cut sequences. But it is so very simple and repetitive.
<br>I say good for a rainy Sunday when you feel the itch to just play something without really having to invest in much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4589781">Expand</a></span>

<br>Ryse does look fantastic but the combat is extremely repetitive, shallow and tiresome in time. The story is  reasonable but the gameplay is desperately lacking and linear. It feels like this game was designed more as a technology showcase for the Xbox One as opposed to delivering an engrossing title on a grand scale.
<br>
<br>On the XB1, Ryse was an welcome game for many thanks largely to a lack of titles available on the system but for PC gamers; it&apos;s nothing more than an average hack and slash. At a price of &#xA3;34.99, this is far too expensive to justify a purchase now and even at a dramatically lower cost down the line; I&apos;d still struggle to justify paying money as there is always a better title out there on the Steam Store.
<br>
<br>With Shadow of Mordor already out and games like Dragon Age: Inquisition and AC Unity on the horizon; Ryse will sink to the genre abyss, so save your money for these or something else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4583452">Expand</a></span>

Pick up and play carnage is only fun for so long and they capture that  length well. The game benefits immensely from the locations and themes in this game. A few interesting twists and a good story. Worth a play through. It has the feel of an Uncharted game. A rollercoaster that lets you ride the tracks, you may fall out but you hop right back in where you left it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4580406">Expand</a></span>

The intense shaking of the my virtual hero has provided me that. Mindless animations, thousands similar looking attackers, permanently identical text passages about honor and Rome raises this computer game to the most boring game which I have bought for a long time. My 4 points are for wonderful to amazing scenarios, the high degree of details and light effects.  I feel sorry for the programmers who have created this wonderful atmosphere for this game. the landscape and equipment programmers have really given close to everything possible, the rest is not worth roughly his salary. Whoever likes monotonous processes doesn&apos;t prefer any excellent action and would like to strike on final opponents for hours, he may buy &quot;Ryse, son of Rome&quot;. All the others should save the money because better games soon will come out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4587446">Expand</a></span>

And not only beautiful, but detailed, animated and presented. Everything is dynamic, lighting is awesome, level design and architecture are perfect work of art. Running the game maxed out on a GTX970 is pure orgasm. The gameplay is admittedly simple, but still thigh and reactive. The shield wall formation portions are something new and very nice, but for the rest I agree it&apos;s missing some diversity. The finisher moves executions are probably the worst part of the game. While the animations are very nice and diverse, the slow-motion/stop others enemies from moving and press the correct corresponding color button get old very fast. This is the only reason why the game did not get 10/10. If this is a glance of what the future of video game is, things are looking quite bright ahead!
<br>
<br>I&apos;m disappointed at the current low score this game have, gamers seriously don&apos;t know what&apos;s good for them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4644830">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But despite all of this, it is still a pretty funny experience. The graphics are impossible to improve and surprisingly well optimized, character animations achieved with motion capture are a delight to watch and the art direction recreates an spectacularly beautiful ancient Rome. The hard difficulty mode is pretty chalenging and I liked to call it &quot;the realist mode&quot; because you can get killed with just 2-3 hits of a sword.
<br>
<br>The story is pretty entertaining too, the characters have a lot of personality and the voice acting is excellent. Although some people complained about the length of the game, I felt it was just fine.
<br>
<br>Finally, the multiplayer in a game like this is always welcomed!
<br>
<br>If you are a fan of action games, probably you want to wait for this to reduce its price. If you like Roman odysseys and want to have a good, although not unforgettable experience, then you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4601412">Expand</a></span>

Since it is Roman soldier with sword and shield he can&apos;t do much more what he already does in this game. Story and graphics are amazing and gameplay is good. Campaign is too short and there is none re-play value. I would suggest to buy this on sale, but not for full price.</span>

GTA, Assasin, Max, Oblivion...any game out there is REPETITIVE!!!

Difference is - what game makes it feel great.

Well, this game sure does.

Visuals are superb in all manner - from pure techical detail to visual style and art in general!

Audio is excellent.

Gameplay, yes...it is</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">What I don&apos;t like is when game is getting bashed for being repetitive...

<br>
<br>Audio is excellent.
<br>
<br>Gameplay, yes...it is repetitive...but then it feels so great and it is intuitive and overwhelming.
<br>
<br>Action and story is on par with every blockbuster out there.
<br>
<br>ONLY thing that could be better, in my opinion, is skill trees and execution upgrade. Feels kinda irrelevant.
<br>
<br>Oh yes, and &quot;on the fly&quot; booster selection is awesome gimmick.
<br>
<br>ALL IN ALL.
<br>
<br>This is a great title that deserves much more credit.
<br>
<br>Especially when some hyped titles get great scores they do not deserve.
<br>
<br>This is a good step forward in gaming history!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4587337">Expand</a></span>

An hour into this game and I was already bored with the combat mechanics and it didn&apos;t really improve from there. Then I noticed my progress.. 11% completion, already?
<br>
<br>Every enemy in the game seems to be recycled over and over again, sometimes you are even fighting 2 or 3 guys simultaneously that are just clones. Its extremely linear as well, so there is really no exploration to this, you&apos;re just kind of pushed through the hall completing tasks the way they want you to.
<br>
<br>This game would be best experienced as a rental, as you will most likely do, and see everything it has to offer in 1 or 2 days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4749151">Expand</a></span>

People do say that Ryse is repetitive but are not all the other games repetitive? E.G shooting enemies in different maps. People are annoyed because of short campaign but like all of the crytek games have short campaigns.</span>

Quick cash grab, without any depth or original ideas. They even didn&apos;t bother with a decent story, instead the mashed together some ideas from Gladiator the movie and some historic inaccurate **** into a an headache inducing mess.

<br>that said, the game actually DOES look great on PC! it&apos;s like all professional publications say/write, it looks quite gorgeous.
<br>BUT, I remember a time - and it is not as long ago as one might believe - when graphic quality alone asured a game a rating in the 60-70 range!
<br>
<br>to be honest, I really wish this game had more to offer... I wish it had ANYTHING to offer, but after completing the game about 50%, there has not, unfortunately.
<br>
<br>10 years ago, RYSE Son of Rome would have gotten reviews in the range between 40-50 - as it deserves.
<br>but, nowadays, you can put in nicely crafted models and textures and get away with a rating between 60 and 79(!).
<br>
<br>it&apos;s really disgraceful! not the game alone...well, that too, but I meant the developers not putting a second thought into everything GAMEPLAY!
<br>that, and, OF COURSE, lacking honesty from all major publications and critics.
<br>
<br>then again, after seeing how the professional critics PRAISED &quot;Bioshock Infinite&quot; as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, slapping their 100/100 ratings on it, blinding even consumers into repeating all their marketing garbage, I should have understood that all a game needs nowadays are decent graphics, a fine promotion team behind it and LOTS OF MONEY TO PAY SAID CRITICS for their &quot;professional opinion&quot;.
<br>see, that&apos;s how &quot;Ryse: Son of Rome&quot; has gotten it&apos;s 60-79 reviews, instead of those 40-50 points reviews it actually deserves!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796807">Expand</a></span>

The story is interesting, the action is really immersive and intense and the soundtrack really sets the mood.

<br>
<br>Sure, this game is no masterpiece, but it is one of the best on its genre. You don&apos;t do much, just hack and slash increasingly more difficult enemies, and proceed to the next corridor. But 99% of the modern AAA games are similar, yet no one complains. How come God of War can get stellar reviews and this was buried by the same reviewers? Same on you, &quot;professionals&quot;.
<br>
<br>This game is a 8/10, giving it a 10 to counter the retards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=6690165">Expand</a></span>

I won&apos;t touch history and credibility, this is a fantasy game, like the Gladiator movie, it has nothing to do with reality - and that would have been the slightest of errors.
<br>It came out since a week ago and we have 2 updates for it, but it is still buggy a hell. Sometimes it just loses controll - Marius stands there, he can&apos;t figh/roll just go around and take blows... If it is a techdemo, buggy as it is, it&apos;s not a miracle that nobody buys the bl..dy engine and Crytek goes bankrupt.
<br>Controls are non-existent: sometimes you have to hit the key 2-3 times, so mr. Marius moves/jumps/fights. Ridiculous. By the time he moves, he got hit 2 times from any boss. Did Crytek care about making this playable? We are in 2014.
<br>BTW you can&apos;t skip movie sequences, you have to replay 5-10 mins from the last checkpoint, so you don&apos;t even want to discover or look around (what kind of techdemo is this?), because you might die. You just focus on going ahead.
<br>Your &quot;soldiers&quot; just stand there watching, while you fight. They don&apos;t free the prisoners or help, just shout. Believable :)
<br>Every boss can be killed in one way only and the game tells you how to do it. So you walk in a tube the whole game, then you kill even the boss with one trick (and these boss fights are damn boring, a chore - any of the devs played Arkham city? No? They should have...). So much about creativity. As I&apos;ve told you: an empty tech demo.
<br>No way you can take serious a &quot;game&quot; like this, so I gave it a 2, seriously...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4607775">Expand</a></span>

For that money I got around 7 hours gameplay for singleplayer campaign. And that I think is what one should expect from the game: simle action game to play instead of going for a movie.
<br>
<br>The game features superb graphics I caught myself looking at some of the vistas for some time. It a dynamic combat system based on attacks and executions similar to games like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor or - to some extent - Dying Light. But the comparison ends there as Ryse does not have the sandbox mode that the aforementioned games have.
<br>
<br>In general the gameplay is smooth and fun on PC and I would consider it as a good port. You cannot map controls but since you really only need 7 keys (four movement keys, dodg, block and execute) the standard WSAD + LShift + E + Space worked fine for me.
<br>
<br>So all in all given the low price of EUR 5, Ryse was a good purchase for me and I recommend it to anybody who loves this type of game. However I can totally understand people who bought the game for full price rating it lower or even giving it sub 5 rating if their expectations were much higher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=6235784">Expand</a></span>

<br>Oh.. Combat is just a bunch of minigames and button pressing. Booo!!! DIdn&apos;t the developers look at any good games before they made those? It is ported poorly as well. Like i said, the frame rate doesn&apos;t hold up. I guess adjusting the engine for PC took too long so they had to release it as-is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4790355">Expand</a></span>

<br>Alt+F4 also doesn&apos;t seem to work, because after 20 minutes of dealing with clunky controls, poorly implemented commands and repetitive combat I was about done.
<br>
<br>I just finished playing Shadow of Mordor before picking this game up and man is it hard to go from one game in the genre that is so much better to one that was clearly not even QAed. Go play Shadow of Mordor it is way fun and the combat is slick, unlike this clunky piece of garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4951389">Expand</a></span>

On the other hand it is a little bit too violent and I think this is making the game to departure from reality NOT to get close of it. Worth to give it a try. (75/100 for me)</span>

<br>Unfortunately this game suffers from a mundane story-line, and utterly monotonous combat. Saved from being a complete disaster are the graphics and voice acting.</span>

<br>
<br>Visually it&apos;s absolutely spectacular, it very much left me in awe on the same level as The Order 1886 did. The in-game facial expressions are the best I&apos;ve ever seen, when you&apos;re fighting enemies you can see the fear in their eyes, and the pain on their face as you kill them, it&apos;s really amazing. The cut scenes are also really well done, and the little cinematics are great as well but I would have liked more of them.
<br>
<br>To go along with the top notch visuals the audio is also really top tier, with quality voice work throughout. The characters are really brought to life by these exceptional performances and the whole game feels like a well made film that you&apos;re directing.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise it&apos;s solid as well, you have your standard weak attack, strong attack, block and dodge. What makes the combat so great are the slow motion execute moves, they&apos;re absolutely brutal with limbs flying off all over the place, and swords being plunged where they shouldn&apos;t be plunged. They&apos;re glorified QTE&apos;s with the enemies glowing either yellow (y) or blue (x) but you don&apos;t care because they&apos;re so satisfying. There&apos;s a unique mechanic where you can gain either health, XP, focus or damage when performing an execute move depending on which one you select (can be changed freely with the D-pad if you use a controller).
<br>
<br>The one area the game falls is the performance, it&apos;s not optimised well at all. I spent a lot of time on Google trying to find fixes and optimal settings and even when using them the game still dropped frames fairly often, massively so in a couple of areas. It was not uncommon to go from 100fps to 20 - 30fps for a split second. I managed to mostly eliminate these huge drops with a little tweaking, but nothing I did removed the small dips.
<br>
<br>The next time this is on sale I would highly recommend buying it, it&apos;s only 6 - 7 hours worth of content so bear that in mind, it&apos;s maybe not worth &#xA3;25 but it&apos;s definitely worth the &#xA3;8 I paid for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=5563097">Expand</a></span>

Also there haven&apos;t been many story-driven games set in ancient Rome, and there certainly haven&apos;t been any action games. Playing a Roman soldiers feels incredible, especially with the perfectly presented combat system that does show us exactly how Romans fought.
<br>
<br>This is where the positives pretty much end, though. The game is EXTREMELY repetitive. There are only 4 types of enemies, and we have to blow through thousands of them over the game. There are not enough moves to make up for that. You can&apos;t exactly do any complicated chains like in DMC or God of War, the combat system is pretty much reactionary, there&apos;s hardly any room for player&apos;s creativity. Boss fights are also very uninspired, bosses are simply glorified mobs of a specific type (Boudica is a typical dual wielding enemy, Commodus is a shield enemy, and so on), the only difference being that they are stronger.
<br>
<br>The game is also very, very short. It lasted me around 6 hours, and that was on the highest difficulty.
<br>
<br>40 euro price tag is almost literally a scam for a game like this. Stay away until the price drops to ~10 euros, the game is worth that much, unless you don&apos;t care about your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4616365">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Personally I didn&apos;t like the game due to repetition, Shadow of Mordor was released prior to the PC version of Son of Rome and after playing such a wonderful game Ryse was a hard one to enjoy. The main reason of purchase though is that Crysis developed the game and as everyone knows they are great at creating demanding benchmark tool games.</span>

                                        <span>I liked the story and it was very fun, however the combat was boring and repetitive. I didn&apos;t like the involvement of the gods, and it wasn&apos;t very realistic. The graphics were unmatchable and very easily handled by even a low-end PC. The characters had a lot of depth and history, and the mythology was great. All in all, I thought it was an average game.</span>

The script looks like the Hollywood&apos;s film. Good slasher and interesting as well.I don&apos;t understand people who write that the game has bad gameplay, short, etc. Can&apos;t, just can&apos;t put this game lower than 10.</span>

So be sure to have a powerful computer because it&apos;s hard to run.....maybe the porting is not optimized....I can play &quot;wolfenstein the new orders&quot; without problem for example but Ryse give me trouble....with a low frame rate this game is unplayable (becasuse it mess with gameplay timing) and part of the fun lies in the visual effects</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=6026942">Expand</a></span>

All that may be kind of true, but, this game was not made with the purpose of giving awesome combat, immersive open world or history lessons; this tgame is not even a game, is a film about a DIFFERENT Rome in which you can interact. Yes the Emperor is called Nero and Boudica existed, but apart from that everithing is part of another reality (Armors, characters, elephants in Britain, legend of Damocles...). I really enjoyed the game and its plot, full of great interpretations, good cutscenes and better dialogues.
<br>It has also some cons though, almost all the enmies look the same, there&apos;s very few variation on their looks, and the fact that you cannot customize the controls is quite annoying. To sum up , if you play this game dont expect too much liberty or historical accuracy, you&apos;re playing a fiction film!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=6307781">Expand</a></span>

You will see high-quality textures, good lighting, etc. I was amazed with quality, really. Moreover, there&apos;s an interesting plot and pretty good gameplay. Recommended, but remind that it&apos;s only for one completing.</span>

They expect some miracles in the field of combat which is anyway pretty good. Story line its interesting and graphics are beautiful although FPS drops happens so thats -1 from the perfect 10. Its a good SLASHER game.</span>

<br>
<br>Some things I really liked:
<br>- Graphics
<br>- Plot (Although it could have been better)
<br>- Characters are vivid and you feel identified with them
<br>- Gameplay: Exterminations and Tactic oriented combat was interesting.
<br>
<br>I was not appealed by:
<br>- Skill systems and upgrades: Feels somehow short
<br>- The collection systems: Picking up scrolls and the likes did not add aggregate value to me.
<br>- For some the game combat can become repetitive.
<br>
<br>I would definitely give the game an 8/10. Enjoyed it a lot!
<br>
<br>I did not try the multiplayer, so cannot comment on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=6901258">Expand</a></span>

This is definitely worth a try if you didn&apos;t play it Xbox One yet. My only complaints about this game and the reason why i gave it an average score is the simple fact that your weapons and armor are not upgrade-able. I wish i was able to upgrade weapons and armor would&apos;ve made my grind throughout this game a lot more satisfying but other than the look of your weapons and armor that changes the more you progress in the story there&apos;s no feature for that. I love the kill moves and if your pc is capable of running this there&apos;s not too much lag in the fps department. I did notice on my less powerful laptop that the lag was bad but not enough to get me to stop playing. Another problem i have with this game is that the story is too short. I wish i was able to experience more in this world. I love ancient Rome and wish i was able to spend more of the story in the Arena (Coliseum). Just to keep it short get the game bro. If not wait until its on sale on steam or something it&apos;s definitely worth a try. I did have some personal issues with the game and felt like the story would&apos;ve benefited a lot more if it had to deal with greece and the 300 spartans story or somewhere along the line of the Persian war. Or maybe the trojan war.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618583">Expand</a></span>

While I must give credit for the character development and intriguing story essentially what this games ends up being is no more than a repetitive hack and slash game where repeating the same attacks numerous times to ultimately work towards an execution , which you will mind numbingly do so many times, it becomes unbearable.

It does suffer from a few camera problems and the upgrades you get are somewhat lackluster.  It did a really good job making you feel like a bad a** roman leader as you command your troops forward.  It is a solid 7 that was worth the price I paid on the steam sale.</span>

<br>When I first started this game, I was already amazed by the power of CRYENGINE, I&apos;ve always known the engine&apos;s capabilities and it&apos;s reputation, but Ryse: Son of Rome looked visually absolutely stunning! The animations, camera movements, lighting..everything felt lifelike, which gave me an immersed feeling while playing. The combat however was a little repetitive, though the executions looked awesome and had a 300-like style, it felt very repetitive because of the same way you have to deal with enemies and the same way you kill them over and over again, this game is very focused on it&apos;s combat but I think that could&apos;ve been done better. The story however is a big plus for me, I always get attracted to games with a good story and this is certainly one of them, I agree however that some characters could&apos;ve been better developed as in that we know very little of them while we&apos;d like to know more. Aside from that the overall storyline was really great and felt like I was truly a Roman. The only thing I do not like is the fact that everything is linear and scripted, no dynamic changes into the story or environment. Would&apos;ve loved to explore more of Rome in this game, especially with those stunning visuals.
<br>
<br>Pro&apos;s:
<br>
<br>Beautiful environments powered by the stunning visuals and audio of CRYENGINE
<br>Amazing storyline
<br>Lifelike and immersive cinematics and cutscenes
<br>Time setting and location
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>Repetitive combat
<br>Short campaign (would&apos;ve liked to see more)
<br>Undeveloped characters
<br>Everything is linear and scripted
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>
<br>Ryse: Son of Rome is certainly a game worth playing with stunning looking visuals and lifelike cutscenes &amp; cinematics. The story is very good with the feel of being an actual Roman, though the campaign is very short and linear, it is very enjoyable as well. The combat feels a bit repetitive and not much variety in both enemies and kill actions. I would recommend this game for people who love the Roman history, along with some action, a good story and amazing visuals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=7274979">Expand</a></span>

There is NO interaction between all these except for animations. There are no interesting combos at all.
<br>Then you have a button for executions that at first are pretty cool, they start a minigame and the animations are well handled, but after an hour of repeating them it gets sort of annoying.
<br>
<br>The plot is as clich&#xE9; as it gets. A warrior that is blessed by the gods to fight for honour and justice and overcomes entire legions of barbarians (which by the way, defeated the Roman empire so there&apos;s that) without much difficulty. It is influenced literally in its entirety by Hollywood with that &quot;hero&quot; stereotype and I could even say which movies they copied scenes from.
<br>
<br>Historically wise, while not being that important, this game **** on the Roman empire. I know it&apos;s just a game, but if you&apos;re gonna make a game about Romans, at least learn how they did things.
<br>
<br>Graphically it&apos;s pretty okay. It&apos;s not that amazing, it just has pretty textures on the models of your character and enemies. Not that it needs anything else but it&apos;s not anything special.
<br>
<br>I got this game for 5&#x20AC; during a sale and I don&apos;t regret it cause of the price, I had an okay time (got bored in a few stages) but I don&apos;t see this game being worth more than 30 bucks, and I don&apos;t see myself replaying it ever again in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=6300734">Expand</a></span>

<br>Surely not a bad game, maybe even a nice game except a couple of flaws. Short campaign, takes roughly 8 - 9 hours to complete. Combat system is cool, no doubt. However; there are -only and only - 5 or 6 enemy types and plus execution animations - QTE order are limited. So naturaly gets repetitive after 2 - 3 hours of gameplay. Online multiplayer co-op (arena, round to round and survival) is nice to play, if you can match a player to play with, that is... Last words: Great graphics (assuming you have a gaming pc), nice looking scenes and cinematic cut-scenes, good but repetitive combat, not bad but short main story, cool but &quot;low population&quot; co-op online mode. I recommend to play and hope to have fun, just not expect some deep, rich game mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=4702381">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I was very reluctant to buy this game because of the bad reviews, but it paid off. The gameplay is amazing and extremely fun. I would of given it a higher score if there was more diversity in the enemy&apos;s, a longer story, and more content such as more customizable weapons and armor. But I highly recommend this game.</span>

<br>What&apos;s to like:
<br>+ The graphics for sure. If you have a killer rig and want an awesome-looking game to showcase your hardware, this is your game. The developers didn&apos;t phone in the backdrops, either: the vistas are huge, the backdrops extensive. The undergrowth in Britain is deep, detailed and lush. The water looks like real water, not shiny, shifting, reflective plastic. Character detail is superb, though facial animations still look just a bit stiff.
<br>+ The voice acting is great, and carries the game at many points. Everyone delivers a superb performance (player-character Marius and npc Vitallion are both stand-outs).
<br>+ The story has emotional impact, though if you&apos;re at all a fan of the time-period, the careless mixing of old and new legends will probably annoy instead of satisfy. Still, it&apos;s enough to keep you moving forward.
<br>+ The soundtrack is a decent emulation of Zimmer&apos;s Gladiator score (not surprising).
<br>+ The combat is slick and swift, and easy for newcomers.
<br>+ A lot of effort clearly went into designing the two-player co-operative multiplayer; there are at least a dozen maps and four game modes. It&apos;s a lot of fun to team up with someone and slay enemies in the arena, but matchmaking is not that good at the moment, if a match can be found at all.
<br>+ Well-optimized (for Radeon, anyway). In an era of increasingly shoddy PC ports, Ryse ran great on my moderate hardware (A10 6800k + 2GB R7 260X); I averaged around 50fps @1080p Medium settings.
<br>
<br>And now, the not-so-awesome stuff.
<br>- Linear as heck. Rome may look awesome in the distance, but you can&apos;t go there.
<br>- While the story works, even the slightest bit of historical research will reveal there is nothing even approaching &#x201C;accuracy&#x201D;. If you were hoping for a cool Roman-era hack&apos;n slash, you&apos;ll get it. Historically accurate? Nope. Just a mix of the cool stuff.
<br>- No real large-scale payoff to the story. Marius has closure, no question. But the larger implications &#x2013; including that he was somehow an instrument of the gods &#x2013; are never addressed. We just get these god-figures who appear at the end (and are glimpsed throughout) with some decent speeches about purpose, rules, and Rome, and that&apos;s it.
<br>- Combat is limited and repetitive. Hack, slash, shield-bash, repeat. Maybe dodge here and there. It definitely bored me by the sixth chapter (out of eight). A missed opportunity to maybe dual-wield swords, or have a spear and shield, but nope. A sword and shield the entire game.
<br>- Staying with combat for a minute, finishing moves are a QTE-fest. I don&apos;t mean every few minutes; every other second you&apos;re performing some kind of QTE. I suppose this was easier than programming more complicated forms of combat.
<br>- I loved some of the contextual battle choices &#x2013; where to deploy your archers, advancing on a line of archers in the testudo formation. But these are under-used, and offer little variation.
<br>- Upgrade skills are ridiculously cheap. I&apos;ve played enough of the Batman Arkham games to be able to string together a 35-hit combo without much trouble. A big enough combo and correctly-completed QTEs grants tons of &#x201C;honor&#x201D; points that are used to level up. If the game were harder, upgrading would have meant more...
<br>- ...perhaps. Aside from new execution animations, the upgrades didn&apos;t seem to have much effect.
<br>
<br>Ryse: Son of Rome is a linear hack&apos;n slash that will satisfy in short bursts, but anyone looking for deep gameplay and any customization will be disappointed. The potential is there to be something truly great, but sadly that potential remains unrealized.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ryse-son-of-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=6494971">Expand</a></span>
