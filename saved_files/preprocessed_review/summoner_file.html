I look upon the ratings that were given for this game and I feel possessed with contempt. This game was very poorly thought-out considering its slew of bugs, but that isn&apos;t saying much considering THQ&apos;s history of pathetic games; the one exception I would say is &quot;Wrestlemania 2000,&quot; a shocker to say the least. Getting back to Summoner, the fact that the fighting engine was pretty much &apos;jacked&apos; from &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; and the intro music sounding very familiar to &quot;Unreal Tournament&apos;s&quot; intro casts some doubt to THQ&apos;s sense of originality and any semblance of creativity. To make a long critique short, I would urge anyone who would consider buying this game to think long and hard. Why not check out something else worth your while, like &quot;Diablo II&quot; or any other Blizzard game? </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/summoner/user-reviews?user_review_id=370389">Expand</a></span>

The graphics were nice for the time, the quests interesting and varied, and the fights challenging. What however breaks the game on PC is that the camera and the character control system. The camera will always try to move by itself as your character moves around, picking strange angles and mostly positioning itself at the side of the character instead of behind him. You give movement orders by clicking on the ground like in an RTS game, but since the camera is constantly moving, it gets very clumsy. So, the controls can be a deal-breaker for most PC gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/summoner/user-reviews?user_review_id=5873149">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>The game in my eyes was very well done as the glitches can be bypassed by regular saves.  Then the story line is well done and though the sequel Summoner 2 was less impressive in my eyes.  The A I was horrible for allies but could be very useful when used as a benefit.  Also who cares if they took something from another game such as fight method.  If it works it works.</span>
