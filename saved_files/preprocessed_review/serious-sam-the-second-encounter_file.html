While it is old school run and gun, and can be played without much thinking, its definitely much brainless , and there wont be difficulty spikes and that much chaos if you&apos;ll actually develop some tactics to how to deal with the enemy in different situations.
<br>And its definitely not a maze game with shooting in it like Doom or Duke Nukem!
<br>
<br>You&apos;d think a game that simply based around running and shooting is just a generic FPS (or TPS, the game also has 3rd person perspective), but the only game I can think of that does the same is Will Rock (no, not Painkiller).
<br>
<br>In those games (I&apos;ll talk about the whole franchise, even though SSII and SS3:BFE did few mistakes here and there), every enemy has its own basic movement, attack, sound, the enemies can come from any direction, at any time, in any amount, and theres usually more then one kind of enemy coming at you at once, and it all matters to figure how to move, what guns to use and who should you deal with first,  but theres no enemies that require specific weapons to deal with, and the game never tells you what exactly to do all the time, so theres many ways to go through each levels, sometimes even brainlessly running forward  and shooting everything that moves with your strongest weapons, but that will get you killed a lot and thats the reason people think the game is too chaotic, they don&apos;t think enough.
<br>
<br>Going through levels experimenting with different tactics, or simply blowing **** up on lower difficulty or with cheats, together with secrets, the game counting how long it took you to pass every level and how many monsters you killed, and also all the mods the community keeps making, give the Serious Sam games lots of replayability.
<br>
<br>And the various levels with always great graphics for its time, that in this franchise never looks dated like some other games of its time, with a great and one of my favorite soundtracks (that helps in gameplay by changing when monsters appear) never gets old!
<br>Just don&apos;t expect any story. It has one, but its not the focus of the games.
<br>
<br>Serious Sam, with The Second Encounter considered by many as the best in the franchise (and for good reasons) is one of the best pure Shooters out there, and my all time favorite! Obviously 10/10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-the-second-encounter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3938157">Expand</a></span>

There might be that AVP2 game and Starship Troopers, but they&apos;re not games like Serious Sam: Second Encounter at all. Serious Sam is all about absurd comedy and not being serious at all. It&apos;s almost like the game is being sarcastic to you all the time. Leave your brains at the door, they are irrelevant. Just blow your way through enemies, collect artifacts and get out. The game&apos;s got some inventivity on the worlds, which makes it a lot more interesting than always wadeing through the same texture while on a linear railway. You know what games I&apos;m talking about. If Serious Sam: Second Encounter isn&apos;t an FPS classic, I don&apos;t know what is. Nine for NUMBING action.

<br>
<br>This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a &#x201C;feel&#x201D; for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.
<br>
<br>The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no &#x201C;half&#x201D; or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.
<br>
<br>The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.
<br>
<br>Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, if a game has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a &#x201C;feature quota&#x201D;. Games that excel in both areas of a section don&#x2019;t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section
<br>
<br>The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; section. This section is for how the reviewer &#x201C;feels&#x201D; about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-the-second-encounter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797121">Expand</a></span>
