While Quake pushed the limit to what shooters in 3d had been, Jedi Knight made the 3d shooter. It was the first game to make real use of 3d space, and bind it so lovingly to the dark, nitty-gritty, space epic of Star Wars novels from authors like Timothy Zhan. Jedi Knight was the first major FPS to expand the horizons of gameplay as well, with RPG like elements as you developed your force talents based on your style of gameplay. While the live-action cutscenes are a bit corny, they do a good job conveying the epic storyline that harkens back to the Seven Samurai, except this time the Samurai are evil, and Kyle Katarn must face everyone to get to the man who is responsible for his father&apos;s death. Will Kyle remain pure during his quest for justice? Or will the Dark Side corrupt him...the path is up to the player. While the graphics did not hold up well throughout the years, the gameplay still is fast, and the music and sound are spot on--perhaps moreso than even modern shooters. Even 12 years from its launch I would say the 5 dollars on Steam are well spent with this classic gem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=740562">Expand</a></span>

An engaging and lengthy single player campaign along with the at-the-time groundbreaking multiplayer: the first time gamers got to duel with lightsabers; made DF2: JK a classic.

We encountered the exact same problem that the reviewer encountered and we also could not complete the game. Very frustrating. I actually called activision support and they claimed it was due to not fully completing the &quot;side missions&quot; or not in the right order. Unfortunately, they could not be more specific. Also, it appears that if you do encounter this problem, the only option is the start the game over. Again, very frustrating especially for a 7 year old. As this game is really more oriented to the younger crowd, I would ask game makers (if they are reading these types of reviews) to try to build in better hints, etc. so the game can be completed. It could even be a setup option so that older, more experienced gamers can opt out. Aside from this BIG issue, my son loved playing the game very much and it suited his age/skill level quite well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1144230">Expand</a></span>

Of course, Lucasarts support was better then, and trying to get the Steam version to work CORRECTLY is a nightmare. I hope Lucasarts is happy, they just lost another customer, who WILL NOT be purchasing from them ever again.</span>

Another negative review is the AI, oh btw, there is an AI ? but let sforget bad reviews, for the time, it was an awsome game, a long game , you will be captivated by the story, it was the first game that YOU decide what you do and your actions, with powerfull powers of the force, this is reccomended to all star wars fans, or begginer. This game will still forever in my memory for the captivating story and the best star wars game ive played, memorable.....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=743977">Expand</a></span>

Fantastic action, story, sound, music, controls, and one of the first FPS&apos;s that had a great character development system as well. Jedi Knight is of the same ilk as other standout FPS/RPGs System Shock 2 and Deus Ex, and is probably just as enjoyable on many levels. It&apos;s a game that makes me disappointed more like it aren&apos;t being made these days.</span>

Back in my days of dial-up internet connections, this and Team Fortress Classic were the only two games that I could play online. Released the same year as Half-Life, I have always felt as though Jedi Knight was just as far ahead of its time with many gameplay and storyline innovations. The story is advanced through live-action cutscenes, making for a movie-like experience (granted with soap-opera-level acting). It featured multiple endings based on force powers used and decisions made throughout the game. It also made significant contributions to Star Wars&apos; Expanded Universe, which include the first use of dual-wielded lightsabers outside of Star Wars comics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2285337">Expand</a></span>

The game still plays remarkably well today. The levels are vast (although the textures are occasionally bland) and the design captures the overall look and feel of the Star Wars universe. However, it wouldn&apos;t be until the next game, Jedi Outcast, that this series would truly &quot;nail&quot; the experience of being a Jedi. The force power system is a bit clunky in this game, the lightsaber glow doesn&apos;t look quite right and the full motion video sequences have aged very poorly. An improvement over the last entry and an interesting stepping stone towards the next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4667338">Expand</a></span>

At this point, the graphics and game-play are a bit dated, so it can be tough for newer players to get into this one without the nostalgic sentiment that allow older players to enjoy this game, but definitely recommended for die hard Star Wars gamers.</span>

The score for this game is contemporaneous as today it would struggle to score 1. The graphics are abominable by today&apos;s standards. However the innovation and range of enemies and weapons is something modern game designers could take ideas from. The cutscenes and plot and both excellent and you can end up playing for 6-8 hours without a break. However despite this game being available for next to nothing on GOG or Steam please do not buy this game. It had a fantastic run but let it rest in peace... unless Disney want to do a remastered edition... please?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7232002">Expand</a></span>
