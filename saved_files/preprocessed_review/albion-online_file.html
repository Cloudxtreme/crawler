I was looking forward to it for years and on face value it appears to be a dream come true, but once you get into it you realize it&apos;s not what it seems.
<br>There is no storyline, no lore. A &quot;sandbox&quot; with no quests and little content. The game is linear with repetitive cycles of gather, craft &amp; gank. You&#x2019;re either gathering and being ganked or joining a big guild and ganking.
<br>Think early 2000 style, very grindy, and while it has the graphics, it lacks the content/innovation of oldschool games. There is no sand in the box and the game is lacklustre. Worse still there is a large imbalance across all weapons/armor (there are no classes). If you pick a &quot;wrong&quot; weapon you get kicked from groups who&#x2019;d rather have somebody with better X or Y due to their item picks. Obviously, this is high impact due to the grindy nature of the game.
<br>There are lots of newbie traps such as building your personal island in any town but Caerleon, but the game ends up pushing you to the Outlands (the gank zones) so everybody lives in the Red City (Caerleon) rendering your island essentially worthless, extortionate silver fees must be paid for you to travel back to it.
<br>All the maps are copy &amp; pasted (literally identical but higher/lower tier) and are also very small. The small nature of the zones leads to constant ganking and losing everything once in the higher tier zones. There is nowhere to hide and nothing to explore.
<br>Due to design, loading screens are experienced every few minutes which really kills immersion for me. FIVE loading screens are endured just to enter the city and repair, bank, buy more food and leave again.
<br>There are lots of performance issues with their infrastructure, they used to blame DDoS attacks but now that many players have quit it happens less frequently but is still very much occuring. Additionally, all the servers are hosted in the USA. Everybody outside the USA has high latency problems that the developers outright admit they don&apos;t see as a problem and won&apos;t change. Rubberbanding during prime-time hours is a big killer for me as it&apos;s the only time I can play after work. It makes you unable to run from gank squads because you teleport back to where you were 10 seconds ago and die, losing everything.
<br>Some people like to grind, myself included, I have played MMO&apos;s for well over a decade but I picked a &quot;wrong&quot; weapon and now after 200+ hours of grind I just don&apos;t have it in me to start over.
<br>Honestly, the game now feels like a money grab. You buy to play (the account), pay to play (you need premium status per month, per char) and you can also pay to win (directly buying ingame gold/silver with a credit card and you can achieve max level crafting in a single day).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7525713">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Game design forces everyone into zerg style play(in the +1 mentality, where overwhelming numbers is more important than any semblance of skills) not just in the fight mechanics, but the hoards of guild slaves needed to finance the extremely high costs of the guild leader&apos;s gear in the 5v5s.  However, the game architecture can&apos;t even handle the zerg vs zerg is forces everyone into and it turns into a laggy mess with disconnects any time people try to engage in how the developers purportedly designed the game to be played instead of solo or in small groups(which the CEO of the company said the game was not made for) that the game consistently punishes you for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7619327">Expand</a></span>

There is not much content for small groups of friends. End game maps are dominated by large guilds. Lack of PvE content as well (Though it is a PvP game). Devs keep restarting the server but keeps losing hours of save data. One day had over 5 restarts and rollbacks. They also by default allow any guild member to take your items on your farm. Prior to joining a new guild, I changed the default setting so only I had access to my island but a rollback reverted this change without me knowing. When I joined the new guild, someone came and stole all my horses which were very expensive. Devs won&apos;t even tell me who did it. Losing time and resources because of server issues is so frustrating. Devs have been very slow in dealing with exploits. In 2 weeks there has been at least 4 exploits and none of it fixed though in their fairness they did say they&apos;ll ban anyone doing 2 of the exploits but it is still possible to do them.
<br>
<br>On top of that, their support is abysmal. If you lose resources due to any exploits abused by other players, they will tell you tough luck they don&apos;t want to do anything to affect the economy even though the situation originated from their lack of insight. If you lose resources due to server issues, they will tell you tough luck we don&apos;t have the logs to verify what you lost. This includes losing premium currency! Anyone who had converted premium currency to silver prior to a forced server reset/rollback will lose both the premium currency and silver when they log back on.  You would assume any good support will restore either the silver or premium currency but they won&apos;t. They&apos;ll say they don&apos;t have the logs. What!?! I can understand if you don&apos;t have the logs if someone lost what they gathered but for PREMIUM CURRENCY? I&apos;m just glad I only lost $5 of premium currency...others have lost over $50. Game concept while cool has been executed poorly. Overall experience has not been great with Albion Online.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7441416">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s been in beta for countless years but even after all that testing they decide to change the game last minute and completely break it for launch.  Not to mention that the economy and gameplay mechanics are completely broken with only band-aid fix after band-aid fix that only overcompensates and creates more issues than it fixes.  Not to mention due to poor design and infrastructure they were completely unprepared for launch populations and their only hope is that enough people quit after constant lag, black screen, and disconnects that it will get to a player population they can actually handle.  There is very little content even for a &quot;sandbox&quot; game and even the bare bones content is only really accessible as a large zerg.  To call this game a sandbox is a misnomer because the only viable play style is large zerg guild because every game mechanic is geared towards it.  I wish I could get a refund of the time and money spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7468444">Expand</a></span>

Player housing is a joke - you get an island which is an instance not part of the world where you can build or grow stuff on predefined plots. Game has no anti-cheat implemented, so game is plagued with zoom- and speed- hackers of all kinds. All in all it is a pay to play game that feels like open beta for a free to play game.
<br>
<br>On gameplay side - everything is broken as well - full loot system is nice, but implementation is horrible - trashing more valuable items upon death. Game can&apos;t handle massive pvp - lagging so much that nobody can move - killing all massive pvp objectives - like castles or boss fights.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7459147">Expand</a></span>

<br>- server restart multiple times with losing if in-game items
<br>- every time 1 hour server maintenance
<br>- lags in towns
<br>- 0 Points because of loosing progress after every Server restart, sometimes more then one hour</span>

<br>
<br>But the main problem is that the whole aspect of the game is flawed. The combat is too simplistic. It isn&apos;t really a sandbox, rather a bunch of copy pasted maps that are a little different in some areas with portals/loading screens in every entrance/exit. The PvP which in concept is a decent idea but is extremely flawed, you will just end up getting zerged by 10+ players of the same guild if you are a solo player. Once you hit t4 you come to the realization that this game is ONLY meant to be played with a group of people/a guild. This game is NOT solo friendly. At the end of it all the staff seems quick to ban people for unspecified reasons, especially from Discord and in game, reports of people with mass amounts of gold being banned, and the ultimate refusal by Bercilak to separate the ONE server into more servers/shards to fix these issues makes this a huge disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7451336">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros
<br>-Moderately interesting sandbox features, (CON) but slow being taken away.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Poorly managed, so much so they must have Trion thrilled that someone might actually make Trion look good.
<br>-Unstable and given comments by the management they have no real way of fixing it, they have hit limitation on their infrastructure. The CEO even posted about there being &quot;too many&quot; players. They seem to be on a strategy of waiting until enough players give up and go away to finally be stable.
<br>-In-game economy is a shambles, gold sellers, bots everywhere and for some bizarre reason the devs leave the server running for a few players while thousands are unable to connect.
<br>-Seven or eight server crashes per day, along with questionable &quot;DDoS&quot; attacks that just happen to occur during peak logins for various regions. This related to the scaling issue listed above.
<br>-Lag, regardless of where you are.
<br>-Missing iOS client which was a part of their marketing strategy and from reading the forums the Android client is bad at best.
<br>
<br>Buyer beware on this one!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7461385">Expand</a></span>

Yet the game has a badly designed reputation system that kills all small scale or meaningful pvp throughout most of the world and has a single server for everyone on earth to play on, meaning your moba combat will suffer high pings from most locations in the world.

<br>The game is also grind heavy. This would not be a huge issue if the game was actually a sandbox and offered you things other than gathering to do as you do the lengthy progression grind to be viable for pvp.

<br>Conclusion: Game has many good ideas, devs failed to deliver then in a meaningful way.

There are numerous issues that impact every aspect of every day game play, and updates just don&apos;t happen.  It is my hope that the developer&apos;s will realize how badly they&apos;ve burned their supporters and relaunch a good version of Albion, but the current state of the game is simply not it.
<br>
<br>Among the issues there is one in particular that stands out, and that is the Mobile development of the game.  Everything released needs to cater to this very small demographic, and really holds the game back from what it really should be.  There are numerous quality of life features missing from the game ranging from things as minor as guild management all the way to broken npc exploits that seriously impact high level dungeons.
<br>
<br>I, and many others are simply tired of fighting the games systems in order to play it.  Around every corner lurks a nasty bug or poorly programmed feature just waiting to cause trouble and make the average player loose hours just because things weren&apos;t programmed properly.
<br>
<br>In 2017 there is no excuse for a competitive MMO to not have weekly balance updates and community involvement, and Albion has neither.  Updates come in huge packages that take Months to put together.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll make this perfectly clear.  If you are looking for a game is worth your time and money look elsewhere.  This is specifically hard for me to say, as a long time supporter of the game both verbally and financially.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7512665">Expand</a></span>

<br>They market the game as being playable on android devices, but it&apos;s not actually possible to play the game at all.  It&apos;s so overcrowded that my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 crashes in cities.  Outside of cities, the framerate is awful and the game is unplayable.
<br>
<br>Technical issues aside, this game was made with groups in mind.  If you&apos;re a solo player, prepare to constantly run into large groups of players who will kill you.  I don&apos;t think it would be so bad to play as a solo player, but the overpopulation is so bad that you really can&apos;t go anywhere without running into people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7423901">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>yeah, I invested in the legendary founders pack, because the game promised the moon.. and delivered absolute dog feces heaped on a plate with an extra large spoon for you to eat with.
<br>
<br>The whole game was SUPPOSED to be a &quot;true successor&quot; to Ultima Online era gameplay.  Work the tradeskills, build your town, etc etc etc.
<br>
<br>What you GET is graphics that make DOOM 2 look **** Futuristic, craptastic paywalls that practically cock slap your ever move, and then there&apos;s the biggest hot dong in the eye...
<br>
<br>the &quot;personal island&quot; is the biggest **** joke Ive ever seen in a video game.  Ever.  Like EVER.  You put dozens of hours farming mundane and boring materials to upgrade your &quot;house&quot; which starts as a 1 room shack about 4 steps wide.
<br>
<br>The final &quot;upgrade&apos; to your home.. which you&apos;ve now sunk DOZENS of hours into building... is a 1 room **** shack about 6 steps wide.
<br>
<br>Your shops?  Oh yeah... more mundane farming for them too... only you cant actually USE them.. cause they get &quot;hungry&quot; and you have to &quot;feed&quot; them in order to get them to work, same as the shops in town.  Did I mention food is so scarce due to the games design that its literally the single most expensive item in the game?  I dropped over 1 MILLION silver coins on the cheapest food &quot;Carrot soup&quot;... i ended up with over 1,000 servers of it.. should have been PLENTY right?  Nope.  It gave 1 merchant a grand total of 4% fed.
<br>
<br>Towns are the same way.. you cant use any of the shops to refine your stuff you just spent HOURS farming up.. because the shop owners cant afford to feed them, and/or there&apos;s no food to be found.
<br>
<br>The &quot;content&quot; is a giant joke too.. mainly, there isnt any.  No, that&apos;s not a joke.  Im being serious.
<br>
<br>&quot;Endgame&quot; (and I use that term loosely) is nothing but pvp, and pvp is nothing but zerg rushing a smaller zerg rush than you and hoping you can win.  Even THIS could have been fun.. but in this company&apos;s infinite wisdom (re- mental retardation.) they decided the ENTIRE game is all point and click.  No keyboard movement.. point and click.. because lazy ass game design is lazy.  Just picture a giant massive pile of players.. all swarming around... in the center is the healer.. but you cant tab target him.. you cant type target him.. you have to click him.. while moving, as he&apos;s moving, in a giant zerg pile, and then you have to KEEP clicking him to use your powers.  If you havent already bashed your face off a wall..
<br>
<br>Then theirs (of course) the REAL purpose of the game.. buying gold for real life cash.  THAT works flawlessly.  On all platforms.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s IF you can even login.. as the server is a total ****show atm.  At one point, I was #3,845 in the Que... estimated wait time.. 3 DAYS to login.
<br>
<br>And FInally..   the chat.  Oh sweet lord in heaven the CHAT.  You thought (insert game here) had a toxic community??  You know nothing.  At one point.. they were openly discussing killing and raping small children.  I asked if a GM was around.  Surprisingly, one sent me an actual tell!  When I asked wtf was going on, I got told .. and now Im QUOTING here... &quot;The chat is kinda a free for all, unless its hate speech or personal violence threats, we dont do anything.&quot;
<br>
<br>I literally have no words to describe my level of dumbfounded disgust I felt at that moment.
<br>
<br>If you go to the Albion forums.. I put a post up there.. in which I described pretty much everything I just did here..  including the chat conversation (and relevant screenshots as proof.)
<br>
<br>They EDITED MY POST TO REMOVE the pics of the discussion in open chat, and removed my discussion of it from my post... claiming it was &quot;Against the rules&quot; to &quot;discuss such things on the forums.&quot;
<br>
<br>Well THANK GOD everyone!  We cant discuss raping and murdering children on the FORUMS.. but in the game.. go for it and have a great day... dont forget to buy some gold from the eshop.. carrot soup aint cheap ****
<br>
<br>I could go on and on.. but I wont.. because the longer i type about this ripoff video game abortion.. the more I get angry about wasting $100 that I could have spent having my taint waxed with a rusty spork by a midget prostitute.

There is no palce for solo players, coz everyone running in huge packs, so lets move to this big pvp fights.. and all u get than is huge lag, when everyone spam aoe spells, to cause even bigger lags. So.. no pvp in this game, u can only die solo or die from lag in big fights. Solo ganking is impossible coz of recent changes of 3 seconds delay in possibility to atack some1 ofter u dismount, they only chance to get solo fight is if other person wants to fight too. So u can only gather and be almost always safe while doing it. Lets move on, gate camps and portal camps everywhere, coz of failed map designs. Oh and ofc failed balance on items, some of weapons are totaly useless and some are superior over other kinds. After 2 or 3 weeks of playing this game i havent found anything good, and frustration from rollbacks and server crashes made me quit it, and i wont go back there, i highly suggest to save your money on anything else, u can even burn your money in trash can, it will be same as bying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7468491">Expand</a></span>

It basically is a grind, with the rewards for grinding consisting of unlocking new grinds.
<br>
<br>The other issues have to do with the server populations (too small), the game performance (not very good and terrible in locations with many players) and the world design (causes people to all bunch up in very few places).
<br>
<br>I like that players make everything and that stuff doesn&apos;t magically move around, although I do think the new player experience would improve if that point was somehow made clear to new players. If you&apos;re having stereotypical &quot;get me n of x&quot;-NPC&apos;s anyway, why not use their missions to actually teach players about the world and pointing at some of the stuff they will not get right away, but will be wondering about how to get.
<br>
<br>It very much feels like an alpha-stage game right now, even though it has quite a bit of time on it already and people are paying full price. The lack of a business model that fits with the current incentives to play the game doesn&apos;t give me high hopes for the longevity of Albion Online.
<br>
<br>If you enjoy a grind, don&apos;t mind a glitchy experience in towns, like the cartoonish art style (I do actually) and like the pioneering sense of a new game, even though you have to pay - go for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7452216">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>3. You can transmute materials up to tier 8.3 by buying materials of lower tier.
<br>
<br>4. You can re-buy equipment you loose and not care. It means that if you kill a &quot;non&quot; P2W player they will have to grind to get the silver to reimburse their loss. P2W player just flashes their credit card and &quot;oh noes I lost my T 8.3&quot;. No biggie for them they can either buy it again or transmute (see point no.3) and craft it again (see point no .1).
<br>
<br>5. You can buy &quot;pies&quot; (or pay money to get to craft them) and get extra gathering fame, due to extra gathering yield, by using the highest tier pie all the time. (The average player, like me, will not be able to afford to do that, nor will they be able to use or craft them as fast as someone who paid to get to T8 cooking skill.)
<br>
<br>6. Whales can buy artifact tier gear at all times to increase fame girding efficiency for the appropriate tier.
<br>
<br>7. Whales can insta buy T8 islands.
<br>
<br>8. Whales can have unlimited premium accounts with multiple shared islands using farms / laborers.
<br>
<br>9. Whales in a guild can equip all their friends using the above benefits.
<br>
<br>At this point in the game don&apos;t give the &quot;Buhht they can&apos;t use it!&quot; Because even if they can&apos;t right now, any whale will eventually be able to use T8 of at least one weapon and armour type. Also any whale will be able to farm up tiers faster and more efficiantly than a regular player (see point 6.)
<br>
<br>Always remember:
<br>
<br>Whales do not care about how much money they spend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7481314">Expand</a></span>

Research &quot;Albion banned account&quot;.

With that said, in the Pay to Play game there is a subscription and they are selling gold! Can you imagine the extent of greed? You buy the game, then you have to pay a premium subscription fee unless you want a daily chore instead of a game, on top of it they are selling gold in the game shop. This is ridiculous! On top of it the game is lagging like hell for more than 3 weeks already, there been like more than 3 attempts to fix it already but not much changed to be honest. EU players get 5x ping the US players have. I can go on and on with the flaws, starting from primitive game design, world design in particular (it&apos;s just a bunch of bonded together instances). 5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7494148">Expand</a></span>

Dungeons and raids can be fun. Red and Black zones are risky to be in, but make the game challenging and fun.
<br>
<br>Cons:    What is keeping Albion from being a 10 star even though I am a current subscriber? Well, it is easy to get &quot;burned out&quot; on the grind of Albion. The game is missing something for the player base to do while not leveling something up. (Quests, battlegrounds, story, npc interactions, etc.) The social side of the game is also lacking. There is no point of a friends list or list of players of any sort since you can not easily invite them to a group or anything. Everything you wish to invite a player, you have the manually enter their name each time. (This can get tiring and irritating for people with hard names).
<br>
<br>Right now, the game is boring as hell for solo players. If you want a guild based game, this is the best one. If you want something to play on your own, this is the worst one for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7508624">Expand</a></span>

Yellow and Red will lead to a reputation loss, but with no big impact. Killing 4 Peaople in Red i had 2000 -Repuation, but you will get 1000 Reputation back every day automatically. you are just marked as &quot;dangerous&quot;......sounds fair to me. If i want PvP without Reputation loss, i can go for Ganking (flagged) Squads in red or yellow, or directly go to black where everything is possible without consequences.
<br>
<br>This is no Solo game, even small guilds will struggle to progress further than T4, so you have to collaborate. So this is something you like or not...but you should know this before buying the game.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t like the mobile part of the game and you should not buy the game if you want to play mobile only. Mobile is more of an gimmick for people brwosing the Auction House or doing their Farming stuff on their island. But obviously not for PvP or PvE. They dont even promote this game as mobile game anymore AFAIK.
<br>
<br>To Complain about overpopulation on launch day is just childish. I think the Servers run &quot;OK&quot; now for that fact that there are sometimes nearly tousand players in one Map. Yesterday i Had a Warcamp Fight with ~250&quot; more or less Lag-free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7435482">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It aims to be a sandbox full loot MMOG, and it manages to get that feeling of dread, when you&apos;re traversing enemy zones with your guild and the tension is palpable, everyone in silence, tending their ears and their eyes wherever danger might hide. Never, since the first days of WoW, have I found a game that I really could play from dusk until dawn without getting bored.
<br>
<br>The game has a lot of content: Guild vs Guild fights (in the forms of 5v5, 10v10, and Zerg v Zerg), instanced and overworld dungeons, world bosses, weekly events and yet more.
<br>
<br>Gathering resources to craft your/others equipment is satisfying and well animated, as much as buying and selling from city to city, exploting the gold market and the many other ways to make an economic difference in the world.
<br>
<br>There is the possibility to get territory for your guild and an island for yourself, building structures like farms, houses, storage, crafters and more.
<br>
<br>The world is divided in 4 zones: Blue Zones, where PvP is disabled, know exactly how many people are there and only low tier resources spawn; Yellow zones, where you can flag yourself for PvP, know exactly how many flagged are there and drop money on death; Red Zones, where you can flag yourself for PvP, know exactly how many flagged are there and drop everything on death, and can find high tier resources; Black Zones, where you are always flagged for PvP, don&apos;t know how many players are there, can find very high tier resources with improved spawn rates and drop everything on death.
<br>
<br>So, you see that the game has potential, and that&apos;s where the 9 comes from. However, there are several flaws right now that might hamper its development;
<br>
<br>for example, the server is just one for the whole world, and while the zone system helps distribute players, sometimes you find yourself in the unenviable position of having to wait for someone to leave the zone you want to go, to enter. The territories are currently owned by the biggest alliances there are, leaving the smaller guilds to either compete between themselves or to try to face manpower well beyond their handlig capacity. The frequent restarts and the daily maintenance are frustrating in their own right, even more when they come suddenly with 5 minutes warning.
<br>
<br>If the devs at Sandbox Games manage to solve these problems, then we have a brilliant game, with a bright future; if they&apos;re not up to the task...well, I fear that this game will be dead by November. We just need to wait and see where this goes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7439546">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I wasn&apos;t around for the development drama, but this game is a breath of fresh air. It&apos;s a call back to old school MMOs where there were consequences. The grinds not too bad, the combat is tight and feels good, and the guild aspects are there. They need to improve on the maps overall, but really I&apos;m enjoying the game and see myself playing for the coming months.</span>

If</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Albion online all around pretty much sucks!  The game claims to be a
<br>sandbox type game but yet they force the same people that want to
<br>craft and do gathering into PVP zones in order to be able to
<br>gather those materials.
<br>
<br>What the clueless developers of Albion Online don&apos;t seem to
<br>understand is that not everyone wants to PVP and some of us are
<br>just happy gathering and crafting.
<br>
<br>If it was a true sandbox game then the players  should not
<br>be forced into PVP and all materials from tier 1 to tier 8 should
<br>be able to be gathered outside of PVP zones and they should not
<br>force the players into PVP areas if they do not want to go there.
<br>
<br>Basically all this game turns into is another giant gank fest
<br>where once you get past tier 4 materials for crafting anyone
<br>that wants to do crafting gets ganked repeatedly over and over
<br>again by teams of gank squads who roam around the zones.
<br>There are 8 different tiers of materials you can get
<br>up to tier 8.
<br>
<br>Also the servers seem to be pretty piss poorly run too you
<br>will be running around a zone collecting materials
<br>then boom all of a sudden you are logged out of the game and
<br>you have to log back in again.
<br>
<br>There are no connection issues on my side what so ever I
<br>can go do everything else just fine. It is on the server side.
<br>
<br>Or I have had a few times where I could not even connect
<br>to their login server to be able to log into the server
<br>again it isn&apos;t my connection it is on the server side
<br>I could surf and do everything else normally except
<br>connect to the game.
<br>
<br>The servers are over crowded with 13 year old kids masturbating
<br>every time they kill a crafter and steal their stuff.
<br>
<br>The game is also full of bots as well out gathering materials
<br>and you do a /report on the bot and nothing gets
<br>done about it seems the admins of this game don&apos;t give a ****
<br>as long as they get your money.
<br>
<br>This is absolutely the worst &quot;Sandbox&quot; game I have ever seen.
<br>I use the term &quot;sandbox&quot; lightly for this game
<br>because really it isn&apos;t because a true sandbox game would not
<br>force a person who wants to craft to go into PVP zones to get
<br>materials and you should be able to just craft all the way
<br>up if you wish without having to do PVP.
<br>
<br>Albion online got the whole open world PVP concept totally wrong.

Customer service on this game is rude and uncaring and they
really don&apos;t give a ****.

The game is NOT free either I saw some sites advertising the
this game is free to play it is not you have to buy a
&quot;starter pack&quot; which ranges anywhere from $29.95 USD (Veteran)
up to $99.95 USD (Legendary) and then after that you can
purchase a &quot;premium&quot; to be able to keep other perks
in the game and pay a monthly fee of $9.95 USD a month.
This game is in NO way free to play!

Avoid this game at all costs the player base is toxic and
rude and just full of ****

<br>- Rubberbanding during prime hours months after release despite &gt; 75% of population gone. This is the only time I can play after work. Their infrastructure is absolutely terrible.
<br>- Vast encouragement of zerging in virtually all game mechanics.
<br>- Everything is instanced on tiny maps which are copy &amp; pasted (lazy). Loading sceens galore.
<br>- More copy paste with skills with slight variations that make no sense whatsoever for their purpose.
<br>- Development incompetence with regard to PvP balance and skills (stuns/snares should do less or no damage, those lacking these abilities should do more, etc).
<br>- Severe imbalances across entire weapon &amp; armor skilltrees with only a select few viable (this is very bad in a very grindy progression game).
<br>- &quot;Game based around 5v5 PvP&quot; when &lt; 1% compete in the 5v5 PvP worth anything. Slave system where guilds force members to &quot;donate&quot; millions of silver a week. Extremely poor game design.
<br>- Countless newbie traps attributed to bad game design. E.G. Worthless player islands (blue towns are useless endgame, funnelled to red towns and pay extortionate silver to go to your island), ghost towns (as all funnelled to 1 town), farming (market is saturated and you lose money trying), builds (very few builds are viable), etc.
<br>- Buy to play, pay to play, pay to win (can get max crafting in 1 day with credit card). This is all 3 models, milk the cash cow.
<br>- Extremely boring PvE. Removal of functioning, fun, PvE that gave &quot;too much silver&quot; and encouraged PvP in the &quot;open world&quot; which is instanced.
<br>- Hackers / bots everywhere.
<br>- Graphics look like it&apos;s from 2003.
<br>- Lack of any lore in it&apos;s entirety.
<br>- &quot;Full loot&quot; visage, more care bear than some theme park mmo&apos;s offering better mechanics and subsequent rewards, particularly for smallscale / solo which is nonexistent.
<br>- Made as difficult as possible, if not impossible to die or lose *anything*. Including BZ city. Smoke and mirrors.
<br>- &quot;Sandbox&quot; but everything about it is linear and structured. No sand in the box.
<br>- Median higher tier item power = worthless because the devs want a gang of newbs in cheap gear to be able to kill experienced players in a progression game. E.G. Tier 4 weapon does almost as much damage as tier 7.
<br>- Skilltrees changed after huge investments and other major game mechanic changes post release after several additional years of beta.
<br>- Implementation of utterly ridiculous concepts unsuitable for full loot sandbox openworld. E.G. Instanced expeditions without PvP, instanced arenas, etc and more to come I am sure.
<br>- Completely changing game direction post release. Now it&apos;s am amalgamation of every MMO ever released except created extremely badly in most respects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/albion-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=7524213">Expand</a></span>
