The graphics, beautiful. The Free running, excellent, some tweaks made to improve it, and endless fun to be had. The story, FANTASTIC, and WAY better than Assassins creed 1. There is more to do, and a wider, more diverse range of directions to go, so it is not the same things over and over again. And the events that are taking place interest you and draw you in. The Combat system remains largely unchanged, but larger scale of enemy difficulties makes for some more challenging and often more enjoyable fights. And I love the cash aspect of this game. Instead of just having a sword and a dagger, the ability to buy and upgrade weapons, to save for the next one, is great! Plus the ability to upgrade the Villa (Sort of home town) in order to gain more revenue is good as. So, based purely on playing the game itself, i give it a 10. I give Ubisoft a 0 for trying their hardest to lose as many customers as they can, but admittedly they&apos;ve put out a damn good game. I will add that this is an obvious console port, with the menu better controllable with keys, as well as the game telling you to press the &quot;hand&quot; key rather than the shift key (the HUD has an Xbox button style diamond like in Assassins Creed 1, with images corresponding to each button on an Xbox controller). Once you get past this, and the keys become muscle memory, you will have no more issues with it. I would give it 9.5/10 but there&apos;s no such option so I&apos;m rounding up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=747805">Expand</a></span>

Great main storylinethat builds Ezio from his womanizing care-free beginnings into the iconic assassin of the order. Various ways to complete objective even if gameplay is linear. Would have liked different endings depending on how you complete objectives. Gameplay mechanics improved from the original, but a more intelligent and agressive AI would have been ideal and felt like a cake walk. Music by Jesper Kyd is phenomenal. (as always)

<br>Straight up combat is still a weak point in the game, but they increased the fun factor by providing more means to avoid it like hiring thieves, using smoke bombs, creating a distraction by throwing money, strategically placing corpses, and assassinating targets from distance with a pistol.

Every single aspect of the story is very well made and the near-end plot twist is awesome, from beginning to end it is interesting and keeps you immersed. The graphics are good but there is space for improvement, Assassin&apos;s Creed had amazing graphics and I feel this is just the same graphics with little or no improvement. The overall sound is amazing with a great soundtrack which is also great to play with an instrument and some excellent sound effects as well as top voice acting. The platforming is way faster and better in many ways such as the gameplay that has you always interested. You can get about 12 hours out of this game and even though the replay value is not much I had the desire to play it again, which I did. Now to the part everyone hated, the Ubisoft DRM is something that has people really mad, but I had surprisingly no problems with this. Overall you should get this game though you should be really careful about the DRM for mac users the best option is buying it in the mac app store and but I think overall the best thing you could do is get it for console, yet its worth a try on PC/Mac.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2509608">Expand</a></span>

The cities are beautiful and they really feel alive. The medieval theme looks and feels really nice. There is quite a load of content in this game with plenty of things to do besides the pretty long main quest. Managing your estate is a fun but shallow distraction. The  vehicle sections are pretty fun. The acrobatics looks cool and feels fluid when everything works. The game feels overall really competent and you get a a nice amount of content for your money.. But sadly it does have some problems. The combat is quite awful and feels static, repetitive and boring. The ridiculous amount of healing items you can carry around also makes it extremely unchallenging and tedious. The climbing and acrobatics in this game works for the most part quite well and it really fun to use. The one-button for everything system in the game is however not flawless and sometimes the game will misinterpret your actions which is never any fun. A long campaign is always nice and this games have one. What is less nice however is that the campaign contains a lot of really boring filler missions that only serve to drag out the game a hour or two. Some other annoyances are bad jumping puzzles, lack of interesting side characters, strange difficulty-curve, terrible stealth-missions, terrible stealth-mechanics, unsatisfying assassinations and lets not forget everything Desmond related. I might sound really negative but i did enjoy my time with the game and i would definitely recommend buying this game for a cheap price if you think the concept sounds interesting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3020095">Expand</a></span>

Why do i not have a problem with the DRM? I gave up on Ubisoft and downloaded a work around. It worked, to say the least. Now then, as for the game itself: There&apos;s no repetitivity like the first game, every mission felt fresh and fun throughout. It took me, according to my stats, 25 hours to get to the end of the game, and i missed out the side missions, which there are plenty of, albeit repetitive, so you&apos;re getting your money&apos;s worth. I had a lot of fun with the game, i&apos;d highly recommend it if not for the DRM. The voice acting is superb, the graphics are nice, although much like the first game. The addition of money to spend on equipment, health &quot;packs&quot;, clothing, paintings, or just to invest in your huge villa is fantastic. The &quot;notoriety system&quot; seems like a work in progress, or a half arsed effort. Every large scale murder, or fight or socially unacceptable action will increase your notoriety, making guards identify you as an assassin faster, which will provoke a fight. That&apos;s all well and good, but the ways of lowering it are ridiculous. You can tear down a poster, located in an area the general public will never see, clearly just to give a free running aspect to it. 4 posters will clear your name completely. Or you can murder a &quot;corrupt guard&quot; which will clear 75% of your nororiety. Needs quite a clean up, but it&apos;s a fresh change to the game. Now for the downsides: For a start, the PC version is quite clearly a console port in every way. The controls are terrible in some places, such as having to repeatedly tap shift when using the Gondola (boat). Anyone with a PC knows that hammering the shift key boots you to the dektop because of the sticky keys nonsense.The lack of advanced graphical options is ridiculous. There&apos;s just &quot;setting 1, 2, 3, 4&quot; for about 5 options. No way to edit .ini files either, because Ubisoft don&apos;t respect their PC customers (clearly indicated by the DRM...). Also, some options won&apos;t save your settings, such as subtitles on, or inverted controls, etc. There&apos;s also the terrible physics engine, just like the first game. If you kill a guard on a slanted rooftop, his body will stiffen in the air, before the physics engine kicks in and his body slops down the side of the roof. Throwing an enemy off a building will result in the body bouncing and flipping around. The terrible AI, like the first game is still there, with guards getting stuck on railings, preventing their friends from climbing that point and pursuing me. The flying machine was a horrible disappointment, as was the the pistol attachment. It takes around 3 seconds to line up the shot, then after firing will increase your notoriety by 10% (explained above) and takes around 2 seconds to reload. Bullets cost 175 florins each, and you can only hold 6 at a time. Considering how loud and impractical the gun is, not to mention the huge cost, it makes other weapons far more viable options. Throwing knives, for example, are 50f each, and have a capacity of 20, not to mention the extremely fast throwing speed. The story is also quite deranged, while at the same time, interesting. (i&apos;ve tried not to include any spoilers)The main problem i had with it is that it spans over the course of 23 years, yet none of the characters age at all. The protagonist should be in his mid 40&apos;s, yet looks the same as his late teens. The only character change is near the very end of the game, where the protagonist gains some stuble...wow. If you don&apos;t mind terrible DRM, lack of customisation options and a terrible engine (bwah hahahahahaha) then it&apos;s worth giving the game a go for the fantastic gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=747690">Expand</a></span>

The people who say the DRM boots you out of the game well I have never been booted out of the game because of the DRM.</span>

I will agree with the multitude of people who complain that it is pretty shoddy, but the game itself, not counting the DRM, is a true masterpiece<br>The storyline is highly involving and intricate, the time setting couldn&apos;t really have been more appropriate and I found Renaissance Italy a very interesting setting to work from.The graphics are fantastic, and even though the system requirements are a bit beefy, I couldn&apos;t help every once in a while climbing a viewpoint simply to stand there and gaze at the surrounding cityline.<br>A major aspect of the first game was the non-linear style of play, which I loved. This has been very nicely updated and improved in the sequel, which a vast range of side-missions to complete, as well as having entire cities to roam around almost freely, allowing you to decide  when to complete a main objective; you can go and rush through the main story if you want or leave it out until you&apos;ve had some fun with it.<br>The fighting system, freerunning and climbing aspects, the largest parts of the game, have been improved very nicely, with more freedom as to how you can conduct yourself about the city. The in-depth and well-explored characters also allow the player to feel immersed in the game. All of this makes for a game that can be replayed again and again and will always feel a little different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1602295">Expand</a></span>

I found the storyline to be gripping and interesting.<br>The voice acting of the characters, NPCs etc in the game is spot on and really fits the setting.<br>The repetitive gameplay of the original AC has now vanished and this makes for a much more enjoyable game. The controls are easy to use and you can bind abilities to different keys if you feel the need to do so.<br>The graphics are great and at medium to max settings with anti-aliasing, look better than the console equivalent due to the vastly superior shadows and lighting.  I do however feel sad that the PC version has ended up getting low user scores because of DRM, because the game itself is great. All in all, it&apos;s a great game and is now available very cheaply.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2082829">Expand</a></span>

You can ! Wanna look for collectibles ? You can, i would say this is one of the best and safe buy of AC&apos;s game i did, you will be able to visit Venice and Florence, and as for me which i listened to the entire game made in Italian was feeling like real.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2308680">Expand</a></span>

The controls were very smooth, and made all the acrobatics fun to perform. The story was ok, and the characters were also acceptable (cliched but I was not expecting something outstanding anyways). Combat was like in the previous game. I felt it was sometimes just too easy with instant chain-kills, and moves that kill your opponents immediately. I felt the developers could have made this part much more challenging. The missions were somewhat varied, but not much changed since the first game. Overall I enjoyed ACII.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2973848">Expand</a></span>

The world is literally HUGE and there is a bare minimum of 45-50 hours of gameplay.  I have played it twice now and it works out slightly differently each time so there is definite replay value here.  There is an enormous amount to do and if you do everything in each city you could probably push your experience out to 60 or 70 hours.  What I really enjoyed in this game was the wealth of historical data you can access about Renaissance Italy - so you not only have a fantastic gaming experience but also learn a great deal about the environment in which you play.  The only downside to this game is some of the controls especially when doing the puzzle/treasure hunts.  Getting Ezio to jump the right way can sometimes be an exercise in frustration and as a result can cause you to take a hell of a long time to complete the mission - however once you do the sense of satisfaction is significant as you feel you have cracked a really difficult problem.  Therefore as frustrating as they may be I would not take the easy route and skip them even though if you become desperate you can do so as they don&apos;t really affect the storyline.
<br>
<br>In short they really pulled out all the stops on this one and if it wasn&apos;t for some of the frustrating controls in the puzzle/treasure hunts I would give it a 10.  Pick it up you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3933713">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 serves as the direct sequel to the first game, continuing the storyline of Altair but mostly of his descendant, Ezio Auditore.
<br>
<br>The story takes place during the Renaissance period of Italy, which feels refreshing away from the Holy Land, where sand dunes and plain terrain is the environment most of the time.
<br>
<br>Note that Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 varies a slight bit from AC1, with a few better improvements, as well as bringing back some of the issues that i had problem with.
<br>
<br>Pros (8):
<br>
<br>(Primary) + Significant general improvements over AC1.
<br>
<br>+ Graphical changes were significant, the game looks much more detailed, lifelike and just more vibrant overall.
<br>+ Even detailed character modelling returns.
<br>+ Repetitive missions are gone! All primary missions, if not most, will always be different. Long gone are the days where doing the same reptitive task leads to the completion of the mission.
<br>+ Storyline is even longer and better. Game no longer ends randomly on a cliffhanger, like some sort of lousy movie film.
<br>+ At least 30ish hours of gameplay. Considered a long duration for a singleplayer story-mode game.
<br>+ No game stability issues, did not crash time during the whole of 28 hours of in-game session.
<br>+ More checkpoints, leading to lesser frustration when dying, crashing, etc.
<br>+ Side missions now serves a function, such as obtaining a cape for collecting a certain amount of feathers.
<br>
<br>Cons (2):
<br>
<br>- Artificial Intelligence coding STILL feels choppy, but is improved, enemies to retaliate more often and are more aware of their surroundings.
<br>-Game mechanic seems worse than before. Scaling walls and performing parkours in general, feels choppier and rough.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend playing the first game and follow the series on a chronological order. And if you loved the first AC game, you would definitely love this one.

<br>The game itself is great. I got 100% completion in about 50 hours. The gameplay can be repetitive and boring at times, but the storyline keeps things interesting. I couldnt play in long sessions however because the controls were just absolutely awful. I played with a mouse+keyboard initially, but gave up and stopped playing the game. I came back months later and played with an xbox 360 controller in steam. it worked a lot better, but it was still frustrating at times lining jumps up right, etc. Many times I&apos;d jump off a building and he&apos;d go in a totally different direction.
<br>
<br>So overall, this is a great game but hampered by agitating controls and repetitive gameplay. It does improve vastly upon the first Creed, and I would recommend it for under $10. Steam has it on sale every now and again for pretty cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4326202">Expand</a></span>

Combat system is very good, action is nearly perfect. After all, a great, great game that I&apos;ve played so far. But there is something make it not perfect: first,  the system requirements are too high, even on the very strong PC, there is still a lot of lag and glitch. Secondly,  requirement of  constant internet connection to play the game is annoying for people who have bad internet connection. A great work of Ubisoft, hope they can provide more in the next project. 9.0 points for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1573457">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Renaissance is one of the best times in AC series for now, lots of different locations, each with its unique sightseeings and interesting missions. It&apos;s hard to say why, but for some reason with every new part of AC we are going farther from silent kills and that kind of actions, more stupid submissions (( It&apos; sad. But the AC2 still has the soul of stealth.
<br>10 out of 10 - definitely
<br>PS. I really surprised to see such a bad user score - it&apos;s ridiculous!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2331746">Expand</a></span>

I remember I was finding myself rather bored during the first 4-5 memories (out of 14). The missions weren&apos;t interesting, the areas were bland and the story was taking too long to get started. However it does pick up eventually and gets much better and incredibly fun. There are about 5 cities in this game, which is slightly more than the first game, and it also made improvements on many aspects from the first game, like the climbing and stealthy combat. The face-on combat is pretty much the same (it was already great to begin with, so I guess no improvements were needed), except fist fighting has gotten significantly improved. The game is also a lot more diverse. There are a lot of areas to explore, a lot of side quests to do, and even various mini-tasks such as refurbishing one of the cities to the full. One could probably spend many hours playing this game. So AC2 is better than the first in many areas, including graphics, storyline, gameplay and perhaps even the background music too. But it has some drawbacks however. The controls for example, which were already one of the biggest flaws of the first game, are even harder now. I had to go back to the controls menu to check up on some of them even in late stages of the game. They are hard to memorise and they are also very inconvenient, forcing you to hold like 3-4 buttons at the same time just to run after someone, making chase parts of the game rather difficult. I was also not too fond of many of the side quests and such. They were bland and so I ended up mostly just playing the main story. AC2 is a good game. I am guessing because of controls issues it&apos;s not supposed to be played on PC, but on a console. My bro has it on Xbox360 and the controls issues are virtually non-existent, so I&apos;d probably advise you to get it on Xbox360 or PS3, not on PC, not to mention the killer graphics requirements the game has on PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769827">Expand</a></span>

The missions are far more engaging and entertaining than the previous game and there is also a built in economy that you can use to upgrade your &quot;headquarters&quot; and get yourself better gear. A great game.</span>

I hear that the DRM is a bit of a killer for anyone who paid for the game. It seems Ubi have done exactly the opposite of what their DRM was supposed to do. When will these companies learn that no matter what they do to try and stop people cracking these games, the hackers will always find a way around it. All they do by introducing these DRM measures is to alienate the people who actually buy a legitimate copy. The pirates are rewarded for pirating since they do not need an internet connection to play, the game doesnt lock up and freeze when connection is lost and save games arent lost when the internet goes down, the crack takes care of all that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=747751">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>i found this game extremely fun, the environments are beautiful and i didn&apos;t find it overly repetitive. the story is great as are the characters. the only problem is the combat with the enemies waiting and taking turns to be stabbed but its easily ignored. the exploration is great, i&apos;m sure most of the negative reviews are about the drm not the game itself.</span>

The DRM does not make the game any worse. I understand that your gaming experience can be ruined by the fact that you have a really spotty internet connection, but that&apos;s just the experience, not the game itself. When I bought this game, the first thing I noticed was the big box on the bottom that says &quot;Continuous Internet Connection Required.&quot; If you see that, don&apos;t buy the game. It&apos;s that simple. I completely disagree with Ubisoft for using the DRM, but don&apos;t let that detract from a great game. Now for my actual review:<br><br>I loved this game. It was MUCH better than Assassin&apos;s Creed. The combat itself hadn&apos;t improved all that much, though I really liked being able to use the hidden blades in combat, and the attachments that went with it. I particularly loved the fact that climbing wasn&apos;t as slow, as Ezio could climb swiftly if there was a clear path to the top.<br><br>What I was most impressed about was the story. In the original AC, you played as Alta&#xC3;&#xAF;r, who really had no character presence. He was just a blade with a voice, and you never really connected with him. However, Ezio was fantastic. His personality had so much depth, and as the story progressed, you really felt Ezio progress as well. Hats off to Ubisoft on this one, regardless of the DRM.<br><br>That being said, I give a 9/10, one point off for the numerous times that I would jump from a wooden beam, and automatically jump diagonally away from my destination.<br><br>To all those complaining about the DRM:<br><br>If you consider yourself a &quot;PC Gamer,&quot; you should really have a good internet connection. It&apos;s 2011, catch up with the times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1488958">Expand</a></span>

The crucial component of AC2 that disappointed me was the controls. It&apos;s TOO difficult and the counter-attacks are nearly impossible to use on the **** keyboard. Sure, you can fix it, but it&apos;s not gonna feel like the typical assassination games like &quot;Hitman: Blood Money&quot;. Nevertheless, if you&apos;re interested in the game, try for it; Maybe you might like it.&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1850173">Expand</a></span>

Aside from that, The game is very well done, right down to the small details that set this game apart from other Free-Runner games like Mirror&apos;s Edge and the like.

If you are thinking about getting this, I highly recommend that you do! You should only rate on the actual game. Best game ever. 10 out of 10.(Rating on the game itself) The PC controls are annoying because it shows you signs.</span>

I think most of the problems with the low user score lie with the hardware (PC) requirements  if you don&apos;t have an updated computer with a great video card and hard drive, your gameplay will suffer. But with the right hardware, this game is unbelievably interesting! It&apos;s the beginning of the story of Ezio Auditore, the assassin whose story later continues with the AC Brotherhood and eventually with AC Revelations.  Centered around various Renaissance cities and a private villa, even Leonardo DaVinci has a role! Take your time playing it. I have already played it four times and each time I manage to find a few things that I had not discovered. The entire Assassin&apos;s Creed series of games is my favorite of all times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3260230">Expand</a></span>

Volume - there is almost none, you really need more than double your settings/speakers to get basic sound for the game. That&apos;s not too inconvenient until your system plays non-AC2 sounds and blows your ears off.<br>2. Mouse Control - incredibly sluggish reactions even on the highest response settings.<br>3. Keyboard - the controls are aimed at console users and sometimes inaccurate. Combined with the mouse problem you never feel you have smooth control this time.<br>4.

I&apos;ve to wait almost 10mn each time I want to play, because the game had to contact Ubisoft to load my saves and to validate the game. When you can play it, the game is fun, the backgrounds are really great, but the characters really ugly compared to the others actual productions.</span>

The second and equally disappointing thing is that the game itself is boring and uninteresting. The first was great because it had an interesting backround and it kept you going. In AC2, the characters are annoying as hell and the game set in the 15th century is honestly terrible. I&apos;m not going to even bring up the DRM as it has all been said before. Serious control issues and a terrible game add up to a generous 3/10 for me.

Honestly, I don&apos;t know how good the game is because there always seems to be connection problems. Constantly, to the point where it&apos;s just pure frustration and the game is unplayable. The forums were no help whatsoever...believe me I tried everything. Before buying the game I had read some articles on this new DRM method but am not technically inclined enough to have judged its stability. You just expect that the manufacturer wouldn&apos;t implement something that didn&apos;t work well. So now hindsight is 20/20 and it&apos;s truly mind-boggling how someone at Ubisoft could think this was a good idea. I&apos;ve spent $1000s of dollars on games over the years and wouldn&apos;t know where to start pirating a game. I just like to whip out the VISA card and start playing. But this is way, way over the edge. I&apos;m out $60 and that&apos;s ok since I learned a valuable lesson...if the name Ubisoft ever shows up in Steam or on a retailer&apos;s shelf, I won&apos;t even look at it. No way, no how and I&apos;ll make sure that everyone I know that plays games is aware of the issue too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=747512">Expand</a></span>

After having read all of these horrible reviews, I figured it couldn&apos;t be *that* bad and I got it (because it is a great game, after all). Such a waste of money! First there&apos;s the DRM and required internet connection - not a problem for me, though. I get booted out of the game sometimes (Ubisoft&apos;s issue, not mine) and often my game doesn&apos;t save properly and I have to redo it (which is bad considering you can&apos;t save whenever you want in this game - it&apos;s automatic). When I play this, I feel like I&apos;m playing a pirated or emulated game!!! It&apos;s so sloppily copied from the console game it&apos;s not even funny... it&apos;s actually sad. At the beginning of the game it shows you the controls using the Xbox360 color coded icons. I found myself mashing random buttons on the keyboard having no idea what corresponded.<br><br>There are so many bugs and issues I don&apos;t even know where to start, from messed up cutscenes to bad controls. If you want to play Assassin&apos;s Creed II, get it for another system (it&apos;s a really good game when it&apos;s not on PC). If you don&apos;t have one, honestly just pirate the game (I never pirate games but I wouldn&apos;t blame anyone if they did with this terrible thing).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1645998">Expand</a></span>

The sequel, while less attractive as a setting to me, was a much better game, with richer gameplay. And the story, although not the best in the world, was enjoyable and not totally retarded like it became in future installments.</span>

I haven&apos;t played the 1st  or the 3rd AC yet. So, I didn&apos;t quite know what to expect. Anyway, I&apos;ll try to sum my opinion up point by point.
<br>I played this on an i7 3770K with a GTX680 and an Asus VG248QE running Windows 7 Ultimate.
<br>
<br>1st, The graphics are typical for a multiplatform release. (nice but nothing groundbreaking) 2nd, The sound is good, and they managed to pack some atmosphere into this game.
<br>3rd, There is plenty to do, but it does become a little repetitive after playing many hours.
<br>4th, The storyline is, for the most part, good. Some parts are a little fluffed up, but you at least want to stay on board to find out what will happen next, and how it will end. 5th, The controls were unintuitive. So, I remapped them, but they still didn&apos;t feel quite right. Finally, I opted to use an XBOX360 controller. For me, this is an unfortunate and unnecessary weak spot, because the PC version of a game should work well with a  mouse and keyboard. Other than that, the game is fun to play.
<br>6th, I would&apos;ve liked to have seen more options to customize the graphics, and maybe the main character as well.
<br>7th, I didn&apos;t experience any technical problems like bugs, glitches, freezing, or crashing. However, this game does require Uplay to run in the background. I bought this on Steam, which means I already have Steam running. So, I don&apos;t see the point of needing both to play, but since, I didn&apos;t experience any issues during my sessions, I&apos;ll leave it at that.
<br>All in all, this title was worth adding to my collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3064677">Expand</a></span>

I have to still sign up for a ubiplay account in order to access this game I bought.  I can&apos;t stand a business model that encourages piracy.  It&apos;s stupid.  Also, this game is disgustingly casual.  You have to TRY to die.  For a game that&apos;s pretty much about running away, the enemies are laughable.  Why do I CARE that I&apos;m infamous.  I can kill the armored axemen with my wristblade.  Oh, you wanna fight?  That&apos;s cute.  The enemies often WON&apos;T EVEN TRY TO HIT YOU unless you taunt them.  It&apos;s silly.  That said, the art is fantastic and combined with decent voice acting the game is surprisingly cinematic.  This game is a tragedy of an amazing idea executed poorly.  They were SO CLOSE to awesome it makes me sad.  But Ubisoft dropped the ball on the INVASIVE drm and the terrible port.  Also make games difficult my lord I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;ve accomplished anything when with the single weakest weapon in the game I can kill most enemies with pretty much no effort (counter, laugh).  Averages as tragically mediocre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2120097">Expand</a></span>

I thought it would be a good place to start that&apos;s not too far back while still being relatively modern. I can see the appeal of the game immediately: it&apos;s an immersive, very beautiful game with a funky UI and great story-telling. I&apos;ve played it for about 2 hours now. HOWEVER, it gets MASSIVE low points for VERY VERY VERY bad control set-up. I&apos;m not against innovative controls, or controls that work both on the PC and on consoles. Skyrim is a good example of that - you feel that the controls were made to be console-friendly, but they&apos;re never inhibiting your game play. This game, however, made controls not only un-intuitive, but also very difficult to understand, having to go through menus to understand which button is the &apos;Head&apos;, the &apos;Open Hand&apos;, the &apos;Armed Hand&apos;, and the &apos;Feet&apos;. None of this is explained in the game itself. NONE. The color-coding presumably makes it easier for console players to understand, but doesn&apos;t work at all for the PC. Do yourself a favor and buy the console version of this title. This is a bad port.<br><br>After finishing the game: 8.5/10. You basically have to memorize the different key bindings and get through the first bit to learn the controls. Don&apos;t be mislead by my high score - the controls are the single most annoying thing in this game. It&apos;s a set of 4 basic controls, which change if you right click the mouse, and then you have to execute sequences of them to do many things... and the game decides that it would be fun to make you do some harder sequences as the game goes on. If you look past that, however, the game is very deep, has multiple meaningful side quests, and is generally a fantastic game. Music is phenomenal. If it&apos;s possible, I would recommend you play this with a controller.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2306616">Expand</a></span>

Assassin&apos;s Creed II, as a game, is simply amazing. This game has exactly what you want in a sequel: continued solid story, improved game mechanics, improved graphics, and more content. AC II continues Desmond&apos;s story from the first game, while introducing a new and likable protagonist, Ezio. The new settling of Renaissance Italy is both fresh and exciting, while preserving and improving on the extensive open world gameplay of its predecessor. It also introduces more sophisticated characters which you actually begin to care about, unlike the dull characters of the first game. Gameplay-wise, AC II skillfully introduces enough new mechanics and improvements to keep it fresh, while not feeling too different: you have a greater variety of weapons, including (thankfully!) long-range weapons; you can now use money to buy weapons and armor on your own schedule, instead of waiting around for mission rewards; you can hire mercenaries, thieves, and prostitutes to assist you in your missions; and plenty of other interesting things. While AC II isn&apos;t perfect, I think that it is a shining example of what a good sequel should be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2901213">Expand</a></span>

I had only played Black Flag and Unity before and thought it would good idea to play the entry many consider one the best of the series. I can&#x2019;t say it was a disappointment but I regret wasting my time on it. My biggest problem are the controls and the quest design. Far too often I jumped not where I wanted or I thought I would jump. Too many quests were timed races/platforming or worse escort missions. Combine this with not-too-perfect controls and frustration or even a rage quit is guaranteed. Since most enemies can counter yours counter attacks as well as yours disarm attempts combat drags on forever. And there&apos;s way too much combat in this game mostly caused by overabundance of hypersensitive guards patrolling the streets. Stealth is almost not an option here. Most quests inevitably end up in combat. The very few missions with forced stealth are poorly done and irritating. The game is agonizingly long. Half way through I started praying for the game to end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6186768">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are very good, and that sums up the good points. This is the most totally broken piece of software I have ever experienced.  If we thought BF4 was broken, this one is laughably worse by far. I received my copy as a promotion. Do Not waste your money on this one.</span>

On a whim, I bought this for like 8 bucks while it was on sale. And at first, I hated it because I tried to play it with kbm.
<br>At least for me, that didn&apos;t work AT ALL, I lost even on the very first, easy race. I then got myself a decent Xbox-controller for PC, and things changed (make sure it&apos;s a rather precise one...I tried a very cheap one which simply didn&apos;t work for some of the more complicated jumps).
<br>What a game, what a story, what a main character...
<br>
<br>The game has aged well...sure, you can tell it&apos;s from 2010, but Florence still looks really nice, very colorful and atmospheric.
<br>Ezio is a very likeable guy, and I quickly was caught up by the story. The moment when he first gets the costume and puts it on is very cool...and iconic. So is the beginning, where you witness Ezios birth, and considering you can follow his story until his death...well, I really think he is one of the coolest characters ever.
<br>
<br>The game surely has its flaws... the controls still are sometimes wonky, where you do a race or a more complicated maneuver and fail because the character does something else, something you didn&apos;t intend to, like doing a backwards flip from a wall when you tried something else.
<br>
<br>Still, the story and the game mechanics are very cool. It&apos;s fun to see Ezio turn from an easy-going teenager to a great assassin, fun to rebuild his base, which lets you earn a lot of money, enabling you to unlock upgrades. Once you do, things get a bit easier, as you can carry more ammo and have more health.
<br>The missions and assassinations are nicely embedded in the story, up until the very end. Yes, you WILL have some frustrating moments... stuff like the race against La Volpe (the controls will make that tricky), or assassinating the merchant on the ship. Yes, it will feel unfair, you might rage a bit.
<br>however, even with those flaws (which Ubisoft in some cases fixed in later games... parcour in Unity for example is much smoother and more controlled, with less mishaps happening), this is almost an iconic game about a great character, with a lot of atmosphere and good-looking graphics.
<br>It&apos;s a bit dated, but if you want to try out the franchise and see why it was and still is so popular (even though some later entries IMO don&apos;t live up to the original games), try out this, and if you like it, continue Ezios story in Brotherhood and Revelations.
<br>Stay patient with the controls, and you WILL succeed. Finishing the optional special jumping-riddles (which will unlock a very special set of armour at your base, which is almost imba) took a lot of attempts on some parts, but felt ultimately satisfying.
<br>This is an improvement over the original AC, and it is the beginning of possibly the coolest and most iconic of the assassins. I still like this Ezio-trilogy (2, BH, Revelations), III and Unity much more than BF, Rogue, or the rather dull and disappointing Syndicate. Check it out, its easy to find for just a few bucks usually!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6097296">Expand</a></span>
