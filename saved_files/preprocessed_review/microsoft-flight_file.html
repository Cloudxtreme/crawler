Free to play games are dominating the market. Many of those are sneaky and wont let you win if you dont pay, others do this model just right with being fair with free players. Flight doesn&apos;t fall in any of those categories and the reason for this is that its a glorified demo and not a freemium game. the only difference is that unlike other demos you will never get a full game, but rather buy content for expanding the demo. needles to say that this might be very expensive than just buying a full game    Sure, i gave this game a chance. i said &quot;ok how bad could it be?&quot; thinking that the initial reports of what the beta included(just two planes) was not what the final game will have. i was mistaken. indeed there are just two planes and the world is as dead as it gets, no AI airtraffic, no cars on the road or boats in the sea and total lack of animal life.    Another compromise done is the realism. its not realistic while its not arcady either. it just cannot decide what it is. it has an identity crisis. you will stall, but you cannot overstress the aircraft? what kind of sorcery is this?!    to change the mood a bit, the scenery is well designed and the aircraft look gorgeous, and best of all the performance is smooth and way better than dear old FSX, and that&apos;s where the good things end. the sound? yes, the sound is good especially the engine sounds of the aircraft, beyond that there&apos;s the music which Ahem...sucks.    another problem are the missions and challenges. they get repetitive while absurdly enough, most missions that already exist in the game require an aircraft you must buy for real money.    there is also a leveling system in place. that means in order to do some challenges and missions you must be in the proper level and this could mean you would have to grind. yes, this is not a typing error, grind in a game like this.    last but not least the false advertisement and MS herself. we got tons of sugar coated news on how Flight is reconsieved and renovated and how is meant for old and new fans, but it turns out its not like this at all. the game is not an advancement rather a significant downgrade and with its realism stripped out(both in physics and world) and its limited scale, Flight deserves the dislike of old fans. MS seems to have asked the marketing department rather the fans or devs, she bullied third party devs and required them to accept preposterous terms in order to let them make content for Flight.    in the end this whole DLC model is as stupid as the people that decide to make money out of it and the people who would pay for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/microsoft-flight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2240867">Expand</a></span>

The plane models are actually pretty good but you only get TWO PLANES! The ground textures are absolutely terrible along with everything else about this game. Keyboard flying sucks too. Arma 2 has has a more realistic flight system. I&apos;d suggest buying X-Plane instead of playing this piece of garbage.</span>

BTW, I got i little hint from someone over at microsoft: Why do you think we couldn&apos;s use the name &quot;flight simulator&quot;.. get it?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/microsoft-flight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2249966">Expand</a></span>

There is no ATC, flight planning, load and balance, IFR, third party add ons for your local airport in timbuctoo....  This is just horrendous. If MS wanted an arcade game for XBOX thats fine, but why trash 20 years of development, a loyal client base, and ontop, steal the name --  Ill stuck with FSX. See flight go the same way as IE, IIS, Silverlight, Office and Windows8 , right to the garbage bin...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/microsoft-flight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2243297">Expand</a></span>

Because it sucks. It&apos;s only worth playing for the achievements. On Max graphics settings the scenery is almost non-existent. I expected at least SOME detail not flat terrain. Framerate is pretty choppy even on a good PC and the camera views are terrible. The ckckpits are acceptable detail but everything else looks terrible I have literally seen games from 1970s and 1980s do better scenery. The only 2 things which are credit worthy about this game are that it has achievements and the tutorials and generally gameplay is well done in the sense that it easily appeals to even non-gamers while still keeping the depth and simulation aspect of flying for the more serious fans. It&apos;s not a &apos;bad game&apos; but there simply isn&apos;t enough content or anything which is interesting here. There&apos;s absolutely no fun or enjoyment to be had here, and no matter what kind of games you like I guarantee you will find more satisfaction elsewhere. However there aren&apos;t many free flying simulator games which appeal to the casual market of good quality. The execution is good, but the whole concept and idea of it is flawed. For this &quot;casual simulator&quot; to be seriously considered as a game it needs to look to Test Drive Unlimited for inspiration, but instead of driving put the focus on flying. Only then can it be a viable game to spend time on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/microsoft-flight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2296849">Expand</a></span>

Aerocashes are a good idea but poorly developed, you seen them all fast and when you log off they aren&apos;t saved so you must always start with the first one Honolii Cove. The planes design could be a lot better, especially with the p51 Mustang which I bought its turning rate, turning speed, and handling is not good at all. To be short about the DLC part, lots of money for what you get in return. I am tired of the expansive DLC rip-off hype under companies. Can&apos;t give a high grade because of the price-content ratio is very low. Else this game deserves a higher grade. Companies should look to innovation of fun gaming instead to their wallet. In the 90s and 00s you bought a big game and you get something in return, from MFS98 to MFSX: big content, very detailed, lots of planes and so on(yes ok they are more real sims and not arcady but that&apos;s not my point here). MS Flight is Free2Play but if you download all DLC and look what you have its WAY more expansive in comparison with the earlier Flight sims from MS. So lookout.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/microsoft-flight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2292357">Expand</a></span>

The game had enormous potential, potential effectively pissed into the flusher by an incompetent development staff.  Graphically, the game is ok, not great, just ok.  The airplanes (the ones that are fully modeled) are nice, however the world you fly them in is stagnant and dead.  I won&apos;t even comment on the **** abominations that honestly have no place in gaming in the year 2012 (unless it&apos;s AI or a static display).  The game could succeed, however the developer needs to stop repeatedly shooting themselves in the foot.  More importantly, the game must find an identity, because really what is it?  An arcade shooter with no shooting?  A civilian flight game with an over abundance of warbirds? or a really poor attempt at a simulator?
<br>
<br>As is, the game is little more than incomplete wasted potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/microsoft-flight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2315173">Expand</a></span>

Flight takes a different approach to the previous games in the series; namely removing &quot;simulator&quot; from the name and giving us a small area to fly in, plus having customers pay money for additional aircraft or scenery; it&apos;s just that you&apos;re effectively paying &#xA3;70 for about 1/100 of FSX or 2004. In Microsoft&apos;s rush to try and make the series more &quot;accessible&quot;, all they&apos;ve done is make a game too boring for the casual gamers and too insubstantial for older fans of the series. The only good thing I have to say about this game is that the graphics are quite nice, as is the sound. If I sound a bit dry, it&apos;s because everything about this game just makes me feel depressed for the AAA games industry and I really don&apos;t have anything to say about it, just don&apos;t download it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/microsoft-flight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2708469">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are better than default FSX, but not better than almost every &quot;A&quot; PC game title today.
<br>
<br>One thing I do know: It&apos;s not appealing enough for its target audience. MS wants millions to buy their DLC, but I&apos;m pretty sure that will not be happening based on the game being a hybrid genre.
<br>
<br>In 2012 it is an insult to release airplanes with no **** Think about that. A Flight sim or game with airplanes and no ****.. The only game I can compare that to is PilotWings and the Nintendo offering is far more fun. Afterall, there is no ambiguity as to what PilotWings is.
<br>
<br>Graphically better than default FSX. Replyablility? If you like doing &quot;jobs&quot; (sort of like random repeatable quests) then you might call this category average. Fun? That depends on you, but if you are approaching this as a flight sim fan there is none of the following: ATC, AI traffic, airliners, or autopilot. This game appeals to GA &quot;low and slow&quot;  but even then there is only Hawai&apos;i to fly in so that has to get boring quickly. Alaska DLC scenery has been announced, but no release date as of this writing.
<br>
<br>The game is relying on people to purchase DLC by the droves. In this endeavour, IMO, MS has chosen poorly. Since the game is free there is no risk to DL it, but don&apos;t expect it to blow you away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/microsoft-flight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2436319">Expand</a></span>

Also to keep you interested, there are missions (cargo, passengers, visiting places, etc.) that grant you &quot;experience points&quot; towards an overall progress meter with quite a number of achievements to unlock. So if you used to fly FSX just for the fun of flying, MS Flight is quite a game. Just don&apos;t expect too much realism.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/microsoft-flight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2463146">Expand</a></span>

The problem is they have released 4 WW2 vintage aircraft with no missions or objectives specific to them and if that alone was not bad enough, none of them have a **** After the release of the first one the message boards lit up with criticism and yet onward MS pushed with releasing more of the same and not replying to any of the customer feedback.
<br>
<br>After ther elease of the P-40 their reaction was to just remove the option for customers to leave comments any more and they have yet to formally respond to all the criticism. There is potential with the title but unfortunately it will probably die a slow death due to the lack of interaction with the customer base and clearly releasing content the community is just not interested in purchasing.
<br>
<br>The game has a cap of level 20 which can be achieved over a weekend of flying and there is no replayability built into any of the mission objectives. In the game you can transport freight, deliver a passenger to buy a $100 hamburger, fly up to 3 passengers to another airport or medivac a patient and nurse. Again, wrong execution of the right idea; the freight missions require you to fly over the MTOW limit of a Maule, the burger missions allow you to use any plane (including single seat warbirds - WTF?) and the passenger missions again limit you to only the Maule. This leaves a very repetitive (read as exciting as watching live coverage of a primary on CNN) game scenario with a slow plane that does not even have working autopilot (although the controls for it are on the instrument panel).
<br>
<br>The flight community has always supported the new products that came out through developing add-on planes the community wanted to see in the sim/game, a lot of it is freeware and the more advanced content as payware. Again, MS missed the mark here in understanding what the target audience wants and has not released any SDK tools.
<br>
<br>This is the absolute worst attempt at niche software development I have seen in the 25 + years I have been gaming, it plays like one of those off-brand console games that are in the bargain bin at the large retailers. Keep in mind this game was years in the making and was released as the evolution of the flight game. The only reason the game gets a 1 is I could not see a way to give it a 0 on here; save your money to buy the additional hardware you may need to run X-Plane 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/microsoft-flight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2472880">Expand</a></span>

A good game to play when trying to fill in time as there is a free flight option. I wouldn&apos;t recommend it for those looking for a proper flight simulator, but I would for those trying to get into this sort of gaming genre.</span>

The Metascore and other peoples opinions don&apos;t always speak the truth, and they probably also expected something different, although the end product on itself is rather good!
<br>
<br>I must say i did like The (very first) First MS Flight Simulator games and played them quite a lot back in the days. However did i mostly not get into every little detail like radio-communications, checklists, full flights from A to B, etc. It was more just taking-off, flying, fly-by&apos;s and landings.
<br>
<br>This year I&apos;ve been looking for the best/right flightsim game/experience and it has (no doubtingly) brought me to MS Flight!
<br>
<br>Despite the &apos;negative-vibe&apos; around MS Flight (Kiddy, Too expensive add-ons, Much too easy, yada-yada) i gave it a try, and hell i have played and enjoyed every second of it! And with settings set to a bit harder level together with stormy weather i really had a lot of trouble learning to take-off and land, and fly for that matter! (enjoyable and fun to also learn to fly better and better)
<br>
<br>And because of the simple but clear checklists and tutorials i also learn more and more about the fuel mixture, oil pressure, battery stuff, and so on! On practically every level this games has given me enjoyment, new information and teaches me more about flying than MS Flight Simulator ever did!

The graphics are a complete disaster if you don&apos;t have them all turned up to max, and if I do that my machine blows up. The trailer is completely deceiving, as there are basically no 3-d structures. The only reason to get this game is because it&apos;s free-to-play.</span>

                                        <span>Again this is a microsoft game, so with that said you have to buy every little thing. The flying is fun, but microsoft wont update this game anymore and instead of flying all over the world you are stuck with just Hawaii and Alaska. Also you are only stuck with certain aircraft and nothing fancy or big. I give this game a 1. I wish I could get my money back and buy other flight simulator games.</span>
