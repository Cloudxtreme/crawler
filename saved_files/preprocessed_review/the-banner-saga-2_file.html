To get a challenge you will need to put the game on difficult as normal presents very little challenge. Making tough decisions that have no clear cut &quot;right&quot; answer is still in the game and still great. What really makes this game just average for me whereas the original was great is the underwhelming story. Little is explained in the overarching storyline of the trilogy and with the exception of the beginning nothing grand really plays out. It is worth playing if you are invested in the trilogy as I am.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-banner-saga-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6452623">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It is iterative rather than revolutionary, but there are clear and natural improvements. The game&apos;s creators didn&apos;t reinvent the wheel, but there were interesting new combat mechanics (including a whole new race of characters to use) and some ease-of-use improvements like better combat tutorials.
<br>
<br>The story is more focused and way more of the small decisions from the first game carried through than I expected. There&apos;s also a bit more variety in the storytelling, leaning on the worldbuilding of the first entry in the series.
<br>
<br>The bleak beauty of the art and the mechanics continue, with harsh consequences for the decisions you must make and no perfect path forward. The music is also every bit as good as the first game.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think this is a great middle entry in the series and I&apos;m excited for the conclusion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-banner-saga-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6310426">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The art, animations, visual style and music all keep in the same style, which is great because these were excellent in the original game.
<br>
<br>In terms of gameplay, the game is very similar to the original, the turn-based combat, RPG elements, dialogue choices, all is pretty much exactly the same, there&apos;s a few new units and abilities. The real only new thing added here is a set of optional &quot;training&quot; scenarios that you can do for a reward of renown points. The training master gives you a limited number of characters at up to 4 individual objectives that you need to accomplish, like using specific abilities or otherwise doing things in a specific way. In principle, this is cool, it allows you to &quot;learn&quot; new units and synergies, and the renown points sure are very important, but the problem is that often times the things you&apos;re asked to do are rather contrived, risky, not very efficient, and, worst of all, sometimes depend STRONGLY on what the AI does with its units. Because of this, sometimes you end up in frustration as you retry the &quot;challenge&quot; over and over again, even if they&apos;re optional...
<br>
<br>The story starts well where it left off, you&apos;re immediately commanding your favourite characters from the previous game, with whom you most likely connected so much with, and there&apos;s even an epic moment quite early on that&apos;s very emotional.
<br>After that, the game splits into a &quot;new&quot; main character, going back and forth between them, much like in the first game. This would be fine, good even, except that this &quot;new&quot; character is SOOO antagonistically different from Rook/Alette that the I felt the change intensely jarring. In the first game, the tone was always that of wanting to protect your caravan and clan through every hardship, and in the face of the approaching End of the World, as best you could, but this new character seemingly doesn&apos;t care about any of that. I didn&apos;t care at all for the &quot;new&quot; character and felt completely lost: was I supposed to get &quot;in character&quot; and be cruel and selfish in the face of so much suffering everywhere? Actually, you can turn into a good guy via your actions and dialogues, which I did, but that always felt very off character throughout the entire game and considering how everyone reacts to you.
<br>
<br>Other than that, I felt like there was a maybe too much of playable characters around, with little &quot;screen time&quot; for each, which left very little room for character development, of course, which was disappointing. The mini events that pop up during your travels and demand some choices felt more difficult to understand the consequences of and more punishing this time around, not as satisfying in &quot;building your own story&quot; as in the first game. There was even one key moment almost at the end where I had to load from a previous save point when I was shocked that I had apparently agreed to betray a significant section of my &quot;clan&quot;/caravan and leave them behind... And I was sure I was selecting a &quot;reasonable&quot; answer and trying to get everyone to get along...
<br>
<br>The main plot was rather mysterious and cryptic to me, what you learn of what is happening from Eyvind and Juno leaves you with more questions than answers, and, sure enough, the game ends in a cliffhanger in a very short last scene where you don&apos;t even understand what 3 main characters were trying to accomplish.
<br>I don&apos;t mind mystery, the world and lore in this game is full of it, and it&apos;s good, but when you&apos;re feeling almost constantly lost during the whole game, it&apos;s not very satisfying in the end.
<br>
<br>Because of all this, the game wasn&apos;t as enjoyable as the first one, even a little frustrating at times. The love I had towards some characters from the first game was what really kept me hanging on to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-banner-saga-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6409435">Expand</a></span>

The strategic gameplay is enjoyable too, AT FIRST.  Same for the depth of engagement you feel for making fair decisions with the caravan and dialogue.

<br>
<br>But then...you quickly realise that the choices you make, besides minor impact on morale /food, makes ZERO difference.  I repeat, ZERO difference.   And then the gameplay becomes repetitive, characters only have a minor variation in abilities so levelling up isn&apos;t so much fun as just a chore, and even what I thought was the holy grail of the game, getting sweet items, those items themselves there&apos;s just not enough of them.  So what does this mean?  It means this is less of a game and more of a &quot;watching boring movie with occassional tediuos fight scene thrown in&quot;.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s just not enough of this game either.  I felt sick when I saw the credits  appear.  So that was the entree, where&apos;s the main or dessert?  Seriously, this game should be sold as an expansion rahter than &quot;part 2&quot;.
<br>
<br>So I give it 3 big points for art, plus one for being almost there in concept.  The rest of it just got stale o-too-quickly.
<br>
<br>Go play chess online you&apos;ll have more fun.
<br>
<br>DEVS - please do the game justice in part 3 in another 10 years.  Make decisions really matter and have long-term consequences.  Make a bigger variety of strategies and characters and items.  Make gameplay and monsters more unique.   pull your finger out!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-banner-saga-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6393417">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game and the first are what I can only describe as &quot;experiences&quot;. It is a game you will play and REMEMBER!. Let me put it this way, the first game (The Banner Saga) came out 2 full years ago and when I loaded the second up, I was greeted by familiar faces and a story I was STILL invested in.

<br>Stop reading and go buy / play it NOW!

<br>Banner Saga II filled all the gaps that were missing or need work in first Banner Saga. Banner Saga II does not feel like a sequel, more like the second season of your favorite show which is a very good thing.
<br>* The story is even better this time;
<br>* Dialogues are so well written (way better than the first one);
<br>* Combat is so diverse and not forced;
<br>* Love camps;
<br>* Graphics are still amazing;
<br>*The art style is gorgeous.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m so glad I supported first Banner Saga on Kickstarter. This is truly amazing game. If next banner saga will be like this one or even better then I want 10 seasons of Banner Saga for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-banner-saga-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6310644">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I played the 1st Banner Saga Game and I totally loved how the player feels part of the story, taking decisions through the game will most of the time have consequences, sometimes some decisions will let your close companions be kill, the background music is awesome, the combat has innovative way using a pretty close point of view like real life (if your strength is low or you are wounded you will do less damage)
<br>
<br>In Banner Saga 2 for the few hours I was able to play in the first day, I knew it was going to be another success game from Stoic Developers since they took the enough time and were opened from feedback to add new features to this 2nd part of the saga. what I love of this game is that you will never expect what is going to happened, yesterday while I was playing I decided to help in a specific situation and the result for that action was something I never expected Emotic&#xF3;n frown
<br>
<br>I was wondering what will happened when characters reach max stats and Stoic team add the talents features, which is awesome allowing the player to choose once more their path to victory with those talents that will make the difference in combat when the odds are against you.
<br>
<br>Here is a nice review I saw long long time ago in a website when I was researching for Banner Saga game before I decided to purchase.
<br>
<br>&quot;Risk in gameplay: A lot of modern games play it safe- you know you&apos;ll defeat the evil and save the day. In The Banner Saga you can&apos;t take anything for granted. We want it to feel like a good tv mini-series; the world doesn&apos;t revolve around you, it&apos;s about how you deal with change.&quot;
<br>
<br>In overview this is my favorite game from many many RPG, Strategy games I had been playing in my life but what I love for both games are how you develop the story based on your decisions which in many situations involves life or death in this breaking world of Banner Saga which I never saw in any other game which this make innovative and attractive game for that and many other reasons. I am really impressed that a small team can develop a great game like this. Like I use to say &quot;Small things, can do a big difference&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-banner-saga-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6317100">Expand</a></span>

<br>- very short story (i finished the game in just 2 days)
-disappointing ending (the choice you make in the end doesn&apos;t count, it is also not a real ending, just a set up for the sequel)
-no voiced characters (that ruins almost 90% of my immersion into the game)

so:

<br>gameplay: 8/10 (it would be better for me if you could have more awesome skills like the arrow trap/ the flaming pitch/ the lightning , the others are all pretty much the same stabbing over and over)
<br>story: 10/10 (very interesting characters, very interesting story).

In the first game of the finals was more smooth, then simply chopped off at the finish line. There are many questions left unsolved. Less intense battles and situations less interesting characters. The rest is all the same amazing game. Hopefully the third part will not fail and will be a spectacular ending saga.</span>

<br>Favorite Thing: Great gameplay and story. Looking forward to The Banner Saga 3.
<br>Least Favorite Thing: The ending was very abrupt with no cliffhanger. I was honestly surprised when it ended.
<br>
<br>Playtime: 16h
<br>Enjoyment: 8/10
<br>Recommendation: Definitely. Make sure to play the first one too.</span>

<br>I must have taken screenshots every 5 minutes &#x2013; the art is fantastic. Every landscape is a wonder to behold and this beautiful world is a great backdrop to the terrifying, cruel and desperate things unfolding in it.
<br>Playing the game felt like Star Wars without a guaranteed happy ending, with death-defying odds, plot twists, tough decisions, soul-gripping soundtrack and engaging writing. Be ready to sweat and worry, as you try to keep your characters alive, no joke.
<br>If the tough combat gets too challenging and you&#x2019;re not a fan of deep strategy or tactics &#x2013; no worries. Change the difficulty to Easy and enjoy the game &#x2013; you don&#x2019;t need to be a chess master to play this.
<br>Taking in to consideration all of the above, I&#x2019;d say that The Banner Saga 2 has something for everyone. I highly recommend it &#x2013; give this experience a try and you&#x2019;ll be surprised how easily it will grow on you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-banner-saga-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6930104">Expand</a></span>

<br>The first part of &quot;The Banner Saga&quot; was a great complete game and it had enourmous replayability. But even in the middle of the second one, I already started to have mixed feelings. No, you will still want to know how it all ends. It becomes more reading a good story, rather than playing it yourself, not saying about having any impact on it, because you haven&apos;t any!
<br>
<br>Also the story this time seems to be a bit short. An interesting end awaits you, but except this, there&apos;s nothing new. No new interesting art, no new characters that you don&apos;t want to lose during your adventure, etc. Nothing really new.
<br>
<br>The battles are upgraded. These were brilliant in the first one, but, yes, they became even better. Still you will find nothing really new and special here.
<br>
<br>Surely the story continues and I just hope it will become better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-banner-saga-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6790502">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Still looks good, but also still has very little animation
-Music does what it sets out to do, but its nothing memorable
-The story picks up right where it left off, which is good because there was a major cliffhanger in the first game
