A massive and undeniably beautiful open world with only a handful of things to do over and over.
<br>
<br>First and foremost, let me just say that this should NOT be played singleplayer. The characters and dialog are so unbelievably one dimensional that you will find yourself groaning as every single attempt at humour falls flat. Throw between one and three friends into the mix and there it is possible to glean some entertainment out of this.
<br>
<br>Taking on a fortified base in complete silence, synchronising shots with your sniper buddy while your two man ground team move in the shadows. There is no denying how much of a badass you will feel when you nail that headshot or wipe out an entire squad of enemies in a single flurry of sniper fire. Even when things don&apos;t go to plan, the subsequent firefights are hectic and sometimes hilarious.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, you will find yourself doing the same thing every half hour. There are side missions you can tackle, but the variety is extremely lackluster. Trigger a radio antenna then race to another, defend a radio when it broadcasts rebel propaganda, steal a guarded chopper/plane or stop and tag a supply convoy. That&apos;s basically it. There are so many tactics that can be applied to complete these objectives, but you will quickly find the best method and this suddenly becomes routine and dull.
<br>
<br>There is a nice level of customisation with your character&apos;s gear and weapons, allowing you to spend literally hours tweaking your setup and making yourself look as professional or as goofy as possible. Sadly, the game is lacking in the &quot;goofy&quot; aspect, instead trying for force the serious tone of the game. There are weapon paints available such as bright red or pink, but surprise surprise, you have to pay extra for them.
<br>
<br>In my personal opinion, you can get ten times the enjoyment out of GTA:Online, which doesn&apos;t limit you to four players, has PVP if that&apos;s your bag, and is constantly being updated for free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7287778">Expand</a></span>

<br>I prefer to play stealth but it&apos;s fcking annoying to do the same basic strat on every outpost. Fly in, mark with drone and let your ai kill every 30 secs 3 targets.
<br>
<br>In level 15, near 16. 17 is max level if you wanna unlock skills, otherwise it&apos;s considered prestige/bonus levels after 17.
<br>Microtransactions are ridiculous. I don&apos;t wanna talk about that kinda low ass money begging behaviour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7080582">Expand</a></span>

While the gameworld is immense and nice to look at, it is a chore to interact with. The gameplay is fun for the first few hours, but this is Ghost Recon in name only, as a lack of tactical options makes the gameplay repetitive.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>+ Open world is immense and very pretty
<br>+ Bullet physics are excellent, with realistic velocity and no bullet sponge enemies
<br>+ Three squadmates that you can Sync Shot with
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>- Open world doesn&apos;t change with your actions other than more rebel patrols. Bases respawn with enemies and SAM sites respawn to screw with air travel that is not fun to begin with.
<br>- Both enemy factions, the Cartel and the Unidad military, shoot you on sight because disguises are apparently beyond the skill of your spec ops team.
<br>- Being engaged on sight is a problem because Unidad spawns UNLIMITED enemies GTA-style, which forces you to retreat. These f*ckers can cause mission failure as they randomly patrol mission areas.
<br>- Those extra rebel patrols? They are designed to &quot;help&quot; you by engaging the Cartel or Unidad when they&apos;re searching for you. They helpfully draw enemies into your area when you&apos;re trying to hide, and helpfully shoot those lieutenants you need to keep alive to interrogate.
<br>- Vehicles have wet noodle physics inspired by Police Quest in the 80&apos;s. Try landing a plane with no gauges on a landing strip shorter than your driveway.
<br>- Your squadmates cannot be ordered to give suppressing fire, or be positioned individually, or have their loadouts modified, or do anything other than Sync Shot
<br>- Higher level missions can instafail due to inexplicable time limits, or being spotted by an enemy, or other designs that are lazy rather than challenging
<br>
<br>On the rare occasion GRW tries to be inventive, it ends up failing miserably. Example: you need to protect a target from the Cartel on his way to the airport. Said target drives away from you quickly, so if you stop to engage the Cartel the mission fails. Since you can&apos;t clear out the first Cartel cluster that shows up and ALL enemies of the same faction have the same status in the gameworld, you end up aggro&apos;ing the whole city. As you drive through enemy fire, rebels helpfully stop in the middle of the road to slow you down. The first Unidad patrol that spots the action gets drawn in, which begins their unlimited spawning circus. Now that there are more enemies than bullets in your inventory, the guy you need to protect gets out of his damaged car to cower in a corner.
<br>
<br>GRW was a solid 7 the first dozen or so hours. But the gameplay gets progressively worse due to repetition in tactics and mission design that is lazy at best, and piss poor at worst. As a sum of it&apos;s parts, I would score GRW firmly in the red.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7476949">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dont get me wrong the game is pretty fun. But I would remmonend to play it with friends. It is an Ubisoft game so some bugs and awful servers are preprogrammed. Stealth is only optional, not too hard but gives no reward other than you wont die in seconds. or you call a mortar strike, rush in and shoots everyone with your lmg. Also the enemies can handle 4 to 5 shots wearing nothing besides pants, while yourself are getting killed by 6 bullets wearing bulletproof clothes.
<br>
<br>As I said. Its Ubisoft. Dont expect to much, but maybe you will be surprised.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7078636">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>its a decent game, quite fun in short bursts. unfortunately its also very bland/vanilla with nothing special about it whatsoever. very ubisoft. on my ps4 pro it ran fine however i found the controls vastly inferior to pc. on pc though with a gtx 1070 i was struggling to hit 60fps</span>

<br>I decided to do my review now after spending about 50+ hours playing, maxing out my character and finding almost all the collectables - and I still have plenty to do, however that replayability will be limited once you have essentially seen and done everything that Ghost Recon Wildlands has to offer.
<br>
<br>Even though I&apos;ve enjoyed my time playing the game, yes its FUN to play - its also frustrating and in classic ubisoft style - its full of bugs and glitches it is simply not finished right now and needs some big patches to fix a lot of the bugs, some of which are hilirious but totally ruin the co-op immersion.  There is also a considerably amount of design flaws which seriously are stupid such as chain link fences which you can ram and destroy with vehicles, but you can&apos;t destroy them with grenades or C4.
<br>
<br>Stealth vs Loud;  The former is one of the problems with the game as quite a few missions require perfect stealth to complete otherwise its instant fail and you have to restart; many of these are nearly impossible in public co-op for the obvious reasons, whilst failing or dying has little consquence it can become annoying having to keep backtracking in order to complete the missions and as for death, put it simply you&apos;ll die -  most of the time you&apos;ll suffer WTF deaths or unfair deaths due to narcos or unidad spawning from thin air, this issue still persists and really ruins a lot of the fun when your suddenly surrounded by 10+ unidad troopers + attack helios in the space of 20 seconds,  the balance here is just horrible,  not to mention the unidad can, and will often disrupt your missions and even sometimes causing you to fail the missions just because &apos;they can&apos;
<br>
<br>The AI is horrible,  your team mates are literally just tag alongs most of the time- in fact, if you had the option to go alone it probably would be better since they are that dumb.  Enemy AI is broken as well, some enemies function with zero brain functions and will just allow you to kill them easily, others will know exactly where you are at all times - they&apos;ll shoot through walls, fire mortars - enemy helicopters will circle you constantly until you can kill them,  and by the way? Totally forget about surviving against unidad apache gunships.
<br>
<br>Driving is also a major problem and needs tweaking, this was one of the major concerns in the beta.  Its essentially doesn&apos;t work very well, cars and ground vehicles feel like they wobble sometimes and its very easy to lose control, Helicopters are even worst and takes a lot of practice before you can fly like a pro; as for destroying targets in helios...forget about it, not happening.
<br>
<br>Wildlands greatest assest is the eye candy, They really made Bolivia look spectular, the graphics are 10/10 easily but its a shame about the rest - potentially in a years time Wildlands will be an awesome game but right now;  be prepared for many issues.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>
<br>Awesome Graphics and Scenery
<br>Plenty of collectables
<br>Good co-op experience
<br>Fun to play
<br>Character and Weapon Customization
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>
<br>Bugs and glitches everywhere
<br>Bad A.I
<br>Unidad soldiers are very unbalanced
<br>Bad Driving mechanics
<br>Potentially P2W
<br>Micro-transactions</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7073580">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played this entire game CO-OP with my friend and taken the most realistic approach to every scenario in the game, I&apos;ve got 68 hours played and I&apos;ve enjoyed every moment of it. I&apos;ve seen a lot of people complaining about texture issues and bugs, but I haven&apos;t experienced any of them yet so I can&apos;t put that into my review.
<br>The map is quite beautiful and so far I&apos;ve enjoyed every single zone, the weather has felt dynamic and realistic. That&apos;s a very nice detail! I can&apos;t say how much I enjoy the sound of the doors opening and closing on cars and the sound of the rain hitting things. It&apos;s a very nice detail.
<br>I&apos;ve got some issues with how some of the vehicles feel weightless and the helicopter controls are a bit wonky but if you just figure out how they work, they&apos;re not a big problem. I can&apos;t say that any of the physics have really made me enjoy the game less. I&apos;ve seen a lot of people complaining about missions failing when you get detected, and I can&apos;t agree fully with them that it&apos;s a bad thing. If you take a nice slow approach to most missions, you&apos;ll get in and out fine without any hassle. Just plan it out, recon the area a bit and just be silent. I felt like I was really working towards taking El Sue&#xF1;o down bit by bit by bit. I didn&apos;t go to complete each of the four pillars one at a time, but I spread out. First I took down a buchon here, then another one here, just because I wanted it to feel more authentic. And it did. Like I said earlier, the game is really what you make it, like most open world games are.
<br>Those are my two cents and I&apos;d recommend this game to anyone who&apos;s like me, really.
<br>
<br>By the way, to everyone who says this is the most pathetic excuse of a tripple-A title, did you even see Mass Effect Andromeda? Jesus Christ.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7171511">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not an RPG, but I got used to the role of the commando, and really felt like a soldier in a foreign country. The tasks I mainly took place via stealth, and when I noticed the enemies (which was often enough, hah), I love to shoot - shooting here is excellent. As for missions... Yeah, they are mostly monotonous and without great performances - only gameplay, but every time you don&apos;t know what will come of the next passage is a typical mission, the replay value is wonderful. I played with friends and with computer partner and computer partner I liked. I felt better the world and get used to the role of a soldier. Yes, sometimes there are bugs, Yes, car physics are not very good, but this game is no worse than MGSV of Mafia3. In this game the plot is primitive, but the mission real soldiers not in the style of GTA5. I&apos;m really pleased with the lore of world, and background for the bosses. The game is not perfect, but commendable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7073618">Expand</a></span>

<br>First of all, let us get right to the good parts. The world is awesome, the charactersmith (while lackluster in the long run) is awesome and so is the Gunsmith. I would also like to cite down many of the characters in the game being awesome. I took a real liking to Bowman and many of the minor bosses who all had distinct personalities - with some you actually feel quite a bit of sympathy for.
<br>
<br>The problem is how this interlocks with the story. The story is average; mostly because the overall objective itself is not the story; the smaller battles waged against the local boss are. While the self-contained areas are nice, it feels crappy that they are not affecting the larger story or the world in general. Plot advances should have affected the world. As for the ending(s), I have only this to say. I confronted El Sueno with 100% Cartel Destabilisation and now I have to do it all over again just to see a different ending? **** that, the ending I got was satisfying enough and I do not see why it is called the &quot;Bad&quot; ending. Speaking of that, since I already had 100% destabilisation, I really ought to get the other ending at once.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise, the game is lauded as the best of Ubisofts Open World Formula. I do not agree, because such a system would obviously have the outpost system from Far Cry or something very similar to it. There is no way to secure more ground save for the unlocked safe houses and no way to actually see the rebels advance.
<br>
<br>As for Vehicles, they are still a mess. Driving is far more complicated than it has to be, Armed Helicopters have no way of aiming your weapons making any sort of air support or air assaults futile.
<br>
<br>Having completed the game solo, all I can express is disappointment over the AI Companions who are dumb as bricks and can do exactly three things well. Running alongside you and just shooting is not one of them.
<br>
<br>I have also played a lot of Co-Op. This is a lot more fun but here there are issues here too. While flying, there are A LOT of freezes and that is just infuriating. The fact that squad banter is bugged here too since &quot;everyone&quot; is Nomad is just silly.
<br>
<br>The integration with NVIDIA Ansel is a great idea but poorly executed. The latests patch that was supposed to fix many of the bugs simply added new ones.
<br>
<br>Before the game was released, I made a point that some of the things brought up in the Beta would not affect my decision to purchase the game. They do however affect the total score and I will hold off with the season pass until I notice some real improvement.
<br>
<br>The lack of AI Customization, the rather stupid behaviour of the AI Ghosts, the somewhat disjointed story that do not affect the game world all drags what is otherwise a pretty awesome game.
<br>
<br>Total Score: 75 out of 100.
<br>Holt out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7094357">Expand</a></span>

<br>Have spent roughly 6 hours with friends playing and am thoroughly enjoying it.  The storyline isn&apos;t lackluster, but it isn&apos;t a Scott Ridley Blockbuster either.  There is a lot to do in this game and the map is freaking huge.  The terrain is definitely challenging and at times I find myself wanting to rage quite after trying to take a short cut on a motorbike and slamming head first into a tree or hidden rock.  Can be quite painful at times to manuever.
<br>
<br>We all set the difficulty setting to Advanced instead of Normal and it offers a nice challenge in the game rather than just a shoot to kill scenario.  Experience isx rewarded for playing as a team, syncing shots, silent takedowns, marking enemies, freeing hostages, shutting down generators etc. etc.
<br>
<br>The Skill Point system is a little clunky.  There are some excellent perks to sink points into (Full attributes in Stamina = Unlimited Run), however others are not really required.
<br>
<br>Having played Watchdogs 2, the drone aspect is always a lot of fun.
<br>
<br>Overall Co-Op gameplay is a lot of fun.  Having 3 mates parachute out of the sky into the hot zone whilst you fly around in an apache, or team mates busting down the door with APC&apos;s or gattling gun jeeps in just a lot of fun.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>Graphics look amazing (Geforce 1080GTX)
<br>Co-Op Play is seriously fantastic. Having 4 helicopters flying around is just a lot of fun
<br>Combat is clean, with reasonable intelligent AI
<br>Storyline is ok. Some will criticize this as being insufficient.
<br>Boats, APC&apos;s, Helicopters, Apache&apos;s, Cars, Bikes, loads of different vehicles.  Some with some sweet armaments too.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Terrain. I f**king hate rocks :(
<br>Objectives are generally go Kill this or hey see that, blow it up.  Some additional options of diplomacy or faction based warfare would be amazing here.
<br>Minor syncing glitches (It is Ubisoft &amp; it is release day). Patching should fix these issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7053092">Expand</a></span>

First encounters AI is like pretty much in every other game. Sneak, kill, whatever.

<br>Once you get past the easy areas and try something harder the AI start to shine in a way I have never seen before, and I&apos;ve seen a lot. It&apos;s simply mind blowing, they will call the army to hunt you down, there are going to be inbound choppers on your location, the AI will pin you down and try to flank you in every possible way. They will leave their base and come to rush you on open areas!  You will try and run and hide and they will pursue, in the night, with flashlights, through the grass, use the terrain to their advantage and every other trick in the book. And you are going to die for every stupid stunt you&apos;re trying to pull against the AI. You&apos;re going to die a lot, just like in real life combat. And all that on a map so huge you&apos;re not going to believe it&apos;s even possible. My mind was completely blown.
<br>The images will still haunt you for hours after you are done playing. The beautiful scenery, the amazing gameplay and the frightening close to reality AI all make for a massive true war zone like experience like I never had experienced before. 10/10 from me on this one guys, it&apos;s a must for every military simulation nut out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7056208">Expand</a></span>

<br>The most garbage excuse for a AAA game I&#x2019;ve ever seen.
<br>Allow me to get my angry joe on for a moment, because ubisoft, yuh done **** it up
<br>Not just ghost recon wildlands, but video games in general if you think that in any way this is an acceptable $60 release
<br>This is the laziest piece of garbage put onto market for $60 in recent memory
<br>This game is just a bunch of side quests on a dead, but beautiful map
<br>this generic drug lord story is so throw away that the game doesn&#x2019;t even make you bother taking out all of the underbosses and making your way up to the final show down
<br>after killing just 2 targets the game told me I can go kill the final boss right now or continue cleaning up the map
<br>meaning you can literally beat this game in less than 4 hours
<br>it took me a little long because I decided to play online and do the other missions around the map&#x2026;
<br>missions that in the end don&#x2019;t really matter.. Cause again, the final boss is right there... drive up to his gates and activate a cut scene, ding... gold trophy...
<br>This is a scary scary indication of what ubisoft plants to do with its lack of narrative focus&#x2026;
<br>this is let&#x2019;s play streamer garbage&#x2026;
<br>the story is forced in this map to trick you into believing this is an actual full-fledged AAA release, buts it&#x2019;s not
<br>it&#x2019;s a giant map with weightless vehicles to drive around, 1 garbage radio station because that&#x2019;s how much ubsioft believed in this title&#x2026; and a bunch of side missions and collectibles to upgrade your character to do with 3 of your friends for 20 hours.
<br>Missions that are literally the worst kind&#x2026;
<br>time trials... auto fails if you&#x2019;re detected... do not kill the target&#x2026;
<br>thanks but no thanks&#x2026;
<br>You can be calculating if you want, taking out binoculars or flying your drone in there, syncing up shots&#x2026; The gunplay feels nice
<br>but again... with a lack of any true narrative&#x2026;you don&#x2019;t feel like you&#x2019;re working towards anything&#x2026; you feel like you&#x2019;re wasting your time... and quite frankly you are&#x2026;
<br>The games boring, the missions are trash, if you don&#x2019;t plan on playing with your friends.. Stay away from this garbage&#x2026;
<br>Ubisoft put no real effort or heart into this at all.
<br>I give Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Wildlands

<br>To start off, this game is EXTREMELY repetitive. Compare this game to Horizon Zero Dawn for example. It has a good story, cut-scenes, the world is smaller but more dense. There are only 5 Cauldrons, 6 Bandit Camps, limitied number of side quests etc. meaning the different mechanics isn&apos;t being milked/overused like they are in all Ubisoft games.
<br>
<br>Wildlands has essentially no story worth speaking of other than the backstory of all the cartel members. All quests, no matter the goal (destroy something, interrogate someone, defend a place, gather intel), simply consists of infiltrating a base either by stealth or frontal assault. No matter the quest, this is all you do. The weapon chests, intel locations, side activites litter the entire map so after doing 20 of each you&apos;re so fed up with it that you&apos;d rather kill yourself than doing it again.
<br>
<br>In the end it boils down to how well the developers manages to hide the repetitiveness of the game. And Ubisoft does a very poor job with this, just like they do with all their open world games. They simply lack a soul. In GTA 5 the missions are so well designed (riding a motorbike on top of a train, climbing the ouside of a scyscraper, doing bank heists, driving a submarine etc) that it doesn&apos;t feel repetitive. Compared to Horizon, GTA 5 and Witcher 3 for example, this game feels extremely bland, repetitive and soulless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7096329">Expand</a></span>

So if you&apos;re looking for an open world game with tons to do, a massive map, more customization than you can shake a stick at, and an atmosphere similar to Far Cry but in third person - you&apos;re going to love this game.  The only reason I bought it is because I wanted to play a game that deals with the drug trade and the cartels.  I&apos;ve watched all the documentaries and TV shows - Miami Vice, Cocaine Cowboys, Sicario, Clear and Present Danger etc..etc.  Always wanted to play a game that delt with this theme and it is finally hear.  The story is actually good - I think most people are annoyed at how the execution of the missions gets boring.  Honestly I&apos;m not even halfway thru and I&apos;m not bored at all.  Obviously its more exciting playing online but I find it equally rewarding playing solo and using the AI yourself.   The one caveat I have is to play it on the hardest setting (the way it is meant to be played) or else you won&apos;t find it as enjoyable.  When you take down a camp it will feel like you just accomplished something - otherwise yes it will feel repetitive and pointless.  7/10 is about right for a rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7088440">Expand</a></span>

The friendly AI seemed dumb and unhelpful, and the way the vehicles controlled and interacted with the world just felt off. Fortunately, the final release seemed to have resolve those issues (at least somewhat).  Driving still doesn&apos;t feel great (which is somewhat worrying considering one of the DLCs is focused on street racing) but it&apos;s better than it was in the beta. Friendly AI seems much more capable and plentiful making using them as a tool/distraction is much more viable. The weapon variety is good and the customization is fairly robust, but most of the weapons often feel like they don&apos;t really have the punch you&apos;d expect, especially against vehicles or when in open combat. The open world is huge, and while I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s empty, it certainly feels like there could have been more (or the map could have been smaller). All in all, this game doesn&apos;t feel like a Ghost Recon game, but it&apos;s fun nonetheless. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a great game or one worth buying at full price (especially if you don&apos;t have friend to play with), but it&apos;s worth giving a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7090144">Expand</a></span>

It offers a tactical experience to play solo or in a 2-4 players Co-op mode.
<br>If you play this game in the single player mode, the rest of your team will be AI controlled, but I have to say that it&#x2019;s not as good, or as fun as playing it online with friends. And I have to say that this game is amazing to play with friends (or with random players via matchmaking in a borderlands style system, so you can play with friends or with other players even if you are at different points in the story and the game will still grant you some Xp for helping them with missions you already completed.) You can switch from Sp to Co-op on the fly at any time.
<br>Character creation and customization is really good, I loved it and without being as deep as it would be in an MMO it&#x2019;s still amazing for a game like this.
<br>Stealth is your best ally but you can also launch frontal assaults, or something in the middle, it&#x2019;s totally up to you. You will find out that you can complete your missions in different ways. To achieve that, you have several weapons at your disposal and accessories to choose from.
<br>Gameplay wise, it feels like a mix of other games like Far Cry 4, GTA, the division, etc. but that&#x2019;s not bad if you enjoy that kind of games.
<br>I am having a lot of fun with my friends playing, I like the freedom I get to do the missions in different styles, although they can get repetitive, which has been highly criticized and I agree, secondary missions are repetitive. I supposed they made it that way so the game can artificially feel longer (this is a common issue with open world games in general), but at least you can be creative so playing them after several times can still be fun.
<br>The enemies can be though and they can be a real challenge at some points, where the best thing to do is just run instead of face them, a quiet outpost can quickly become a war zone. Enemies will hunt you down and it will get nasty, so team work is very important. Be prepared to die a lot here. I like a good Co-op challenge and GRWL has it.
<br>There are a lot of Vehicles to choose from and Imo they are not as bad as people say, choppers and airplanes are actually fun after some practice and jumping from them with a parachute is amazing. Ground vehicles are a bit clunky but decent, same with boats.
<br>There is a skill point advancement system that will make you and your team become even more efficient.
<br>The game needs more polish and It has bugs, but they are not game breaking and they can be fixed with patches.
<br>Bolivia looks stunning, I enjoy the huge and open landscapes the game has, it&#x2019;s really impressive with so many zones and biomes, a night and day cycle and dynamic weather, a beautiful eye candy.
<br>The story is ok, a bit generic at some points, but it didn&#x2019;t get boring and the bosses have a lot of personality and a lot of background, if you like to follow the always optional files and leads you will enjoy this part too.
<br>To sum up: GRWL is fun if you play with friends, it offers a lot of freedom and possibilities, its huge. On the negative side, it can get repetitive, but if you love co-op you should really give it a chance.
<br>I love Ghost Recon Wildlands, I really do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7205494">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>New ubisoft franchises like for honor and the division? Mostly suck... Pretty sad when south park games are your best bet with ubisoft because they are at least kind of funny...
<br>
<br>See a trend here fellas? Whenever they do a half way decent job it&apos;s &quot;meh&quot; at best. You don&apos;t see them pulling a chrono trigger or ocarina of time now do you?
<br>
<br>Wild lands is the same ubisoft trash... Remember what crowbcat has proven kids... Ubisoft downgrades. They make their stuff look great at E3 and then deliver trash for the most part or something worse than what was shown. Do any ubisoft games have a 9 or higher on metacritic? I don&apos;t think so and even if they do I know it&apos;s a low 9. Like I said. This company never wows anyone who has a brain and taste in the gaming world.
<br>
<br>Anyways this game blows because it&apos;s the division with terrible vehicles, terrible controls, terrible physics, it&apos;s online only, it&apos;s boring, it&apos;s very unrealistic, the servers suck, the open world style is lack luster, Missions are very repetitive, The AI is very stupid etc etc...
<br>
<br>The only good thing I can tell is that it has some kool character and weapon customization but hey... This is a video game guys. Not barbies dress up...
<br>
<br>I give this trash a 4 out of 10 and that&apos;s being generous. Most would give it about a 6 or 7 but most don&apos;t have good taste so a 4 is right for the kind of gamer who has good taste and doesn&apos;t pull the opinion card like a moron. Opinions aside guys... Facts are facts. A game like Ocarina of time is in fact a great game. A game like big rigs is in fact a totally crappy game. And a game like wild lands is somewhere in between. Ocarina of time factually made with care and great detail. Big rigs was factually not... Wildlands is meh...
<br>
<br>It&apos;s worth a rental to play for maybe a couple days if you&apos;re that bored and one of those morons who likes to support micro transaction games... Other than that. Please... Just pass up this sorry excuse for a video game just like pretty much every game ubisoft rushes out the door. Go play breath of the wild. Go play Horizon. Don&apos;t waste your time with trash from ubisoft...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7073229">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, i agree - coop can do everything better. But let&apos;s be clean - in this case, you and your friends are the main sources of fun - nothing of it coming from the game itself. Try it solo to feel it - it&apos;s dead empty sandbox.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7050854">Expand</a></span>

Gunplay is bad, ai allies and enemy bad, vehicles controls are insanely terrible, mission are incredibly repetitive its gets old after 3 missions and the open world is empty its way to big for no reason at all. Giving this game 8 and 10 when MGS5 exist is pretty retarded but you have to expect white knight defending it because it got next to no good feedback in the beta ive never seen anything like it people where legit pissed and i understand this isnt ghost recon its a GTA online watch dogs far cry machup and a bad one. Im giving it a 4 because it can really be fun with friends. People saying it is good have nothing good to say except its a good game they cant point out whats good because its not good its fun with friends but far from good. And comparing this garbage to MGS5 is pretty retarded</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7051269">Expand</a></span>

<br>por esto pondr&#xE9; un 10 para balancear a favor porque este juego merece un 8 o tan siquiera un 7.9 y solo por esto pongo un 10 por que el juego merece una mejor calificaci&#xF3;n por parte de nosotros
<br>
<br>y solo actualizan sus drivers y solo compra el season pass si eres un verdaderisimo Ghost Recon fan, por que no eres fan de toda esta saga de Tom Clancy</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7060259">Expand</a></span>

It has a really appealing environment since its ecosystem is really diverse. Reason why I just got really immersed into the game. The projectile mechanics are  realistic and you can complete the mission at your own way, with your own methods and without following specific checkpoints. However I find some deplorable aspect cs on the game. Particularly the vehicles glitch and the AI of  the enemies, and your allies is not bad but it could be better. Then I would criticize the voice acting, all the Bolivian characters(without the narcos or gangsters which are Mexicans) had a Mexican accent. When they are speaking on Spanish, they have a Mexican accent instead of speaking like Bolivians with their respective slangs(I know that because I live in Bolivia )so basically i felt that the voice acting limited the experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7059650">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+ Best looking game to date. The graphics are stunning.
<br>+ Good performance and configuration options. Ultra settings are demanding, but that is to be expected.
<br>+ Size of the world is unmatched I think and it feels very realistic.
<br>+ Great variation of landscapes and locations.
<br>+ Good shooting mechanics and weapon/movement controls.
<br>+ Many customizable weapons.
<br>+ Coop gameplay is very fun.
<br>+ Great attention to details in many areas of the game.
<br>
<br>= The story isn&apos;t great, but it serves well for an open world game like this. You get most information on the run and there are no interruptions, similar to The Division.
<br>
<br>- Some missions are incredibly badly designed, especially the ones where you have to protect NPCs.
<br>- Vehicle physics have a lot of room for improvement.
<br>- Mediocre squad AI. Too often they stand right next to the enemy in a fire fight and don&apos;t notice. Other times, they try to shoot things through walls or get run over by a train.
<br>- A few animations could be better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7069112">Expand</a></span>

People have said this is the pinnacle of all those games combined and to a certain extent, I agree.  There is also some Just Cause 3 in it.

<br>
<br>I did not get this game for multiplayer as so many have said it&apos;s much better.  I can see how that would be so if you go at it with people you know and friends.  But if you&apos;re playing multiplayer by joining a session, then you will be disappointed.  The map is too big and most of the time ur wasting trying to group up with unknown players.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m having a blast playing single player with no problem.  It&apos;s way better than any of the other games i&apos;ve mentioned above.  It still should have been 1st person like the classic original though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7058950">Expand</a></span>

<br>The lack of mission match making is a bit of an odd choice but it feels like it works. It seems like you hold a group together all night instead of 20 mins and build a understanding with players about playstyle. If you dont like theirs leave and try again.
<br>Feels like elderscrolls online with guns and grenades. With dungeons that role into roaming and dungeons and helicopter fights and stealing a lamborghini.

It was just a generic open world game with The Legend of Zelda slapped on the cover. Not much in this felt like a LoZ game and in my opinion that was a negative not a positive. Definitely the worst Zelda game I have ever played.</span>

There are bells and whistles and you can paint your gun and there map is covered in icon vomit, all of which distracts from the fact that the game is just no fun to actually play.
<br>
<br>The game is huge, the world is detailed and varied, and screwing around with friends is pretty fun. The problem is that the minute-to-minute gameplay is horrifically unsatisfying. If we&apos;re going to make a game whose main draws are exploration, stealth, and shooting, wouldn&apos;t you try to make those elements fun? If you answered yes, you&apos;ll never work at Ubisoft.
<br>
<br>Gunplay is barely serviceable. Aiming feels sluggish and the audio lacks weight and punch. My biggest gripe is that Wildlands has latched onto one of the most baffling trends in modern shooter design, something I like to call the &quot;Nerf&quot; effect. Rather than firing supersonic metal projectiles like guns in the real world, guns in Wildlands shoot slow moving, glowing nerf darts. Ostensibly this aesthetic is supposed to look like tracer fire, but it completely undermines the gritty, realistic feel the game is going for. When using assault weapons and sidearms at close range, the effect isn&apos;t too bad, but it completely ruins the immersion and fun of sniping. I LOVE the inclusion of bullet drop, but it&apos;s taken to risible extremes in this game. It feels less like shooting highpowered rifles and more like lobbing novelty mini footballs.
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t spend too much time on the vehicles, except to say they&apos;re horrible. Cars and track are decent, but the control scheme for the helicopter is - without hyperbole -  one of the worst things I&apos;ve ever experienced in a game.
<br>
<br>The story is blah - the big bad is pretty cool but the plot + dialogue are generic tough-guy inanity.
<br>
<br>This, look so many of other of Ubi&apos;s recent games, feels like a piece of software created by a focus group rather than a team of passionate gamers and developers. It&apos;s big and shiny and as boring as the day is long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7072023">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The AI is a bit odd with them being pretty poor at shooting in a fire fight but superhuman at downing targets with SyncShot. I find I can stealth an attack but it usually falls apart when I get jumped by someone and it becomes a fire fight.
<br>
<br>There are insta fail missions but have yet to come across one that was frustrating to complete. For me the let down is in the constant respawning a la Far a cry 2, not generally too much of an issue when your moving from province to province but when you destroy all the SAM sites and have them respawning making helicopter travel in an area frustrating I do get a bit angry Joe.
<br>
<br>If you have a tolerance for repetition then go for it, I feel I will fizzle out before the end but 29hrs in I&apos;m still having a blast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7087340">Expand</a></span>

I found this game really amazing for those enjoy out-world game, huge wolrd, etc. I think it&apos;s cost alot of time to finish every achievement. The spectacular sence in Bolivia, the good shooting techniquie and skill builts, weapons building is awesome. However, I prefer stealth kill in most case, when enemy alarm, I cant restart this mission emedietely but wait until die or out to load main screen and go back. It&apos;s time consuming and make me anxious. Why Ubisoft does not do the same like Watch Dog 2? The is restart button. Next, the driving system is bad. For sure.  All in all, this game is worth buying and spend time for it. Now I am a fan of Tom Clancy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7081585">Expand</a></span>

<br>aside from it its an awesome experience, huge and varied maps and an endless possibilities of approaching every mission, the story as cartoonish as it seems reflects a reality in latin america (i am mexican and its like watching the news channel). great for coop!</span>

<br>If you look at the game as kind of a more &apos;realistic&apos;, multiplayer &apos;Just Cause&apos;, that focuses more on weapons and taking you time to do things, you&apos;ll have super fun.

However, I do think that this game would get pretty mundane pretty fast if you weren&apos;t goofing off with a few friends while playing it.

Coop is good fun and they got that part right generally, although there isn&apos;t much to do beneath the surface it is very very shallow. The world is nice and looks beautiful on ultra. There is some texture repetition etc and towns made with identical &quot;brushes&quot; so seen a few buildings you&apos;ve seen it all. Like a few other ubi titles they&apos;ve done away with doors which I find odd in 2017 game and all towns/bases etc are basically the same as each other. Oh what I&apos;d give for the door system from R6 Raven Shield with mouse wheel open (or click to kick in), with incremental stance from that too.
<br>
<br>The ballistics and spawn distances in this are terrible, longest kill I could get was 617m because I cannot get anything not to spawn, or not despawn if move out the AO, past that (all settings maxed) and there is spawn in real close on some missions. I blame most of that on console port style code. It is basically a shallow console port with graphical eye candy for PC folks added on. The ballistics including drop and penetration are terrible. The vehicle physics is broken IMHO and helis are bad although easy to fly there is a lot of annoying quirks that totally defy how helis work (I don&apos;t want DCSworld style sim or even TOH/Arma, just some recognition of physics). For instance having rudder on pad bumpers and cyclic on the stick and leaving collective on triggers would do. Second remove the weird physics and make them act like an arcade version of helo flight model so you could do some real manouvres and fly them properly. I do have sim gear but pad is fine for this kind of game and TIR, stick and pedal is PC only and raises the bar too much for a none sim so I don&apos;t think I ask for too much.
<br>
<br>The environment is nice though through snowy mountain to dense jungle, desert/salt flats, prairies etc that give distinct geography feel to regions. Enemies are not bullet sponges, although the player semi is even on high difficulties.The bad, as usual Ubi speciality of no real substance or content, I get the idea they have lot of graphic design staff and very little content creators. There is little to do except some the usual ubi collectible in place of content fare, mission templates are samey across the board from sidequest to story and story is poor so there isn&apos;t even that.
<br>
<br>Basically it would have been amazing with the same looks/world with better building variation. good ballistics, more varied mission templates and genuine content not placeholders for it like generic collectables ubi relies on. Add to that some good but entry level friendly vehicle physics and spawn distances and it&apos;d be one of the best modern games ever with real longevity. Adding the door system from R6RS and flexistance and some CQB/urban raid missions and it&apos;d probably be one of the best coop shooters of the next 15 years! Ubi have the cash but they always go for the lowhanging fruit of making another cookiecutter watchdogs/farcry clone with new branding/gfx instead of pushing the boat out sadly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7072984">Expand</a></span>

This thing isn&apos;t able even to launch, that&apos;s right, haven&apos;t being able yet to play it, although I bought it on launch day! And I&apos;m not the only one, just check their Forums. Ubisoft does nothing to solve this, so, just go and spend your money somewhere else!</span>

<br>
<br>I know this is not a proper review of a game but I thought this would still be useful, as more people may purchase the game and find out that they can&apos;t play it.
<br>
<br>I will update this review when the developers fix the game and allow me to give it a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7141815">Expand</a></span>

Sure, it has bugs, but they are mostly hilarious - nothing game breaking i have found from 30 hours gameplay so far.</span>

I also hear alot about &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; driving controls and I will say the ground vehicles were a bit squirrley, and It seemed like I couldn&apos;t fly a helicopter up and forward at the same time- but at least they don&apos;t want to fall out of the sky like Battlefield choppers. The spy drone mechanic was nice, but im wondering why the &quot;sync shot&quot; ability only works on one guy. You have a team of up to three AI guys backing you up, can&apos;t they shoot three enemies? There might be a way of doing this though, I didn&apos;t read up on the upgrade trees.
<br>
<br>It seems like the kind of game you could have left as a 6-10 hour pipe shooter without adding the illusion of additional game time via a freeroam mode. Based on what I&apos;ve seen so far, it&apos;s at least passably playable, but I&apos;ve played many other games that do what it does better. It&apos;s at least co-op focused, which already puts it a step above Rainbow Six: Siege.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7232770">Expand</a></span>

This is the first Ubisoft game I&apos;ve ever purchased and was sure I had made a mistake doing so after (buyers regret). However, I was incredibly surprised and have come to greatly enjoy this game.  I haven&apos;t played this in co-op, which seems to be the positive of this game from some, yet I am having a lot of fun in solo. Once I beat the game solo I will start rocking co-op with my buddies, but wanted to air it out that its not a &quot;must&quot; to enjoy WildLands, which was the impression I had going in. The story is lackluster and can easily be ignored. The graphics are a solid 8.5/10 and PC optimization is a 9/10 having surprisingly stable fps and no stuttering even during autosaves. (I own a 1080 FTW 2, Intel 6-6000K, 32gb Ram, ect). I&apos;d also like to note I have yet to encounter any bugs so far (60 hours). The civilian AI is programmed poorly, at times being annoying, where as the cartel AI is well done, which is good since theyre the ones you that shoot at you haha. There are lots of options for customizing your game experience from difficulty modes, hud options and the like to tailor to your liking. The game itself is huge and offers many tactical options to employ at your own discretion for quest you take. There are lots of weapons to obtain, side quest to complex and in-game lore to find. Last GTA game I played was GTA 4 and will say the vehicles for WildLands remind me of a GTA game, very arcadey, simple controls and just awful physics. If your buying this game expecting a military sim or any sort of realistic gameplay, you&apos;ll be disappointed. If your going into it like I did, expecting a casual, open world, military themed shooter, you&apos;ll be blown away and have lots of fun.  Overall this game is an easy 9/10 for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7313442">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Essence of the game: Kill all drug cartel fiefs (everyone cartel related really).
<br>
<br>Disliked:
<br>* Infinite respawn. If you die, all your clearing is for naught. If you move a couple of meters away from an area you&apos;ve cleared, your labor is for naught since all enemies and threats re-appear. This utterly kills the sense of achievement, and makes any kind of military strategy pointless. Take out 3 SAM sites in the belief that you can safely fly in the area. Haha, they&apos;re too far apart, so the first will respawn as you reach the third. Sigh.
<br>* Respawns in the most illogical location (e.g. in a small closet you just cleared, as soon as you turn your back to it). Greatly diminishes use of tactics.
<br>* The horrid zombie wave of cops in GTA is here re-skinned into Unidad (corrupt Bolivian military), but they&apos;ve been tuned up to be even more relentless than in GTA. This attribute coupled with the random spawning issue makes this game mechanic totally game and immersion breaking at times. Aweful aspect of the game which you&apos;ll come to hate with a passion.
<br>* No way to progress time. This is particularly annoying if you prefer doing certain activities in daylight and others at night. E.g. infiltration at night time and scouting at day. I hope UBI will fix this in future titles, as I had to leave the game running for half an hour, doing something else while waiting for the game to cycle 12 hours. Just a pointless time wasting limitation that greatly reduced the enjoyment.
<br>* The enemy AI I would say is OK compared to other FPS titles, but there&apos;s one annoying aspect to it. The AI has an incredible ability to immediately spot where you are if an enemy finds a dead buddy, or if you covertly snipe them from way afar. Either this was poor design, or a gimmick by UBI to force you into a shoot and move tactic. It&apos;s just not realistic that they can 100% pin-point your location by finding a dead comrade, or seeing a buddy hit the dirt by a single sniper bullet. Some uncertainty would be advised when UBI tunes their next title, as not even the best real world sniper will find his enemy from a single gun echo and bullet crack.
<br>* Horrid vehicle handling. Especially aircraft (planes and helicopters). Land vehicles were not great either. Rockstar and Bohemia have nailed vehicle driving. Why does UBI continue to fail when the have blueprints from the competition?
<br>* Cheap tricks employed to extend the game time. All the backtracking, the A+ search the level team used for placing items maximally away from you. Spawning zombies into the middle of your mission area (Unidad appearing out of nowhere when you&apos;re trying to infiltrate a Santa blanca stronghold, and calling in their infinite dead army, leading to you having to reload the game).
<br>* That the skill tree is gated by you having to do the most boring fetch quests (stop the same friggin convoy a billion times), where you need to increase a combination of 4 different counters. Each fetch quest gives you a small bump in one of those stats.
<br>
<br>Final verdict from me is a solid 7.4 / 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7480694">Expand</a></span>

It is a game where there is an enormous amount of stuff to do, and yet, almost all of the stuff is the same, and it is a game without a strong sense of progression.
<br>
<br>Your goal in Ghost Recon: Wildlands is to bring down a drug cartel which has taken over Bolivia. You do this by taking down a bunch of cartel bosses, who lead to their bosses, who lead to their bosses, who lead to the head of the cartel. The world map &#x2013; about 400 square kilometers of land &#x2013; is broken up into 20 or so regions, each of which is ruled over by a cartel leader. Within each area, you collect intel which leads to missions, which then get completed in order to unlock a confrontation with that area&#x2019;s leader, where you kill them, capture them, or cajole them into turning on their cartel masters. Beat two of these bosses from a single portion of the gang (Security, Influence, Production, or Smuggling), and you unlock the ability to take on that section&#x2019;s &#x201C;underboss&#x201D;. Beat all of these bosses, and you get to take on the boss of that section of the gang.
<br>
<br>The thing is, you can take these on in any order you want. As the game starts, you are dumped into Bolivia with a marker on your map to lead you to your first mission objective; after that point, you are introduced to the idea of how to get more missions, and you are let loose on the world.
<br>
<br>Because you can attack the bosses in any order, they don&#x2019;t really tie together very closely; each area has its own little self-contained story, which only really intersect in that you unlock additional story segments, in the form of little videos, after beating each area. However, these have to be pretty vague about which bosses you&#x2019;ve beaten, as there&#x2019;s no particular order to them, so it really just shows a growing sense of desperation by the cartel.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, this is really the only flavor there is in the game. This is a &#x201C;realistic&#x201D; game, and like many &#x201C;realistic&#x201D; games, it falls into the trap of making the enemies have very little sense of variety. All the enemies can be taken down with just a few bullets &#x2013; or often, a single bullet from a more powerful gun, like a sniper rifle &#x2013; which really robs the combat of any sense of diversity. There are vehicles, but in the end, there is very limited variety in vehicles &#x2013; there are the vehicles that are just cars with dudes in them, there are vehicles that have turrets on top of them, there are helicopters with dudes in them, and there are helicopters with turrets on them. In addition to &#x201C;dude with gun&#x201D; and &#x201C;dude with sniper rifle&#x201D;, that is the &#x201C;variety&#x201D; of enemies in the game, and you will experience all of them quite early.
<br>
<br>This leads to very, very limited variety in the sort of challenge you face. Worse, all missions basically are &#x201C;kill the dude/all the dudes&#x201D;, &#x201C;sneak into an area without being detected (while killing dudes along the way)&#x201D;, &#x201C;stop the dude and then interrogate them/put a tag on a vehicle you stopped&#x201D;, or &#x201C;kill some dudes and steal a vehicle that you drive off to some other location in&#x201D;. There are hundreds of these missions in the game, so they repeat not just frequently, but incessantly. Worse, even the set dressing on these missions repeats heavily; there&#x2019;s a set of missions which involve blowing open a radio station tower and then going in to shoot some people and hack a system within a time limit, and you do this mission something like nine times over the course of the game. Not even basically the same mission; exactly the same mission, just in different locations. The same goes for stealing planes/helicopters and flying supplies to hidden rebel bases, with the only real breaks there being a few missions where you must carefully avoid anti-aircraft systems (or, more likely, blow them up pre-emptively).
<br>
<br>Having a big world is pointless if it is just the same things over and over again, copy-pasted into 20 different areas, and that&#x2019;s precisely what Ghost Recon: Wildlands is. All the production values in the world can&#x2019;t disguise the samey, repetitive gameplay, and you will get bored with the game long before you get anywhere near the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7600914">Expand</a></span>

<br>I brought the game myself, but at a hugely discounted price due to pre-order bonus and Uplay club points, and I also got access to the Beta for free.
<br>
<br>The size of the map, the diversity of the locations, the wealth of customisation and the beauty of the scenerey are staggering. its a 10/10 on the ubisoft scale for a ubisoft open world game, ticking every box, even the little &quot;fake life&quot; that goes on with kids kicking balls around a dusty town.
<br>
<br>But like most Ubisoft games this is a facade, you spend any time looking, its easy to see through. you start shooting in a crowded civillian area, the civillians arae just as likely to duck down in the middle of a road, or run straight into your gunfire. and between settlements there is very little beyond lush jungles, perfect for walking on foot.
<br>
<br>Talking about the large map, in other Ubisoft games, placing a map pointer at the far end of the map will give you a 5KM waypoint, it will be enjoyable to get there, in Wilalnds, placing even a close by mission marker may beat least 3KM, and you regularly feel you want to rush there by a car or helicopter, the game does little to encourage you to drive slow and take in the beautiful scenerey.
<br>
<br>As for gameplay, its solid. there are some criticisms on bullet drop, but mostly if you shoot someone, they go down.
<br>
<br>AI is a hot topic. i have sometiems had it where AI have been laser accurate in knowing my position, but in my recent multiplayer session we were attacking an enemy base, we got spotted and they sent a patrol out. we fled to the nearby hills and watched from drones as they got out of cars, patrolled the area, gave up, got back into their cars and drove away. now this wasnt perfect, it took a few minuts for the AI to figure out where the road was, and some Ai even took random civillian vehicles.
<br>
<br>the story is, limited at best. you spend so much time not focusing onthe story, but there are some things to read between the lines. i have seen many reviews saying its just some &quot;hoorah&quot; shooter where you can solve all problems by shooting enough people, and while the gamplay my make you believe that, listening to kingslayer files and idle AI chatter will make you realise that the story does go a bit deeper, but similar to many games, this is just giving story from found tapes and doccuments NOT showing you the story.
<br>
<br>In short, this game is mercenaries 3 with elss boom, a boring just cause, a fun (but limited ARMA 3) and i have even seen people compare it to MGSV without the rich story and heritage.
<br>
<br>the world is big, beautiful and bold, with clearly defined gameplay which will allow you to stray from it in co-op, but dont expect the game to get on well with you if you try to break the games rules. thoroughly enjoying it, and 100% happy i purchased it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7083706">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game overall plays out like this:
<br>1. Enter a region.
<br>2. Receive a radio communication from the task giver, where she tells you about the fief in the region, that she has no idea where that person is. However she knows about a couple of points of interests (typically 4-5) which are then marked in gold on the map.
<br>3. You travel to each POI and as you reach each of them, they transform into another POI on the map, some distance away.
<br>4. You travel to that new POI location.
<br>5. Once you&apos;ve visited all of POIs in the region, a final POI is marked on the map.
<br>6. You travel to the final POI and is tasked with killing or kidnapping a person.
<br>7. You again travel a fair distance to some specific safehouse where you drop the kidnapped person off, and the story progresses a bit. You are told about the impact of the loss of this fief to the cartel organisation.
<br>8. Repeat 26 times from step 1.
<br>
<br>This game is long. The main reason for that is cheap padding.
<br>1. A constant back and forth travelling (backtracking) where travelling between a single POI to another may take 3-4 minutes by helicopter or many times that with a land vehicle.
<br>2. In between each step above, you will face an infinite number of enemies, that respawn &quot;as soon as you turn your back on them&quot;. Or more accuratly, as soon as you&apos;ve moved a short distance away.
<br>3. In order to not be annihilated you need to upgrade your skill tree and that is accomplished by... you guessed it, boring fetch quests, travelling to yet other POIs on the map, where you have to kill hordes of respawning enemies.
<br>4. You can&apos;t just acquire new and improved weapons and addons for your weapons stash from killed enemies, no you need to travel far and wide to hundreds of additional POIs, where the same &quot;Crate&quot; will exist with a trophy in it.
<br>5. Each item you seek is typically placed as far away from you as possible, while still fitting in the overall story segment. For example, it&apos;s almost certain that if there&apos;s a village with an item in it, then the item will be located in the highest building, at the top floor, as far away from the stairs as possible. It seems UBI used an algorithm for travelling salesman problem where they inverted the heuristic to produce the location with the furthest travelling distance from any other point on the map.
<br>
<br>Liked:
<br>Even though the game has all the problems mentioned in the separate review, the cheap tricks to pad its length, and the constant repetition, I still found it a blast to play, in small chunks.
<br>
<br>* Performance, it ran beautifully at 60 FPS on my Intel Core i7 4770, with a Geforce GTX 1080 and 32 GB RAM at 1920x1200 resolution. No crashes.
<br>* Voices. Acting was rather good I found and added quite a bit to the immersion. Your team mates respond to surroundings. In the beginning I was impressed by the variety of comments by the AI mates, but found they ran out of ambient dialogue after about 10% into the game. A potential for improvement in UBIs future titles, but as a proof of concept, I think it turned out rather well and applaud the devs for the idea.
<br>* Graphics. The scenery is absolutely stunning. From snow covered mountains to dense jungles. Nothing beats flying a helicopter over cities, canyons, bridges, the jungle and the alps. It&apos;s something very relaxing about it. The character models also looked great. Attention to detail was overall very high imo.
<br>* Gunplay. Bullets have trajectories! Head shots are fatal! Unarmored enemies are not bullet sponges! Weapon handling feels a bit on the realistic side when compared to other titles, with weapon weight and stats playing into how the weapons behave. Overall I found gun fights highly enjoyable, which really is a saving grace as you wade through the hordes of zomb... I mean cartel and unidad soldiers.
<br>* Rebel assistance. This is a new thing I believe in UBI titles. Along with your skill tree, there is a separate branch which allows various forms of assistance from bolivian rebels. The types include sending grunts to help you in gun fights (can make a HUGE difference, especially for timed challenges), calling in mortar strikes (Awesome, especially for taking out pesky drone jammers), helping with recon etc. I found the former two great, while the rest I never saw a use for.
<br>* Your AI mates aren&apos;t completely useless! They&apos;re definitely not Rainbow six good, but they&apos;re much better than in your average FPS title.
<br>* The story was OK. It definitely wasn&apos;t CDPR good, but much better than other UBI titles. It also served a purpose, giving you enough of a justification for exploring areas. Judging this aspect entirely within the UBI bubble, I&apos;d give it above average, akin to AC 1-3 where the story still had some value.
<br>
<br>To be continued ...

<br>
<br>Well - of course this game has quite some problems. But first of all - at least to me ... it felt like playing World in Flames 2 again. (or Far Cry 4 -t here are so many games that are very similar in that regard)
<br>
<br>One major problem of the game is the AI - again - it just feels like games have made quantum leaps in visuals, audio - (and sometimes a leap backwards towards casual gameplay and complexity ) ... but what has not improved noticably is the AI.
<br>
<br>Enemy bots are simply suicidal - they do not mind stepping into a pile of dozens of fallen comrades into a doorway ... where they just saw one after another of their own being shot. Because of that - the game is anything but challenging. I have not seen the AI take smart, alternative attack routes - use smarter weapons (lobbing a grenade, hide and lay low etc. ) .. in that regard - the AI is even more stupid than the AI in Far Cry 4 (which was pretty similar but had its moments in ... mostly highly scripted missions )
<br>
<br>The game offers so many approaches - scout drones, distraction, remote explosions, mines and and and ... sooo much ... when all you need is a doorway and placing the crosshair head-high (cause all bad guys have the very same statue)
<br>
<br>The game has a neat skill system that somehow feels like cheating. At first the game appears to be a more &quot;realistic&quot; version of world in flames or Far Cry 4 .. but after a short while it turns out to be just as much arcade as the others. It does look more realistic - but a short ride on a motocross bike downhill reveals that physics and bodily harm is on an arcade level.
<br>
<br>Controls are very good - for all - vehicles, on foot and in the air. Especially vehicles feel well done. On foot animations are wonderful (i have never seen such complex animations in other games) and the game even allows (mostly) full character customization!
<br>
<br>The visuals of this game are breathtakingly amazing on ultra settings - and pretty terrible on low settings. (kind of what its supposed to be i guess) - with the little problem that even on low settings - the game is quite demanding .. for how it looks. (textures and loading times do not seem optimized)
<br>
<br>The missions are varied enough - and i have not encountered notable invisible walls on a map that can only be decribed as HUGE.
<br>
<br>conclusion:
<br>
<br>This is a great game to kill some time and mess around. At the same time - it offers quite some longer term motivation with regularly unlockable gadgets and stuff. The close quarter controls are not great in my opinion - and the forced 3rd person perspective can be problematic. The AI is terrible but cheats enough (constant stream of reinforcements...) to be a light challenge.
<br>
<br>I can fully recommend this game - for a little bit 90s action movie nostalgia - and cheesy one liners.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7448575">Expand</a></span>

<br>I usually not so &quot;good hearted&quot; with nowadays shooters, because of reasons... and this game does not make an exception from that list!
<br>This game is a good idea, and mainly a &quot;&apos;meh good&quot; game. The 6/10 point perfectly suits the game in it&apos;s all round up critic/review. Be warned! Some players find this review too &quot;hard&quot; and rude, but hey: It&apos;s a AAA game for 60 eur, so... let&apos;s look at the game in a bird perspective: This game has many good things/solutions/features in it, but unfortunately it has exactly the same amount of bad.
<br>In details:
<br>- Good weapon customization/Really bad controls for heli&apos;s
<br>- Good graphics/Bad AI
<br>- Very good story concept (&quot;maffia tree&quot;)/Repetitive and nonsense missions
<br>- Good game mechanics, playing style options (drones, sync shot feature, command rose, etc.,)/Sometimes unnecessary and annoying TPS view (in CQ firefights for ex. imho!)
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sure i&apos;m missing a lot from this list, but these are just the things i remembered. The main things that are drive me crazy in this game are: heli controls, AI, and ballistics... The helicopter controls are a joke... really. You played any game where you controlled a helicopter? Forget it! This is the worst and hardest way to do it! My heli control (mouse) sensitivity is at 15%, and sometimes the little pushes on the mouse, makes the heli spin like a modernfokker! Sometimes, doesn&apos;t even response to the pushes... seriously... makes me crazy sometimes. And you have to do missions with it... no jokes! AI is bad too. But you probably heard that from the everywhere :) It&apos;s a known fact now :) Your team mates just walk past you, even if you give them &quot;fall in&quot; command. Sometimes walk to a enemy, and sits next to him. Enemy does not give a **** And suddenly the enemy (after 3-5 sec.) beginning to realise the presence of your buddy, and you only see the attack begins on your whole squad because that idiot team mate sat next to an enemy... Joke really. And the AI&apos;s strange list is far from over! The ballistics in this game is (IMHO!) very bad too. The bullet from a assault rifle, beginning to drop at 50m(around 170 ft). That is a joke. If you look at videos, you can see for yourself this &quot;anomaly&quot;. I don&apos;t know the game dev&apos;s why find this &quot;feature&quot; so awesome nowadays... That is why i don&apos;t play BF1 too. The devs of DICE began to use this in BF3, but in BF3 there was exactly the same as in real life. Only the sniper rifles used tracer bullets to see the bullet drop. In BF4 they tinkered it up (bullet drop) imho, because the maps doesn&apos;t have that much space to really mess with the zeroing. This game... New era! Bullet drop the fokk out of all the guns! Even pistols... The M40A5 rifle dropped 10-20cm&apos;s in just 50-70m&apos;s for me!!! It&apos;s a joke really :D IRL: MV:777m/s so yea... it makes roughly 350m&apos;s in just half of a second...
<br>All the boys and girls out there: If you want to play this in solo mode: Don&apos;t buy it!!! I bought it because of some undemandig guy&apos;s told me: &quot;It&apos;s good in single player too!&quot; No, it isn&apos;t. Really. In the beginning it is a refreshing and cool looking game, yes. But if you play it enough time, you will see that this game is made to be played in co-op with at least 1 or 2 friends. In every aspect for real. There are missions that you can&apos;t even make without real people in you team. (deactivate towers for ex. where you have to disable comm towers one after another, but if you disable the first one, the game tells you: &quot;Rush for the second tower!&quot; You got 45 seconds... impossible even with a heli, believe me)
<br>All i can say: This game is a good idea, and a good game! But if you want to play solo and somewhat real gunplay/shooter: miss out on this one, or wait for it when it gets AT LEAST 20-30% discount!
<br>I&apos;m sure i&apos;m missing a lot of good and bad things. But the majority of people can already make a decision from this review.
<br>So a maximum of 6 outa 10!
<br>Over and out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=7192047">Expand</a></span>

The ridiculous moments of a stealth mission going to crap with a group is where the game shines.  I keep playing, but the game just makes me wish Just Cause 3 was a Co-Op game. If you like collecting things you will never use - 10/10.</span>

<br>The game seems fun at the beginning of it, but more you play, more boring it gets. Game is super repetitive and painfully average.
<br>Ridiculously stupid and boring story
<br>Side missions felt pointless
<br>Graphics weren&apos;t that bad, but it doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re good
<br>Music, I don&apos;t remember any soundtracks which I enjoyed
<br>And characters were an absolute joke!</span>
