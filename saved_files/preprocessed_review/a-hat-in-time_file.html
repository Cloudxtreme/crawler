The level of detail found throughout the world is absolutely astounding. The gameplay is very reminiscent of Mario&apos;s early forays into 3D-platforming with chapter based encounters. There are a current total of five unique chapters, which are mostly large environments, just oozing with charm. A huge, fishy town controlled by the Mafia! A spooky, mysterious forest! Even a crazy, western train! Feeling nostalgic? Same.
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>
<br>+ Precise controls and an intuitive move-set gives the protagonist an unparalleled sense of
<br>movement and acrobatic prowess.
<br>
<br>+ Stunning visuals that perfectly blend sixth generation sensibilities with modern resolution/lighting/particle effects.
<br>
<br>+ The soundtrack. Geez. This soundtrack.
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>
<br>- Some collision issues and general glitches. Nothing detrimental. Some of it has actually been rather funny.
<br>
<br>- The difficulty spikes when it comes to bosses. Not going to spoil anything, and perhaps this issue is just because I am not great as I think I am. But, the sudden rise was jarring.
<br>
<br>Overall, A Hat in Time is a game that keeps on giving. From speed-running, easter eggs, developer console, steam workshop, and the later to be added, 6th and 7th bonus chapters, multiplayer, in-game level editor, developer commentary. Buying the game right now at $29.99 is a no-brainer.
<br>
<br>Enjoy the hell out of it now, revisit again in the future with even MORE content. Or, continue to play it while the Workshop keeps receiving content from dedicated fans... You can&apos;t possibly go wrong.

<br>
<br>On a unrelated note: it was released for 30$ (2x backer price). A pricetag maybe a bit too high for an indie game made by a very small and unknown team (except for the music composer). It was a courageous choice by the devs who clearly believed in their product.
<br>I honestly would have skipped this title if I didn&apos;t read so many positive comments about it on the net as usually kickstarted games are more often than not trash, and so are indie 3d platforms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7652785">Expand</a></span>

<br>Great game. Truly a modern day collectathon I can get behind. This gives me serious Mario vibes but it&apos;s really it&apos;s own thing. If you love 3D platforming, and wonder what it&apos;s like to play one where the camera annoyances are minimal, I&apos;d recommend this game. The platforming is smooth, the characters are charming, the worlds are beautiful and the game looks smooth as heck at 60+fps and high resolutions. The best part is probably that the developer is adding in new worlds later and there&apos;s a Steam Workshop option coming soon. This is worth every cent of the purchase.
<br>
<br>I hope to see more from this studio in the future! I&apos;m definitely a fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7604853">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Art style and level design is good, however the controller lag is enormous (at least on PC). The camera works as it should but most of the time the character will be all over the place because of the laggy and twitchy input.
<br>
<br>Story okay tough, a bit boring and childish.</span>

Its definitely my favorite game in a LONG time.
<br>
<br>The worlds are beautiful, huge, filled with hilarious characters. Coupled with hilarious writing, an awesome soundtrack and a great art style, each world ends up feeling like its own grand adventure. The presentation isn&apos;t all, though - Hat kid&apos;s controls are more fun and responsive than most 3D platformers, and the stages you run around in can vary between a ton of varied gameplay styles including tough platforming sections, stealth, pure exploration, and more. It rarely ends up boring, if at all.
<br>
<br>Like Shovel Knight and Freedom Planet before it, the game builds upon nostalgia for old platforming games while creating a unique experience that could very well sit alongside its inspirations - Mario Sunshine, Paper Mario TTYD, Banjo, and other N64/Gamecube legends. Hat in Time surely doesn&apos;t hide its inspirations, but the game feels like a perfect melting pot of all the best games from that era.
<br>
<br>With 40 timepieces (basically power-stars) to collect, some of which being massive ~20 minute missions, the game ends up being longer than you&apos;d initially expect it to be for only 5 chapters. The bosses are insane, especially in the chapters besides chapter 1. There are a lot of extras and secrets to find, upgrades and bonus music tracks, so competitions have a lot to look forward to. It isn&apos;t tedious at all to 100% the game either, and it ends up being a very satisfying 15-20 hour adventure if you don&apos;t rush. For speedrunners, the game is incredibly rewarding to tear through and on par with legendary games like Mario Sunshine. it even has a timer and cutscene removal options for easier practice. Whichever way you decide to play the game, you get your money&apos;s worth for sure.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s hard to ignore some of the game&apos;s flaws though, which only stand out because the rest of the game is so great:
<br>- While the camera is really good for most of the game, it has some issues dealing with cramped spaces and may jitter around a little
<br>- Some wonky collision when dealing with a few of the curved and angled platforms
<br>- A few instances of missing voice acting
<br>- Chapter 1 boss fights feel less polished than the other bosses
<br>
<br>Its easy to look past these things, though, since the game is pure joy. With steam workshop support, coop, bugfixes, and bonus chapters on the way via free updates, it&apos;s so easy to recommend. Get this game. That is an order.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7584750">Expand</a></span>

It gives you entertaining levels to platform across and many collectibles to collect.
<br>
<br>The story has you take control of the cute Hat Girl who is on her way home until Mafia Men ruins her plan by making her fuel fly out. Her fuel are these hourglass that serve as the stars or jiggys if you were playing Mario or Banjo Kazooie. To get enough fuel you must venture across 5 worlds tackling different task for the hourglass.
<br>
<br>The Worlds:
<br>As stated before you tackle 5 Worlds for hourglasses. ALMOST all of these can be beaten in any order. As long as its available, you can play it or skip it. Some worlds require all levels to be beaten before the final boss though. Too avoid spoilers, i will just state each world is filled with creativity and entertaining level design.
<br>
<br>The Characters:
<br>Every world offers new characters to see while it may bring one or two back. Almost the whole game has voice acting too which is actually not bad at all. Everyone of the characters voices makes them all the more interesting.
<br>
<br>The Abilities/Collectibles:
<br>The game has a hat system. Each hat gives you an new ability. You unlock these new abilities by stitching new hats which can be done by collecting yarn balls. Each hat you unlock is mainly built for that world but the new hat can be used in the previous world for collecting other collectibles such as time rift tokens or yarn balls. It basically balances itself out and does backtracking well.
<br>
<br>That being said, the game has a nice small amount of collectibles to get. You have your main collectible, time rift tokens, yarn balls, Hats, Badges, and others.
<br>I already explained some above so i will continue with the others. Time rift tokens are used to spin a slot machine to obtain the &quot;other&quot; collectibles such as music,more hat variety, and colors (Hat Kids appearance can be changed).
<br>
<br>Badges are like Tonics from Yooka Laylee. You can edit your gameplay slightly, for example, one token lets you run up the wall after a belly dive.
<br>
<br>The New:
<br>A Hat In Time doesnt really add anything to the genre but does everything so well and unique, its fine.
<br>
<br>The Music:
<br>Not much to say here. The soundtrack is very catchy and you will memorize some of the music just like you would if playing a Mario or Banjo Kazooie game.
<br>
<br>The Negative:
<br>The game is short...Like really short. Can finish in a day.
<br>The end game falls really short too. Chapter 4 completely drops the entertaining part and goes full platforming and chapter 5  shouldve had a bit more levels.
<br>
<br>Summary:
<br>A Hat In Time hits all the right nails of a good 3D Platformer.  Its charming, funny, creative, and has good challenging platforming sections but is pretty short. That being said, i give it a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7576811">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is a Homage to the 3D Platformer genre from the 90s and early 2000&apos;s with the GameCube and the N64 era, you&apos;ll give a kick out of the game&apos;s soundtrack because It is just sooo good, the character&apos;s in the game are charm and lovable (including Hat Kid, because she is just adorable).
<br>
<br>There are some glitches that you&apos;ll find, but you can completely ignore it.
<br>
<br>It is a great 3D platformer to play in 2017 that is funded on Kickstarter (unlike Yooka-laylee) so I highly recommend buying the game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7578067">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are pure eyecandy compared to the platformers of the past.    The camera is easily manipulated and customizable, instead of being infuriating.  The voice-acting is ACTUALLY GOOD.  The collecting does NOT feel like a chore, and instead gives the player the choice to NOT collect items when it becomes tedious, while still helpfully guiding the player along through the amazingly intricate world.  It does literally everything right except depth of field.
<br>
<br>I made this account to just review this game.  I hope this sets the gold standard for what a modern-day platformer is supposed to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7577410">Expand</a></span>

<br>Each chapter is entirely unique and even the sections within them aim to throw something different at you every time making sure that you aren&apos;t stuck doing the same repetitive task. The movement is fluid with abilities that are always being utilized. The soundtrack is outstanding and when combined with the Wind Waker-esque graphics it creates a truly magical experience.

However, I was completely proven wrong by the official release. Some of the most charming level design coupled with tight gameplay makes this a must play.

It combines almost everything people love about &quot;3D Platformers&quot;, while adding it&apos;s own things, and while you&apos;re kinda right about the gameplay being very reminiscent of &quot;Mario Sunshine&quot;, it doesn&apos;t try to fully replicate it. This game is also not like &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot; where you&apos;re going to look at the characters and think &quot;Oh, it&apos;s kinda like Banjo-Kazooie&quot; or &quot;Oh, it&apos;s kinda like Mario, right?&quot; No, it&apos;s not like that at all. &quot;A Hat In Time&quot; is &quot;A Hat In Time&quot; and nothing else is.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>The level design is fantastic
<br>Controls smoothly
<br>Game has great sense of humor
<br>Characters are all interesting, fun, and brimming with personality
<br>Power-ups all have very interesting or just helpful abilities
<br>Mod Support!! (it&apos;s in BETA right now)
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>You currently can&apos;t collect everything in the game
<br>Story is kind of random and ending just sort of happens
<br>
<br>To Come:
<br>
<br>Two additional worlds will arrive later as free DLC!!
<br>New Game+ (Maybe it&apos;s already in the game, i just didn&apos;t fully 100% my first file)
<br>Developer Commentary
<br>Co-Op
<br>
<br>It&apos;s an amazing &quot;3D Platformer&quot; that now is in my top 3 favorite games of all time. Cannot recommend the game enough, potential GOTY here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7589377">Expand</a></span>

<br>Think Mario galaxy but with a special hat and the levels are not globe shaped. Way more special moves than mario though for sure and lots of replay value. It makes you want to go back and explore for the hidden orbs that it shows you pictures of.

Also to who ever thinks the game is bad because of Jontron being in it is silly. Come on now, everyone has said stupid stuff.</span>

<br>
<br>Really, you can&apos;t go wrong with A Hat in Time. It&apos;s quirky. It&apos;s charming. It has tons of flair, or for the rare spots it doesn&apos;t, it makes up for with humorous dialogue and large, beautiful scenery that will blow you away for such a &quot;simple&quot; looking game on the outside.
<br>
<br>It manages to go really in-depth in terms of storytelling and narrative - and just wait for the conclusion. You won&apos;t be the same&#x2014;in fact, you&apos;ll miss it so much you&apos;ll play it again, and perhaps again and again.
<br>
<br>It really has tons of replayability, is what I&apos;m saying. The game actually features several instances of &quot;choose your own path&quot; style gameplay, and in a way that&apos;s neither offputting for detracting (I won&apos;t spoil it&#x2014;you&apos;ll have to choose yourself!). And not to mention it&apos;s in the same field as Super Mario 64, Sunshine, Galaxy, and even Banjo-Kazooie &#x2014; what of those -aren&apos;t- replayable all the time?
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is equally as charming. I can&apos;t actually describe it - go listen! The game&apos;s composer made such marvelous works, go listen or go play so you can experience some of them.
<br>
<br>Cons? In it&apos;s current state, it does carry a -few- bugs (for instance, clipping through objects by occasion, etc), but we live in the modern age of bug fixing and patching, so it shouldn&apos;t be a detriment. You could argue its artstyle (ingame) is a bit of an off put - true, some may not find the initial &apos;toon&apos; style appealing, but you may also be surprised to find that it has some pretty intense graphics otherwise - beyond the initial glance, you may actually find that it has some pretty crazy environments.
<br>
<br>A Hat in Time is simply a call back to the &quot;good old days&quot; of platforming and grabbing collectible goodies. Jump, dive, dream and even &quot;solve murder&quot; through this marvelous little adventure easily accessible by anyone who owns a PC (and you can steam refund if it doesn&apos;t--soon out on PS4 and Xbox as well!). Not to mention the game is receiving two bonus levels later on (yes, free, entire new chapters to the game!), as well as co-op (+online co-op for PC version!) and mod support (PC version!) - the game will surely live into a age well beyond the present, and I believe will never cease to amaze us with what the developers (and fans) are able to do with it in the coming decades.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7582146">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It is a boring game and i don&apos;t like it. Psychonauts did it better.
<br>
<br>Also jontron shouldn&apos;t be publically in it. You&apos;ll have to google why.</span>

<br>
<br>1. CAMERA! the cam is very jittery and in tight closed areas it starts to go nuts and starts doing a wormhole effect you can&apos;t even see where your going half the time the more you zoom out the worse it gets!
<br>
<br>2. collision detection! it&apos;s screwed in most areas especially where you have to jump onto the ropes. Most of the time you&apos;ll pass right through it and when you do land on them when you jump your supposed to jump straight up and land back on the ripe right? wrong you end up jumping up and over to the left or right even if you don&apos;t touch the controller makes it very frustrating in some areas especially the last area.
<br>
<br>3. GLITCHES! i ran into quite a few glitches in this among one that&apos;s a serious game breaker. if you buy a badge pin and have cut scenes turned off you DO NOT get the extra badge slot! in the twilight bell stage i got stuck in a gate and had to restart the whole level! there is also a lot of areas you can get stuck if you accidentally jump in or behind them.
<br>
<br>4. voice acting! it&apos;s terrible just terrible the moment you hear the mustache girl talk you will be opening the menu at lightning speed to turn the voices off and oh yeah that racist jontron is in this making it even worse!
<br>
<br>5. too damn short! there are 4 areas total (5 if you count the final boss level) and oh yeah in the last area in the mountains they decided to not even have a boss at all so there is a total of 3 bosses in the whole game you can easily do this in under 20 hours. there&apos;s lots of stuff to collect like yarn but they made it so you only need to collect about 10% of it to finish the game which is a waste! Also there is not enough badges you can easily get the $ to buy all the badges just be playing the 1st two worlds again another wasted feature.
<br>
<br>verdict
<br>=====
<br>the platforming is great especially in the last world, the music is awesome and the game looks fantastic...but among all this it&apos;s just got too many flaws and is way too short. for the price they are asking for it right now...it&apos;s just not worth it! I&apos;d wait till they release more worlds and the map editor to make challenging levels before picking this up and maybe fix a few of these damn bugs!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7595282">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After spending 6 hours playing it, this game seems more like a fun little college project than a polished video game. If you want to see what a polished, indie platformer looks like, look at Ori and the Blind Forest. Sure, it isn&apos;t a 3D platformer, but then, no one said a platformer needed to be 3D... and if you can&apos;t make an excellent product in one style, why not try a different route?
<br>
<br>I give this game a 7 because in the last month I have made sure to play various platformers (as Mario Odyssey loomed in the horizon) in order to get back into a genre that seems almost lost in a world drowning in MMOs, mobile freemiums, and Halo-styled or zombie shooters. No doubt this game is somewhere at the top of the list of current 3D platformers; I can attest to that. However, is it really an 8/10 or more? Nah.
<br>
<br>If you review any working game after only a few minutes of playing it, you are adding to the problem of why we don&apos;t have better games. It&apos;s that simple. Imagine recommending a Netflix show to a friend after only seeing one episode.... or suggesting a restaurant after only using the bathroom there... same thing.

<br>So let&apos;s quickly go down the list:
<br>
<br>Inviting? Yes.
<br>Colorful? Yes.
<br>Great music? Yes... although it steals a whole melody from Ghibli Studio&apos;s &quot;Kiki&apos;s Delivery Service&quot; (I&apos;m sure if Joe Hisaishi cared, they could be sued)
<br>Fun? YES.
<br>Fun-ny?... eh, sometimes. Definitely not Banjo-Kazooie or Crash Bandicoot kind of funny.
<br>Simple to control? Yes.
<br>Headache to control? Yes. Unfortunately, yes. Sometimes, you run up a wall and Hat Kid STANDS on the flat surface of the wall......... makes no sense, but shows you how unpolished the game is. Sometimes, you jump and the command to bop an enemy appears, sometimes it doesn&apos;t... :shrugs:
<br>
<br>In short, this is a game that thankfully was released in the shadow of a better platformer, Mario Odyssey, because I personally think it will benefit from such a release, as more people will want to suddenly play it after playing Odyssey, when their nostalgia for the 3D platformer is rekindled. And perhaps some will even tread through the mess that are the controls, and rage onward into everything this game has to offer, which is actually quite a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7661928">Expand</a></span>

This genre does not get enough love and even when most people do try, they ultimately do not succeed. Regardless, this game happens to break that pattern and create an experience that reminisces on previous successful titles while doing it in a new, creative, and enjoyable way that makes you love it more and more. The game is not perfect but the controls are a solid 9.9/10 and the charm of all the characters easily makes up for any small, insignificant shortcomings you may find.

Based around classic 3D platformers from the N64 era, A Hat in Time has you play as the adorable Hat Kid, a young girl who makes use of different hats with different abilities, who is searching several worlds for her Time Pieces in order to see her way home. The overall plot may feel simplistic, but each individual world feels like their own little story of their own. From fighting off the mafia in a shady looking town to helping two birds fight for a movie award, the game has a lot of charm in it&apos;s worlds. And the worlds, for the most part, aren&apos;t small and feature lots to do within each act. They are jam packed with places to explore, characters to interact with and time pieces to find. In a sense, the game&apos;s progression feels similar to Super Mario Sunshine, where each act puts you on a path to a set time piece, but the open world gives you lots of freedom to explore and there aren&apos;t many limits in each act, which is nice.
<br>
<br>Another aspect I enjoyed a lot was the characters. Despite there being a few notable stand-outs, they were easy to love. From the goofy mafia to the disco penguin DJ Grooves to the Hat Kid herself, I found the cast to be overly charming. Even the standard NPC characters had some witty bits of dialogue and I always respect that.
<br>
<br>However, there is one thing I felt was wrong with this game and that was the length. With there only being a total of 40 Time Pieces and about 5 worlds to explore, the game doesn&apos;t take long to beat. While getting all 40 Time Pieces is still on my to-do list while I&apos;m writing this, reaching the final boss doesn&apos;t take long. Maybe the game will release more content over time, which I hope it does because this is one charming game I&apos;d love to play more of.
<br>
<br>In the end, A Hat in Time is just choked full of charm and character. I loved every minute of it, no doubt. The length is about all I can talk down on, but that is hidden behind a lovable cast, detailed and creative worlds, clean controls and a load of easy to use abilities that make the game feel so great. Here&apos;s hoping the game will get an expansion, but in the mean time, I&apos;ll enjoy what I have; a charming and adorable 3D platformer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7603949">Expand</a></span>

It really plays like a GameCube 3D platformer, and would feel right at home on that system! It doesn&apos;t quite have the same strong identity of some of the classics, but it&apos;s still a real breath of fresh air, and if you feel nostalgic for these kind of games you *have* to try it. It&apos;s 10 - 12 hours of great lighthearted fun, through vibrant and varied worlds brimming with charm and creativity.
<br>
<br>My main issue with the game is that the imitation of the classics extends to the way the game plays, for better and for worse. The controls aren&apos;t as tight as they could be; traversing across smaller platforms can be really finicky, and it can be hard to judge your jumps, dives and climbs, resulting in falls to your death that you won&apos;t always feel are your own fault. The camera is very old fashioned too. Left and right camera movement works fine, but moving the analog stick up and down simply moves the camera closer or further away, rather than tilting it up and down. This is rarely a problem in combat, but it does feel archaic when you&apos;re just exploring and trying to find things, and can cause some annoyance.
<br>
<br>Another minor problem I have is that the game doesn&apos;t always give you a clear idea of what to do next or direct you to what you&apos;re missing. On one of the worlds I had no idea how to unlock new chapters until I googled it. The last world doesn&apos;t give you any clues at all, and instead just drops you in there for you to work things out yourself. It&apos;s not a big problem, and perhaps I&apos;m just impatient, but I&apos;m not 13 anymore either, and I don&apos;t have time to just aimlessly explore until I figure out what I&apos;m supposed to do. I don&apos;t need my hand held, but I do need a little more direction than this game was sometimes willing to give me.
<br>
<br>So it&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s a very fun and satisfying game, not to mention adorable. Leaving each session of playing a game with a big smile on my face is something that doesn&apos;t happen nearly enough these days, and that alone makes me want to recommend A Hat in Time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7714232">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story is not amazing, is simple like getting a kiss and cake from a princess, but the gameplay is another story.
<br>The way hat kid (thats her name) moves is similar to mario in mario sunshine, she can jump, dive and wall jump but she can also double jump, cancel the momentum of the dive a front flip and has different power ups at her disposal, if i were to compare the controls of other platformers like banjo kazooie, mario sunshine, and crash i would say that a hat in time is the one with the most control and enjoyable to play, the movement hat kid has its INSANE in fact it gives you so much control you can move with such confidence in the worlds you explore with no little fear of messing up, not because its easy but because the movement she has is very vast and easy to handle.
<br>
<br>Now there is one detail with the controls and its the camera, you cant control it to see specific things and you can only focus the camera to look slightly up, this is bad and stupid and i dont know why they make it like this.
<br>
<br>The difficulty on the platform and levels is not out of this world but its pretty enjoyable and also remember the power ups? well you are gonna use them allot, this is one of the things i love from videogames that they give you something not for a specific use but for you to do whatever you want with them and they are very useful on every mission, its also not afraid to throw special missions that break the platforming formula and experiment a little which is executed perfectly. The boss battles in my opinion are one of the best things in this game breaking another platform rule of the 3 lives bosses, i honestly dont even know how many times you have to hit each boss to just die and also the level of difficulty increases with each stage and boss so as you get better at this game it also ask you more from you.
<br>
<br>the art is very charming and the characters are also charming and original, they all have very interesting personalities and makes the simple story interesting to listen, i personally enjoy the voice acting (expect from one blonde lady) but if you dont like you can just mute it.
<br>
<br>you can also see the level of details put in allot of the extra art, each time you enter a stage they have a different drawing to represent each mission (expect the time rift all of the are the same) which brings me to hat kid again, she is the most adorable thing in this entire game, the way she interacts, the noises she make and the animation she has just warms your hearth.
<br>
<br>now there are some problems, first the biggest one IS TOO SHORT! why does good game creators have low budgets? but hey it is what it is.
<br>second there are some glitches in the game that kind off bump down the experience but just a little
<br>the time rifts can be a bother to find when you dont have A GOOD CAMERA! specially on mafia town where you have to look around long corridors that are position diagonally and you can only look to the floor, or when you are trying to explore a certain level and you dont have the camera to look around is annoying too.
<br>
<br>the final problem for me is that on the special platforming is too easy for my taste, now this is tricky since i believe it has good design but the abilities hat kid has and the way you can control her makes this a walk in the park, i literally enter a level i had never enter and play it like i was a speed runner now that doesnt mean its bad but if you are gonna give us so much control then spice things up a little, also the minions arent particularly hard to beat... just press a bunch of times and you are set some of them need another trick that is jumping and hitting them in the head but it doesnt changes too much of that.
<br>
<br>in conclusion i recommend this game, you are definetly gonna have a good time playing it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7623307">Expand</a></span>

Although the gameplay pays tribute to Super Mario 64 and Sunshine, the story is able to stand on its own. The art direction is really something (props to the developers for that beautiful fourth chapter) and the music goes right along with it. A Hat in Time was a pleasant surprise for me, being so skeptical going into it.
<br>
<br>There are only a few things that I think could&apos;ve improved the game any further. I, for one, was expecting more weapon choices to become available throughout the game, but that&apos;s not a real complaint. My only beef with the game is how underwhelming the 5th chapter is. Each previous chapter felt like its own, unique section of the game, while the 5th chapter served only as the cherry on top of the rest. The game may as well have 4 chapters, which is fine, only the final one was a mere tease, in my opinion. Still, this does not ruin the experience by any means and the length of the game does indeed warrant the $30 price tag.
<br>
<br>All in all... very impressive. I would not mind a sequel, which the game sort of sets itself up for, one bit!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7636428">Expand</a></span>

Super Mario 64 was a landmark title that paved the road for future title, as well as more 3D &quot;collect-athon&quot; style platformers.  It was praised mostly for its unique gameplay mechanics, its rock solid controls, its innovative camera system which worked very well when compared to even a lot of 3D platformers now.  It also brought a lot to the table that had never really existed up until that point.  This brings me to &quot;A hat in time,&quot; a cute, albeit not particularly original title that stars a little girl who for some reason uses different magical &quot;hats&quot; to maneuver through puzzles, levels and acquire key items.  Its fairly intuitive, and has been receiving quite a lot of praise since its release.  It was a labor of love from what I&apos;ve read about and was genuinely started by some very intrepid developers, but is that enough to preserve its reputation as far as the actual game play is concerned?  I don&apos;t think so.  I found A hat in time to be from one of those development camps that suggests that for every step forward, take one step back.  That&apos;s what it actually feels like.  The game is incredibly dodgy, collision detection glitches, camera problems, weird bugs that cause the main character to get stuck on the environment, extremely repetitive mechanics, and the Unreal 4 engine itself does not seem to be well suited for the game either.  Rather than whimsical, I found myself easily frustrated at the level design, the movement of the character and the jumping mechanics.  At the end of the day, the game just frustrates me, its not fun to play, the difficulty curve is completely ridiculous.  You go from a light hearted romp, to the first boss kicking you in the teeth repeatedly with a very obnoxious and confusing attack pattern.  I got about as far as Subcon forest and legitimately got stuck.  Or how about for example the train mystery level?  The one where the level is specifically designed so that only certain portions open up, but only if you trigger certain events by finding pieces of evidence or activating a cutscene.  It was infuriating because it didn&apos;t make sense at all.  I also found the visual presentation to be a bit lacking.  As charming as some of the characters designs were, its obvious that they hadn&apos;t changed much from their original designs, some of them even look like early concept art that never moved forward.  All in all I don&apos;t think A hat in time is a bad game at all, I think its good, and it did accomplish most of what it set out to do.  Just because I found it frustrating doesn&apos;t mean its a bad game at all.  Like I said, Rayman 2 was a game I grew up playing and these days I&apos;m not even sure if I could play through it again, especially given some the difficult segments in it.  Hat girl is adorable, but I guess I don&apos;t see the game being an evolutionary work of genius as far as the genre is concerned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7690980">Expand</a></span>

Luckily, the game has interesting, lighthearted, and comedy-filled writing to supplement the gameplay. The music pairs well and faithfully runs with the gamecube-era-inspired aesthetics. The game isn&apos;t overly challenging, but it respects the player and allows them to use the various hats and upgrades (the scooter especially) to go over an obstacle at their own pace and with their own plan. It&apos;s simple and lacks a lot of substance, but the smooth gameplay and aesthetics mean it doesn&apos;t need to be very heavy on story or coherence. It&apos;s a short, delicious burst of passion and platforming elegance, and is worth the pricetag, especially to reward Gears For Breakfast for their dedication.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-hat-in-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7696739">Expand</a></span>
