Its a fresh, fast, streamlining of what a MOBA should be. For the first time a MOBA feels like it was designed by professionals. Leaving in the good bits and removing the toxic bits. If you want a fast paced competitive team game look no further.</span>

<br>As others have stated this is just another cash cow for Blizzard. It&apos;s actually sickening to me how Blizzard have become a money grabbing corporation from the small band of average Joe&apos;s who changed the face of gaming back in the 90&apos;s. Money and power inevitably corrupts. But what do we have left with Blizzard? The only Blizzard game I now play is Starcraft 2. I look forward to the third installment on this front but since I&apos;ve stopped playing WOW and I&apos;m not really a Diablo fan, Blizzard are now like  the band I used to love but who now play crappy pop music with only the occasional good song.
<br>
<br>The game itself is, as expected, in no way exceptional. It draws on the shoulders of other successes and I can honestly say I will never play it again after an hour of play in which my heart sunk and my faith in this one time great company vanished. Hearthstone was the first nail in the coffin, Heroes of the Storm is the second.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5300875">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gameplay feels very slow, tho matches are way shorter than in top MOBA&apos;s like League and Dota. It feels almost clunky and unresponsive and for my taste, it&apos;s to much team play oriented which is bad in several ways: you feel less impactful, playing solo can be extremely frustrating (way more than in LoL or Dota) and shared experience is just plain stupid idea,
<br>
<br>Game has also several technical issues, like unstable fps with even significant drops, issues with reconnect after getting DC.
<br>
<br>Even games has sever different maps to play, witch different objectives it feels all games are the same, objective after objective - there&apos;s not much freedom and strategy involved, it&apos;s basically all about how well you cooperate  with teammates, and falling behind is more common point of no return than in other MOBAs, because you can&apos;t carry weaker players and loosing few objectives gives enemy team insane power spike. One more thing, being heavily objective based game falls short on direct pvp (both duels and team fights), which takes most of this gaming genre&apos;s fun away.
<br>
<br>If you are not a big fan of blizzard and their lore or you are not super casual, you might have hard time enjoying this game. Tbh, I can&apos;t find anything really positive and good to say about this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5295168">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you are a parent whose child is playing this and worse, if you let your child to use your credit card, this game is not only going to rob you of your precious money, but also raising a gambler, all hidden in plain sight!
<br>
<br>This game blasts you with random &apos;&apos;lootboxes&apos;&apos; on each hero level-up, yet keeps a lot of content (&apos;&apos;epic&apos;&apos; skins) accessible only from them, not able to be directly bought, and allows to buy more of these lootboxes with real money.
<br>There is also a psychological trick, called fake currency. First you buy &quot;shards&quot; with real money and then use these shards to buy lootboxes, it seems to lessen the &quot;pain of purchasing&quot; creating a perceived distance to money.
<br>
<br>This trend has to die before it spreads, already upcoming Warner Bros game Shadows of War also is including lootboxes, same BS is happening in another Blizzard games - Overwatch and Hearthstone.
<br>
<br>Gaming community accepts being treated increasingly worse - fanboyism or plain apathy caused broken games on release - enormous first day patches, a lot of content cut out and resold as &quot;DLC&quot;, paying for unfinished games, called &quot;early access&quot;, the greedy men in suits push for more - they want gambling! They want your kids to be gambling!!! And if the sheep will ignore this one too, it will happen!
<br>
<br>Apart from that, the game itself is very retarded and so is the average player, because for them this game has been designed and marketed.
<br>No items, no gold, no builds, no strategy. Just go in, mash buttons. There are &quot;talents&quot; but they are merely a change of style not a change in power, there are no power spikes whatsoever, there is no individualism.
<br>The worst part of this game is shared EXP system. All team shares level. It is good for utter morons, who are the target community, as it helps even complete failures to be carried to mediocrity.
<br>For good players this system is unacceptable. It keeps you down. It doesn&apos;t allow you to shine. No matter what you do, it feels without impact - and so go the matches, they&apos;re like slowly moving wall. If you&apos;re winning, it doesn&apos;t happen fast. This game doesn&apos;t respect your skill, it doesn&apos;t respect your time. And if you lose, if you are pulled down by morons, it feels like punching a slowly moving concrete wall. Game goes and goes and you got this false hope but because everyone in the enemy team got stat advantage ALL ACROSS THE BOARD you can try and try but eventually lose. There is also no surrender option.
<br>When comparing all kinds of PvP games - DOTA 2, LoL, other MOBAs, CS, Halo, other shooters, whatever.. this game is the most hostile to individual plays and the most catering to morons. Do you enjoy being a digital babysitter to random idiots?
<br>
<br>Many maps are recycled, the &quot;strategy&quot; in them all is the same - go to the objective, it is essentially a numbers game, the most people at the ridiculously overpowered objective are present, that team wins.
<br>
<br>Strategy in them all is the same, exactly like President Camacho&apos;s speech in the movie Idiocracy: &quot;3 point plan to fix everything, Number 1 - we got this guy Not Sure, Number 2 - he got da highest IQ out of anybody, Number 3 - he&apos;s gonna fix everything!!!&quot; *wild applause now*
<br>It is the same here: Number 1 - kill minions, collect stuff, Number 2 - deliver collected stuff to temple / checkpoint, whatever, Number 3 - summon big scary monster, big gun or whatever and proceed to kick ass
<br>Bonus point is if you&apos;re playing this on Windows 8 or 10 - https://i.pinimg.com/originals/80/5d/d4/805dd41210153c62db3a48eeba6534a4.jpg
<br>
<br>The graphics also are crap considering the insanely high system requirements, there are still reports of failures, glitches and low FPS even on the most powerful of gaming PCs.
<br>
<br>Also do you love each new hero released to be super-overpowered for a while, for the company to milk money from purchases only to nerf it in oblivion soon before the next hero is released? And this practice constantly repeated? Like it is in League of Legends? This is exactly what happens in this game.
<br>
<br>And from the old heroes, the balance is completely wrecked. Some heroes are worse than situational, utter, complete garbage, no reason to pick them, others are super OP and can do good in nearly every game, every scenario. And no - that is not addressed.
<br>
<br>There is also an influx of retarded pop-culture inspired cancer &quot;heroes&quot; from Overwatch, them in the same game with well-established, lore-rich heroes of Diablo and Warcraft universes is an insult, however, these heroes have been made when Blizzard was good, when it was real Blizzard. Right now it is a zombie owned by Activision, kept technically alive only to pump out as much money as possible, using every sleazy tactic out there and even pushing the limit.
<br>
<br>Blizzard is dead. Long live the Blizzard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=7497957">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Matchmaking is completely broken, unbalanced skills, unablanced heroes match, or u stomp your enemy or u get stomped, there is no competition or skills challenge, or get destroyed by enemies or  your team destroy them, that&apos;s why matches last 15-20 min max
<br>
<br>Heroes balancing, they nerfed the goods heroes the few that were balanced like ETC or Muradin  becasue the kids were crying on the forums casue they haven&apos;t any skills to kill them or to use them.
<br>
<br>Most of the people use toxic heroes like Genji, Valeera, Nova useless in team just to get easy kills and run away like cod players they camp u in lane waiting for u to have few hp than use 2 skills to oneshot u, feeling so pro in their minds.
<br>
<br>Ranked match are totally a mess...u lost more points than u can gain with a win, so after the 10 qualifiy matches it&apos;s hard to rank up, usually or u play 200-300 match per season u u just lose ranks
<br>
<br>Full of russians toxic players from other moba like LoL
<br>
<br>No moderation in game, no banhammer, no toxic player banned, no troll banned, they ruin ranked and unranked without any problem one of the worst experience of my life...stay away from this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=7495134">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After being stuck in development for nearly 7 years, here in 2016, Heroes of the Storm still lacks features we&apos;ve come to take for granted in other genre titles, fails to garner a strong Twitch following, has messy tournaments, and overall is not anything of a spectacle.
<br>
<br>Not Blizzard&apos;s finest hour. Perhaps the game would have been better if they had stuck to their original plan of making it a Starcraft Arcade title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=6468829">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is probably the only game in its genre I&apos;d recommend to anyone besides DOTA, since unlike League/Smite/any of the other numerous clones, it&apos;s actually enough of a departure to be unique, instead of just being DOTA with worse balance, less experienced developers, and more pay walls.
<br>
<br>However, HOTS is still plagued by the worst parts of those games, most notably the pay walls. Unlike Smite and other games, there&apos;s no option to unlock all the heroes in one reasonably priced pack, so to gain access to the full roster you need to either grind out hundreds or probably thousands of games to buy them with the in-game currency, or spend hundreds of dollars to get them all with real money.
<br>
<br>Really I think any LOMA without a fully unlocked hero roster is doomed from conception. The business model only allows for two options: either people without the full roster are at a competitive disadvantage, or the roster is drastically less diverse than in DOTA.
<br>
<br>Put in the extra time and effort to learn DOTA and you will be rewarded with a truly balanced and endlessly deep game that you can learn and improve at all your life. Stick with HOTS and you&apos;ll be stuck in the kiddie pool -- not because this is a marginally easier game to play, but because the design decisions made by the developers necessarily limit your creativity as a player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=7586523">Expand</a></span>

Heroes also has a good business model that allows you access to lots of heroes without spending any or much $.  I honestly don&apos;t like all the game modes and just prefer the standard summoner&apos;s rift type push, but that&apos;s just me.  I like it, I mean I&apos;m just not blown away.</span>

It has nice graphics and the fact that you can not buy items is not important, because this game has other great assets. On the other hand, the game is imbalanced and poorly optimized, also the ranked system could be better. In overall HOTS is solid MOBA game, but Dota 2 and LoL are still unchallenged kings of this genre.</span>

The big reason not to play it more is because it takes way to long to buy a new character and it cost alot of money to buy new heroes and skins.  I would recommend this game to people new to Mobas or people who play casual in League and Dota.</span>

<br>
<br>Played this game since beta &amp; now it&apos;s dumbed down for 8 year olds and boring.
<br>
<br>Game is so easy &amp; people still have no clue.
<br>
<br>Notice how there&apos;s no negative from critics.  People who suck at video games writing about them.</span>

Put them aside, players want something more in these genre of video games: balance.
<br>It&apos;s out of question that this game is going to be in comparison with dota forever, the father of this genre. And dota has been here for almost 10 years and been in balancing stage for that length too. Dota has over 100 perfect balanced heroes and over 200 perfect balanced items.
<br>Which lead my review to this:, you read this and decide yourself:
<br>Heroes of the Storm is a great game but has less strategy depth and seriousness of dota.
<br>Heroes of the Storm made a dump decision, making heroes unavailable and you should pay for them (or play stupidity amount of hours to do so) and dota didn&apos;t.
<br>Heroes of the Storm has better technical graphics but not for a long time. (Dota reborn is coming with Valve top notch new engine, Source 2).
<br>Heroes of the Storm has Blizzard original Heroes.
<br>Heroes of the Storm has different maps (8 for now) with almost different rules to play and its seems there will be more.
<br>Heroes of the Storm has no items and individual effects. Hots is based on teamwork more than dota.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5382539">Expand</a></span>

<br>HOWEVER
<br>The game is fun and you dont get bored easily as there are many maps + the pace of new hero releases is very high. In summary i recommend to try this if you want to play moba but dont want to invest 50+ hours learning and not be a complete trash and 2+ hours daily just to play 2-3 games/ stay at some decent skill level</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5930459">Expand</a></span>

<br>Overall, a fun game, and it&apos;s free so nothing is lost but time if you don&apos;t like it.  There are just a few issues that need to be resolved.

<br>FYI, Update 2.0 did nothing to address the MM issues.....So yeah, still not increasing the rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5374062">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>That being said it has some problems right now.  The biggest 2 are matchmaking being BAD, like really bad, and the prices and gold earning rate are both poor too.  Prices are horrible but gold earning rates initially seem good up until you start running out of bonuses.  Then you realize a month or two later how bad they actually are.  It makes League of Legends look generous and I HATE runes.
<br>
<br>Then you have alot of smaller issues like Blizzard not communicating very well, making completely odd changes nobody wanted like removing the ability to easily see critical buffs and removing the ability to see prices in the shop.  It&apos;s actually easier to see prices in hero select than the SHOP atm.
<br>
<br>You also have a rather poor reconnect system and spectator UI/casting client, bad drafting UI/functionality, etc.  They&apos;ve got a long way to go just yet.
<br>
<br>But when they get there this will be the best MOBA on the market hands down IMO.  I&apos;m just not going to give them much of my money until they fix pricing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5306986">Expand</a></span>

Blizzard have systematically reduced and removed elements of the genre until the game has become so boring and uninteresting to play I predict the playerbase to sharply drop off if it ever picks up in the first place. There&apos;s just no compulsion to continue playing game after game like many other MOBA titles, because the game is so simplistic and predictable. The infinite permutations of items, builds, meta strategy, is nonexistent in Heroes. Yes, I know Blizzard insists it has transcended the genre of MOBA and is a &quot;hero brawler&quot; but a FPS game that insists it is an &quot;Enemy Blaster&quot; is still an FPS and should be compared as  such.
<br>
<br>In addition the game is lacking basic features and the performance and netcode is incredibly poor and simply not up to the standard of the polished MOBA games on the market today, as a result of using an ancient SC2 engine with no multithreading that has always had poor netcode.
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s all failing to mention to horrible cash shop implementation and the prohibitive price of the limited hero pool as it is. This game is simply yet another cash grab by Blizzard to support the falling subscriptions of WoW</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5306809">Expand</a></span>

It was in beta and open beta for many months, so I thought it will be all nicely polished and bug free, but unfortunately it isn&apos;t. As long as you play in a single player it&apos;s fine, yes, visuals look 10 years old, but at least it plays smoothly even on lower rigs. The problem starts when you try to play this game online, which is ironically supposed to be it&apos;s main draw. You get frequent lag, stuttering and right during my very first game - BSOD. Not just a crash to desktop, but good old Blue Screen Of Death! Last time this happened to me was sometime in the 90&apos;s and it&apos;s a shame Blizzard put something like this out, considering most of their games in the past were pretty stable. Tried playing some other matches and it&apos;s like weather, sometimes it plays well, other times it won&apos;t even load, gets stuck on loading screen, logging in and out and other problems and glitches. One time my heroes didn&apos;t load so I couldn&apos;t start new matches. Even menus and game UI don&apos;t scale properly to your used resolutions. The state of this game right now is pretty disappointing and I&apos;m tired of developers releasing these buggy and of non-functional products. Other than that, the game itself can be fun at first, but it gets quite repetitive very quickly, there is not much strategy involved, no story whatsoever and the gameplay is not exactly fluid either. The potential is definitely there, I really like the huge selection of different heroes with various unique abilities, so just trying them out can be fun. Another problem is that it&apos;s heavily team based, so if you get bad team you&apos;re out of luck, because you can&apos;t do that much on your own. Most matches are decided in first 5 mins, because once your team starts to loose, everyone in your team is usually logging out, giving up and you&apos;re just there to wait for defeat for another 10 mins, not fun at all. Thankfully it&apos;s a free game, so there is no loss in trying it out for yourself, but I would advise to wait a while until Blizzard patches everything up and the game gets more stable. 5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5304634">Expand</a></span>

<br>HoTS has many unique and gorgeous battlegrounds. The gameplay is exciting to the last moment! Several times have I been in games where the outcome wasn&apos;t sure until the last seconds. Very exciting and yes it can be disappointing with tough losses.
<br>
<br>Game is frequently updated with new skins, battlegrounds and characters.
<br>
<br>LoL is a toxic game, rarely was someone not yelling and degrading teammates. The Blizzard community seems to be better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5823454">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To address some criticisms from other writeups, I&apos;ll say that I&apos;ve never felt tempted to spend money in the cash store. I might agree that the prices are outrageous, but by grinding in-game gold, I&apos;ve bought 24 heroes, leaving 21 that I don&apos;t own. I&apos;ve bought two &apos;master&apos; skins, which are as expensive as the most expensive heroes, so basically I&apos;ve gotten to the point of impulsively buying cosmetics. Never have I been tempted to buy anything with cash. There are no pay-to-pown temptations, no pay gates to content. Actually, I think there are some skins that come with some sort of themed abilities, and I don&apos;t want anybody to feel misled about that, but to me this looks like an excuse to spend money, for those who want to spend money. If you are a completist who has to own everything in the shop, then maybe that&apos;s different. For me, this game is entirely free to play, it&apos;s that simple.
<br>
<br>Next, how do we compare this to League of Legends and Dota 2? Well, it seems like in this genre all these games have kind of simplified graphics. Maybe they&apos;re tuned to play on a larger variety of hardware, and not lag, etc. &apos;Heroes&apos; is like the others in this respect. And, movement and basic attacks are right-clicks, while hero abilities are triggered by the QWE keys (initially) and left-clicks. So the gameplay is similar as far as the controls. And as far as the idea of two teams of five heroes, facing off across a map, split into a small number of lanes, etc. You know, minion waves march across the lanes, and defensive structures for both teams defend &apos;their&apos; half of the map. I&apos;m no expert on Lol or Dota 2, though I&apos;ve played a few games of each. In &apos;Heroes&apos;, it&apos;s easy to gain a slight advantage, but it&apos;s hard to snowball to an unfair one. Lots of the time, teams are within touching distance, and I think the other games are more known for the phenomenon of one player falling behind and becoming a liability.
<br>
<br>Here are some remarks that won&apos;t be for those who don&apos;t even know what MOBAs are and why they&apos;re all the rage: In &apos;Heroes&apos;, each map is dotted with mercenary camps, which are minor aids to your pushing power, capable of pushing through defences if left unchecked. The maps, are themed around their &apos;objectives&apos;, and there is laning on top of those objectives, on top of levelling, and the &apos;things to do&apos; never stops. I appreciate that there are smaller maps, forcing you to battle intently for big consequences, but the maps are different. A game is just 15 to 20 minutes. I really find that most rounds remain winnable for either team until a very advanced stage. I&apos;ve seen huge comebacks, I&apos;ve seen decisive late-game teamfights. I&apos;ve seen no filler, here.
<br>
<br>Maybe MOBAs are a very specific sort of game that you either are into or not. Must you play this, must you experience this? Maybe not. Where I&apos;m at, I reached max level (40) relatively quickly, and there&apos;s nothing much else to gain after that other than leveling up individual heroes for the odd gold bonus. There&apos;s a competetive ladder, where I&apos;ve won over 100 games, so I&apos;m movin&apos; on up. Only when you get off of the bottom rungs of that so-called &apos;Hero League&apos;, as I now have, do you find that no all of your teammates are morons. There is an ironclad rule, that if somebody is chatting, they&apos;re reminding you that everybody playing the game is a moron. I honestly can see no redeeming value for chat, here, at all. Like it&apos;s been removed from Hearthstone, which seems draconian, but again, honestly, etc. Yet I played a few team games (where all five players are queued up as a team) where we used voice chat, and shockingly I had fallen in with chaming wonderful dudes. Even the time that we lost a game! weird. But in Hero League you queue up along or with one other person, and get thrown into a team of five. Again, once you move up, you get among serious players but I&apos;ve played for several weeks to get to this point. BTW it&apos;s fascinating how much variety and depth there is to the game, as I still don&apos;t call myself actually *good*, by any stretch! I think that clearly, a lot of complexities from other mobas are ironed out or removed completely. But, learning the heroes and maps is fun and has depth to it. And, it DOES require you to concentrate and put your best effort in to be the kind of player who&apos;s an asset to your team instead of a hindrance.
<br>
<br>From me, then, this is recommended to anyone who has even considered a MOBA. Is it really a 9? Yes, heck, I didn&apos;t toss it a &apos;10&apos;. I&apos;m intimidated at how people have been writing off this game, and I wonder whether winning or losing some online match with 4 random anonymous teammates will hardly matter either way. I think a permanent team of five mates ready to play seems, at this point, like the ideal here, to me. And it&apos;s a totally different experience using voice chat -- which might be a totally unfair advantage, too!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5847234">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you are a parent whose child is playing this and worse, if you let your child to use your credit card, this game is not only going to rob you of your precious money, but also raising a gambler, all hidden in plain sight!
<br>
<br>This game blasts you with random &apos;&apos;lootboxes&apos;&apos; on each hero level-up, yet keeps a lot of content (&apos;&apos;epic&apos;&apos; skins) accessible only from them, not able to be directly bought, and allows to buy more of these lootboxes with real money.
<br>There is also a psychological trick, called fake currency. First you buy &quot;shards&quot; with real money and then use these shards to buy lootboxes, it seems to lessen the &quot;pain of purchasing&quot; creating a perceived distance to money.
<br>
<br>This trend has to die before it spreads, already upcoming Warner Bros game Shadows of War also is including lootboxes, same BS is happening in another Blizzard games - Overwatch and Hearthstone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=7567141">Expand</a></span>

<br>The community here is so much better than Lol and Dota. There are toxic people here to but this game has an effective reporting system and there are far less toxic people here.
<br>
<br>Items in this game are replaced with talents for each hero, which makes it easier for the team to balance things and no need to recall to buy.
<br>
<br>The heroes have a HUGE variance and you will find a character you like. You can play as Murky with a 3 second respawn or The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters etc
<br>
<br>The team is taking feedback from the community and updating the game regulary.
<br>
<br>I recommend at least trying it and getting your own opinion</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5653340">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The f2p grind is not as long/hard as lol. You do earn a small amount per game as compared to lol or dota, but you earn ridiculous amounts from quests and milestones. I just hit level 40 and i have 14 champs, 2 of which are the most expensive. When I hit max level in lol i only had 5 champs (granted i had expensive taste in that game, and this was during the age of absurdly priced runes). The only way the grind is harder is if you are playing 24/7, because at a certain of binge gaming HotS absolutely does become more grindy, but I&apos;m not even close to having that much time to game. However, the $ prices are higher than LoL for individual items, bundles are huge savings.
<br>
<br>Alot of negative reviews focus on team shared exp saying that this brings down because you cant save your team. People saying this are the toxic lol/dota players that start raging at the first sign of a bad team. The underdog system makes it so that one player CAN bring the ENTIRE team back up to a level playing field. Ask any experienced HotS player. It is not uncommon that you are behind by 3 levels at minute 10, but back on a level playing field by minute 15-17. This is essentially unheard of in LoL. I cant begin to explain how many LoL games I&apos;ve played where a carry lost early and never had a chance to recoup and we go on without significant AD damage, or a jungler made mistakes, lost some camps, and now can&apos;t gank or tank for the next 15 minutes while the team lays helpless against a snowballing jungler. The shared exp in HotS is actually what allows a single person to bring back the ENTIRE team, and its not that rare.
<br>
<br>I understand alot of the apprehension of no items. But when we sit and look at LoL, how often do we see AD carries with identical builds? Ap carries? Tanks? Junglers? How many ADs build serker greaves, blood thirster, phantom dancer, infinity edge? Is there really that much diversity in other mobas when each role really just uses all the same items. I actually see comments laughing at HotS for only giving players 6 choices for their build. How is not easily comparable to items? Most games in other Mobas dont even make it to full builds. Granted, it took me until about lvl 20 in HotS to truly get over not having items, but talents are much more unique to each hero than items ever were. And there is actually diversity in your choices than every X champ having to follow the same build. And these aren&apos;t minor choices, they are choices that change your abilities. In LoL, you may have your serker greavers, blood thirster and infinity edge, but how are these items actually changing you? They are making you stronger and more of a threat but thats it, its not a diverse build, you really arent any different just stronger. Talent choices in HotS are choices that add stuns, increase slow, increase cast range, lower CD based on enemies hit, etc etc etc. These choices fundamentally change your champ.
<br>
<br>There are negative comments saying it is slow and repetitive... Now this is very odd because I dont know at all see how you can think that this game is slow and I especially cant imagine how it&apos;s repetitive. Now, I did enjoy the laning phase of LoL, especially for mid, and HotS essentially removes the laning phase. This may be considered a negative, but it makes the game FAST. Brawls and ganks are happening immediately, team fights start at minute 2 on some maps. 4v4 fights happen on some maps to contest vision even before minion waves start clashing. You start with 3 abilities. This game is FAST game. And it is certainly not repetitive. How can LoL and Dota players say that? I come from LoL, where in draft I know where I&apos;ll be finding each enemy champ before the match even starts. I know what builds to expect. I know at what minute it&apos;s best for their jungler to come bot and get me. Ever read a jungling guide for LoL? How is that not repetitive but HotS is? Except for specialists, you usually dont know what lane anyone is going to. You can play only one champ and you will be in different lanes each game. On top of that, you wont be stuck in a lane for most the game, you&apos;ll be brawling. And of course, HotS has map diversity. So not only are you changing lanes and moving around and not following a preset minute by minute guide, you are reading the new map, the new situation, the new comps. Oh crap, we are pushing top lane and the sky temple showed up bot and they have mercs pushing mid at minute 20, we are now in a dire situation that doesnt show up on a guide because this game is way more fluid than any other moba out there.

<br>This game is very different from other MOBA&apos;s, it&apos;s easy to be apprehensive about it. I primarily come from LoL and I&apos;m not going back anytime soon just to spend 3 hours to only complete 3 games where my teammates yell at each other the whole time</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5644832">Expand</a></span>

Tonight I uninstalled it though. I realized I get more upset, frustrated, and angry when playing than I enjoy it.
<br>
<br>It is a nice clean, polished game. Unfortunately, that is the graphics. Gameplay is and always has been lacking. It is simple and faster, or at least shorter than other Moba&apos;s, but it has no real depth. Also there are some gameplay design flaws that I pointed out were terrible decisions in Alpha, but because they are core concepts they stay in the game. One of these things is the shared XP. Unlike other Moba&apos;s where you have your own level, your whole team shares a level. So if one player is not contributing, it hamstrings the entire team even more than it does in a regular moba. Another issue is roles are very set, you can&apos;t compensate for a bad healer by taking heal items, because you dont have any. So basically one bad team member destroys your chance of winning a match. thanks to a horrible matchmaking system, once you lose a match, you are more likely to get bad team members.
<br>
<br>Basically, what happens, is if you start winning games, winning is pretty easy and you can keep winning. Start losing and the same thing happens in reverse. What happens though Is you will get leavers, maybe not the first season you start playing, but sooner or later it will happen in your placement games for a ranked season. At which point you will be fed bad teammates until you start winning more than your losing. As the other team is also bad, it eventually averages out. However, if you get unlucky and have the worse player in the match on your team, you will lose. Because of the way it is designed, it does not matter how good you play, it simply matters who has the worst overall player, or in some cases the most bad players. This makes for a frustrating and miserable experience.
<br>
<br>I would like to add that i have been on both sides of the teeter-totter when winning you get matched with winners and games are enjoyable even if you lose. When losing you get matched with losers and games are frustrating even when you win.
<br>
<br>Because of all the horrible design choices the ranks are near meaningless. I saw someone that was playing at top tier rank 1 on the old ranking system, then Blizzard revamped the ranking system and he ended up at silver 2 with is the 8th rank from the bottom with 25 ranks plus master and grand master. After dozens of games he was silver 5 which was 3 ranks lower. This is someone that was playing in top tier matches before.
<br>
<br>TL:DR. HOTS is a polished turd due to intentional design choices by Blizzard compounded by their poor match making system.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=6894630">Expand</a></span>

It smartly trims the more tedious elements of other MOBA&apos;s like LoL and Dota and stands on its own as a fresh experience that is both faster paced and more accessible. Gone is the laning phase and other things you might be familiar with. In fact you can get about the map much faster by using mounts. The heroes all feel distinct with characters like Cho-gall even requiring two players to play him. If there is one gripe I have; its that some of the game&apos;s heroes and skins are pretty expensive. Its possible to earn them through play but the pricing needs some work. Its adviseable to wait for a sale before spending on real cash on the game at the present.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5997877">Expand</a></span>

It also has the best IPs of the genre. Blizzard really , really knows what they are doing when they set out to design games. I have not been a fan of their games in the past because of the game passive strategy gameplay, but this game is a nice hybridization of strategic play of warcraft/starcraft and fast paced, competitive multiplayer action. This is not a game that you want to play solo! It&apos;s way more fun with a squad of similarly skilled players. The best part of the game is the insane team fights. The worst part is not being able to leave a quickmatch or an A.I. match, I understand why they did this but completely disagree with it... If you get really into this game the microtransactions will get you, for a free-to-play game you will find yourself spending $60 in no time, but for a AAA game that your going to put 50+ hours into, i&apos;d say it&apos;s well worth it. You will like this game if you enjoy competitive online multiplayer with Blizzard IP. Will not like this game if you don&apos;t like PVP and if you are super hardcore jaded MOBA player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=6329736">Expand</a></span>

There are a lot of toxic players not willing to act as a team and in order to have any fun you have to run in with a full party or you&apos;ll end up getting stomped every game because random players rarely know what they are doing and will blame everyone but themselves for all the world&apos;s problems.  I would like to point out however that most of the problems with the game are not uniquely it&apos;s own and are suffered by all mobas. There is one problem that is uniquely it&apos;s own and that is the morons it has on its forums saying that certain characters need buffs or nerfs when 75% of the time they have their head up their ass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5297483">Expand</a></span>

Those first few hours I had a lot of fun. However after more extensive playthrough I must lower the score to 5. In the end, while Blizzard did some good things here for every good thing they did they took out something important from the genre. Everything just has a sense of being useless after to get used to things. Leveling is pretty useless, killing creeps feels useless most of the time, matchmaking is dreadful. All this being said, you can have a lot of fun in the first few hours of playing... but I doubt any experienced MOBA/Team Brawler player will play for long. Kids are going to love it though so I don&apos;t think the game will die.
<br>
<br>Overall 5 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5294104">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The matchmaking is complete bogus. The level system and farm system is almost nonexistent making the players not even care about how they actually play their roles in the game, getting levels together with the whole team and not having gold or items made this game a complete waste of time since you really have no reward for being a good player.
<br>
<br>So there you have it Blizzard, this games is bad, and the only reason it even gets good reviews is because it&apos;s a Blizzard game and have WoW characters in it. And because the majority of people giving good reviews to this game was a first time player on MOBA type games and don&apos;t have experience with actual MOBA games to compare with.
<br>
<br>I really wish they had listened to the player base when this game was in closed beta.
<br>
<br>Anyway, farewell Heroes Of the Storm never gonna play you again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5300159">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll mostly comment on the current state of the game, as Blizzard seems to have settled on the bulk of the game&apos;s key features by now. My complaints are pretty straightforward, so I&apos;ll go with the Pro/Con format.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Beautifully designed game with some amazing characters from across all Blizzard worlds brought to life in a vibrant art style.
<br>- A solid attempt at bringing more casual players into the MOBA fold. Very easy to pick up and play.
<br>- Many characters and abilities feel very punchy and responsive.
<br>- Objective-oriented play is a breath of fresh air from the highly individually competitive structure of many other MOBAs (although - many players don&apos;t yet realize this and ignore objectives, leading to a swift loss)
<br>
<br>Mixed:
<br>- Simplification of the MOBA format across the board. This is a blessing and a curse, as you lose a lot of control but also avoid a lot of unnecessary frustration. Still, overall it tends to make the game feel very shallow.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Practically unplayable due to lag, disconnects, and crashes a large percentage of the time. This frequently led me to be counted as absent from games I played 100% of the way through, granting no XP or Gold even for a victory.
<br>- Extremely aggressive pricing has kept me from spending a single dime on the game, as characters and skins tend to cost around $10 apiece. The cost to unlock all of the content in the game is sky high. And if you&apos;re hoping to earn it all through the in game currency, good luck. It would take ages of constant play at a rate far slower than any other MOBA.
<br>- Absolutely broken matchmaking, made worse by the snowballing nature of the game format. You will know in the first 3 minutes whether your team will win or lose, as once a team gets ahead they almost invariably stay there.
<br>- Many characters and abilities feel completely useless, with no sign of incoming balancing.
<br>- Talents are locked behind level walls, which is a death sentence if you are prevented from leveling as per the above lag, crashes, and disconnects.
<br>
<br>Perhaps in 6-12 months or so they&apos;ll have some of the bugs ironed out... Although, not to sound overly cynical, I&apos;ve kinda lost faith in Blizzard&apos;s commitment to updating and improving their games. Money has become too central a factor in their design philosophy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5320923">Expand</a></span>

You can really tell that they have actively tried to address many of the issues within the genre, such as team composition, game length, grinding, etc.
<br>
<br>Rather than killing minions for gold, you just get a small amount of XP. This discourages players from sitting around farming all game rather than joining in on team fights, which I&apos;m a huge fan of. Rather than buying items, you have an ability tree where you can essentially mix and match hero skills (And active abilities, such as totems that heal your team or drones that repair your structures) to accommodate your team&apos;s needs and counter the enemy, this adds a very robust and defining quality to the game.
<br>
<br>You&apos;re unable to enter ranked match making until you&apos;re level 30 with at least 10 heroes, this might sound unreasonable but it&apos;s actually a very good thing. In games like Dota 2 the barrier for entry is negligible, and as a result you get players who lack the absolute fundamentals of the game and it&apos;s more about which team gets the noobiest players. Admittedly, there will always be landslide losses and landslide victories in any game you play, but most of the games in my experience are pretty much head to head all game long, and the tide can change in a heart beat.
<br>
<br>My only complaint is that you really don&apos;t earn much gold, EVEN with stim packs (an item that causes you to gain 100% more XP and 150% more gold). I have to take a point off for that, because that is pure grinding no two ways about it. You can easily save up enough for your favorite heroes though, so it isn&apos;t a huge deal. It&apos;ll definitely bug you though.
<br>
<br>All in all, excellent game. I hope it catches on</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5295426">Expand</a></span>

You unlock all of a heroes passives once you get that hero to level 4 or if you get your game level to level 40. The removal of  gold  removes all the hated supports/tanks get for &quot;kill stealing&quot; a kill. Leveling as a team is great for promoting team play.
<br>Each of the maps has objectives that activate every few mins. This is when team fights usually occur.Between objectives you can kill/bribe map creeps to have them fight for your side or you can push lanes.
<br>The hero roster is kinda small at 37 but that&apos;s to be expected. In game currency rewards is a bit on the low side. You get 50ish gold per match and some heroes costs are as high as 10,000 gold. The game does allow you to try out your hero at the shop before your purchase.
<br>All in all this game brings a nice change to the genre. Playing the same map in every MOBA got a bit redundant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5295734">Expand</a></span>

Obviously there are going to be the comparisons to games like DOTA and LoL, there certainly are similarities, but in many respects they aren&apos;t justified.  By differentiating itself so drastically, Heroes of the Storm is bringing in an entirely different player base all together, there will obviously be unhappy players from other MOBA&apos;s move across, but ultimately it will do more to introduce more players to the genre, than to kill off either of the other two big dogs.  Die hard players of any of the 3 games will remain so, but casual players, or those looking to get into the genre will almost certainly gravitate towards Heroes of the Storm because it successfully manages to draw a player in, and then keep them playing for longer, by making it about teamwork, minimizing in-match grinding, an maximizing variety through team fighting, hero types, and maps with key objectives.
<br>
<br>Currently the matchmaking system is something of a shambles, but having sat through various incarnations of release, Alpha, Closed Beta, Open Beta, Launch, the matchmaking is always a bit of a shambles out of the gate before settling into a fairly competitive (player to player) system, it&apos;s not in-depth enough to match based on skill or win percentage with a particular hero, or even class, so you may get a great player using a hero and role the are unfamiliar with, which may translate to a train smash; but you will frequently square off against, or beside, familiar players, which is great, especially if you&apos;re carrying a grudge.
<br>
<br>Matches are ~20 mins in length, which always seems to feel longer, but each game settles into a good pace, and keeps the action coming thick and fast.  By and large the maps are great, with a variety of objectives that can quickly change the landscape of a match and play to individual players strengths or weaknesses.  The only real gripe as far as maps go would be the Garden of Terror, where games on average seem to take 5 minutes longer, part of it is due to the volume of contestable objectives, the other part seems to be that the Garden Terror unit itself needs a bit of a buff, as even in the late game it can be cut down quickly without making much of an impact on the enemy defenses.
<br>
<br>Team experience is shared, and while you occasionally get games where one team jumps out to a lead, and compounds upon it through a combination of player kills, fort kills and objective catches, there is always a sense that winning one decisive team fight lat in the game can change the dynamic of the match.  It is something of an artificial mechanic, but one that rewards great teamwork, can punish selfishness, and allow a team that may not have initially been cohesive, to remain in the match if they can form some kind of degree of cohesion.
<br>
<br>the lack of will always be a contentious issue, but the use of talents at various levels throughout the match is a solid system, with each adding a layer of diversity, and adaptability throughout a match, without making them unbeatable (or unplayable) depending on whether you choose the right or wrong talent at any given level.  It&apos;s not only a forgiving decision, it encourages experimentation to find a build that suits an individual players play style, without needing extensive knowledge, or theory crafting.
<br>
<br>The basic marketplace structure seems fair, where cosmetics like mounts and skins cost real money, while heroes can be purchased with real money, or in-game currency earned by playing matches, or completing daily quests.  However, the actual pricing seems to be about double what it reasonably should, particularly for the cosmetic aspects.  What people generally forget is that while the game is &quot;free-to-play&quot; it costs to be made available.  Servers cost money, development teams cost money, so while it&apos;s free to play, it&apos;s not free to make.  That said, most players can justify $10 a month for a new hero, but throw in 2 per month (as we will see in June), and skins at the same price, and devoted players (and completionists alike) can quickly spend upwards of $50 in a single purchase.  Given the massive player base at launch, chopping 25% (or even 50%) across the board could be achieved, without compromising the overall quality of the game.  Alternatively, you can buy all the heroes, and their master skins, by playing your behind off and accumulating the in-game currency, just don&apos;t expect any of the cosmetic options.
<br>
<br>The graphics are slick, sounds, animations, and collisions are all Triple A level as you would expect, each hero feels unique, and has been given the love and attention that you would expect for one that pulls together some of the most beloved characters in the Blizzard universe (if not, all gaming), across the board they are well balanced, but you feel they will be in a constant state of re-balancing as new heroes are added, players develop (and exploit) various metas and so on.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a great game, well worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5304275">Expand</a></span>

Also the Objectives are exciting to take since the map changes and the tide of war turn very quick from turning into a giant bloodknight dragon to a epic barrage of cannons shooting into the enemies base.

For the most part of course: we saw experiments like SMNC, Dawngate, and maybe Smite but they end up either failing, being cancelled or just feel too different to be fun. HoTS however feels different on some regards.
<br>
<br>I will admit upfront: I was not expecting any good from this game and I simply thought that this was going to be another LoL or DOTA2 clone with no innovation whatsoever. But in the end I was partially wrong, and I&apos;m glad that the game is actually tons of fun!
<br>
<br>Instead of talking of what the game is about, I want to focus on what makes HotS different:
<br>
<br>-There are no items. Hence, there&apos;s no gold. Hence there&apos;s no last hitting. Everyone takes experience points at the same time and you don&apos;t get to be shouted if you&apos;re a support in need of money: you can attack and get yourself already into the battle from level 1.
<br>
<br>There are no levels. To be precise, the levels are shared between all of your team mates but it doesn&apos;t mean you can slack off: each player gives exp from their creep farming and hero killing, but there&apos;s no fear of being left behind anyway: if your exp rate is low you just go and farm creeps.
<br>
<br>There is no jungling. Again, to be precise you can find creeps in the jungle but they have another role, and that&apos;s to push the lane. While giving exp, they also turn into stronger creeps that will push the lane and help you out, especially boss types.
<br>
<br>No skill levelling. Your skill levels up with your level and you start with all 3 at once from level 1, while you have to choose your ultimate at level 10 (instead of 6). Instead of skills however you have talents and if you&apos;ve played WoW for the past 2-3 years you&apos;d understand what it is. If not, it simply means that your character gets unique perks on their skills of their choosing, greatly modifying their skills&apos; functions.
<br>
<br>The best example I can give is the new hero Kharazim: he is a melee support but with the right talents he can turn into quite a good damage dealer. Granted not all heroes have the same luck, but their talents can potentially change how they behave in combat.
<br>
<br>There is more than one map. Most of the maps are still the standard 3 lane way, with one being a 2 lane, but the difference here is that you have more than one map and each one of them have unique events that you MUST do in order to win. In Blackheart&apos;s bay for example you have to hunt gold coins so that the pirate will use his cannon on the enemy team&apos;s buildings, and or in another where you need to collect seeds to build an horror that you can use, and so on. As of now, there are a total of 9 maps and they are always random chose, meaning that your last match might be totally different than the last.
<br>
<br>Overall, the main feature of this game is that it&apos;s, quite literally, a simplified MOBA that cuts the fat around the most annoying parts (gold farming, exp farming, etc), and simply makes it more about the actual combat rather than being around preparing to combat. Fights don&apos;t last more than 20 minutes (I won some in 10 as well), and that means you can have that &quot;one more game&quot; feeling quite a lot.
<br>
<br>Still...the game has flaws. Some aren&apos;t game breaking, sure, but they&apos;re flaws nevertheless.
<br>
<br>The game is still relatively new, which means we have a total of only 40 heroes right now: not a lot for a MOBA, especially where in LoL we have more than 100.
<br>
<br>The shop&apos;s prices are insanely high. Sure, LoL&apos;s skins aren&apos;t cheap either but usually the heroes in that game aren&apos;t costy, but in HotS a hero can cost up to 10 bucks! And some skins? 15 bucks too! Luckily enough you can buy them with daily missions that give you gold, but that&apos;ll take you a very long time before you can purchase your favourite hero.
<br>
<br>The lack of items, gold, and experience farming might make the game too easy for some and the talents don&apos;t always translate into new builds: if you have one build working you might as well stick with that only. Besides, didn&apos;t you do the same on LoL? Didn&apos;t you always build the same, exact items for most matches?
<br>
<br>And for last, the game is mostly based of events in the map and might turn off the purists, since you ARE required to achieve the events&apos; goals in order to win.
<br>
<br>But still I cannot deny that I had a lot of fun playing so far and I quite literally don&apos;t see a reason to play Dota or LoL anymore: those games are complex, yes, but they don&apos;t allow mistakes to happen and rely on a high skill level to play another hero properly. But in this game, you can play any hero you want and have fun right at the beginning without worrying about too much of your skills. Sure, some heroes are harder than others but even the hardest to play can be fun to try.
<br>
<br>With that said, I highly recommend to give this game a try. It tries new things and, in my opinion, it succeeds on making a new type of MOBA. Definitely a must try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5441162">Expand</a></span>

They addressed many of the genre&apos;s legacy issues, promoted team play and removed only the pointless complexity, thereby creating a more accessible game without losing any depth in the process. Easy to learn. Hard to master. It&apos;s relatively quick to accumulate gold to get a decent selection of heroes, and there is no advantage to veteran players, other than actual skill, to give them an unfair advantage over new players. For some reason, banning is still a thing, so depending on which hero or heroes are your favourite, if you play in ranked matches, you may rarely get to play your favourites as they may simply get banned.
<br>
<br>The gameplay will be very familiar to players of the genre, but the more objective-based map selection ensures you&apos;ll be fighting the opposing players a lot more frequently than you may be used to. Possibly the best genre evolution is team-wide shared experience accumulation within a game, allowing support and tank players to also kick ass. Unfortunately the game can suffer from performance issues even on high-end hardware. Perhaps a side effect of having the game based on the StarCraft 2 engine, which may not be optimally tuned for modern hardware. This is probably the only major flaw of the game, but a potentially very detrimental one.
<br>
<br>The heroes and villains in the game are drawn from the various Blizzard franchises, primarily Diablo, StarCraft and WarCraft. They have plenty of character and are drawn and animated nicely, usually with meaty sound effects that make it a pleasure to destroy an enemy hero and watch what the physics engine does with them afterwards.
<br>
<br>The pricing appears crazy to me. The individual heroes and bundles, have a very reasonable price in in-game currency, while their real money price is prohibitively expensive, even looking at the bundles they have on sale. For the full price of an AAA game, you will only get a handful of the game&apos;s heroes and a few skins. It&apos;s not really a problem for the player, as you can just buy the heroes you want with gold, but before I would spend real money over simply acquiring gold, they&apos;d probably need to halve the real money costs and increase the gold costs by 50%. But maybe I&apos;m just not the average spender.
<br>
<br>PROs
<br>- Best designed MOBA out there
<br>- Great selection of heroes/villains
<br>- Relatively easy to get in-game money for buying new heroes
<br>
<br>CONs
<br>- Poor optimization
<br>- Crazy real money prices
<br>- Banning system</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=6340689">Expand</a></span>

<br>Additionaly, the balance is surprisingly bad for a Blizzard game, the map-generation isnt as good as in LOL and DOTA and the camera is suboptimal and cannot be changed.
<br>
<br>Still, i will continue to play this game for a couple of reasons:
<br>There are no items, which i love, as i want to know what to expect from each hero, and experience is shared as team and there are no last hit mechanisms, which means, that teams are not fighting against each other as well...
<br>
<br>There is, however, much work to be done, until the game reaches the quality of its competetors...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5405081">Expand</a></span>

<br>Ingame prices are insane, but you can get a real good starter package for ~15$ on the internet is you want to  heroleague faster.

Its easy to play but hard to master.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5412480">Expand</a></span>

Blizzard is one of those companies that is still alive only from name recognition, and this game is a proof of that. Heroes is a &quot;Hero Brawler&quot; which is an attempt to dig into the money from a game which used to be a mod for their game Warcraft 3. This game is the perfect for those who are new to the genre but are turned down by the complexity of Dota 2 or League of Legends. This game is simple, casual, fun. However, as with all their modern games, Blizzard is trying to make this game a competitive E-Sport, which causes issues with the structure of the game. The main game is like most ARTS titles, you&apos;re in a 5v5 map where the objective is to destroy the enemy&apos;s core, which is guarded by forts, and you have to go down lanes and destroy these forts. Unlike most games of this type, your team levels up together, and instead of skill leveling and items, you have power ups called &apos;talents&apos; which you receive every 3 levels, with the choices differing for each hero. Unfortunately this does minimize hero creativity, something the genre is very well known to do well at. There are 10 different battlegrounds, and an ARAM map that nobody plays on. These battlegrounds differ in layout and in objectives that help you push the lanes and win the match. These objectives are hit or miss however, there are those that go well with the ARTS gameplay with focus on dominating you lane like Dragon Shire, however, most maps are distracting and involve you frequently leaving the lane to got jungling for a few minutes like Garden of Terror. These objectives end up feeling like distractions, and you end up running around the entire map trying to get them, without a quick breather in most cases.  The objective bonuses also differ, but some are worst than others, and often feel like game over being hit by them like the one in Cursed Hallow where your forts stop firing and your minions have 1 hp. Some bonuses involve the game destroy towns for you and these maps fail to balance laning and pushing and with objectives, making these maps all about standing around doing objectives until the game wins itself, and really shows how the game could be completely mechanically remade, and yet play almost the same.  Now lets talk about heroes. There are currently 53 heroes in the game with with a weekly rotation of 7 heroes, which you can increase to 10 by leveling up. The f2p model is similar to that of league, but much more demanding. The maximum price for heroes is $10, and their price with in game currency is ridiculously high. The only way to reach their prices is through daily quests, which forces you to frequently play heroes against weak bots so that you can get them over with. Items like skins aren&apos;t better. Average skin prices range from $7.50 - $15.00 and are fairly expensive by industry standards. So, how does the game perform? Not so great. The game is poorly optimized with many FPS and Ping spikes with a lot of stuttering even on high end PCs, and the engine handles reconnects very poorly, having the client catch up to the server, even if you are alt-tabbing. There are a few issues with the core gameplay as well. Due to a lack of items, there are no regular health pots. Instead, there are Healing Fountains and Regen Globes that heal you in a team fight. Due to their abundance and short cooldowns however, recalling and going back to base become useless since there is a lot of sustain options in the game, especially since all the supports are all heal-bots, meaning that they mostly revolve around healing allies. Other differences in this game is the inclusion of ammo bars on forts and keeps. Although you can rely on your minions to tank them, once they run out of ammo, your minions become useless and and you can take on the towns yourself. Overall, this game is an interesting concept, to say the least. However, it is not completely well made, with gameplay that negates certain aspects, of the game, and not well balanced. This game is fun as a casual free-to-play game, but Blizzard is trying to show off this game as competitive, which it isn&apos;t and won&apos;t be any time soon. This game could&apos;ve been good, but many aspects ruin the game and makes it not fun, and makes you wish that you were playing Dota 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=6534476">Expand</a></span>

<br>Heroes of the Storm is an objectively better game than League of Legends. It has better game design, hero balance, strategic elements, ect. Any positive review will explain further. What I am here to say is as a response for some of the negative reviews.
<br>
<br>People say they can&apos;t carry; they are wrong, they are just less able to notice game changing opportunities, or are potentially really bad. LostSands is my username in League of Legends, and I am a Platinum V support main. I play Heroes of the Storm now because it is an objectively better game, and I maintain a 65% win rate in my games. You 100% can carry a game by playing the right characters and making the right play at the right time.
<br>
<br>For individuals who are saying that it&apos;s community is toxic, that is ultimately not a consequence of the game, but rather a consequence of any given online MOBA community, and HotS is by far the most tame of any of them due to the fact that you literally cannot spend that much time in a game typing, or else you aren&apos;t playing.
<br>
<br>Make no mistake, If you wanted to complain about Heroes of the Storm, then you can absolutely do so, but it should be done for the right reasons. The largests flaw in heroes of the storm for me is a consequence of one of it&apos;s upsides. Games are shorter, and more team oriented, objective centric. Because of this, as an individual who is very competitive, it makes the entire game feel less impactful
<br>
<br>There are many times that I know I do very well, landing a critical snare, or a well timed ult, and these things lead to finishing the game. However, these moments don&apos;t stack up very well to the moments I have done at the 37 minute mark in League.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=6644604">Expand</a></span>

<br>The experience is global to the team, so, as long as one member is near a death, the whole team gets xp, what makes you play more like a team and eliminates the carrier role and the support that would help the carrier to level, is focused on healing, disabling and crowd controlling.
<br>Every map has objectives that spawns from time to time and helps the teams to get the upper hand, this is when the game almost forces team fights, and helps the matches to be faster (around 12 minutes vs bot, 21 minutes vs players).
<br>The heroes have all theirs skills unlocked (except the the 2 ults, that you have to choose at level 10) from the beginning of the match and at some levels (1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 20) they have to choose a talent, that gives additional effects for the skills or even unlocks more skills. This is the personalization you get for your during matches, there is no item shop, what makes easier to new player to learn how to play.
<br>Although it seen too casual because it&apos;s easy to learn, it&apos;s not so easy to master.
<br>Most people complains because HotS is too different from DotA. I played DotA 2, League of Legends and Strife, but for me, this is the funniest game of the gender. Do you want to play a game like DotA, play DotA or it&apos;s copies. Do you want a different game, try HotS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5355049">Expand</a></span>

I had to quit playing because a new addition to the family was and is taking up a-lot of my spare time so I could only play a game here and there.
<br>
<br>The problem with that is in DotA 2 and LoL the games are long and very skill intensive. If you want to play seriously at all you need to keep up with the incredibly un-fun last hitting and denying. So I just stopped knowing that I would always be out of practice and I would also be constantly bashed by the trash communities in both games.
<br>
<br>Fast forward to about 5 months ago, I discovered Heroes of the Storm was ready to play in my Bnet client. I wasn&apos;t excited or anything because I already knew I didn&apos;t have much time to game but my curiosity got the best of me and I checked it out. I am REALLY glad I did.
<br>
<br>First off, this is definitely a more casual game. Games are much shorter and the gameplay is all about team fights, jungle baddies and objectives. Instead of the painfully boring slow starts consisting of denying and last hitting present in other MOBA&apos;S, you jump right in to the action and HotS does MOBA action better than all the rest.
<br>
<br>This is where skill comes in. Team fights and objectives present great targets for strategy and skill. A team working together will always beat a team that does not and Blizzard made working together SO very easy with it&apos;s auto-ping system. You don&apos;t need to chat, just ping something on the map and your team knows what you mean and what to do. It&apos;s genius! I found myself immediately having a blast the very first game I played. No-one bashed me for being new and 2 of my teamates even helped me out with advice in-game. Your team shares XP so everything you kill, every objective you complete contributes to your teams overall level. As you level, you unlock talents. Talents present the diversity in builds in HotS instead of items. This is also a great change that removes a-lot of the busywork present in other MOBA&apos;s. I quickly made 3 builds for Sonya, one focused on siege damage and laning, one on killing enemy heroes and one on tanking, all 3 worked great and played very differently! I didn&apos;t have to look up item builds, or farm for gold to get it done.. I just had to fight and do objectives and help my team!
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve finally found a MOBA I can play with my time constraints. And it happens to be the very best one I have ever played. Blizzard has surprised and delighted me with this game. Totally worth playing!
<br>
<br>- best action packed gameplay of any MOBA
<br>- focuses on fun and teamwork over last hitting and denying
<br>- Objectives are unique and effective for each of the 8 maps
<br>- Quick games!
<br>- did I say it&apos;s fun yet? cuz it really is.
<br>- Talents allow very versatile Hero builds.
<br>- In-game gold earning is pretty quick
<br>- Community is actually not full of a$$holes!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5455172">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t know what your skills do? THATS OKAY!!! Just click the one that says it will deal more damage. You never have to last hit. You can suck as much as you want. As long as other people on your team just cooperate with one another, you will most likely  win. The objectives in the match are nice... But really really gimmicky. I wanted this to be so much more. Its great to introduce to your friends who have either a) never played video games before or b) suck soooo bad at video games but they want to play something together that this is what you have to deduce to because you don&apos;t want to lose a friend. Solo play gets boring REALLY quick. To unlock anything you do have to grind it out a bit. Being a support is a joke. Keep in mind that this is still new and they can change many of this...

You can unlock heroes with gold earned in game, pay real money, 10 heroes are free to play each week and heroes are always on sale. You can pick up some tier one heroes for less than $4.

The &quot;mini-game&quot; objectives get a little tiring considering how heavily some players demand they be completed, but I wouldn&apos;t say they necessarily detract from the game.
<br>
<br>This really is like a version of LOL or DOTA for kids though. It&apos;s much more forgiving given that there are many ways to regenerate life and the skills have fairly quick cooldowns for the most part, making a misfire unlikely to be a terminal mistake. Unfortunately, this also comes with the drawback that your characters don&apos;t ever really feel as unique to you as they do in other MOBAs. The talents really add very little to how the character ultimately plays and a lack of items means they will only ever fit a very specific role on the team.
<br>
<br>That said, there is a very nice variety to the skills the characters possess and they do give them a lot of unique feel between them. This ultimately makes for a nice variety of play styles that you can switch easily between.
<br>
<br>A big plus is the fact that, so far, the community is also much less toxic than other MOBAs. Maybe this is just because the game is still young, but typically your team remains silent just using pings rather than berating everyone on the team for bringing them down.
<br>
<br>TLDR: A fun game with good potential if they can keep it up, but it won&apos;t unseat the existing giants, much like nothing could ever unseat WOW as the prime MMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5294235">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The heroes all feel very unique and are fun to play. I have to tip my hat to Blizz for managing to create all those ICONS from DIABLO, SC and WOW and mangage to keep the feeling that you are actually controlling that hero you loved from previous blizz games and at the same time keep it balanced.
<br>
<br>Graphicly speaking, it&apos;s a probably one of the best looking MOBA&apos;s out there.
<br>
<br>That being, said... I do have a few problems with the games.
<br>
<br>The different game maps for one thing. The idea of a lot of map objectives is nice and it does make the game more dynamic and direct-to-action oriented than most MOBA&apos;s, but at the same time... It does make the game less strategic and competive. For now, HOTS simply does not have any Metagame with clear defining positions and roles to assume. It&apos;s one big mess where you need to keep roaming all over the place.
<br>
<br>It certainly is fun, but if you looking for high end strategy with everyone assuming a specific role and position, than you are going to be disappointed.
<br>
<br>This is a the perfect MOBA to play for pure fun. But I really don&apos;t see HOTS being the next big competitive E-sport of this generation. The maps and overall game mechanics simply don&apos;t encourage you to fill a specific role and position in a match...
<br>
<br>The shared XP and stats is a good idea on paper but it also creates a problem : You start not paying attention to your personal perfomances within the team. Sure, people are less likely to be toxic to you now. But at the same time, you don&apos;t have to worry about improving your own perfomances anymore. In LOL if you farm 80 creeps and the opposite lane farms 120 of them, you know that you are doing something wrong. Having clear stats showing when you rock or when you suck is important because that&apos;s will allow you to measure your progress. HOTS has no such feature and therefor does not encourage you to improve/correct yourself.
<br>
<br>If you take LOL for exemple, you know that :
<br>
<br>1) You need TOP : TANK/bruiser; Mid : MAGE/ASSASSIN/AP CARRY, BOTTOM : SUPPORT+AD CARRY, JUNGLE.
<br>
<br>2) One balanced map, that has 3 clear games phases.
<br>
<br>3) LOL allows more chances of a &quot;come back&quot; than HOTS. In LOL, because XP isn&apos;t shared for the most part. One carry can turn around a whole match. In HOTS, if your team is underperfoming and everyone will underleveled to the enemy team. Meaning that if enemy gains 2-3 levels over your team, you have very little chances to win a 5 vs 5 exchange. Not saying that they are no chances of a come back in HOTS, but most of time, if your team slacks of ... Than you are doomed to suffer the consequences of their mistakes. This is really frustrating, as in LOL... I know that If i am 3 levels behind than it&apos;s my fault and I don&apos;t punish my team too much for it. In Heroes, 2 bad team mates can drag your own perfomances down... And you have to deal with the consequences of their failures.
<br>
<br>4) In LOL, you have a lot of strategy and despite what the HOTS fanboys will tell you, LOL actually require a LOT MORE TEAMPLAY. In LoL, the wining team, is the team with the jungler that will assist a lane. The wining team will be the one with the support assisting his carry, the wining team will be the one that will think about buy a ward rather than keeping all the gold for himself. HOTS takes you by the end by sharing XP between the team, but that doesn&apos;t mean that it encourages people to be team players. Quiet the opposite actually.
<br>
<br>All and all. It&apos;s a fun MOBA and well polished. It&apos;s free so why not try it out outleast? It&apos;s definitly very fun and I will be playing it a lot. However, when it comes to the competitive aspect... I&apos;ll definitly stick to LOL and DOTA II.
<br>
<br>If anything, it&apos;s a good gateway for your friends who don&apos;t know how to play MOBA&apos;s to get into it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5296681">Expand</a></span>

A variety of maps and scenarios, a redefined jungle, and advanced talents in lieu of an item shop are what really set this game apart from other MOBA games.  While there are a lot of players that prefer LoL, and those who prefer DOTA, there will be just as many that will prefer HoTS - if not more.
<br>
<br>The grind to get new heroes takes way longer than LoL... so there is a strong encouragement to spend real money to progress.  I have no quarrel with spending money on games, but it may put off some people.
<br>
<br>Overall, I would highly recommend this game to any new or seasoned MOBA player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5305439">Expand</a></span>

And by the way, you later realize that you win more games if you build a hero according to their class (assasin, healer, tank...) and in a real match that is exactly what is expected from you. It is better to build a damage dealer as that and to overtake the enemy rather than go for a defensive build and die slower because your damage dealer is useless. So the builds are mostly just useless filler, an illusion of depth for the naive, when in facts they create more problems than they solve.&#xFEFF;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5326887">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is pure fun, they streamlined the gameplay and made it what in my opinion MOBA should be, quick action paced tactical brawl, wich doesnt care about your gear but more on your actuall skill and tactics. The heroes are numeral, the gameplay is fun, maps are nice and overall its great game. It has some flaws as connectivity issues, some maps are badly designed. But its really solid game an awesome moba for people who dont like mobas, gameplay mechanics wise  9/10.
<br>
<br>But now lets get unto the ugly truth, how blizzard BUTCHERED, let me repeat, butchered this game into state of being unplayable crap. They made perfect game, but they destroyed it. Lets get straight down to the worst deal breaker. Matchmaking....the matchmaking is the WORST I have seen in the history of gaming. Its plain horrible, if you want fun balanced game....no you WONT find it here every single game, is either you steamroll enemy or enemy steamrolls you. NOTHING BETWEEN, scores like 30-0 kills is normal....its just utterlly pathetic and there is no excuse. I dont even know how they managed it, its even impossible to make such matchmaking, it destroys any challenge or fun of the game, you either just kill enemy team without any resistance or you get steamrolled, HOW IS THAT FUN????
<br>Than another brilliant idea was implementation of bots, if one member of your team goes AFK, you literally lose because they get replaced by bot that is brain dead, the other team groups up and game over. The bot just gives them free exp, while contributing nothing to your team. I dont even understand who ever tought this would be good idea??? Why not let other person in queue just jump in??? Or give the team some kind of boost??? No, it gets replaced by good for nothing bot, that ruins your chance of winning + awesome connectivity means this happens in 90% of games, im not kidding.
<br>Another big flop is that the controls are flaky, its not intuitive you feel like you are controlling pushing a rock. You cant do precise moves, you cant skirmish, you just cant do any kind of manouvers so it removes any kind of skill in terms of movement. Than heroes are unbalanced, to the point of there are only few choosable heroes, ussually the most COSTLY ONES, must be a coincidence...*cough* cash cow *cough* on paper it looks lovely, so many combinations and unique heroes and gamestyles....haha no, there is only one gamestyle, choose overpowered ones and win, but op hero of today may be weak hero of tommorow if the price goes down. Community wont boycoot this because they would be fools cause they spend hard cash buying those op heroes...who would want balanced game when they paid to win right?
<br>I thought there is skill involved, but no....actually this game favors those who are less skilled in fact this game has to be the most luck base multiplayer game I have ever seen.
<br>Lets not forget the most intelligent decision, to not be able to choose heroes right before match like in other moba games. You choose hero and go into queue. The awesome matchmaking system now pits you with totally random heroes, wich is 50/50, if your team is imbalanced, you cant change your hero to suit team when game loads or at the beggining of match....no its game over, you are doomed even before you start game and you cant do squat.
<br>Now unto the grinding. You make 30 gold per match if you win, game lasts 20 min average, heroes cost 2000-10 000 gold. If you will play daily 2 hours you make 180 gold....that means you have to play 11 days to just get one cheapest hero or 22 hours non stop....yes you have daily quests but you get one per day and its only 300 gold per quest...you get rewards for leveling heroes, but with the number of heroes, cost of heroes and rewards are one time only....the grind is unbeliavable + you have to have 10 heroes to get into the league battles!!!! Dont worry heroes cost from 2 dollars to 10 dollars!!!! You can buy skin for 15 dollars!!!! This is outrageous!!! Again you buy only the 10 000 ones cause the cheaper ones in league will get butchered. So pay to win cash cow....
<br>Plus there is absolutely NO ROOM for solo gameplay, you cant just drag your team out of loss, no you can do anything in your power but the game is all about team, if one of your team members suck, game over you lost and you cant do anything to change that. Even the pacing is garbage, anything you do until high levels is usseless, you can push one objective in higher levels and you win...one lucky completion of objective and you win....
<br>To sum it up its unplayable 0/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5476915">Expand</a></span>

It is relatively easy to pick up, it is fast paced but doesn&apos;t feel rushed. The game is very strategic so I disagree wholeheartedly with those that say it isn&apos;t. The map mechanics do play a large part of the game so it isn&apos;t all about siege and defending the siege like every other moba. If you go into this game expecting LoL or DOTA but with blizzard champions you&apos;ll be disappointed. However, I do believe that this game takes the flaws in those games and fixes them and makes this game more fun. The gold has gotten better in the recent past with extra level up gold. Also every time you get a hero to level 5 you get gold so if you grind to 5 with that week&apos;s free heroes + daily quests that range from 200 - 800 you&apos;ll find the gold grind isn&apos;t as bad as some games where you only get a first win of the day bonus.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5306663">Expand</a></span>
