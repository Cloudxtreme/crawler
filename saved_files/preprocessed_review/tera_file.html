Tera is the most fun MMO I have ever played, it&apos;s fun for MMO gamers, but it&apos;s also fun for guys like my brother who prefer to play action games on consoles. The classes are really cool, playing an archer is like playing a third person shooter melee classes feel like Fable or Zelda. I couldn&apos;t STOP playing. The action combat is the real deal - after playing Tera you won&apos;t be able to play another MMO with tab targeting - it&apos;s that good. I also really enjoy the depth of the game, leveling my character, upgrading my gear, the awesome dungeons, and just getting better at my class - the lancer. Since Tera actually requires skill, it motivates me to be good at my class so when I play in groups I can be an awesome tank. I really can&apos;t say enough good things about the game - I hope anyone who reads this gives it a try, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2321276">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a lot here that is similar.  Questing follows the three basic paths (play postman, kill x number of x, pick up x number of x), and it&apos;s one of the dull points of the game.  You have your equipment and enchants and stat itemization, just like those other games.  The story is good at best, boring at worst.  Crafting is uninventive and derivative.  Also, the K-RPG lineage pops up from time to time as a distraction (big-busted female models showing too much skin, ridiculous cut scenes, failing to gather a resource node).<br><br>But, after an extended play of the game, you quickly realize that Tera is not about questing or exploring a storyline or crafting.  What Tera is about is team combat, and once you walk down some long, dangerous, monster filled paths to get to that big bad boss with some friends, the game hooks you.  It&apos;s about combat and exploration, and in those two regards it succeeds marvelously.<br><br>Think Monster Hunter or Phantasy Star Online, not WoW or SWToR.  The combat is refreshing, though it takes a lot of getting used to at first, particularly if you&apos;re used to playing other MMOs.  Instead of standing in spot and trading blows, you&apos;re dodging, looking for enemy context clues, and building up combos to deal monsterous damage or stagger the enemy.  It feels nearly Devil May Cry or God of War in execution, and it&apos;s wonderful.  You can mouse &amp; keyboard or controller it up;  both feel great.<br><br>In some bizarre, masochistic design decision, the game starts off incredibly easy.  Easy as in extremely boring and dull easy.  The starting zone is this cookie-cutter, happy island that one commenter in Area chat referred to as &quot;Disneyland minus the fun.&quot;  The devs clearly knew this, as there&apos;s a prologue that lets you experience level 20 combat from the get-go.  It&apos;s dark, ominous, full of baddies, and is a total blast.  Then, you get dumped into snoozeville.  Fortunately, once you get past the 2nd zone, the game ramps up the excitement and the difficulty.  This is when it truly starts to shine. As zones open up and enemies become more challenging, what you get is a huge exploration from boss fight to boss fight, with some thrown in for gear and experience.  And even though it can take a while to get from one place to another, you won&apos;t mind, because travel is painless with all the eye candy.<br><br>This game is utterly breathtaking.  To say it runs graphical circles around its competition is actually demeaning the beauty of it.  Light effects and shadows add depth and ambience, colors explode off the screen, and animations are fluid and smooth like a AAA action game.  At one point, I found myself stopping to just stare at a priest&apos;s spells, only to find myself squashed by a gigantic boss for not paying attention.  It&apos;s MMO eye candy you&apos;ve never seen before.<br><br>If someone says it&apos;s &quot;just like WoW&quot; or a &quot;WoW clone,&quot; shut them down and stop listening.  This game is about as similar to WoW as a Hummer is to a Corolla.  Sure, they both have four wheels, an engine and a transmission, but the goal is totally different.  This is an open-world dungeon crawl of the lineage of Diablo or Gauntlet with the combat genes from a fast-paced action game like Ninja Gaiden.<br><br>That said, it won&apos;t be for everyone. Those put off by K-RPG elements are going to find this game nauseating,  If you&apos;re looking for a deep and complex MMO where you can theorycraft, this isn&apos;t it,<br><br>However, if you&apos;re a big fan of action games and dungeon crawls, give it a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320989">Expand</a></span>

Not to mention almost every annoyance and limitation imposed by other MMOs are addressed here. You can train and level up ALL of the trade skills. They even added costuming to the mix. The quest system is nice and organized. Basically fool proof. Things really move along nicely. Finding guilds and instance groups is easy as pie.<br><br>I gave it an 8 though because it&apos;s not perfect. There are still a couple things that I dislike. I prefer a WOW style 30 minute hearthstone over the town portal scrolls in TERA. They are hard to come by and expensive at low levels. Also I find myself having money problems for a large part of the early game. This could be because it&apos;s so new and the auction system isn&apos;t booming yet. I also feel they re-use some enemy textures a little too much and add a little bit of a different feature, but they still look the same.<br><br>Overall it&apos;s worth the money if you are looking for an MMO to play like I was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2322132">Expand</a></span>

The questing is a bit lacking, very typical and nothing revolutionary. For a day 0 launch the game is incredibly polished and the action combat is very smooth. BAM&apos;s are INCREDIBLE, so much fun, so interactive, keeps you on your toes. I have high hopes for the game and can&apos;t wait to see end game.</span>

It can&apos;t ever achieve that great action combat you can expect from games like Diablo III or Skyrim. However it gives you a combat that&apos;s well worth the effort, great visuals for a MMO and a huge world to roam about. No more people practically sleeping on the instance runs or raids! Now everyone has to be awake and constantly reposition themselves and aim their skills.<br><br>While the true action combat is awesome, it is also more taxing. I found myself getting tired in a few hours because in every fight (soloing) I had to constantly evade and pop appropriate skills. Also, this game has a somewhat steeper learning curve than your average MMO. I&apos;ve seen tanks that do tanking worse than some healers and some healers who don&apos;t know that they&apos;re supposed to heal instead of DPS. While they&apos;re annoying, they will be weeded out once you get to higher levels and team up with a guild.<br><br>The graphics of TERA are amazing, if you got the hardware to run it properly. The characters look very detailed and every weapon and armor looks pretty awesome. Which is only appropriate as you are awesome as well. Still, there&apos;s some issues with the draw distance and some textures on characters load pretty slow. These will be fixed though, I hope.<br><br>When it comes to classes, TERA has the usual lineup. DPS, healer, tank, support. DPS having both melee and ranged versions. As you level you get new skills and spells, but also after level 20 you can buy glyphs to enhance the skills/spells of your choice. You might enjoy doing a spinning attack as a berserker, so why not invest in a glyph that gives you a 25% faster charge time? Or a healer will greatly benefit from a glyph that allows him to choose more targets for a targeted healing spell. You will have a limited amount of points for glyphs per level though, and every glyph has a value from about 1 to 5.<br><br>TERA has enough new in an old formula that it keeps the MMO gameplay fresh. Once the game has been available for everyone the elections for vanarchs (mayors pretty much) start. Vanarchs will be able to choose what things to develop in his region and set tax rates etc. It will be interesting to see how it will affect the gameplay. In the headstart many features and NPCs have been unavailable because of missing vanarchs. So, I feel like I can&apos;t give a permanent score &apos;till I know how much they will add to the game.<br><br>Overall I&apos;m enjoying my time in TERA more than in any MMO since the old school EverQuest in the 90s. Since it has it flaws (that will be fixed I hope), I would give TERA a solid 8.5 for now, but I&apos;ll round it up to 9 since metacritic won&apos;t let me give such a number. I recommend people to at least try TERA. It&apos;s not for the lazy or timid, however.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2321074">Expand</a></span>

Social system is strong,  Beautiful  graphics, huge tough MOBS called BAMs in the open world are also very fun to fight solo or in groups.  I have experienced -0- bugs, not saying there arnt any, but 29 lvl&apos;s and not one bug.  I cant give the game a 10 because of the common fetch and return quests, long PUG instance que times is also an issue. You might wait 30 mins if you are a DPS class, but you can quest while you wait ;)  If you join a guild and run the instances mostly with guildies you wont have that problem.  Everything else in this game is as good, if not better then whats out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320755">Expand</a></span>

First let me say that I have never found any lasting appeal with Korean MMO&apos;s.  I never like the art direction, and I always thought content was severely lacking (offering &quot;grinding&quot; as a sole activity).  A friend recommended I try the open beta, and I was hesitant at first - I hate Korean MMO&apos;s right? Well, let me say that while the game isn&apos;t going to win any awards for breaking the mold with standard fed-ex quests, etc., the combat in this game is so amazing that I have had a hard time going back to the &quot;old way&quot; of doing things in games like WoW.  It is so good in fact that I spent more time playing the head start than I did the GW2 beta weekend.  It is just that good.  So, if you hated Korean MMO&apos;s in the past, give this game a shot.  You can thank me later :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320543">Expand</a></span>

It has all of the standard MMO features, but feels more like a console game.  TERA could probably use 10% more wizards, but that&apos;s my only complaint.</span>

Since other reviewers mentioned the excellent combat, I&apos;ll address some of the inaccuracies and common misconceptions in the negative reviews.<br><br>1) Tera is not a &quot;typical Korea grinder&quot; MMO. Leveling is about the pace of WoW vanilla (probably faster) and there are more quests than needed to level to cap.<br><br>2) The combat is skill-based. Don&apos;t believe the trolls saying it&apos;s a gimmick, everything about the system emphasizes player skill and rewards you for being attentive to what&apos;s happening on the screen (rather than staring at your skill CDs). BAMs have a variety of unique attacks all with specific &quot;tells&quot; which allow the observant/experienced player to do what is needed to avoid the attack. It might be easy to hit the BAMs, but you are rewarded for back shots and unlike other MMOs, are a much smaller region on the mob (~45 deg rather than 180 deg). Besides, aiming your attacks is most certainly not &quot;the entire point of the action combat&quot; it&apos;s just one small facet of it.<br><br>3) The engine and net-code are superb, the reviewer who said otherwise is either a troll or a shill. The game runs amazingly well for how good it looks, and unlike most MMOs, can actually handle large crowds of players without becoming a slideshow.<br><br>and finally, the criticism I&apos;ve heard most often, mostly from fanboys of other games who are jumping on a talking point to criticize Tera:<br><br>&quot;Animation lock makes the combat slow and unexciting.&quot;<br><br>Anyone who has actually played the game for more than an hour or two knows how wrong this is. First off, &quot;animation lock&quot; is describing how many skills root your character&apos;s movement until the animation is finished. It certainly exists in the game, but it is essential to making combat strategic and does nothing to take away from the action. Even with the lock on some skills, all classes are still incredibly mobile in combat for two reasons:<br><br>1) As you level up, many of your most important skills lose the animation lock entirely. You also get skills that can break animations mid-way.<br><br>2) Every class has a plethora of skills that allow you to dodge, run, strafe, or charge WHILE dishing out damage.<br><br>WIthout the animation rooting on some skills, the game would devolve into Quake with swords and sorcery. Having certain attacks restrict your movement gives various skills differing amounts of risk v. reward. Every fight requires a delicate balance of damaging your opponent while still avoiding its attacks. It is also huge in balancing melee vs. ranged in PvP and making positioning and tactics matter more than raw twitch skill. &quot;Animation lock&quot; is critical to preserving strategy and preventing the combat from devolving into a spaz-fest. It&apos;s a feature, not a flaw.<br><br>Since I don&apos;t want this review to look like a marketing pamphlet, I&apos;ll outline some of the most glaring flaws. They aren&apos;t near enough to detract from all the awesomeness in the game, but they&apos;re worth pointing out nonetheless:<br><br>1) Doesn&apos;t pick up till the 20s. This is why you have negative reviews that make no sense whatsoever to Tera players. It&apos;s very easy to get a skewed perception of the game by only playing a few hours. The big draw for most people is the combat, and it doesn&apos;t really get a chance to shine until you start fighting BAMs in your 20s. However, leveling is so quick it should only take you a day at most to get to this point.<br><br>2) Overly sexualized characters: Yes, Tera has its fair share of pandering to horny males. It also has a short, nubile race with provocative outfits. While they&apos;re not exactly sexualized children (since their proportions are completely unrealistic) like some might have you believe, it is a little weird. I choose to ignore it since the rest of the game is so good. Tera also has armor skins so you can have your character wear a less revealing armor set while still keeping the stats of the armor that bothered you.<br><br>3) Quests are fairly bland. They&apos;re not worse than vanilla WoW, but people expect more now. Luckily, the fun combat and beautiful environments make me not even notice this for the most part. Combat is what you&apos;re doing 95% of the time in an MMO, so making that activity FUN matters more than anything else. It doesn&apos;t matter how revolutionary your quest system is if the combat is the same ol&apos; boring tab-target combat.<br><br>As I&apos;m approaching 5000 characters, I&apos;ll stop :). Hope this review was helpful for those not sure what to believe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2321802">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game play is a bit different from WoW, I admit to being a clicker in WoW. This game is actually helping me move away from that a bit, due to the fact you really need to be comfortable using the keys on your keyboard, to your full advantage. This is actually a good thing for me. I admit I didn&apos;t want to like this game as much as I am, I have a full plate of games already that I&apos;m playing ( KoA) or am going to be playing (Diablo 3 ). This game is already making it tough for me to consider that I might have to put it down one down, if I can at that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2322203">Expand</a></span>

It feels like they put a lot of effort into over hyping their combat system and not enough effort into...anything else. The game would have more potential if it wasn&apos;t a standard-style MMO with the most basic cut and dry questing system available. If you want a story line, forget about it. Just expect to collect 10 boxes and kill 50 boars. Not just -any- boars though, but boars with the same model and skills you saw when you were level 5, forty levels ago. Yes, a lot of recycled mobs standing in a field. If you manage to stomach the horrible level 55 through 60 grind and make it to level cap, expect the game to be heavily dependent on gear (which you&apos;ll struggle in getting unless you know a Tank or you are a Tank). Otherwise, have fun in 2hr+ queues even if you&apos;re a healer.  ==== As for the dungeons, it&apos;s probably the best part of the game, however their LFG system is flawed but it gets the job done (barely). What&apos;s wrong with the LFG system? Well, for starters, people AFK and that&apos;s not the worst part, the AFKers are usually the group leaders. Who can kick? Group leaders. By then, you&apos;ll probably have your tank leave out of frustration and your group falls apart. Another scenario, my personal favorite, is someone who &quot;buys a tank&quot; to tank for them in a dungeon but upon arrival, the Tank will leave as soon as everyone zones in. Again, the group falls apart. The next best part though is wiping. Since you get zoned into an instance, chances are you have no idea where this instance is, so if you wipe, you&apos;re ported back to a town somewhere in the zone. Thus, you have people leaving because 1) You wiped, 2) They&apos;re lost, 3) They&apos;re tired of waiting for the lost person to find their way. *Another* flaw is the fact that if you press &quot;wait&quot; before entering a Dungeon, there is no option to teleport back to the dungeon. Yeah..this wasn&apos;t thought through. ====<br><br>Finally, I don&apos;t think Tera offers enough to be deemed as &quot;unique.&quot; The hype of the combat system will wither away after level 40 and I promise you&apos;ll be clawing your eyes out by the time you kill your 9823794872938479824 recycled quest mob. The depth of the quests is not worth reading (not even the &quot;story&quot; quest), the cut scenes are awful and poorly translated. There&apos;s just not much to do at cap to even justify putting yourself through so much pain and agony. Not to mention (take it as good or bad, as a female gamer I found it weird) all the female characters look and dress like porn stars. Tera took &quot;battle thongs&quot; to a whole new level.  ====<br><br>PS: I hope you -really- like 100% gear based, stuns, back-to-back knockdowns, chain CC&apos;s, getting ganked/zerged, and getting two shot [unless...you&apos;re a lancer], because that&apos;s about what you can expect from Tera&apos;s PVP. So much for skill (because..aiming is hard or something?). Honestly, it&apos;s no wonder this game failed in other countries already. But don&apos;t take my word for it, try it for yourselves and make your own opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2428884">Expand</a></span>

Been playing since the beta weekends and it&apos;s superb. The graphics are easily some of the best in the genre; textures are fantastic, colors are gorgeous, and animations are wonderfully done. The combat system is the best out of any MMO, going back to tab targeting is going to be impossible. It&apos;s not only fast but you need to be smart as well and time everything perfectly. The combat system makes the dungeons so, so fun and playing a healer is a blast. My favorite aspect though is the world. It&apos;s one huge world with vast areas to travel and explore. I definitely recommend this!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2322150">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps, sometimes, a little overtly sexy, but you won&apos;t hear me complain. The questing is fun, the classes are fun to play -- personally speaking. The prologue before you start leveling lets you try any class before you commit to playing it for 60 levels. The crafting is challenging and costly, but rewards you very well later on. The enchanting system is fun, and the extraction system is useful.<br><br>The Bad? I can&apos;t really think of anything that warrants reducing the rating -- I don&apos;t play on PVP servers but I hear that the camping is pretty ridiculous. If you&apos;re a fan of MMORPGs, especially WoW, Lineage II, and even more PVP based MMORPGs I think you&apos;ll find that Tera is very fun and rewarding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2321873">Expand</a></span>

I did play Vindictus, but I don&apos;t think that counts. Anyways TERA has combat that is very similar to Vindictus and Monster Hunter, but it has the open world and great PvP that those games were missing. Everybody should at least give this game a try.</span>

It truly is like playing a classic Japanese-style action game with combos.  Your attacks &quot;feel&quot; like they are connecting which is a detail that many MMOs outside of WoW often lack.  The graphics are beautiful as well as the animations.  LOTS of attention to detail.  Some people will undoubtedly be put off by the cutesy graphics, but they are some bad ass looking races and mobs.  Again, the animations and weapon/armor models are superb.  In the very least, TERA is worth the box price.  Two--thumps-up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320975">Expand</a></span>

As far as draw distances concerned I have not had that problem. I see enemies clear across the battlefield. People giving 0-4 are just trolls, and they ruin the validity of customer reviews.</span>

I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants fun combat and amazing graphics that set a high bar for future MMOs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320564">Expand</a></span>

The guild wars system is nice but sometimes the open world PvP can be very abuseable by griefers who have nothing better to do then camp level 10&apos;s. Let me stress the combat system is very nice but the rest of the game is very generic in every way. The graphics are very nice but graphics doesn&apos;t make the game. Also the anime art style might not appeal to some people, it appealed to me but again the game feels generic beyond the combat system.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2323041">Expand</a></span>

<br>- The combat in with game is really a big plus part in this game. Live action, blocking, dodging in a way that lets you kill high level and really powerful monster if you have enough skill. I can&apos;t really describe how great this approach is the mmo-combat.
<br>
<br>1-The graphics, TERA offers a beautiful world with smooth and incredible animations. Lighting, particles and everything visual that is taken for granted should be appreciated. A few times I stopped just to take a look around, and when you let the scenery sink in, you realize the developers did a great job.
<br>2-The games user interface is really user friendly and easy to get into. This makes veterans from other games get a familiar feel that is easy to pick up.
<br>
<br>3-Character creator and selection screen. A big thing for me in any RPG is character creation. I love creating a very unique character down to every detail. TERA offers this and it spent hours having fun playing with the options.
<br>These 3 points are what really stood out to me and I actually really had fun playing this game. it is in my opinion the best MMO to me released next to Guild Wars 2. Why did I stop playing you ask? We will discuss this in the Cons.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1-The combat, the combat... though refreshing, fun and innovative is also part of the flaw in this game. Timing is 100% critical in this game and what really is terrible is the developers decided that your character, but finish up his/her attack/spell animation before you can do anything else. For example, if you are swinging your axe and you need to block because the boss is charging up a spell... well... 1-2 seconds can feel like forever as you cannot use your dodge or block till your character finishes the swing/cast. This will lead to frustrating mayhem. So add to this issue; the developers made it where you can only move in one direction in the game. Which is forward; so if you need to black up, your character will turn its back to the enemy to back up.(There is no walk backwards animation)In this game you must always face your enemy, specially if you are a tank. So turning your back to move out of a AOE spot will lead to your death. Taunting is a 1-2 second cast spell to taunt enemies, this is really difficult since the battlefield is always moving. All spells/attack anchor your character until the animation is complete, and this is what flaws the live action combat as it is not fluid like it should be.
<br>
<br>2-Instances Ques... oh the Instance/Dungeon Ques... If you are not a tank(Since tanking is really difficult because of con#1. Tanks are rare. With this being said instances Ques are incredible long for even Healers and especially DPS. As a Lancer I got instant Que&apos;s but that it not fair to the other players who need quests to wait 30-40+ minutes or longer for a brave soul who rolled a tank to Que up.
<br>
<br>3- Group Quests and special monsters... Most MMORPG have group quests, they are either optional to do, or they only require... 2-3 players(Since these are non-dungeon quests). TERA decided ALL group quests are 5 mans. Same thing with Elites, most games have lesser elites and powerful/boss elites. TERA has ALL 5play+elites that require a tank-DPS-Healer. As mentioned in Con#2 getting a group for a dungeon is almost impossible, so getting a group to till 1 elite for a zone quest is even more impossible. This leads you to skip good XP and good loot. However, with enough skill you can kill these monster on your own, BUT it will take you 30 minutes of constant battle to bring it down(With average quest gear.) So spending 1+ hour for 1 quest leads many player to skip these as you can do a dozen normal ones within that time for more XP.
<br>
<br>In conclusion: Since TERA has failed to address these HUGE issues mentioned above, this has caused a lot of the player population slowly dwindle away. (Can&apos;t do quests, can&apos;t do dungeons, combat is flawed.) Which are the heart and soul of any MMORPG. These things in my opinion is why I quit and I am sure many others. To address the problem NCsoft instead of fixing these problem instead convert the game to Free 2 Play. Might as well stabbed themselves in the chest. TERA is a great game, I liked, I really did. If the problems were fixed, I would have stayed, but NCsoft failed to heed our cries. With that in mind TERA will slowly die like the rest. :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2912022">Expand</a></span>

The good: the visuals are absolutely stunning, I dare say that it&apos;s probably the best looking MMO I&apos;ve ever played (and I have played many); achievements and reputation grinds give you some fun little things to do outside of pursuing the usual endgame MMO sort of thing; the combat breaks away from the typical MMO, and it&apos;s definitely a lot of fun having full control over your character&apos;s actions instead of simply queuing up abilities like in WoW. Unfortunately, the visuals and immersive environment really weren&apos;t enough to keep me interested.. At it&apos;s core, the game is just a whole lot of repetition, with damn near everything being a &quot;go here, fetch this, kill that&quot; quest experience, and it gets old horribly fast. I understand some people like that sort of thing, and that&apos;s awesome, but if you&apos;re looking for a richer questing experience from your MMO, TERA probably isn&apos;t going to satisfy you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2515344">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing it for a month, playing with the unlimited trial, but eventually the game made me buy a copy before the free-to-play release in order to get some bonuses, and it was worth it! The game isn&apos;t perfect of course but, in all honesty, it deserved much more than it ddoes: the system works, it&apos;s pretty fun and, like I said, very different than usual. The classes are pretty varied and only downside is that their restricted to one weapon, but I personally found that to be a good detail actually (it limits steals within a dungeon team, since weapons are class restricted). Also, the races have no limitations in classes and I found that to be a BIG positive remark, since it gives you a lot of combinations and there&apos;s no real con or pro: every class-race combination works greatly and gives you a huge variation for your characters. The graphics are very good...on the characters and monsters, while the areas and some places seems lacking details and have bland textures (although some cities and areas ARE gorgeous). On the other hand, the characters, the npcs, the monsters are greatly animated, greatly detailed and I was amazed how the graphics were. Of course, some characters (the females) may have some...&quot;particular&quot; detailing on them...and I&apos;m personally not bothered that much; I do like when games attempt to be brave by having some revealing female characters, without mentioning that the males too are exagerated in both their body mass and their armors (some are revealing, some are massively big). For the rest, I do have some complains: firstly, I hated that there&apos;s NO vendor outside the villages or main cities, and if you&apos;re filled with trash to sell, you&apos;re basically forced to go back (either on foot, horse, or using a scroll if you&apos;re lucky) and sell your stuff. At least you can teleport to the nearest post. The enemies aren&apos;t hard to defeat...but if you aggro some by going nearby, 2 are the possibilities: 1) you get hit and you&apos;ll be in combat stance, with your weapons out, and your movement will be slower until you defeat your enemies or run away (hard to do). 2) you run away for a good amount of time..only to find them right behind you and forcing you to beat them go out of combat stance. This is SO annoying on so many levels because the enemies will almost never let you go and they can follow you almost for more than 1 minute (I even had fun running around with a mob following me around a fireplace...for five minutes straight! And he wouldn&apos;t leave!). At leas the enemies are slow, but sure are persistent. And for last...the quests. I read a lot of reviews mentioning that among their complains, was the the questing due to the lack of originality and boredom. I have one thing to say: it is true...but why only TERA gets the blame? I haven&apos;t played tons of mmorpgs, but in more than one I&apos;ve had boring quests, yet nobody mentions that little factoid, and I&apos;m talking of games like World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, Aion, The Secret World, and many other small games with the same kind of quests. Also in TERA the questing can be boring, but personally for the wrong reasons: my feeling was that most of these quests weren&apos;t that &quot;great&quot; and could have used more &quot;challenges&quot; too. Infact, the best quests were the group ones, because those big monsters were fun to fight and killing one takes a little more time than usual. Yet again, not the best quests ever, but I don&apos;t see much reasons of blaming the game while we have many other titles with the same issues that nobody ever mentions, and I&apos;m the type of player who enjoys questing, so I may have a word about it!. And for last, the Free-to-Play limitations. I have bought the veteran status weeks before the free-to-play launch and with that purchase I got more bonuses (no char limit, more bank slot) so I can&apos;t judge the limitations properly. But here&apos;s what I think: the 2 character limitation IS a big flaw because of the variety of classes and races...but it was expected. However, the price for an additional slot is just too high at the moment and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if people are annoyed by the price (about 30 euros for ONE slot). You have one bank slot as a f2p player...but the slot alone (about 72 spaces) is very big and I&apos;m still using one (and I&apos;m level 40). Also here however the price is high and not sure if worth it. Other limitations aren&apos;t very big so far (less &quot;auction house&quot; actions, a limited amount of gold sent, and few others), and that&apos;s surprising considering the game is actually big and, except for some other details, the game doesn&apos;t limit much else (unlike SWTOR). All in all, it&apos;s a good game and now that&apos;s a f2p with not too many limits, everyone can give it a shot and enjoy it, because I personally think the game deserved some more praise than it did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2937147">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I played the game for long enough to get 2 characters to level 15 (after a 30ish hours download of the game) and i saw no difference in gameplay from my first minute until the last i was playing. The action is repetitive, the quests are extremely dull, the plot is the same for every race/class and the so called  &quot;action oriented&quot; battle system is just a small perk on a otherwise 3ish score game.
<br>
<br>sure the environment is good looking (although nothing spectacular [no grass details on the ground and realistic roads for instance]) but that&apos;s about it. This game would have scored a 7 if it had been released about 5 years ago, but nowadays, if u use the same grinding formula of koreans MMOs, your product is just gonna hit way below the curve.
<br>
<br>in summary: only get tera if you enjoy grinding/repetitive games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2518929">Expand</a></span>

Main problems  No depth and no character. Nothing more to offer than lots of games out there today and lacks a lot of what  those games offer. Still, i d play it since its f2p and  if you dont expect too much you ll have a good time.</span>

<br>-F2P model is generally less onerous than other MMOs. You even get a decent mount for free early on.
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>-Terrible default controls (although there are robust customization options)
<br>-Annoying mini-map.
<br>-Forgettable story/plot. I enjoyed the game more after I started skipping all the dialogue.
<br>-You can&apos;t cancel an attack once started, making combat less fluid than it could be. (For example, you can&apos;t decide to dodge while you&apos;re in the middle of an attack).
<br>
<br>PRO or CON (depends on your taste)
<br>-Strong Asian sensibilities, although not an anime art style.
<br>-Both male and female costumes/armors are designed to be more sexy than functional.
<br>-There are all kinds of zany mounts and costumes, which can be immersion breaking but fun. This game isn&apos;t really about immersion anyway.
<br>
<br>OVERVIEW
<br>For those interested in an action MMO, I highly recommend trying this game out. It&apos;s the only true action combat experience I&apos;ve found so far, and it costs nothing to try. The introductory area gives you a good idea what your experience will be like playing the rest of game. If you particularly care about story, it&apos;s probably not for you, but if you enjoy the combat, there&apos;s a lot of entertainment to be had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=5392489">Expand</a></span>

Even though FF14 and GW2 are very solid titles, I prefer TERA because it feels more free and skill-based. Highly recommended. I had no trouble running this on laptop either, graphics are highly customizable. I play on EU server.</span>

I&apos;ll just chime in and say that the combat is fun, the character creation is sufficiently varied, and the questing/adventuring model is utterly tedious. It&apos;s just not possible for me to enjoy running to a quest hub, picking up all the quests without reading the text, killing everything in sight, then running back to the quest hub any longer. And then you get a breadcrumb quest to run to the next hub, where you literally do the same things over and over again. The actual act of killing is energetic, however. That can&apos;t be denied, and it shouldn&apos;t be minimized. After all, a huge part of the game is centered around killing. But, seriously, killing thousands upon thousands of foozles, only to look back and see the next guy killing those same foozles...that model is really bankrupt at this point, wouldn&apos;t you agree?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2526364">Expand</a></span>

This game is not an MMO RPG. It is a MMO ACTION RPG. Though some people may not know the difference between the 2, other gamers would see this as the difference between the FF Series and a game like KoA or the recently released Dragon&apos;s Dogma. In fact, having a different view of this game is what made the game a little more appealing to me. unfortunately, it is only by a little. This game has great combat mechanics going for it, and my first dungeon experience was probably my favorite dungeon experience in any MMO I ever played. However, it is the lack of depth in other areas of the game that makes it fall short as a great MMO, in my honest opinion. My reasoning is this: Each and every individual class is the same within its own class. To cite an example from the most popular MMO game, The Druid class in WoW can be 1 of 4 different things (even before MoP). They are either melee dps, ranged dps, tank, or a healer, depending on how you specialize the class. Tera tries to enact a smaller version of this type of feature through the glyph system. Although the glyph system is nice, it doesn&apos;t do much to deviate or specialize your class more than anyone else choosing the same class as you. An Archer is an Archer/ranged DPS. A Slayer is a Slayer/melee DPS. A Priest is a Priest/healer. Any class you choose is the play style you stick with (the exceptions being the Mystic class, which is a ranged dps/support heal class, and the Warrior class, which is a melee DPS or evasion tank), and that will only change if you decide to play another class from the beginning. At that point, you are doing the exact same quests you just did with your previous character, leaving very little room or reason to want to play as multiple characters. Everyone starts in the same area and does the same quests, no matter your race or class. Once I viewed this game as an Action RPG, I was able to enjoy it more and compare it to games outside of the MMO genre. It is a beat&apos;em up game with RPG elements (The core of Action RPGs), with limited room outside of what the class you chose can do. I compared this game to Diablo III in my mind with this in mind. The leveling system is linear, but the game itself is still fun. The fun increases exponentially when you play with other people, which is where this game really shines. If you are looking for your first experience with a MMO Action RPG, Tera takes this role and and does a fantastic job with it. but to compare this game to other MMOs is folly, due to the fact that other current MMO RPGs offer more depth for the class you choose, as well as a better crafting system and, in some cases, quests with more of a point to them (I can&apos;t count how many times I have done quests where they directed me to the person 10 feet away. Although this happens in more MMO games, this game takes it a little too far). I will also say that the gathering system is also one of the best, but only because anything that you gather gives you a temporary buff, which I think is a great way to to promote the player to want to try the crafting system. However, this also gives it too much incentive, as people will gather things that they don&apos;t need simply for the buff that it gives them. But, that is just a case where you take the good with the bad. Out of the few things I have listed because all MMOs, no matter what type MMO they are, have too much to explain about in a small User Review post, the last thing I would like to list is the chat in the game. On the server I am on, it constantly feels like I am in Barrens Chat (for those that have played WoW). It could be said to simply turn off General chat (which I did) if there weren&apos;t any other channels for people to talk over their random BS with (which they did). Never have I seen such an abhorrent abuse of LFG chat when I am one of few people that is actually looking for a group. One could also say that you can simply use the LFG feature, but in any MMO I have played that has this feature, it seems to not be used very much as people will still use the LFG channel for better results, in my personal experience (which I still used the LFG feature and still never found a group). By all means, get the game if you are in the mood for an Action RPG but would rather play in a world full of other players, as this is one of the best. Just keep in mind that this game truly is an Action RPG MMO and it is better to put it in that category rather than the standard MMO RPG category (regardless of the few comparisons I have made of this game to MMO RPGs).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2418724">Expand</a></span>

TERA is a little thin on content and most of the skills and abilities are rather unimaginative, but it makes up for this with very addictive fresh gameplay combat mechanics and terrific visuals. Not only does TERA utilize the latest graphic shaders it has the art work to back it up. Environments are rich and detailed, textures are consistent and high quality. The characters models are incredibly imaginative and well modeled. Most of the nonsense from previous MMOs have been removed, however TERA is not without it&apos;s own monotony; The starting zone is the same for all races, so rolling multiple classes gets fairly tedious quickly. The questing system is fairly standard and there aren&apos;t too many changes to the formula. Perhaps playing this game as a singleplayer game would be a mistake. Where this game shines is in the group mechanics, it is very fun to play with your friends. The Big Ass Monster fights are really fun and it feels like you&apos;re constantly fighting a bunch of mini-bosses which are both challenging and satisfying to take down. Bottom line is if you are playing TERA with your friends or with other people, you&apos;ll have a good time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2326979">Expand</a></span>

It has amazing graphics, and an even more amazing combat system. No more tab targeting and spamming a couple of keys. No more watch some Youtube videos while you tank and spank some raidboss. While the average mob isn&apos;t that dangerous till higher levels, the BAMs and bosses are a lot of fun. They move around, randomly change directions, have multiple move sets, can easily wipe your party if you make a mistake. All this makes the game very rewarding. Yes the quests are very generic, they haven&apos;t really changed from what MMOs have been doing for the past 10 years. It is essentially the same as what every other game does, WoW, Everquest, etc. SWTOR is pretty much the only game with a better quest system.<br><br>If you want to play a MMO which rewards skill based play, doesn&apos;t involve tab targeting and forces you to actually aim and time your moves, then this is the game for you. Th combat makes this game and the graphics are a nice addition too. There really is no reason to not play this unless you are not a fan of the subscription model.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334923">Expand</a></span>

PvP is new to Tera so they are listening to lots of feedback unlike many other games. I have been playing the Beta since it was released in Korea. The game looks different in USA/Euro and Korean servers due to the stage of finish and content restrictions but thats the fault of countries not Devs. Customer response will also vary as in the US it will be Frogster, Euro EnMasse. Frogster does not have a great rep with customers.

Unfortunately, 2012 marks the release date of a game that, in the greater scheme of things, is far behind the competition. Despite Tera&apos;s landmark action combat system - which I truly believe is the prototype for great MMOs to come - it is unfortunately plagued by sheer, overwhelming mediocrity in the departments of questing, storyline, and interactivity with the environment. (those that try to climb ladders and vines will know part of what I&apos;m talking about) The PvP is even a little off - what I expected to be an even playing field where skills matter than levels or gear, I was shocked that this game, which I had expected to pioneer normalized PvP, still rewarded grind time over actual skills such as reaction speed and hand-eye coordination (though it still does this far better than any MMO to date, it&apos;s not saying too much). I gave this a 9 in my first review, but after playing it for a while, I&apos;m disappointed to say the least that this game, which I had VERY high expectations for, didn&apos;t fully deliver like I expected. I still have half a year of my subscription to go and hopefully things turn out a lot better, but if not then Tera has lost a very hopeful customer - someone that truly believed in the greatness it could&apos;ve achieved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2338252">Expand</a></span>

Each MMO had its good points and bad points and Tera is no exception. Graphically I really like the look of Tera and the environment/enemies even though I hate the look of some races (Elin). Storyline was boring, but that is ok with me after SWTOR gave me my fill. Now when it comes to the bread and butter of any MMO is where I am the toughest critic. PVP and PVE are the two things that must be done right or failure is inevitable. In terms if PVE, Tera provides the standard dungeon fare with mobs standing around until you pulverize them for their loot. With a good amount of dungeons on U.S launch and an instance queue system in place that I would say is now a staple for any MMO, they have gotten the basics right Now in terms of actual content, I found the experiences of the dungeons themselves underwhelming thus far (I am Level 40). The boss monsters are really big, but never make me feel really any different from a standard mob. You just don&apos;t let them hit you (unless your a Lancer tank) and dps/heal your way to victory. So far none of the bosses need any explanation of mechanics or warnings really. They are all literal tank and spanks. This has created boredom to the point that a fanboy once told me that &quot;paying attention through the boring encounters is part of the challenge&quot; and he meant it as a compliment to the PVE of the game. Secondly I have an issue with the attributes in the game. So far every other priest that is my level can heal just as well as I can since your attributes are pretty much only controlled by the equipment you have on your character. There is no change in builds from player to player, for example: I can&apos;t stack a particular stat to accomodate the way that I play beyond 8 crystal slots that usually have stipulations on only being allowed to equip one of a certain type (like crit bonus). There are also glyphs that can alter your abilities somewhat like decrease cooldown or increase the duration of a HoT. So once I reach level 60, and have all the best gear, I will heal for the exact same amount as any other priest who is level 60 with the same gear as I have . I know what your thinking &quot;well yea you have the same gear!&quot;, but when every single heal is the same exact number every single time and like every other player of the same class, it gets dull as hell. Also, questing is simple fetch this, or kill that which would be ok if I weren&apos;t slaying pigs or picking herbs for people. When are developers going to start making quests real quests. I rather spend an hour doing one quest that forces me to kill many things and get a massive amount of exp on the way than spend an hour doing farmer and butcher work to get the same exp. Ever since level4 I have literally gathered groups of mobs, stop, and dps them down while they try to reduce my health by 10% at most. The only time I need anyone else with me is when killing the skull monsters, and even then it only takes 3 people. Thankfully I look pretty and my spells look pretty and the monsters that I slay look pretty while doing this. And now onto PVP, This is where I think the game is really going to please the majority of people. With GVG, 10v10, and open world pvp anywhere you want it (on pvp servers like I am on) it can be really fun just questing. You always have to watch your back and be prepared to fight for your life and honor of your guild (if your in one). The classes aren&apos;t necessarily balanced against every other class but thats okay with me. Some classes seem to have an advantage over others but are also weak against others so in a way it balances out i guess. I would like to see something worth fighting for in terms of pvp instead of just bragging rights. Not sure if the game will ever need battlegrounds, could ruin the fun of open world pvp if all the pvpers are in instanced battles. The game also makes skill in pvp the most important factor (not counting level difference) which is great. TL;DR - I gave the game a seven overall based on averaging scores on Graphics (9), PVP (9), PVE (5), Combat System (7), Story (2), and Reliability (9)<br>Would like better boss encounters, harder PVE, a reason to GVG or praise your guild and better things to do/reasons to run errands for quest givers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2335939">Expand</a></span>

Being a veteran of many past and current MMO&apos;s, I tried this game because of the available 7 day 23 level limit trial.  Well, to my surprise I couldn&apos;t get over how fun the combat system is.  I created a priest and was shocked at how awesome he is.  Playing the classic Korean androgynous high elf I can thrash my enemies with awesome combs and without having to repeat the normal rotations I am so used to in other MMO&apos;s.  That is one of the large reasons why I prefer to play this game over many of my other MMO&apos;s.  When I play Tera is fullfills my needs not only for an MMO, but for an action game in where my character placement and skill are actually important.  I gave this game an 8 overall just because while the combat is great I feel that the quests could be a little more stimulating.
<br>One point that I must highlight about this game as well is the graphics.  If you were, or are a fan of Lineage 2 and Korean games you will absolutely love this game.  the character models are absolutely gorgeous, so make sure not to solicit your party members while in an important dungeon.
<br>In a very harsh MMO market, I believe that Tera will stay alive and well.  The community seems good and the game brings to the market elements that no others contain.  I for one see myself playing Tera for many more years to come and have faith that the additional endgame will fulfill its patrons.  As the current dungeons are a very fun and unique experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2549187">Expand</a></span>

Combat is engaging and challenging, it reminds me of vanilla wow when bosses used to hurt, healing was challenging, tanking took attention.    I currently am level 34 priest and im loving it.   Unfortunately questing is linear so no matter how many alts i make there is only one way to go.   Im sure there are quest hubs i missed/skipped however the main story will be repeated on any alts i make which is a small disappointment.  Is it a wow killer?  questionable...given time wow will kill itself however i think this game is definitely worth a pick up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2330750">Expand</a></span>

The questing is more focused on Grind and find I must admit though, But If you are playing a fun class you actually look forward to killing most creeps only passing up the ones you know are weak. And yes it is skill based to have to target even a BAM, If you try this and don&apos;t think so... try soloing it, big fun right there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2324507">Expand</a></span>

The questing may be old fair but with Tera&apos;s beautiful world and dynamic combat, it&apos;s more challenging and engaging than ever before. Play Tera for 15 minutes and not only will you be hooked but you&apos;ll never be able to go back to old style MMO&apos;s again.</span>

At certain levels you will need to hit certain zones to get/complete quest of your level. This only really becomes a problem when you start leveling your third or second character.<br>- Lower levels are very easy, i would say they may even be to lowly tuned, because of the action combat system and your ability to dodge attacks many people may find the game somewhat boring through the stages of 1-30 ish as there is no feeling of real danger of death or real challenge in your questing.<br>- Party size can sometimes be an issue when you have a large group of friends playing the game<br><br>Pros:<br>- Group Quest. I don&apos;t think this is talked about enough about this game, group quest occur in almost every zone you level in but are not needed to be completed to progress through the zone. What this does is it gives players an option to do these group quest which requires a little setup but offers greater item/exp rewards than your normal quest. Or to pass them if they do not want to go through the trouble. This allows players to interact socially when questing, make friends, meet people, etc, but does not punish them if they happen to be playing at off hours when they cannot create a group. While this setup is nothing new to mmo&apos;s it is worth mentioning that it&apos;s in the game.<br>- Party Grinding. I started playing mmos in EQ and FFXI which is why I like that this is in this game, but most bam (Big ass monster) quest when completed will give you a repeatable kill quest, which than allows people to form parties to grind on these bans for the exp they give, which is usually plentiful, and the exp/item reward gains from the quest itself. This is sometimes a welcome reprieve from soloing.<br>- The Action combat system is also very fun, but as mentioned above in the cons can sometimes make the game feel too easy.<br>- PVP, I find the over world PVP in this game to be well done, along with the guild battle system which allows players to declare war on a guild for some awesome over world pvp goodness. Currently no battlegrounds in the game however if you are a battleground enthusiast - Pretty game is pretty. Overall Tera is a very good game, but it&apos;s not one that I can suggest to everyone. The cons that i mentioned will affect certain people more than others. because of the way the questing system is currently setup, which is basically going from hub to hub doing kill/gather/deliver quest for some people It may feel like a very large grind. While the combat system does take the edge off a little, as mentioned when you get the hang of your class, and the best way to handle certain mobs it also makes the game sometimes feel like it&apos;s to easy and to repetitive. Add on to that what feels to be a very linear progression model, it does make the game feel like somewhat of a grind, this is even more prevalent on your 2nd or 3rd 60. However their are ways to change it up, they do have dungeons and a dungeon finder system, they also have ways via repeatable quest to grind bams in a party setting so you can focus on your job mechanics, ie if your a priest you can actually be healing a party instead of grinding quest, or if your a tank you can practice your tanking. These are welcome reprieves and are quite fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2322738">Expand</a></span>

Later I&apos;ve tried Age of Conan and Warhammer Online, but both were disappointing. During last 2 year I&apos;ve been trying to return to WoW, but didn&apos;t succeed - it was so casual and fast-pacing. And so I gave a try to TERA. I should say I never played Korean MMORPG before and I was always afraid of constant grinding. However, I was surprised by quests in TERA. I felt like I returned to original WoW - sometimes quests are even challenging (solo fighting BAMs, for example). Some people complain about generic quests, but what else can you expect from MMORPG (korean, particularly)? In games like that, you always work as a delivery man, who, however, most of his time cleaning locations from evil monsters. Nothing special here. Next, I&apos;d like to mention graphics and locations design. In 3 words, they are great! Very juicy colors, huge detailed environments, modern-looking characters models and, in general, relatively good engine optimization (I don&apos;t have top-notch PC, by the way).<br>What I really enjoy is combat system. Yes, I&apos;ve never played korean games before, but I did play american and european MMORPG. Combat system in TERA feels so much different from what I&apos;ve seen before. Maybe it is not perfect, I agree, but it is so much more dynamic and fresh after years in WoW that I am still under positive influence. For example, when you are fighting monster in WoW, he / she always faces you (unless he / she is under stun effect). No matter how fast you run around him, he&apos;ll always will be facing you. In TERA, after monster land his attack or use his spell, it will take time for him to recharge and turn back to you. While he&apos;s recharging, you can perform any tactical moves, run around and score a combo or two! That is why it feels so amazingly different than regular MMORPG.<br>So far, so good. What about bad point? I don&apos;t really like UI. To me, it feels a little sluggish and non-intuitive. Moreover, sometimes it just fails to do what you expect. It is not really a big deal, but sometimes it hard to understand certain features. All in all, I like this game so far. Though it was a very squeezed review, I mentioned points I really enjoyed and felt good about. Hope to see you in Tera!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2405998">Expand</a></span>

The lore is interesting and its clear there&apos;s still a lot in store for the game. The release went well and there were server transfers offered at release. There was lag in major cities and I&apos;m finding that with an AMD/ATI based system it can get jittery at times but once everything is loaded it runs at a smooth 40-60fps. I definitely recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2405934">Expand</a></span>

I think my main is in the low to mid 30&apos;s. I have to say that after every game i&apos;ve played Tera is that game i keep coming back to. I&apos;m in other betas for new mmos and I have enough money i could buy any game on any system but for some reason tera keeps drawing me back. The questing is repetative, however the environment is great and as a casual gamer i don&apos;t feel the need to spend days a whole day playing tera. I log in for a couple of hours, knock out a lvl (leveling is pretty fast), log out and then after a day or so i feel like i want to play it again. Once you play tera for awhile normal mmos (and most games) will drive you nuts. Even the new ones. It was so difficult for me playing an upcoming MMO beta when i saw a boss charge up for a super attack and i couldn&apos;t block, dodge or teleport away from it. I just had to stand there and be killed. Tera will seem to lack customization at first and it will seem to lack content, however that gets introduced starting at lvl 20. It also seems kind of cookie cutter at times, but once you start to pvp you&apos;ll realize there really is no formula for success, just like in a basic fighting game, using the same moves over and over will get you killed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2389979">Expand</a></span>

However, I had a pretty damn annoying experience w/ the launcher. No matter, support walked me through it and now everything is fine. The game has stunning visuals, smooth gameplay (no jerky movements, flawless animation), active combat, and I want to stress that last part- when you hit a monster u actually see them react and u feel like ur delivering a powerful blow. However, the quests are the same old generic mmorpg quests. That&apos;s to be expected from most mmos anyhow. Another small gripe I had was the fact that there was no option to sword n&apos; board and generally the melee classes only get to choose 1 weapon whereas in most other mmos you have several options. Regardless, the game was well-made, cool looking characters (hot looking women :D), amazing environment, the works...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2347102">Expand</a></span>

While grinding can be fun, I want more to a game than that. TERA provides in spades. For one, it doesn&apos;t have the rather annoying faction mechanism prevalent in games like WoW [and Rift]. When starting all players are in the same zone, so playing different races with friends is easier. The combat system really makes your attacks and strategy matter even when dealing with a simple grind. And I actually find the NPC dialogue to be interesting and logical in explaining why you have to go perform the quests. If you like games like Dragon Age II and Mass Effect 2 you&apos;ll likely enjoy the way TERA approaches crafting an MMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2349549">Expand</a></span>

The difference here is the world they have created is absolutely jaw dropping. Gorgeous visuals with action combat and cool looking architecture and mobs and I do not mind roaming around killing mobs and turning in quests. This has become my go to MMO. It&apos;s F2P.. give it a shot.</span>

The only thing that kept me playing was the action combat, but not even that is enough now. The community is incredibly toxic (given a f2p game) but what&apos;s even worse is that Enmasse Entertainment, the publisher for Bluehole is horrible now. They do less than pay attention to the community&apos;s needs, banning people from forums if they were to list a single complaint that is bashing the company. They lost their best staff and now are currently running their game into the dirt, promising players content but then pushing it back by more than two months. The only compensation is a cash grab event that only makes Enmasse more money. If you don&apos;t believe how displeased the community is, go ahead and check the forums. They are removing downvotes on the forums however, so soon enough we won&apos;t even be able to voice our displeasure. The game is going downhill as their support is getting worse by the month and there are no fixes to problems in game that are mentioned frequently. I used to love this game, but now I&apos;m just tired.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=6013396">Expand</a></span>

While I admit this would not work on some hard mode fights in WoW and other games on dungeons you could usually just stand around and hop out of fire if it landed under you.  With Tera you have to constantly be aiming  at the boss (or teammates if you&apos;re a healer) planning your abilities and avoiding damage.  The mobs in Tera have really cool animations as well.  I just finished healing a Cultists Refuge group last night on my 40 Mystic and that was the most fun I&apos;ve had healing in a very long time.<br><br>Try this game out you won&apos;t be disappointed!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2322431">Expand</a></span>

The having to dodge which requires you paying attention to the enemy animation (there is no cast bar) along with the lock on and aiming systems works very fluid. Graphically it is a eye pleasure, even more as you get out of the starting areas. It is a Korea based MMO and therefore unlike most Western MMOs it is a bit more grindy that some maybe use to. Though this is offset a bit by the combat system which keeps you engaged a bit more than just standing there pressing attacks while downing a drink like other MMOs. If you are into healing this is a completely new experience than you will find in any game out currently. There are no healing bars that you click on, heals must be aimed at players or AoEs placed. Healers also provide support to the dps, have to be on constant movement around the field and on some fights are responsible for dps other targets. Can be a bit nerve racking at first, though quickly becomes a completely immersive experience. Again no standing there watching a healing grid waiting to play whack a mole.  The crafting, enchanting etc system is a bit more tedious to really skill up. Crafting you will have access to every possible one (armor, cloth, leather, alch, focus etc) along with every gathering skill (mining, herb, essences). You could realistically level each one though it quickly becomes a money sink or gathering sink for certain reagents which only drop off larger mobs or instance quests. But to me this makes it much more satisfying to actually complete. Enchanting is the same way with a RNG to it if the reagents used (powders and a sacrificed item of gear) increase it. This generally means you probably will not be really enchanting the gear which is done through stages (+2-+12) till higher end tier items.<br><br>There is also no pay2win model here as some who have spewed here with not playing nor any attention to the actual discussions of the Western Tera. If you are looking for a chance in a MMO, do not mind a more grindy though generally rewarding experience with full attention and fluid situational awareness from all group members; then get Tera.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2322602">Expand</a></span>

Soloing BAMs is a fun and rewarding experience, and can be a headache if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re heading into. The instances later on are very hard, one mistake means you&apos;re dead...which is a good change from the late drop of difficulty in MMOs(Im looking at you SWTOR and WoW). All in all, amazing graphics, playability is fluid and consistent, classes are mostly balanced, and sexy females in always a good point in my book!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2322736">Expand</a></span>

When issues do rise up, the support team is also among the nicest that I have encountered, and quick to reply.  En Masse is also very vocal on twitter, so players always know what is going on when an in game event occurs, or there are login troubles.  There is a lot of potential in TERA, and I expect great things to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2323103">Expand</a></span>

What drew me to this game was the combat.  It is amazing.  The skill shots, the character placement, the animations, and the particles are all top notch!  The graphics are superb, character creation is fantastic, even the early level grindy quests are fun because you look so good doing them, and with the combat system you can approach every fight differently.  The instances are fraking awesome, and the instance bosses are enormous and terrifying!  The BAMs and world bosses break any kind of monotony you might find in a regular quest chain.  People who give this game a bad review are the jaded gamer type, don&apos;t let them steer you away from what could possibly be the best game of the year, and certainly the best MMO.  My only gripe is that the instance matchmaking system needs some smoothing out, long queue times can be a turn off to people sitting there not doing something to fill their time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2323466">Expand</a></span>

I even created an account for this. I frequent this site to check game scores very often. TERA is a great game. The combat is refreshing and it becomes pretty addictive. When you first start the game there is an intro which allows you to &quot;test drive&quot; the class you choose as if you were already at lvl 20, which is fun and also introduces you to the combat system. The does progress an epic storyline, which isn&apos;t to deep or full of intrigue but it gripped me enough so that i actually watch all the cutscenes. The community in the game seems to be pretty happy with the product so far, and i have a feeling tera is here to stay. You&apos;ll have no problem finding people to party up with or a guild to join. So, i strongly suggest anyone to give this game a go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2323834">Expand</a></span>

The action-style combat has ruined me for traditional tab-target MMOs. The races and classes are extremely varied and all fun to play. Only two slight complaints: First, a little more variety in the character customization would be welcome. Second, the questing system is fine, but nothing special. There are plenty of quests, though, so leveling up is easy. Overall, it&apos;s an awesome game, and a breath of fresh air for an MMO fan like me who hasn&apos;t had anything grab his attention in a long while. I would give it a 9 out of 10 but I&apos;m bumping it up to offset the ridiculous zero scores from people who seemingly haven&apos;t read about the game, much less actually played it (hint: there is no play2win cash shop). Everyone I know who has tried it has loved it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tera/user-reviews?user_review_id=2324116">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Tera has suprised me with highly impressive visuals and extremely fun combat. The game has raised the bar for the MMO genre. The Big Ass Monster battles are chaotic and a ton of fun. The world is absolutely huge and highly detailed. There are so many peices to talk about but the bottom line is that I will be playing this game for a very long time.</span>
