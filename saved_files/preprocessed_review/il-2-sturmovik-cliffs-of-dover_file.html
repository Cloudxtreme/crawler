If you like World War 2 history and have an interest in flight simulators, look no further: this is the game you&apos;ve been waiting for. You will relive the Battle of Britain like you have never seen it before. You will find yourself crammed into a claustrophobic cockpit and fight for either the Royal Air Force, the Luftwaffe or the Regia Aeronautica Italiana. If you are an aviation buff, you will be pleased to find an impressive selection of aircraft used during the battle, even less known aircraft like the Boulton-Paul Defiant, the Supermarine Walrus, the Short Sunderland, the Dornier Do-17 or the Vickers Wellington. Of course, not all of these aircraft are flyable yet but the iconic planes like the Spitfire, Bf.109, Hurricane, G.50, Blenheim IV, Ju-88, He-111 and Br.20 can be flown. You can fly online with up to 100 people, which makes for very impressive battles with friends and foes.
<br>
<br>The story of Il-2 Cliffs of Dover is a long and complicated one. When Ubisoft and 1C Game Studios dropped support for the game, a merry band of volunteers decided to create a free mod in order to fix the many issues Cliffs of Dover had back in the years 2011 to 2013. They became known as Team Fusion, and they keep modding CloD to this day and are slowly expanding the game to a whole new level. Sound mods, graphical fixes, performance improvement, flight model adjustment, new flyable aircraft, additional war theaters... these guys transformed this sim from the buggy-and-barely-playable-piece-of-junk mentioned in early reviews to what we have today. The difference between pre-mod and after-mod is mindblowing and it is the only way to play this game, trust me.
<br>
<br>The strength of the game is that it is a happy medium between the complexity of a study sim like DCS and the accessibility of an arcade sim like War Thunder. You can jump into a cockpit and fly like you&apos;re really there. You need to keep your engine temperatures (oil and water radiator) in check by maintaining proper RPM and manifold pressure settings (which are controlled by prop pitch and throttle controls) that should come with any cheap joystick you can buy on the market. Just like in real life, your aircraft will be prone to stall, spin and attempt to kill you if you do certain types of manoeuvers. You will learn how to takeoff and land by maintaining proper rotation and approach speeds. You will also learn how to navigate using either a magnetic compass or a gyro compass, just like they did in the 1940&apos;s. You can also do high-altitude bombing with the real bombsight and autopilot controls if you like more advanced stuff. And if you think this stuff is too hard to learn, have no fear. There will ALWAYS be someone to explain these things to you if you ask for help. How do I know? Well, simply because I gave up on this game three times before Team Fusion finally modded the game and I asked for help on the ATAG forums (more on that later). These guys taught me everything I know and it is my pleasure to train new guys on a regular basis.
<br>
<br>Cliffs of Dover wouldn&apos;t be where it is today if it wasn&apos;t for the efforts of Team Fusion, but I must also mention something else about CloD. There is a sense of fellowship in its online community that is unique and has no equal anywhere else. ATAG, also known as the Air Tactical Assault Group, is an online community where it all started. ATAG hosts the most popular online server and their forums are THE place to go if you want to learn how to play this game. There is a virtual Flight School where people request lessons with volunteer teachers. People can join Virtual Squadrons, discuss History, create multiplayer events, online campaigns, and have lots of fun on Teamspeak (which is a must if you want to fly online and coordinate with your fellow pilots). Whether you are a flight sim veteran or someone who has never even seen an aircraft, there is always place for you among the skies of Dover. If you like competition, you will find in multiplayer some of the finest virtual pilots with thousands of hours under their belt. If you want to learn how to fly from scratch, you will find someone to teach you the basics, from how to start your engine and get your butt off the ground to advanced techniques on how to shoot down enemy planes in flames. Guaranteed.
<br>
<br>Overall, Cliffs of Dover is now living up to its promises and it is a real blast to fly. There is nothing more intense in the history of gaming than trying to shake that Messerschmitt off your six o&apos; clock. The next Team Fusion patch will include (for free) a new theater, new flyable planes (among them the mighty Wellington bomber) and all sorts of new goodies. The &quot;vanilla&quot; and the TF mod versions are as different as night and day. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=4778243">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is way better than Battle of Stalingrad and the DCS series, regarding multiplayer. I would give this game an eleven if I could.

<br>There is a number of great single player campaigns from Desastersoft. Multiplayer offers up to one hundred players simultaneously on ATAG server.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s really a shame that it was never finished according with vision of Oleg Maddox, but at least it&apos;s moddable so we will see more content.

<br>This game was crap when it came out. So performance hungry it brought machines to their knees, riddled with bugs and issues. Team Fusion - a core group of volunteers - have brought this game forward leaps and bounds. There&apos;s still issues, the AI model is unpredictable and not truly satisfying, spotting targets can be frustrating and the graphical map based bugs (rivers getting MORE visible from altitude) grate. However, for out and out immersion, jump on an online server (the folks at www.stormofwar.org have really taken online to another level for one example but there are others) and fly a campaign with AI and other players. Realistic ground control by players, huge bomber intercepts, stats and alsorts of new stuff planned.
<br>
<br>As and when Team Fusion get access to the core code of the game to continue bug fixes, restore features hidden away and release new content - Africa theatre is coming in TF5, then this game will be an absolute treat and still beats the pants off the competition like Battle of Stalingrad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=4825625">Expand</a></span>

The mod from Team Fusion called &apos;Team Fusion 3.0&apos; simply makes this flight simulator great! It fixes nearly every issue that I had with the game, and fixes the graphics so that the game no longer stutters or lags for me and it now runs smooth and blows Il2-Sturmovik out of the water in terms of realism. It adds FULL HD textures to the game and has increased its performance on my rig insurmountably, which isn&apos;t bad considering how many games hate a 2-way SLI configuration. Now I should give this game a low mark because it took a dedicated community to fix all of its problems, but I really want to draw attention to the fine work that Team Fusion has done. Seriously, if your reading the reviews and thinking about not buying the game, look at the mod and reconsider, it was the best 300mb I have downloaded in a long time.
<br>The only real problem with the game is the lack of a dynamic campaign but other than that, with the mod it is a very capable successor to the IL2 franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=3493613">Expand</a></span>

Cliffs of Dover is the most realistic air combat experience available today. It has been rescued by the community and is beginning to display its true potential. Lag issues have been dealt with and many flight model and environmennt issues and effects have been fixed. Still some snags to eliminate but as a &apos;realistic as it gets&apos; air combat experience it is second to none. When played on-line against other real people-pilots you will recognise some of those Autobiography experiences you have read about: in the thick of a dogfight one moment, then next you&apos;re alone in the air and feeling a tad nervous - look for friends! (there are many); watch the sun and check your six or pay the price; make the kill while your wingman protects your back. Tackle mission objectives along with your friends or just go hunting. Talk to each other on Teamspeak and organise your mission sortie with others or just follow the plan. Everyone is friendly and helpful. You can join a Squadron/Unit if you want the experience of flying in combat formations and working together.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=3946806">Expand</a></span>

Also, compared to modern based games, this has the most REALISTIC physics and flight, as I said. Even the gunnery is truly realistic! In my opinion this is the BEST flight simulator out there, mind me, but this game has gone far... and is going further!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=3845293">Expand</a></span>

Since the Team Fusion mod has been released, this game has become a must-buy for flight sim fans. Arcade flight enthusiasts need not apply. The Team Fusion mod has drastically improved the graphics and now a 100 players in the sky is a regular occurrence on the AGAT server. Be sure to join the AGAT Teamspeak community who will assist you with Team Fusion patch process and help you learn how to do complex engine management. Until you learn how to keep your radiator coolant temperatures low while trying to compete, expect to overheat your engine to the point of frustration. However, the AGAT community is mature and helpful. Yesterday, they even set-up a New Pilots Flight Academy whereby veteran pilots arrange a time to help you at whatever skill level you are at, including beginners who want to learn how to start their engine. If you have the patience, the time, and proper gear, you should be up and flying competently after a few days. However, understand that some of the veteran pilots who have been into flight sims for 10-15 years are in the skies, too, and they may be on the other team. More than anything, I am impressed with the friendly, mature helpful attitude of the AGAT pilots. No one on the AGAT servers is going to act disrespectfully towards you. It is an inviting, helpful, and friendly community of pilots who all want to help you improve so everyone can enjoy the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=3960993">Expand</a></span>

Flashes in smoke trails sparks on hits unreal damage models and great cockpit function. If an enemy is over your base it&apos;s a real nerve wracking chore just getting your Daimler Benz started...Bf 109. Flight can be on the difficult side sometimes...Manual prop pitch in dog fights can get hairy but you learn. Your guns sound amazing btw! Flight models are the best in my opinion and you have access to hundreds of custom skins online. I can see COD improving and improving still as time goes on with other theaters and aircraft. Get a copy it&apos;s not expensive and go  to the ATAG stite for info about Team Fusion and the patches you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=4575947">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The FM,DM, Graphics, Versatility (Coop, SP, MP, technical details ect), very good.
<br>Cockpits the best there are atm  I think.
<br>
<br>MP: a 10
<br>SP: I am using Desastersoft add ons, a 8 for me.
<br>Out of the box SP I would give an 7, because of faulty AI.
<br>
<br>Still good for many hours of play eventough I have the game 2 years. Thumbs up!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=4697690">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is the absolute best propeller simulation you can fly.  More immersive and detailed than even Rise of Flight.   GUI is still a bit primitive in areas  but what flight sims have ever had great gui&apos;s?
<br>
<br>This sim  like all others, requires tweaking to get the most out of it.  Ton of undocumented features.

It&apos;s now the most accurate and advanced dogfight simulator available. The flight model is just as reality, the graphics are stunning (though, I currently possess a highly expensive Nvidia graphics card), the IA flies even better than real humans and the scenery is incredibly realistic. The only thing I find annoying of this game is the lack of playable planes. Basically, the only fighters which are flyable are the Bf.110, the Bf.109, the Spitfire and the Hurricane (in lots of variants, of course). IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover recreates the WWII dogfights as never seen before. If you are planning to buy a Dogfights Simulator, don&apos;t even think in wasting your money on a modern war game, Cliffs of Dover is way more realistic. It doesn&apos;t matter if you want a modern war simulator, spend your money on a REAL simulator. (Also, never forget that the WWII Dogfights are the funniest and toughest ones!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=2942397">Expand</a></span>

Never crashed on me, run everything on high smoothly, no sound problems and most of all its just such an awesome game. Everything is just so amazing and real. Huge multiplayer matches, intense heart pounding action. Really this game is just amazing. Sure it needs a few tweaks here and there but they are working on it, patch after patch, and such a dramatic performance improvement. This game is a 10 no doubt. But i warn everyone, when i say realistic i mean it! I was on a server and 10 &quot;kids&quot; complained because they didnt know how to start the engine. Mixture, Prop, fuel **** and much more is applied to start the engine! It is one intense, fun, and serious game all in one. I really hope people will buy this game because it really isn&apos;t a let down, if you read others they still love the game even when it did have all the crashes. Its just THAT good</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=1705096">Expand</a></span>

Its somewhat limited in how many planes there are, and that you can fly. But graphics, realism and physics are excellent. I am truly hoping for an expansion, or DLC on this one. I highly recommend it to simulation fans. But you need a beasty PC to enjoy it to the fullest. Nothing like flying in a formation of 50+ bombers, manning a gunner seat, and being attacked by an equal number of enemy fighters. Plus any escort fighters. The mission editor is great, and you can build just about any mission you like. Again, the only limitation is the in the number of planes in the game, its not as many as it should be, and that you cant pilot all of them. I really do hope they expand on this game, because otherwise its fantastic. The graphics are what I have been waiting for in flight sims for a long time. Most of the bad reviews are from IL2 fans, who are disappointed in the lower amount of content compared to previous games. I can understand that. But this game is also different then previous IL2 games, theres a lot more detail. So theres more work involved in adding that content, and its more pressure on your system to manage all the extra stuff. I have a quad core, maxed out with goodies, and this game pushes it to the limit, as it is. The weather generator is insane, even though its a bit buggy. I still say this is one of the best flight sims, over all, in a very long time.  The game creator says they are still working on this game, and more stuff is coming, and fixes will happen. I sure hope they keep that promise. A check for videos on Youtube will give you a look at the graphics of this game..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=2220891">Expand</a></span>

<br>When it starts it is totally unplayable. Even on lowest settings with just 1 plane in the air (and now imagine that 128 mp battle). Before I get flamed, my spec is way above minimum (it is not recommended spec) but it should do for some medium.. or even LOW settings.
<br>Shame.</span>

<br>The 3d models, flight models, damage models and small details are in a class all by themselves and make BoS look like dated material. Don&apos;t even get me started on the clickable cockpits. They are so detailed that going to Battle of Stalingrad felt like red baron 3d or aces of the pacific.
<br>Furthermore the future looks very bright. A dedicated team of enthusiasts is slowly but surely fixing all that was wrong with the sim on release. Whats more they are currently adding more planes, ships, vehicles, making AI planes flyable with unique cockpits, and even creating a new theater to use them in.
<br>Team Fusion is as good or better than any other mod team Ive ever seen. It takes time with this complicated sim, but they have a solid track record of astounding quality of production if not quantity. They are going to take this sim into the future and make it into the sandbox that Il2 46 was.
<br>The dream of a new Il2 with better graphics, sounds, maps and physics is realized here, and it only gets better with every new pilot! The more people that come along and the more that have the skills to contribute the more the sim can grow.
<br>This sim is OURS now, we can make it what WE always wanted! Not the flight game lock you into a crap single player campaign, in which you must grind out XP to unlock the tools for multi player. That is garbage.
<br>Get on board brothers and together we can build Olegs original dream from a decade ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=4798186">Expand</a></span>

My specs are 3.3 I5, 4GB ram and AMD 6950. The graphics is really good and gameplay is alot more realistic than the first il2. The sound is pretty rubbish but I don&apos;t really care about that.</span>

We all had the utmost confidence in Oleg and team. This is what we get? This is a very sad day in flight sim land. If people like me (been a dedicated fan and loyal supporter of IL2 since 2001) are giving it bad reviews you know something went dramatically wrong. Close to a decade of dev time...I just cannot comprehend this. I am just rambling now because I am so utterly shocked.<br><br>One comfort in this mess is most of us know Maddox and crew will work hard to address these issues. They have a stellar track record of doing so. Better then any other developer in the industry and that is fact. They have a long road ahead and have a tremendous amount of work to do though. I mean...I have always kept up with my gaming rig (mainly for this series) and the game was running at 1FPS...1 Frame per second!!<br><br>I see Steam pushed its release till July now. I guess the reason is obvious. I just do not understand why Oleg and crew released the game in this state in other territories. I mean...its been this long and I am sure there was little pressure on them to push it out. Having said all that I will gladly buy this game again when Steam releases their copy. I want nothing to do with my current one. Sound odd I know but I want to support the combat flight sim market and especially the team that created the greatest flight sim of all time. I just want it to be playable. Hopefully in the end...the review average will go up. So weird seeing a Maddox game with such a bad score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=1643865">Expand</a></span>

I have been waiting for this game a long time.  I was a big fan of the original IL-2 Sturmovik, and I am impressed with Cliffs of Dover.  The game has been patched and I am running the game at almost max video settings and getting great frame rates.  I think the Metacritics need to go back and review this game, it is much better than what they give it credit for.  It has all the features of the original IL-2, the option to record flights, along with all the settings so that you can fly as realistic as you want to get.  Can&apos;t wait to see if they will have more flyable planes like the original.  If you liked the original IL-2 you will love Cliffs of Dover!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=1778024">Expand</a></span>

I really had hope for this game as I have been into flight sims since the old CGA vector graphics days and a IL-2/Maddox fan since the very first IL-2. This game is unfinished and full of bugs. I have a top of the line system and suffer micro stutters and input lag from the get go. The GUI is horrid and the campaigns unfinished and anemic. It has very poor stick support. My Saitek X-52 throttle will only register input maybe 10% of the time as well as the occasional input lag. With my system I should breeze through this game. intel i7 2600k @ 4.4 Ghz, 16GB DDR3 1600, Samsung 470 SSD, SB X-Fi xtreme, ATI 6970 2GB video. I am running all the latest drivers and the game is the latest version. I feel so let down over this as I not only purchased one copy but one for myself and one for a friend. To top it all off I pre-ordered in April only to suffer multiple release postponements. I have SUCKER written all over my face. Shame on You Ubisoft! With the combination of your insane DRMs and willingness to give the consumer the bird by riding on the laurels of established and respected titles i.e. Silent Hunter 5, IL-2 whose fans pre-paid by the 1000s for these titles and then giving them unsupported/unfinished crap. I have bought the last Ubisoft game I will ever buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=1709039">Expand</a></span>

They&apos;ve released it before it&apos;s ready so don&apos;t waste your money.</span>

                                        <span>I am a big Il-2 fan since .. about 2008 but this game is really bad, i cant run it on middle graphics with a gtx 260 but that&apos;s not the big deal. The Campaign is short and strange to play and you have so many bugs in the game. The complete opposite of the Normal Il-2 Sturmovik game.
<br>So this game is just like a downgrade in every aspect.</span>

<br>This game has been released far to soon, it&apos;s not ready and should never have been released. There is no way the developer didn&apos;t know about these bugs, its a waste of money, don&apos;t buy this game until you read about a patch that resolves the issues.
<br>I want to support the developer, but don&apos;t buy this game until its ready. I wish I didn&apos;t and I could have brought something else to play this month. as I can&apos;t see myself playing this for at least a couple of months due to the large amount of issues.
<br>Wait until its been sorted before you part with your money, its a joke at the moment, maybe april fools joke?

I think both are well done, with the damage modelling being ahead anything sim-like released up to date. The planes can take all sorts of damage to pretty much any structural element. The hitboxes are placed everywhere, so you can lose your ammunition, you can lose your gear etc. The engine can suffer all kinds of failures, you name it. Wooden planes light like a match but take more explosive punishment. The flight modelling seems a bit off here and there, but it`s just a question of fine tuning.<br>Graphics.<br>Stunning, again imo the best ever in a sim. Visibly better than in Rise of Flight for example.  All the reflections are there, the clouds, the trees, big cities, plane model detail and last but not least clickable , self shadowing **** which are their own class. Every gauge and lever works here, the canopy also might be retracted, everything supported by Track IR and 6 degrees of freedom. Everything on the ground is also exceptionally well detailed.<br>Sound.<br>Merely average. I`d say maybe a bit better than those in IL2:1946 but that doesn`t say much. When flying **** only it`s no biggie, but external sounds are awful, almost cartoon-like. It doesn`t exactly kill the immersion when flying, but it could have been done MUCH better. As of now, the developer is reworking the sound from scratch, so it may come out better in a few months.<br>Online multiplayer.<br>I`m affraid it`s almost non existant currently. No coops, very bad and unsuitable Steam interface make this a cery limited experience. For the moment, only the quake type servers are running which really isn`t the way the game is supposed to be played (I`m talking about real squadron based real war - type missions like say escort a bomber formation).<br>Single player.<br>Very limited, good at best. The English campaign is very bad, the German one is great. The thing I dislike about them is that you`re forced to run missions with different aircraft , basicly a bunch of loosely made missions instead of a genuine pilot career. Not recommended.<br>Performance.<br>At release it was really awful. Recommended specs would let anyone run this game at mid 20s FPS and multiple stutters. Now it`s easily 70fps anywhere but over big city areas where it`s like ~40fps, still stuttering just a bit. Running this game at medium is possible, maximum settings are reachable only with top of the top of todays hardware. Nonetheless, the settings are VERY scalable, so after few hints here and there most will be able to play it with satisfying FPS. BUGS : the game has many bugs actually, happily none are show stoppers.<br><br>In order to do the game justice, one must absolutely write, that the developer team is working on fixing every bug and optimising this game. There will be many patches to come though the years, as the sim is planned to be supported thrpughout the entire life cycle (possibly 3-10 years).<br><br>The rating would couldn`t be higher, as this game still has big holes, which should never still be in a release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=1693707">Expand</a></span>

I might be biased because I have gotten used to the flight models from 777 games of Rise of Flight and Battle of Stalingrad but really, terrible feel to this game.</span>

<br>
<br>When this sim originally came out it had flaws that put a lot of people off and gave bad reviews on sites like this. Unfortunately this has marred what is now quite literaly a brilliant sim. Its taken a while but for those of us who gave this sim a second chance we have not been disapointed. For that reason I feel that I should make people aware of what they are missing if they don&apos;t get this game, but don&apos;t take my word for it..checkout the recent youtube videos..
<br>
<br>The online experience is probably the best part of this game...To fight in the skies over Kent and the Pas-de-Calais in real time, scan the skies for enemy contacts, wing with a buddy and engage a deadly foe, it is exhilarating. You can change your shells to whatever shells were available at the time, you can change convergence settings so that your bullets hit exactly the same point, you fuel up to what amount you need which will influence your aircrafts balance and weight. The dogfight tactics are still the same from 1940, the flight characteristics are different for each aircraft and at different altitudes too....You can also fly bomber runs in 1940 bombers and take control of every manned gunning position as you try to fend off hungry attackers.
<br>
<br>Even for new players there is plenty of help on youtube with 5 minute startup procedures, and how to dogfight in every flyable aircraft, you can be up and flying in just a few minutes. The best online server is ATAGS and they also have a website to checkout which is a must for new flyers with questions. Most importantly a large group of WWII aircraft enthusiast programmers have taken this sim and are constantly modifying it for a more complete experience. They are called Team Fusion (TF) and they also use the ATAGS website as their base for discussion. The issues that once surrounded this game have now been resolved and the TF are now dedicating their time to making game enhancing changes like contrails and reflective cockpit canopys. Thats where this sim is at now.
<br>
<br>So my advice is to ignore any review earlier than 2013 as Cliffs Of Dover is as different now to when it was released as night and day and is nowhere near comparable with those early reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-cliffs-of-dover/user-reviews?user_review_id=4599436">Expand</a></span>
