                                        <span>Id say so far this game is not bad like some think. Its so environmentally amazing. The sounds the scares, the characters, and the story is sticking to its roots. I can say the cut scenes are mehh and sometimes the voice wont match its lips but other than that im having tons of fun with the game.</span>

This is certainly not a game for people with ADD or compulsive disorders (i.e. people who enjoy CoD, Halo and the like) and I can understand why they would feel disappointed.  It&apos;s because they were expecting an FPS and move around too much, too fast and probably die incessantly as a consequence.  For those of us that like to immerse ourself in a world, take a long Sunday drive, and take in the little details, this game is exactly what we&apos;ve been looking for.  And the fact that it does this while staying so true to Alien form is very impressive.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been gaming for many decades and I can honestly say that this game made me feel like it was 2003 and I was playing Metroid Prime for the first time.  If you know what I&apos;m talking about, tarry not and buy this game.
<br>
<br>To Creative Assembly: A sincere thank you from the bottom of my heart.  This masterpiece is a true work of art.  Please remember those of us that love it when you contemplate a second.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4569463">Expand</a></span>

Best Alien game ever? Most likely. Perfection? Not quite. Whilst the game marvels with its infectious ambience and hair raising AI, it never quite manages to escape the extra terrestrial clutches of being quite irritating. Whilst it&apos;s non-AAA qualities allow for a game which is far from intent upon chasing the buying masses, it&apos;s insistence upon overstating the omnipotence of the Xenomorph, can leave you feeling like victory will (at times) fall upon little more than a lucky break.
<br>
<br>The games pacing begins with aplomb, as you begin to question the presence of the chief villain far before its arrival and, at the same time, are lead into a perfect false sense of security as it finally appears to turn your nightmares into a living reality.
<br>
<br>The following hours are spent with an understanding that thinking on your feet is a necessity, whilst scrunched eyes and screen-avoiding head turns are sure to be the only way to shun an alien AI which can be considered one of the most intelligent ever seen in a video game.
<br>
<br>Of course, this is also one of the games chief problems. At times, the Alien AI is simply unstoppable. Were he to say jump, my only response would be to ask how high. And whilst a bevy of craft-able weaponry may seems like the perfect distraction for his hunting expertise, you can be left with the feeling that if the game wants you dead, there is very little you can do to prevent your inevitable demise
<br>.
<br>But (and it is a big but), this is what makes Alien Isolation everything it claims to be. It really is the ultimate survival horror. Forget the overused simplicities of low ammo in a world of insurmountable odds. This is a isolated ship in which you are restricted in movement (thanks to a very well designed level structure), clouded in doubt (thanks to superb audio and nerve jangling flumes of steam), and fraught with fear (thanks to a single entity set upon pulling you limb from limb). Alien Isolation will keep you on edge, it will make you question your decision making and, above all else, will ensure that you are thoroughly immersed whilst doing it.
<br>
<br>Reviewers have been fair in their opinions that the game drops off in the closing hours. By then, you have seen it all and done it all. A heavy dose of everything at once does little more than distract from what has (up to that point) been a battle of wits against singular foes. However, if you want an October of fear to lead you towards Halloween, Alien Isolation is arguably the best game to achieve that and one created to ensure that as you fall asleep at night, you will have sharp memories of the speed, power and terror of the mighty Xenomorph.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4571996">Expand</a></span>

<br>In terms of production, Isolation shines brightly. With a beautifully crafted world inspired by Ridley Scott&apos;s original masterpiece, and a truly exquisite use of sound design to help invoke fear, adrenaline, and isolation.
<br>
<br>The only real problem with this game is how too unforgiven it can be at times. Yet, it reminds me of the Souls series where every fail inspires me to keep trying instead of making me want to stop. Isolation is a true AAA survival horror worthy of your time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4569931">Expand</a></span>

<br>THE GOOD : + Amazing AI +Oppressing environment + Faithfull to the movie + Great attention to detail + Very scary + The survivor mode and Crew missions are enjoyable
<br>+ Enjoyable story (But predictable if you are a fan of the movies)
<br>+ Its not Alien Colonial Marines :3
<br>
<br>BAD :
<br>
<br>- A bit too long, which breaks the pacing
<br>- The AI can be a bit unfair at times (Ex : Camping an exit or locker for 5 minutes)
<br>- The saving system (while adding an extra layer of stress, which is good) can be very frustrating at times as it forces you to start over.
<br>
<br>Not the perfect Alien game, but a VERY good one. Best Alien game since AvP2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4569360">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As for the game play: It&apos;s absolutely terrifying at times. (Akin to that of Dead Space) The intensity of enemies nearby, the internal struggle of &quot;Do I make a run for it?&quot; really makes the game a blast....Though on the other hand, where it&apos;s quiet. Where nothing happens, is equally as unsettling. This is where Alien: Isolation pulls through. The fact that you never feel safe in any situation.
<br>
<br>Creative Assembly outdid themselves this time. Whilst it&apos;s not the game that people wanted in some aspects (You can&apos;t blast the Alien away with guns), it&apos;s the game that people definitely deserved considering the mess that was Aliens: Colonial Marines.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4569490">Expand</a></span>

<br>As an individual who favours a good horror game over everything else, this  is hands down an amazing thrill ride and worth your 60-70$. Creative assembly nailed it. Rarely am I ever immersed into a game on such an in depth level. Story, graphics, sounds, pacing all get 10-10.</span>

When you die you think &quot;oh well lets try a different approach,&quot; nope doesn&apos;t work here. I also had a pretty glitchy gameplay experience where the alien would be on the other side of the map while I was hiding and run directly toward my hiding spot and kill me without me moving and with all of the extra features turned off. This happens constantly and kept me from progressing for hours. Waste of 40 bucks for an overrated, overhyped game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4586201">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>BUT... it&apos;s just a long, boring, sluggish, pedantic exercise in stealth movement and &quot;trial and error&quot; approach. It&apos;s DAMN HARD! While the Alien AI is as rigid as a plank (it&apos;s totally scripted), it takes MANY tries to overcome a single section.
<br>
<br>And, above all, you have to walk, and walk, and walk, through a neverending obscurity, along winding tunnels, winding paths, winding corridors that takes you to another corridor, another path, another door, with NOTHING that happens in between.
<br>
<br>You can actually spend hours (I mean it!) under a table, or in closet, just to be instantly killed and have to start it again from the last save point. And, yes, the poor saving system doesn&apos;t help to get out from this quagmire of frustration. FRUSTRATION and STRESS at its best.
<br>To the point that, at a certain moment, while you are playing, it&apos;s impossibile not to ask to yourself what&apos;s the point of all this wandering around, opening doors &quot;Zelda style&quot; (once you need crowbar, then you need a decoder, then some sort of lance...), repeating the same section again and again and again until you get it right.
<br>
<br>Alien Isolation is a very good simulator of an hell of a life. It simulates very well how stressfull can be being chased by an invulnerable alien, and some other guys you don&apos;t have the slightest chance to overcome in combat. As such simulator, the game is tense. But one should accept this level of frustration and stress ONLY if he were actually try to escape from an Alien unbeatable creture! Got my point?
<br>A lot (a lot!) of wasted potential</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4571602">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game, from the middle on forward, gets really boring, with stupid missions that make you do the same thing twice. Literally. You know that the game don&apos;t have more &quot;content&quot; to show off, but keep pushing you to play without fun or a good reason.
<br>
<br>And the AI could be better. Sometimes, is like you&apos;re playing a Playstation 1 game. The enemies find and see you in unbelievable situations. This work kinda OK with the Alien or the robots (as they aren&apos;t human and could have better &apos;senses&apos;), but the humans make it clear that the AI is not ok.

<br>Yet, I think Alien Isolation is a good game, but with STUPID things that make it a 6/10. It&apos;s like they had to finish the game in a close deadline ?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4587857">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>- The graphics are spectacular
<br>- Love the 80s film grain
<br>- Nice looking environments
<br>- Interesting Characters
<br>Negatives:
<br>- Way, way too long
<br>- Repetitive
<br>- Gets extremely annoying getting glitched out and caught by the Alien
<br>- Bad story
<br>- Bad enemies</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4808637">Expand</a></span>

The visuals and sounds all fit very well with the situation.  I often found myself getting anxious just from the environment or the ambient noises. They did a great job on that part of the game.  The rest of the game is just so-so.
<br>
<br>In terms of story, it is OK.  I wanted to see what happened to Ripley in the end. Sadly, the ending was very underwhelming.  After several earlier crescendos that seemed like the end of the game, the final scene was a low point.  Instead of a dramatic user-controlled action scene, they went with a short quick-time event. They literally paused the action and said &quot;Press Button X&quot;.  The rest of the ending was left open-ended. They were either planning for a sequel/DLC or they expect you to be familiar with the Amanda Ripley story from the Aliens movie.
<br>
<br>The scripted encounters with the Alien felt pretty forced.  The Alien from the Alien movie is a stealthy predator that ambushes people one at a time.  The scripted encounters in this game had the Alien drop into a room and walk around in erratic patrols.  As you moved on from room to room, the patrols moved with you.  It always felt like the Alien knew where I was, it was just waiting for me to break a rule before it attacked.  Sort of like, &quot;I know you are in that locker, but you haven&apos;t made a loud enough noise yet so I&apos;ll just circle &apos;round again.&quot;.
<br>
<br>Speaking of circling around again, the backtracking got a little silly.  No device on that station worked with any less than three switches in three separate corners of a room. You could never walk down a straight corridor, you would always get to the end to find the door locked and need to take the long way around. I get that it was meant to drive the tension when trying to avoid the Alien but it got annoying pretty quickly. The &quot;You mean I have to go back?&quot; moment loses some impact after the tenth time.

<br>If you like stealth games you will like parts of this game.  If you like the Alien franchise, you will like parts of this game.  I enjoyed most of my experience; maybe some DLC will fix up the ending but I hate paying for a better ending.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4672403">Expand</a></span>

The graphics and environment are top notch and the sounds and lighting are great, but gameplay is extremely lacking. I&apos;m surprised it got such high reviews but then again, most people like games that require very little thought. The game forces you to play the way they want you to and you can&apos;t progress unless you meet the checkboxes the developers put in. If you just want a walk-thru game with a predetermined path that the developers hold your hand through then this game is for you.
<br>
<br>The game is very linear and scripted to the point of predictability which I will explain more. Subtle things are quite annoying such as not casting shadows while standing in front of lights or unable to step over suitcases. Literally you are prevented from walking down a particular hallway because a small row of suitcases block the way, thus making the game feel even more linear and controlled. The story is driven by waypoints meaning as soon as you enter the area either a small cutscene or event occurs but only when you enter that specific spot or area. Another item I thought was silly was after blugeoning a person I could not pick up their pistol, odd right? Well you can get a pistol but a specific one the game tells you to pick up..
<br>
<br>Adding to the scripting and predictability you will quickly learn when and why the alien appears. My first play through was on hard and after about 3 hours I figured out how to avoid ever seeing it. Additionally you will learn quickly where and when the alien is active. This predictability essentially made the game unplayable to the point that it wasn&apos;t scary nor tense at any point of the game.
<br>
<br>*SPOILER BELOW*
<br>
<br>Basically the Alien operates only in areas where drones aren&apos;t and only comes out if you run or shoot so you can walk around freely without worry..Yes as long as you walk and not run you&apos;ll never be attacked by the alien.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4584446">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sevastopol itself is highly immersive, and is brimming with detail and excellent environmental storytelling. Atmosphere is top notch, especially if you&apos;re a fan of the film. There are SOOOO many details that would make Alien fans giddy inside.
<br>
<br>The main antagonist the Alien, is very well done. He/she/it/whatever instantly became one of the most respectable and feared opponents I&apos;ve ever encountered from a video game. It&apos;s extremely intimidating, and a large part of that intimidation factor comes from its sound design, especially the loud thumping footsteps it makes as it moves. It&apos;s also highly unpredictable, so you can never truly feel safe, even if the Alien leaves the room. Every encounter with it is frightening, tension-filled, and just brilliant.
<br>
<br>The other enemy you will encounter often on the ship is the android working joes. I&apos;ve heard a lot of people complain about them stealing air-time away from the Alien, but I have no complaints. Evey encounter with the Alien takes A LOT out of you. The Working Joes are there so you can get a breather. It also helps that they fit well into the storyline, setting, and atmosphere. Just like the Alien, they have a brilliant sound design, and can also be quite intimidating and scary. It&apos;s also immensely satisfying to beat them up. Largely thanks to some excellent animations, and some really solid-feeling weapons. There are also a few encounters when you have to deal with Working Joes and the Alien. This is extra challenging, because any sound you make will attract the Alien to your position.
<br>
<br>The animations in this game are BRILLIANT. Every action you do, the game has an animation for it. This may seem small, but it really adds to immersion.
<br>
<br>The story itself was good enough. It did its job at gelling the game play sequences together and it did it well. The story was quite straightforward, and that&apos;s fine. It didn&apos;t need to be some crazy mastermind plot. I was content with it and didn&apos;t expect anything more. Only problem was the ending. Definite sequel bate, and just a slap in the face. I won&apos;t get into more.
<br>
<br>Overall, Alien Isolation was the best survival horror game I&apos;ve ever played. Extremely immersive, tense, terrifying, and at the same time an excellent tribute to the film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4654158">Expand</a></span>

If you figure out the pathway you can get through it pretty easily its okay worth a playthrough but I wasnt scared.  Maybe bored a little I dont have headphones maybe that was the problem.  Everything looked great except the humans and androids why scimp on that?  Buy on sale for a playthru.</span>

<br>
<br>Bugs I have encountered:
<br>
<br>1. Game occasionally/frequently freezes after reloading from last checkpoint (after dying).
<br>
<br>2. A few game device called &apos;rewire boxes&apos; are supposed to be hackable but some will freeze the player (not the game) if you attempt to hack them (requiring game restart).
<br>
<br>3. Doors that are needed to continue the story, that should be open, are locked tight. This is interesting. On the AI site people are experiencing this at random places and, as it turns out, are sometimes a result of player error (player failed to hack a terminal, rewire box, press a switch or whatever). However at least one is the result of the developers&apos; failure. The objective indicator shows two different paths to reach the objective yet one path leads to a locked door that will only open if the other path was taken with no game message/cue/explanation offered at the locked door. It looks like a bug. If one looks at youtube walkthroughs it would appear that the door should be open by default and one is left scratching one&apos;s head. Its a story logic issue. So I spent an hour in-game trying to figure out what I did wrong, then spent a half-hour watching youtube videos and came away empty without a solution. It wasn&apos;t until my second playthrough that I payed close attention and came to understand that the objective indicator was faulty, was the source of the problem. I have a hunch that many of the bugs are really similar &apos;gameplay&apos; story problems.
<br>
<br>These are the bugs I have experienced but there are myriad more on the AI web. The bugs seem to be random.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a little irresponsible to not have fixed one bug over 13 days since release. The AI website is a POS, too. I was trying to help by posting my bug experiences and solutions but today the &apos;login&apos; link is broken (on both IE and FF) so i say ef it. It&apos;s playable on my PC but check the AI website for an indication of the scope and randomness or the bug.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4613059">Expand</a></span>

The voice acting was good, the sounds are amazing and stay true to the film, and the graphics and visuals are absolutely stunning. The second the Torrens spacecraft arrives to Sevastopol Station (where you will spend most of the game in), something doesn&apos;t seem right. The ship looks damaged and there is someone trying to contact you for help. You then find yourself on the station alone, and then you start to get scared. I thought the Alien was going to kill me the second I stepped in the ship. And this is where we get to the A.I. that the Alien has. The A.I. of the Alien is very good although it may sometimes bug out but most of the time you cannot predict which way the Alien will go and that is what makes the Alien truly terrifying. But the Alien is not the only threat on the ship. The other threats are people and synthetic androids called &quot;Working Joes.&quot; As soon as I saw these things chills ran down my spine because I remember how Ash relentlessly attacked Ellen Ripley in the 1979 Alien. And when they do attack they are a chore to kill. It takes several headshots with a gun to kill one of them and many, many hits with a crowbar to kill. But when you get more advanced weapons like the bolt gun, they are easier to kill. But if they outnumber you, you are screwed. The bad thing about this game is that the Alien gets &quot;killed&quot; by Amanda Ripley about halfway through the game and the other half is fighting working joes which was a bit dissapointing to me. But, Alien Isolation is a great Alien game that we&apos;ve all been waiting for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612077">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For those looking for your typical first person shooter, this isn&apos;t it.  I would instead, compare this games feel to that of Resident Evil 1.  Survival horror, except in first person view...which is great!  This game isn&apos;t meant for plowing through enemies with amazing aim...and unlimited rounds.  It&apos;s hide and seek, as was the movie.
<br>
<br>This game gets bonus points for not being your typical first person shooter, and instead opting to try something new!  We need more games like this!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4644907">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I did however find the level design and encounter design to be very linear and repetitive. Animation quality isn&apos;t great. The small amounts of combat that are in the game feel very poorly put together. The save system can create huge frustrations with infrequent checkpoints placed behind quick time events and story components. This type of game is generally quite short and available for less than full retail, thus with this title coming in at full price it feels extortionately padded out to justify it&apos;s price. This in turn reduces the quality of the game considerably and is probably one of it&apos;s most noticeable lows with some sections dragging on into an hour or more of walking around. There really isn&apos;t any replay value here and the DLC is both short and overpriced.
<br>
<br>On the plus side it looks great, highly atmospheric and true to the genres well executed formula.
<br>
<br>If you don&apos;t already enjoy games like Outlast or Amnesia, you really won&apos;t enjoy this one. However if you do enjoy this type of game, Alien Isolation adds a few interesting chemicals into the mix and makes good use of the Alien License. Fortunately too it is a strong PC release with plenty of graphics options, very few bugs and performance is excellent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604490">Expand</a></span>

<br>Many of you are intrigued by the title, we all loved the movie, but gameplay is definitely love it or leave it. There is no in between, hence the negative reviews. Also you are pretty much forced into a &apos;no kill&apos; run, which probably isn&apos;t going over well with the twitchy trigger fingers.  Admittedly I would have preferred a no kill option I like to shoot stuff too, but I think developers were focused on suspense and it does work well. I&apos;m still going to dock it a point for the reason, and walking( not running) grates on you after a while.
<br>
<br>Overall, a stunning immersive experience. Graphics may look a little dated but it runs smooth, there is good detail, and very cool lighting effects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4916290">Expand</a></span>

In some areas, it can be so frustrating that it makes you want to eat your own keyboard, the game is a touch long, and the tension really needs to have a little more juxtaposition with relaxed, safe spots to explore.
<br>
<br>For the good: the game is scary as hell. Anyone who says it&apos;s easy, the alien is easily outsmarted, etc. is lying and just trying to be an obnoxious contrarian. Anyone who says the alien on two feet isn&apos;t immersive is also wrong. The alien is smart, it&apos;s omniscience as a constant threat from above or below even when it&apos;s not on the same floor creates a wonderful atmosphere, and it can be tricked into eating your fellow man when needed, or you can just sprint by the other suckers and the alien will just decide on the closer brains to munch. It walks with a sense of security. Sure, it makes sense for it to be sneaky when it wants to be, but that&apos;s precisely what it has, absolute control. It doesn&apos;t NEED to sneak around munching heads because it&apos;s an apex predator. It moves with purpose and is absolutely unnerving to watch thump along, not giving a damn about anything around it, held against slithering, meaningful motions when it&apos;s stalking someone. It&apos;s not full of jump scares and grotesquery like dead space (a game I do like), it&apos;s got this feeling of oppression weighing down on you, not knowing what action or sound is going to bring the xenomorph out.
<br>
<br>The crafting is worked well into the game, giving you multiple options without overloading you with a bunch of items. This works out into giving you a resource pool with multiple outlets and letting you choose what you want to do with it, instead of giving you items themselves, forcing you to follow a certain method. This builds on the almost roguelike-nature of the gameplay.
<br>
<br>There are only two bad points that REALLY slam the game down at times.
<br>
<br>Firstly, the alien&apos;s AI is off at times. If it does decide to show up, and you happen to be in one of the hallway-type areas, you&apos;re going to be in for an obnoxious time. The alien doesn&apos;t patrol hallways well enough, it always sticks within a certain distance of you and never seems to pop back up into the vents. This leads to scenarios where you&apos;re hiding in a cupboard with your motion tracker up, and as the alien walks away, as soon as you hear it disappearing, you pop out only to see it having turned around and looking right out at your big stupid face. The best way to deal with it in hallway scenarios is to just nail the bugger with a molotov and make him piss off back to the vents for a few seconds.
<br>
<br>Secondly, the save system is obnoxious as hell. It&apos;s a neat little idea, but the problem with no quicksaves is that it punishes exploration in areas where there aren&apos;t many save points. I had a recurring problem where I&apos;d run out into a big new area and 5-10 minutes of exploring, sneaking past the alien, distracting him into enemies and watching with glee as he chomped their brains out, only to just get killed before finding the save station and having to redo the whole thing over. So the best method for the game is to just sprint from save point until you find the next save point, tanking deaths, until you know where it is, and THEN do a sneaky stealth attempt where you try to be clever. it&apos;s inorganic and retarded. Quicksaving would really solve all of the problems with the alien&apos;s occasionally dodgy AI and arbitrary punishment of time.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d give the game an 8.5 (rounding up to 9.) the two flaws and lack of easing off the tension knob (the game really turns it up to 11, breaks off the knob and then sets it on fire. I don&apos;t count it as a negative because it&apos;s really just a personal thing) lead to me getting just exhausted while playing after a few hours, instead of hitting the sweet spot of keeping me in the zone nonstop. I had fun with it, it&apos;s VERY replayable, even if you know the plot, the game will never play the same way twice, and you&apos;ll get more than your money&apos;s worth if you&apos;re a fan of horror or alien. It&apos;s definitely the best sci-fi horror game out there (and system shock doesn&apos;t count because you can fight back) so definitely give it a look.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4663518">Expand</a></span>

AI also features fantastic gameplay which is as different as it gets with the emphasis on being hunted (by some terrifying AI) rather than being the hunter. Unlike some players I found the length ideal... top game of 2014 IMHO :)</span>

<br>The one thing I don&apos;t like are the fixed save points. I know it&apos;s to increase the immersion, but I hate losing progress.
<br>
<br>One tip: When you switch on the power, it opens doors for the alien to attack you. When you leave it off, the alien sneaks up behind you in the dark. Either way, you&apos;re screwed.

So many of the details from the Nostromo are present on Sevastopol station, like the dipping birds, the cassette-playing boom boxes, the style of the rooms and bulkheads, the 70s era low tech look and feel to everything. You even get to visit the iconic alien derelict ship in the game via a flashback. Cool! But the most important thing it captures is the feeling of dread, the anticipation of death around every corner. The alien is terrifying, but you are most afraid when you don&apos;t even see it, just hear it stalking the halls or scuttling around in the air ducts.
<br>
<br>Alien: Isolation features a simple but suspenseful story, fleshed out by logs, radio communications, and a few direct interactions with other survivors on the station. The length and pacing of the game is excellent, there is never a dull moment. The manual save system that I was worried about is actually implemented very well, and I like how they incorporated the save stations into the game world so organically.
<br>
<br>Visually, the environments are wonderfully detailed, believably authentic, and sometimes spectacular. I was disappointed in the character animations, however, which looked more like something from five years ago, and the dialogue was not always synced up well with the mouth movements. I hope CA focuses on this more if they do a sequel.
<br>
<br>My only real criticism of the gameplay is with the last thirty minutes or so. Without giving anything away, after a certain significant event happens to your character, the gameplay suddenly changes from a stealth/survival game to a consoley/XBox linear action game with cut scenes and a final scene that is a god-awful quick time event. For a game built on the dynamic of completing your objectives while using your wits and limited resources to avoid detection by the alien and other human and android enemies, to end with you mashing keys when prompted was a real letdown. This game would have earned a 10/10 if it had a worthy finish that had you utilize the skills that got you through the first 97 percent of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4818073">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m definitely getting my money&apos;s worth taking the game slow and putting myself in Ripley&apos;s shoes.
<br>
<br>My only criticism is that I was very misled by the difficulty descriptions. They pretty much state that hard mode is the way it was meant to be played. Really it just breaks the immersion due to how often you&apos;ll die over and over. It&apos;s almost as if the Alien has inserted a radio-beacon probe straight up Ripley&apos;s ass leading to sometimes just absurd instances of the Alien magically coming across the map to the most random locker in the most secure room you could find just to face rape you 10 times over unless you just say screw it and run for the exit.

This game follows Amanda Ripley on a quest to discover the fate of her mother, Ellen Ripley. The game takes a while to finally introduce the Alien, but when it shows up, you are in for a treat. The alien AI is absolutely amazing. You have NO idea where the alien will show up, and when, making you improvise and craft tools like noisemakers to distract the alien. The alien kills you immediately after it catches you, and the alien is faster than you, so one mess up and you are done for. The alien &quot;OP&quot; is what many people are whining about, how the game is too hard or unfair. BS. The game is designed to give you the feeling of dread, and if the game is too easy, it defeats the whole purpose. The graphics are top notch, everything made to exquisite detail. The only gripe I have is the characters we meet early, the girl we have to save. I could really care less, especially when a 8 foot murder machine wants my blood. Overall Alien Isolation is a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4610757">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;d recommend playing with some good headphones in a dark room.  I played this on a pc and it&apos;s nicely optimised. Story&apos;s pretty solid and kept me engaged. I had some odd glitches with the A.I which is why it got a 9 but only on odd occasions. Otherwise 10/10</span>

<br>
<br>In relation to the atmosphere, it&apos;s fantastic.  It builds up using great audio and lighting to present a real feeling of terror and tense.
<br>
<br>the fact that you&apos;re unable to kill the alien really enforces the play style.  The creature is agile and incredibly fast.  If you&apos;re seen, you know there&apos;s probably only a 1 in 10 chance you&apos;re going to survive.  Despite this, you always try!
<br>
<br>The only slight minor I would give the game is the Aliens navmesh... on a lot of occasions it felt like even though I hadn&apos;t been detected the Alien was simply &apos;hanging around&apos;.  However, this is a very minor concern.
<br>
<br>Overall, fantastic experience and at 20hours+ was a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4694214">Expand</a></span>

The game is moderately difficult in a unique way where it certainly requires more analysis and awareness in stealth methods of getting from point A to point B compared to the typical run and shoot method. There is a learning curve where growing some balls and moving onto the next objective is required. You may feel a bit tense or strung up during game play but that indicates a positive sign that you are entertained. Not playing at night times or giving yourself a few days to mentally stabilize yourself may occur.
<br>This game is long but not RPG long so its well with the $$$ and there is re-playability in terms of beating the game again just to see how better you do your second time around.
<br>
<br>Graphics are also great/optimized. Does not seem to be taxing on system hardware when it runs. Sound quality is great, music cues perfectly during game play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4783201">Expand</a></span>

Being relentlessly hunted by the alien in Sebastopol is really scary and takes its toll. Saving system is great. Sound effects and really good actor voices add to the atmosphere. So, I would say that the game mechanics is close to perfect. Now, the writers really did not do a good job of following through the narrative in the spirit of Alien. As mentioned by other reviewers a lot of the build up breaks down in the last few hours of the game, like the producers threw out the windows &quot;Alien&quot; and brought back the awful &quot;Aliens&quot; with multiple monster bashing and repetitive blue-collar work where the exhausted player has to turn on and off switches across the stations long after the climax of the game has been reached. Other than  that, the first 80% of the game are so great that its worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4850557">Expand</a></span>

Even though developers seemed to aim to provide the similar experience, two important differences stick out. First, you will achieve little or nothing at all in AI by deploying offensive playing only. In another words, you cannot shoot your way out of the problem in this game. And, second there is higher degree of exploration freedom offered to the player, extending their operational area beyond just linear corridor. I picked those two examples of old games because; my perception of AI was that it will be similar experience. As it turns out, AI offers more, although some of the additional game mechanics may not have been done well enough to be considered a value. Before listing the weak part of the game, I would say that game is very true to the original Alien movie, which I think is the other main goal developers try to achieve. First, the environment is incredibly well done and detailed. This makes it very immersive, and invites exploration. Second, the character animations are superb and on level one would expect for game in 2014. Game is something between sandbox and linear action. It is goal driven, which is consistently changing based on the story development, nevertheless, it is still possible to venture outside the forward path and trace back your steps, or just explore area you missed before. Here is where one of the negative aspects of the game comes out. As mentioned before, the environment is incredibly detailed and offers multiple level of exploration. The problem is alien. Yes, this game is about Aliens and their presence is absolutely required, but the issue is that at one point in the game, Alien is constantly above your head, frequently making trips down to the floor to seek and destroy. This means that player will spend a lot of time hiding in the closet. Literally! This off course turns the experience into cat and mouse game, which I think is overbearing and distracting of the wonderful other experiences player, could have had. Devs try to mitigate this by introducing even lower difficulty settings where Alien spends more time dwelling in the sealing, and less on the floor where it directly impacts the player, but the essence still remains the same. What devs could have done instead is create oasis of different experience, such as humanoid opponents without Aliens or different level of challenges. The problem is that the game is not bad by any means; the problem is that at some points, it is very easy to quit playing because the joy diminishes quicker then what new level or task can provide. In the worst case, I have heard and nearly experience myself rage quitting, just because try to replay 20minutes of game over and over, tends to get very annoying, especially since there are more fun alternatives. That being said, and without the obvious Alien &#x201C;stalker&#x201D; issue, this could have been game of the year candidate. I really like the lack of offensive ability at most points through the game as well as limited save ability, but as said, the experience of leaving the movie is overtaken by experience of hiding. From my standpoint: Graphics =9 (with sweetfx with very little effort), Map and levels = 9, Game play = 7, Animations and movies = 9, Reparability = 6.

Let me start a review on the gameplay.
<br>
<br>The mechanics are very simple yet sometimes, it&apos;s kinda hard but not that hard. The crafting is useful for &apos;heavy situation&apos; and the movement of the character is smooth.
<br>
<br>The story is beautiful also, it gives a nostalgic effect when you watched it&apos;s film, the tense, the character, the survival, everything about it. No wonder I got few nightmares when I encounter &apos;black&apos; creatures like insect or animals. However, the story is so long that you&apos;ve wasted enough hours to play but if you&apos;re a big fan of Alien, you can finish this game in no time.
<br>
<br>The graphic is amazing, the aliens, the character, the androids, everything about it. Last..
<br>
<br>The creatures... Gosh, the creatures are magnificent, I remember one time when I was kid, I had a huge nightmare about this monster when I grew big and played this game, the nightmare, came back to my life again. Once you encountered this creature, I&apos;m sure you&apos;re gonna stay in the lockers, vents, or anything that the creature won&apos;t find you and pray that the monster won&apos;t eat you, seriously..
<br>
<br>This game.... Is truly amazing. I can&apos;t find the perfect word for it but I&apos;m sure, you&apos;ll enjoy this game but be warned... Don&apos;t play this at night, that&apos;s all :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5239970">Expand</a></span>

And for that I am unabashed to offer a full score as the game delivers what it set out to achieve. What more is desired? Nothing at all.
<br>
<br>Alien Isolation is a game of cat and mouse, and for all the hoopla and petty click-baiting (and the subsequent long whining sessions stretched across a couple of Ryan&#x2019;s embarrassing circle-jerking videos) generated by the incredibly mentally channeled reviewers of IGN and Gamespot (and even Polygon) or that god awfully imbecilic Quarter to Three reviewer, it is a game that plays completely fair; it just punishes you for all the right reasons.
<br>
<br>Shocking isn&#x2019;t it? But had dear ol&#x2019; Ryan and Co McGees decided to actually read the instructions the game hands out like candy all the time, and maybe (just maybe) light the dimply lit corners of their heads to actually see the clear cut instructions at the bottom of your constructed gadgets, we wouldn&#x2019;t be in this mess. Or perhaps, look a little carefully around as the items are plentiful, even in Nightmare mode.
<br>
<br>Yes, AI plays completely fair and without giving much (as I want the review to be as spoiler free as possible), I would offer a few lines on this. The game is incredibly tense and at times very unnerving. You are literally the mouse in this game who is up against a cat armed down to its last &#x2026; err &#x2026; spiked tail?
<br>
<br>Well, the analogy is as fitting as it can be as the Alien is a deadly killing machine with incredibly honed senses. You would come to know a deadly adversary in the Medical Bay, as when the leash is off the Alien, it&#x2019;s just you and it one on one. And all you can do is survive. Yes, people, THIS is the point of the entire game; Survival.
<br>
<br>You are literally stripped down to human level and I love the tiny details, as for example when you are putting bullets into the empty barrels of the revolver, Amanda&#x2019;s hand would shake sometimes and she would do it slowly. Why? It makes sense. She is an engineer not a preposterous Space Marine but an ordinary young woman thrown into an impossible situation for which strategy and quick-wits are your sole modes of survival.
<br>
<br>True to its word, the game tosses confrontations (for the most part) out of the window as it&#x2019;s a hardcore Stealth game dealing with nothing but survival first and everything else later. You are facing a gargantuan threat, an unstoppable force and an apex predator. How do you think it should behave? It should behave unpredictably.
<br>
<br>Yes, the Alien is a tough, unpredictable foe. It doesn&#x2019;t care about your frustrations (I never had them), but only how it shouldn&#x2019;t see and outwit you. I cannot imagine the infamous Medical Bay sequence going any other way imaginable as its second (or 3rd entry if you count the Axel cutscene) entry here is nothing short of spectacular.
<br>
<br>Provided that the player takes notes of the impossible number of easy hints the game keeps throwing at you, I cannot imagine anyone dying in that heart-pumping adrenaline inducing sequence more than 2 or 3 times and that too on Hard Mode.
<br>
<br>Your quick wits is all that is needed. And isn&#x2019;t this the entire point of the game; outsmarting a deadly threat? It just is and its simplicity is even further reinforced by the persistence of the threat.
<br>
<br>To be honest, if you love games that demand the attention span of a guppy and draw despicably unintelligent (shoot stuff, save every nanosecond, tell you where to go because, apparently, you cannot read a map a child can) crowd, then AI would prove to be something out of Milton&#x2019;s parables for you as the manual Save Points and lack of pointless arrows pointing at directions (bar the obvious Motion Sensor aid) would frustrate anyone with a subpar attention span.
<br>
<br>This game is a challenge and it proves so by putting you in very different situations to judge your capabilities as a player. You think the Alien is in vents? Try to sneak past humans or Synthetics. How fast are you in these situations to come up with an exit plan? Should I make a noise with firearms or a noise maker and risk drawing its attention or is stealth my option &#x2026; or is drawing the Alien to hit it with a Molotov more up my alley?
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s this mixing up of situations and multiple climaxes that hit the nail on Survival and the never-ending tension. You are made to feel vulnerable &#x2026; and boy is the game apt at this play at mortal fear.
<br>
<br>The pacing is incredible, and yes, people a story can have multiple climaxes. Ryan and Co never read anything beyond menu screens for good literature to fall back on as that criticism was probably one of the most idiotic things on the internet; nothing but incredibly ignorant individuals trying their hand at literary devices. I felt nothing but second-hand embarrassment.
<br>
<br>A tense Survival game; it would be a crime as a gamer to pass it up as it&apos;s a surreal experience par excellence of a lifetime!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=6028753">Expand</a></span>

<br>From the outset it&apos;s obvious that the production standards are set at a lofty height. The art (both visual and audio), is fantastic, and are intimately faithful to the original Alien film. The atmosphere is crafted to perfection - no cheap jumpscares here. The constant threat of the Xeno produces a level of fear and tension I&apos;ve never experienced in a game before.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re part of the ADD twitchy FPS generation, this game is not for you. Prepare to spend a lot of time crouch walking, scavenging for supplies, and hiding in lockers (!!). The story is not deeply engrossing, but the hark back to the Alien universe of old makes for a memorable experience. In an age where the multiplayer component of a game is often the core focus, Alien Isolation really nails the campaign.
<br>
<br>From a mechanical standpoint, this game is well-built. I am playing at 2560x1080 with all settings maxed on a pretty old rig (Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM, but with a newer Radeon R9 380 4GB). I get a near constant 60fps, which is stellar. I would say that the AA algorithms are not great, as there are still visible jaggies with settings maxed. I also encountered a few &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;ling bugs, but these were usually solved by reloading or restarting the game.
<br>
<br>After the disappointment of Aliens: Colonial Marines, and AVP (2010), this game was barely on my radar. To say that I am pleasantly surprised by it would be the understatement of the century. I think Alien Isolation has earned a spot on my list of all-time favourite games. I highly recommend that you play this game...

This game came out and it gave me hope again. The game is awesome during the first half. Making you feel like you are in the ridley scott universe all over again but you get to be the one chased by the alien this time. Spoiler alert: the end of the first half you killed the alien but yet you still have more to do. At this point in the game you feel relaxed, like you can finally stop collecting the ammo you got and finally let yourself go. Big F**king mistake I&apos;ll tell you. Because after your character get the idea to blow the station up you find out that the title lied to you. This isn&apos;t &quot;Alien: Isolation&quot; This is &quot;Aliens:isolation&quot; Now don&apos;t get me wrong I had no problem at first having to evade one unkillable alien at first. But when their are 5 aliens stalking you going the same path and you can&apos;t even get your objective and die over and over again. Please let us have a way to kill the 10 aliens chasing after you. By this time when you have to go up against more than one alien, it starts feeling less as horror and more of a chore. As you die over and over again. You get the shotgun after dealing with the first alien. I get the other weapons not doing much to the xenomorph. But a flamethrower and shotgun do absolutely nothing to them even when there are 5 of them. All they do is force one to run away while the other 4 murder your face. And those facehuggers are the only you can kill but when you do kill them guess what you attracted the other aliens. Get really annoying in the second half. 10/10 for the first half and 4/10 for the second half</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=6032137">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Excellent game...even 18 months after release.  It&apos;s worth picking up in a bundle with all the DLC.  There is a bit of inconsitency in the cutscenes, but they add to the growing intensity of the game wonderfully.  My only issue with the game is that it does end with a few loose ends.  With a sequel still not certain (but not ruled out), here&apos;s hoping they find a way to tie up the loose ends.</span>

<br>
<br>Despite the game&apos;s beauty, there&apos;s a lot of things that really drag it down. The worst of it is the repetitive tasks. &quot;Alright run across the map and hit this switch and come all the way back to run this generator ok ok now run across the map two more times because the lights suddenly went out and you need to find a hidden keycard to-&quot; Yeah, painful.
<br>
<br>Another downside is the layout of some of the maps. You can find yourself running into tons of locked doors and going in circles just finding that 100th generator you need to turn on. Though this is redeemed by the atmospheric design of everything, so at least you&apos;re running around pretty well-lit maps and crawling through convenient rewarding vents anyway.
<br>
<br>Despite the fact that I didn&apos;t enjoy the game as much as everyone else, I would STILL recommend it to ever other gamer out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4589901">Expand</a></span>

Everything about the game practically screams dedication and love towards the original movie. All props, environments and actors feel like straight from the original set and is a delight to look upon for a hardened Alien-fan like me. The game looks graphically good and performs well.
<br>
<br>Ambience in the game is excellent, with various machines whirring and clicking about, dark corridors with flicking lights and rooms that always feel slightly too small. The space station is claustrophobic and  well executed.
<br>
<br>But that&apos;s about as far as the good things go. For the developers have forgotten one very basic thing: unknown scares you. And trust me when I say, the Alien will not be unknown to you. Not in the slightest. Always crawling around the vents, guided by an erratic &quot;hunter a.i.&quot; the alien will kill you. Several times.
<br>
<br>Practically, after the two first encounters with the alien, I grew so jaded towards it, that I no longer felt even a tinge of fear when it was prowling around. Especially as the game progresses and you will learn to know how the alien acts, you will most likely start to get annoyed by it.
<br>
<br>And that is the greatest downfall of this game. The Alien, one of the greatest movie monsters around, has been reduced to an annoyance. A nuisance. After clocking several hours in to the game I am having serious doubts about whether or not I should bother to continue. In fact, I was forced to lower the difficulty from the hardest setting, because of the sheer tediousness of having to dodge the alien. This decision had nothing to do with the game being too difficult, and everything to do with the fact that the alien encounters are so tedious they were boring me to death. There is no tension, no horror, no thrill. It&apos;s simply business.
<br>
<br>All in all, Alien: Isolation turns into a boring game of hide and seek, where if you fail, you are given few seconds (if that) to use up resources to scare off the aggressor, or you die and load the latest save.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a decent game with good graphics and awesome atmosphere, but it gets absolutely murdered by the developer&apos;s idea, that having to constantly dodge something is scary.
<br>
<br>I can not with good conscience recommend this game, unless you&apos;re buying it somewhere cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4588290">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_4588796"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The atmosphere at the beginning of the game is really quite something and when the alien first shows up it&apos;s pretty terrifying. You probably will try to hide a lot, crouch and go very slowly the first few times you strive to circumvent the beast and provided that you play this game on hard difficulty setting (as you should), you will die rapidly and frequently. This is due to the omniscient AI, which somehow always knows where you are (even if you clearly tricked the alien into going in a totally different direction) and is glued to the player, while mostly ignoring other survivors and completely ignoring Androids. It goes from terrifying to frustrating all too quickly here.
<br>After a while I figured out that not going slowly, breaking the line of sight and only hiding as a last resort is much easier, which is counterintuitive and not really what a stealth game should be about. The game still manages to built atmosphere and tension though.
<br>At the midpoint of the game you&apos;ll be introduced to the flamethrower. As soon as you acquire this gadget, the Alien is not a threat anymore. You just hit it with a burst and it flees. Now the alien is no more than a chore to be dealt with. It will pop up every once in a while, sometimes as soon as 15 seconds after you last repelled it. This can get quite tedious. You will still die to some of those unfair alien appearances though.
<br>I&apos;ve read some reviews where people claim the flamethrower fuel is scarce. Not true in the slightest; it only takes one gush of flame to repel the alien, which consumes about 6 or 7 points of ammo. I stopped hiding as soon as I got the flamethrower and never had less than 400 fuel for the rest of the game ...why they would add a weapon this gamebreaking I do not know.
<br>After you deal with the alien for the first time, the game evolves into a mediocre shooter during the midgame. A barrage of angry androids are thrown at you to disassemble, which is very easy to do, because they don&apos;t have any weapons and can&apos;t shoot back. 2 shotgun rounds to the face, 6 pistol shots, 1 stun baton hit followed by 7 melee attacks, EMP&apos;s, Molotovs, Pipebombs, and the OP bolt gun, all of these deal with them very quickly and with close to no risk. Even human enemies are more dangerous, they at least shoot back. I found this part of the game to be overly easy; on hard difficulty.
<br>
<br>After experiencing all these flaws, I still found Alien Isolation to be a good game. The graphics are good, but nothing special, the sound is amazing and so is the voice acting. The story is a bit lacking, but it stays close to its role model and I especially enjoyed the flashback to the movie plot. The level design is also quite good, there is a lot of backtracking, but I didn&apos;t mind it that much (it would be a little odd to be wandering around a confined space station for 15+ hours and never see the same place twice).
<br>
<br>All in all it&apos;s a game worth picking up. It&apos;s certainly not a perfect game and whoever rates it at 10 really needs to come down from that acid trip.
<br>
<br>Ps: what&apos;s up with all those devices to open certain doors, it felt like playing Legend of Zelda from time to time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4588796">Expand</a></span>

It seems from what I have been reading that without any means of protection one is supposed to try and out wit this scaly long in the tooth down in the mouth off worlder  and in the end do what, perhaps shove it out the back door and hope it gets caught in one of the boosters? Collecting bits and pieces and knitting them together to form some sort of defensive weapon whilst trying to stop your butt getting a going over from your only passenger and ending up as a giant easter egg somehow has no appeal. At the end of the day I suspect this game will get a vote of  not that exciting. Oh I have gone through the opening sequence of the game and I suppose now that I am searching for my alien spotting thingy I shall be safe to head out and hunt or be hunted!?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4580399">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s not perfect but damn close. Yes there&apos;s some repetition, but they could have easily avoided that by making it same length as other games. So, in fact there is no repetition, in comparison with normal (shorter) games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4608795">Expand</a></span>

<br>The alien is well crafted, from initial encounter it is easy to see how well detailed it is. The music is well done, the architecture of the craft is bang on, including all the added extras like the really old on board computers to the old cassette/radio players.
<br>I think anyone who really gets the Alien series will love this game. It&apos;s got the right look to it, the right feel to it, basically, it&apos;s definitely the bees knees for this kind of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4631345">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sound: Good stuff. Good use of positional audio and great dynamic music that also warns you of danger. Voice acting is really good.
<br>
<br>Fear factor: Some people think that the alien takes too long to appear. I disagree. Buildup is really important in proper horror games. I found the introduction well done and effective. Up until the mid game, everything is well designed and tense. Then it goes downhill for a few hours, but picks up again towards the end. The game could have been slightly trimmed down and lost nothing, in fact it would feel more tightly paced.
<br>
<br>Optimization/bugs: People are praising this game for its polish. Maybe they played a different game than me, or are judging it by usual CA standards of releasing a mangled carcass of a game and fixing it in a year or two. Yeah, for CA standards it&apos;s good, but it&apos;s nowhere near polished. In several occasions, events failed to trigger for me, which left me stuck, wandering around, trying to find out what I missed. Turns out I missed nothing and I had to reload the last save, go through another 30 minutes of sneaking and then pray the events would trigger properly this time. NPC&apos;s would not open elevators, the med lab white board would not update my objectives, and other things. As for optimization, the game runs well but it was EXTREMELY crash happy on my system. After several hours of experimentation, I eliminated the crashes by lowering my screen&apos;s refresh rate from 144hz to 60 hz, and playing the game in Windowed Fullscreen mode with Vsync on. If I tried increasing my refresh rate again, the game would promptly send me to desktop. Not acceptable. It&apos;s not 2007, people use varying refresh rates. Do some basic stability/compatibility testing, not go &quot;it works on 60hz, it&apos;s a wrap&quot;. Ridiculous that I pay full price for a game and then have to test it for 3 hours to find a setup that stops it from crashing.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, it&apos;s worth playing, but I suggest you wait. It&apos;s shaky and needs several patches, you may have problems that will test your patience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4585674">Expand</a></span>

Love Aliens and all the lore that goes with it and hated the disrespect the Xenomorphs were  given in video games that basically made them fast zombies.  However, this game goes too far the other way by making the Xenomorph a loud, stomping, unstoppable killing machine that never goes farther then 10 meters away from you.  However, the game also makes the Xenomorph a blind idiot that will follow you into a room with no exits  but not bother to check each locker or even under each table.  As a result you will spend a  majority of the game crawling around from one table or locker to another while the Alien stomps around and makes loud noises. You know, like it NEVER did in any of the movies. The Xenomorph also  does a great job of taking away any joy you may receive from exploring this awesome spaceship and all the lore it is packed with.  For example you will find several computer terminals with email and audio files that provide background information on how the space-station went to hell  and how  the Xenomorph got there.  However, the game doesn&apos;t pause when you access a terminal so you have to speed read every thing and then hide in a locker to listen to the audio file.  What makes matters worse and why I am writing this negative review is the save system.  The games uses a checkpoint system which may result in you having to replay segments of the game for 20-30 mins (depending on how long you have to hide in a locker).  I am  willing to die in order to explore the space station but not if it results in having waste 30 mins of my life replaying the mission.  Every time I had to walk  by a computer or a room for the sake of finishing the mission or finding a save point it made me sick.  This game has a great story and environment too bad you can&apos;t enjoy it because you are either crawling around the floor or hiding in a locker.  The best way to enjoy this game is by watching someone else play it on Youtube.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5211464">Expand</a></span>

<br>Nope here you will just be crouching your way through the path that the designers decided it was the only path meant to be. It is sometimes even more obvious when your way is blocked down by a 15cm height object and that stupid amanda cannot jump over...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=5382608">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game offers fantastic environments, I mean talk about experiencing the movie franchise we have enjoyed for so many years in a whole new, immersive way.  It&#x2019;s the polished, well executed graphics and character movements that really bring this game to life.  One can tell that a lot of effort was put into cooking this visually stunning smorgasbord to the player.
<br>But does it really matter how much energy was exerted in bringing a visually engaging game to the player if the players avatar lacks some basic human capabilities.  If I cannot scale a couch in order to traverse from one part of the room to another than this entire beautiful virtual reality becomes a real life frustration.  Ok, so I can&apos;t jump... but what about all of those useless little items that are scattered throughout.  That box on the floor, the cute little monkey wrench, the coffee cup on the counter, why can I not lift these things?  Why is the cup on the counter if I cannot throw it onto the floor?  What is the purpose of these freely moving items that seem to all have physics when I run into them, but I cannot be interacted with using my hands.
<br>OK, so I can&apos;t pick up useless junk... how about emptying my hands.  I have been holding this med-pack for an hour, why can&apos;t I place it back into my pocket?  Let me &apos;holster&apos; stuff.
<br>Look, the game is gorgeous, no doubt about that, the game-play even feels good, but immersion suffers from some goofy things your character just can&apos;t do.
<br>Sorry guys but you have to be able to jump.  If you design a level and then figure out that jumping from point A to point B circumvents some gameplay triggers then you should redesign the level or put up some invisible walls... idk if less of two evils is removing ability to jump... arg why does not jumping bother me so much?  I&apos;m not a very active person in rl so... well the character is a young woman, she looks fit.  I just think she should be able to lift things like coffee mugs, or scale over a couch.  What&apos;s the point of these amazing environments and graphics if the basic human movement is unrealistic?
<br>So 7 it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4576075">Expand</a></span>

Even players who don&apos;t usually like horror games will feel compelled to go on and explore the picture-perfect recreation of the dark, low-high-tech sci-fi vision of the 1979&apos;s movie, filled with CRT screens, mechanical computers and steam vents.
<br>
<br>This is not a shooter, so be prepared to hide, crouch through vents, and peer in horror at your motion detector as the beeping green blip comes closer and closer to you while you try to hold your breath and not make a noise.
<br>
<br>The game is difficult, occasionally unfair, and has a checkpoint save system that reminds me of Dark Souls&apos; bonfires. It all works great to build an incredible level of tension and fear, but it will also be frustrating to players who don&apos;t want to try something different to modern straightforward shooters with quicksave systems.
<br>
<br>Technically, the game is a wonder. Graphics are the best I&apos;ve ever seen, and they feel very well optimized for PC. Sound is even better. Every mechanical noise will bring you back to the original movie, and the music feels dynamic and oppressive, including some cues from the original movie soundtrack. The surround audio is also brilliant, and it&apos;s just as useful as your motion detector when trying to guess where the creature is.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t recommend this game highly enough for fans of the first Alien movie, OR fans of horror games. For everyone else, it will probably not be their cup of tea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4582773">Expand</a></span>

This game is what alien fans was waiting for years. Excellent graphic, excellent atmosphere and sorround sound. EXCELLENT performance in mid-range pc! and.. oh yes! finally, DIFFICULT AS HELL! no more regen-life, no more auto-checkpoints, the old school gaming is finally here. The Alien, humans and androids, all of them are hard to avoid or to fight. Every encounter is a challenge, and meet with the alien face to face, a death sentence. Aliens IA is increible, searching for humans ( not only for you) every time, it could be in the celling, on the flor, in the air ducts.. everywhere... and the game is LOOONG and with a great story. The producers has captured perfectly the 80&apos;s future view of the Alien universe. This game is game of the year without a doubt!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4587506">Expand</a></span>

<br>Visuals
<br>----------
<br>The game captures the old analog feel of the universe perfectly. Everything seems futuristic but at the same time feels old and clunky. That mix of old and new is hard to capture and Creative Assembly did this with flying colors. The alien itself is also brought to life with beautiful animations and looks exactly how I remember from the old film. Unfortunately, characters and their mouths in some cutscenes can be a little lacking. However, never to the point you are taken out of the universe. Cutscenes and character models still look great. Just nothing to marvel over. I also noticed how in game characters lips wouldn&apos;t match what they were saying all the time. Forgivable with everything else the game nails. Visuals- 9/10
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>--------------
<br>Finally an alien game that doesn&apos;t have you blasting away every alien in sight. The game is a first person  survival horror that focuses on stealth. In fact it is a MUST! The alien is STRONG and will kill you on sight. I have seen some complaints about the alien being OP but honestly......it would kill you as fast as it does. The instant death adds CRAZY tension as you desperately hide under desks and in lockers. The game is long and needs to be taken slow, which will not appeal to all. If you try and sprint at the wrong time the alien will hear you and it won&apos;t take long till its all over. Also, there have been comments about it getting repetitive, which I believe is false. The game never lets up the tension and you believe everything that is going wrong and why you would need to head back to an area. Which, never happens that often. You may go back to 1 or 2 areas but they will be VERY different because the alien and station have changed since your last time being there. Which all adds to the believability of the game. Amanda is given a wide range of weapons but, unfortunately I found myself hugging the flamethrower all the time when I got it. All the other guns and weapons look and function perfectly. But the flame thrower is such a safe haven from the alien its hard to get away from. There are a few hacking mini games that add CRAZY tension. They do not pause the game and for all you know the alien could be right behind you as you start, making every encounter with a hackable door tense, and awesome. Amanda moves well and is easy to control. I never ran into a SINGLE bug or glitch in over 16+ hours. The gameplay is great, but I felt that the flamethrower (still a great aspect) made me feel too safe at moments. When you get the chance to use the other weapons on people and androids, like the pistol, it feels fresh and fun. But be warned, the alien can hear every shot! Gameplay- 9/10
<br>
<br>Sound and Voice
<br>----------------------
<br>The game sounds beautiful. Clunky sounds that fit beautifully with the universe. As you walk down the corridors you will hear your every step echo through the halls, worrying you if someone is listening. The clunky analog computers sound exactly like how you would imagine. Kezia Burrows voice acts Amanda Ripley and does a phenomenal job. Every time something goes wrong you BELIEVE she is distressed at the situation. You believe Amanda is scared out of her mind at moments because of the great line deliveries Kezia Burrows gives. a specific moment is when Amanda is dodging train cars......I felt like an actual persons life was in my hands. All other characters are acted very well as well minus one character named Marlow who was mostly forgettable. Also, the music is perfect, fitting in the world perfectly. And hearing the old classic theme is an amazing throw back. Tense music during Alien/Human/Android attacks are great. Sound and voice- 8/10
<br>
<br>Story
<br>-------
<br>Story starts of a little quick, which seems to just THROW Amanda into the current situation. Once you arrive on the Station, that is where the story begins to shine. Figuring out ways to survive and find your crew, while simultaneously trying to search of answer about Ellen (Amanda&apos;s mother) is fun. However, the game seems to throw away the whole Ellen aspect of the story early with one quick moment with the flight recorder which I won&apos;t spoil. Then it is brought back up for a quick instant at the end. Still fun when its happening though. The true fun is in the story of survival which is captured beautifully by everything above. No details about that, in order to avoid spoilers. Just know its a fun ride. Story- 8/10
<br>
<br>All aspects of this game are strong. Other than some wonky lip syncing in game, feeling to attached to the flamethrower, and the Ellen story seeming tossed, this game nails everything. From the amazing visuals, to the fun gameplay, great Voice acting and sound design, and Amanda&apos;s great story of survival on the sevastopol make for a game that will appeal to all gamers. Not just fans of the universe. Alien Isolation is a ride worth taking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4603680">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s visually stunning, engrossing with atmosphere, and for a good bit of it absolutely terrifying. However, my main beef with the game isn&apos;t as some major outlets have said it&apos;s length, which is perfect. Any game should be this long, and it&apos;s a shame that anything can be considered &quot;too long.&quot; My main beef has to do with the acquisition of a certain weapon, that may count as a small spoiler, be warned, but shouldn&apos;t to any seasoned fan of the franchise. That weapon is the flame thrower. The flame thrower thoroughly ruined this game. It turned the menace of the Alien into an annoyance. Instead of something that made me crawl everywhere from fright, the Alien became something that I was forced to repetitively deal with every time I heard him stomping around. Instead of being something I ran from it was something I went toward in order to flame him back into his hole, but this happened all to often. I found that after setting fire to the beast he would reappear not 30 seconds later in some cases, and force me to deal with him again so that I make any progress on the objective. It went from frightening, and fun to annoying and tedious all with the addition of one item to my inventory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4577813">Expand</a></span>

The graphics look superb and you can tell the developers really optimized the software for the PC platform. This is what it is about for PC gamers, right here.
<br>
<br>With that being said, when you first start Alien: Isolation, you&apos;ll enjoy it and be genuinely interested in the environment and feel a need to explore. Unfortunately this will fade away quite quickly and give way to repetition. The game is largely a stealth based game, it fools you into believing there&apos;s some form of combat survival by supplying a paltry amount of weapons, but don&apos;t be fooled, combat is never a good option in this game.
<br>
<br>The game gets stale quickly as you sneak through halls, avoid androids and hope to god you don&apos;t fall victim to another alien.  And while I think that is measured doses, this would have been great, I think largely ignoring the action element from the &apos;Alien&apos; series was a big mistake. Alien was a Sci-Fi horror movie, but it also had strong bits of action as Ripley fought back for her life.
<br>
<br>This is a good game for short bursts of game-play, but as soon as you feel frustrated, walk away, take a break and come back later. It could have been better, but it could have been worse. A average survival horror game at best, which is sometimes the best we can hope for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4580613">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay wise, the game takes a while to gain moment and complexity, but once it reaches that point the possibilities for completing a mission are endless. This is thanks to the crafting system and the excellent &quot;peep&quot; mechanics. The enemies are challenging, and each in their won ways. I found myself being relieved at each interval when I would switch from Joe&apos;s to the Xeno or even humans. It keeps it fresh. What holds it back is the glitches that are a little to frequent to ignore. People talk without moving their lips, whole death sequences falter leaving a character alive who is scripted as being dead. These things aside, the best story telling didn&apos;t happen in the cutscenes (although those are a delight), they happened in the voice acting from Amanda herself. Truly the best I&apos;ve heard in a game. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4574312">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Lightning and sound:
<br>
<br>Lighting in some areas are just perfect and for me it feels like I am some times standing in the corridors from Alien 1 and 2 and I have rely some times just stood in a corridor watching the lightning and being amazed because some times this game is just mindblowing beautiful.
<br>
<br>The sound is up there with the best tension games right now. It makes everything so scary.
<br>Me for once sat in an Airduct for like 5 minutes before daring to go out because just the sound of the area made it so intense.
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>
<br>The graphics overall you can some times wish a little more off but overall the graphics are rely good and really lifts the feeling of behind stuck on a huge Space station/ship with a huge alien monster hunting you around.
<br>
<br>Ai:
<br>
<br>The &quot;humans/Androids&quot; Ai is some what &quot;meh&quot; and its understanding because the AI TRULY shines when you meet the ALIEN. I have many times actually wondered if the Alien is playing with me.
<br>
<br>Yes you heard it right, A computer game where I wonder if the AI is so smart so it play with me.
<br>For an instance: I sit in a room pitch black with the alien on the other side of the door looking for me.
<br>I sit in that room for maybe 5 min (irl) just waiting and listening.
<br>
<br>After 5 min is gone I move and come out in the corridor, I move like 10 feet and I get attacked from the alien HIDING IN AN AIRDUCT ! Just so he can jump out in my way and finish me of with a claw to the face.
<br>
<br>With that said you will MANY TIMES in this game have some REALLY Cat and mouse hunts in this game.
<br>You running through a corridor just to turn around to see you are not followed, Just to turn around again and realizing that the alien took a shorter route through the air duct and now stand behind you.
<br>
<br>If I HAVE to say bad things about the game I rely have to force my self to find some.
<br>But IF I now have to then it would be that there is a little to much humans with guns in this game and that it would have been better if they would have taken some of them away at least, together with some weapons.
<br>
<br>Other then that this game is a masterpiece and can&apos;t wait for a sequel in Alien 2 setting or even a new movie following this game.
<br>
<br>10/10 hands down !! Every one should get this !!
<br>And if you planning on getting an oculus rift, GET THIS NOW !!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4571735">Expand</a></span>

<br>Even without the Aliens unscripted AI this game would be brilliant with its well realised world that basically sits you in Ridley&apos;s idea for this universe buts its the Alien that sets this game apart from games like Outlast or Amnesia.
<br>
<br>The issue most horror games have is predictable AI with set paths, while its still scary you can easily learn the enemies path and get into this repetition of waiting around a corner and then moving out when they&apos;ve gone past, now while this does happen from time to time in Isolation with the other enemies (Androids and Humans), when you&apos;re dealing with the Alien there is no scripted path.
<br>The fact that the Alien doesn&apos;t follow a path makes it so refreshing because theres no studying its path and then exploiting it, theres just you having to make quick decisions and using your available gadgets to improvise on the fly.
<br>This is also another area games like Outlast and Amnesia have a problem with, giving you no way to defend yourself. Now while that may seem to be a good thing and be more scary, allowing you to have a fighting chance prevents the game from becoming boring and monotonous.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve been waiting for a proper Alien game this is as close as you&apos;re gonna get, great campaign length (took me 21 hours on Hard) and wonderful atmosphere make for one of the best survival horror games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4579304">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There was one point in the game where I was so terrified I sat there in the cold corner of a ventilation griping my gun with fear... the horror in this is very intense. It also has a lot of action elements to the game which add to the enjoyment.
<br>
<br>The story also fits between the 2 first movies Alien and Aliens (which makes it a good idea to watch the movies before hand to get a good idea of what is going on. Just to make the experience even better)
<br>
<br>My personal opinion is there has been a lot of thought and effort put into this game so i&apos;m going to give it 10/10 Beautiful Game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4596361">Expand</a></span>

I had decided to go the pre-order route despite the let down of Aliens: Colonial Marines. As a massive fan of the 1979 movie I had to get this game, the idea of a survival horror instantly got my unwavering attention and having played some 30 hours so far am delighted with the end product. The game is very tense, creates a shedload of atmosphere and in visually stunning as well as keeping true to the Ridley Scott feel of the sets and tech. The game has some very minor flaws but nothing that won&apos;t get ironed out when some patches roll out, other than that this will be my game of the year. The game was exactly what I had expected from all the trailers and interviews regarding it, focusing mainly on stealth and survival, this isn&apos;t a game for people who want a run and gun experience and it&apos;s very important to emphasize that fact as people still seem to be buying games without having done any research beforehand and then complaining that it wasn&apos;t what they thought it was, hence the reason for some low scores on here. I love this game, and hats off to Creative Assembly for delivering a fantastic game that finally does my favorite movie of all time some justice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4589787">Expand</a></span>

The game looked and felt amazing and the story was great and the enemy AI was amazingly unpredictable. Now it was far from perfect as it did have its share of bugs( alien sometimes magically knowing where i am, things going through walls) and in my opinion a lack of real jumpscares, this is easily one of the most stressful (in a good way) games ive ever played and the length makes it more than worth the price and i found it dosent even get repetitive thanks to the great twists of the story, the and the enemy AI. The ending was also fantastic. Don&apos;t know why this game has gotten so many mixed reviews, its simply amazing.

<br>
<br>There are some minor issues (occasional AI bugs, some technical bugs, characters that, despite interesting motivation, are rather flat), but they&apos;re overshadowed by Isolation being probably the most terrifying game in years, if not ever (I say this as a fan of the genre).
<br>
<br>Lastly, series&apos; fans will appreciate the amount of homage this game offers towards the original Alien. Still, this it&apos;s beyond being pure fanservice. Taking cues from the likes of Bioshock, Amnesia or OutlastIt&apos;s and solidifying them into a coherent whole, it&apos;s a new quality of video game horror.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4598240">Expand</a></span>

<br>First up I REALLY f***ing hate the sh**ting creature with a vengeance. Not because its gonna kill me, I got to accept that after the 100th time, but more like an annoying unwanted wasp at a picnic that no matter where you go or do its ALWAYS there. Also , why is it that after every objective, it seems it all goes **** up and Ripley has to back track, I mean come on for eff&apos;s sake.
<br>There is not a lot new about yet another AAA title. We have a mixture of all those elements in Deux Ex, Bioshock, Batman Arkham asylum that kinda make a lot of these (great) titles morph into one; and as I played Alien: Isolation my scoring fluctuated wildly from 3/10 &quot;I&apos;m gonna delete this goddam game&quot; through 5/10 &quot;Meh its OK&quot; all the way to 9/10 &quot;AWESOME SAUCE&quot; . In the final analysis my 8/10 seems just about right.
<br>If you cant stand prolonged tension with little release then don&apos;t bother with this. This ain&apos;t no gung-ho guns blazing of Aliens fame, but a ratcheting of the claustrophobia and terror of the first and the best movie. Survival is the name of the game here, and I love this game for doing that slow burning intensity so well. Sure you get to craft a few explosives and pick up some weapons but this is a lot to do with distracting and misdirecting rather than toe to toe combat ( A bolt fired from the gun through the head of the creepy Working Joe AI&apos;s however, is some small sweet compensation)
<br>Certainly Alien Isolation is not a masterpiece, but in my opinion it is a flawed classic that is definitely worthy of a playthrough</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612552">Expand</a></span>

Creative Assembly could&apos;ve released anything, but as long as it functioned (to some extent and didn&apos;t deeply anger players) it was already miles ahead of the infamous &quot;Colonial Marines&quot; fiasco.  This is troubling since for one, not one person that claims to adore the game, seems to want to mention how terribly paced it is, or how the dialogue is awkwardly written or how the cinematic sequences are deeply underwhelming.  Even worse than that, they fail to mention how unbelievably silly of a notion it was to place Ellen Ripley&apos;s daughter in as the main character and give her an equally silly motivation such as: &quot;My Mother has been missing for 15 years, guess its time to fly out on the same looking ship, meet a bunch of generic characters in space on another ship and ultimately get nowhere in the search for my own Mother.&quot;
<br>
<br>This is that entire plot, excluding the Alien, and of course the other humans on board this theoretical &quot;Station,&quot; who will stop at nothing just to kill you and only you (unless they spot the Alien of course or by proxy are spotted by it).  You can dress up the ugliest little girl in the whole wide world, teach her how to play the Violin like a grandmaster, and at the end of the day someone is still going to call her only &quot;passable&quot; on of those abilities.  That&apos;s what this whole game feels like, they borrowed the look, the sound, the music (which I&apos;ll give them a pass on since it actually involved some of the composers from the film itself) and of course the actual Alien just to smack it all together to form a boring re-envisioning of the first film.  Its not even shocking how lazily this was thrown together, but looking back at the seminal Aliens versus Predator 2, a game that embodied the second Aliens film amongst other things, wrestled three intertwining story lines, three races with individual player campaigns and managed to make the whole thing immensely original to boot- its easy to see just how terribly unoriginal Alien: Isolation is at its heart.  It mimics a time and a place that some people feel is where the series began and ended.  However, their is a balance that other titles in this sub-genre have managed to lock down to some degree, whereas Isolation seems to be focused on some rather poor stealth sections in stiff, metallic, dark, dull environments that unbelievably DON&apos;T provide you with any cover from the laser beam eyes of the humans and Alien alike.  Amnesia gave you a stealth system that made sense, it even slapped you on the wrist if you hung around the shadows for too long by winding up your insanity meter, you got into a room, you analyzed what the objective in said room was, you completed it as quickly as manageable and stayed out of the sight of the wandering monstrosities.  It was tense, it was interesting and you were unarmed throughout.  Which is why the &quot;crafting&quot; in Isolation seems like a chore.  Most of the times the Human artificial intelligence is lacking to a degree that would make the rent-a-guards from the Thief series blush.  They sometimes see you and then sometimes... they just don&apos;t.  Doesn&apos;t even matter how close you are to them in some situations.  The Alien itself is equally as stupid.  Either that or its a &quot;clever girl&quot; super genius that will sniff out your location in a millisecond and kill you.  I found this garbage stealth system to be a failure, the crafting to be ultimately pointless in many situations and on the whole the game itself is deeply in need of a patch to address these issues.  What they implemented only works correctly something like 75% of the time and that&apos;s not good enough.  I understand that they wanted to play it safe, especially with the brilliantly stupid casting decision of &quot;Amanda Ripley&quot; as our protagonist, but it stands out and speaks volumes about the team behind all of it.  Its like reading fan fiction, Alien fan fiction and that&apos;s been done to death (thanks comic books).  What I would&apos;ve really liked to have seen here was a stealth and A.I. system that actually worked, but mostly what I really wanted to play was less rip-off material incorporated from such games as Dead Space, System Shock, Amnesia, and Bioshock.  However it ultimately doesn&apos;t matter what I think about the game, its getting loads of positive feedback from most sites just from its &quot;atmosphere&quot; alone, but I still think it needs a patch as soon as possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4601798">Expand</a></span>

<br>In space, no one can hear you scream at the repetition.
<br>
<br>Well, talk about a MASSIVE disappointment.
<br>
<br>The first third of the game is superb, the middle section is mediocre, and the last third is terrible. This is a 6-8 hour game with, literally, 10 hours of completely superfluous padding that does absolutely nothing except serve as a major source of deja vu and frustration with the lack of imagination demonstrated by the developers.
<br>
<br>You won&apos;t believe how many times you have to go back and restart a generator or something similarly uninteresting - because the game has no more tricks up its sleeve after the first handful of hours. It&apos;s the way they try to create tension and it works in the beginning.
<br>
<br>But as the game progresses, you adjust to the Alien and it&apos;s no longer as scary as it is at first. This means that every implausible accident causing a delay becomes ever more about despising the process and ever less about appreciating the tension.
<br>
<br>The exploration is mostly linear or deceptively non-linear at places, and you find very little of interest. The audio logs are there just because that&apos;s what these games have in them, and not because the developers had something interesting to say.
<br>
<br>Same goes for the crafting system, which is perhaps the least interesting crafting system I can recall. I didn&apos;t use half the things I could craft - because the game gives you very few opportunities or reasons not to use the much faster and more efficient approach of your normal weapons.
<br>
<br>Clearly, the game was NOT developed by people who understood the games they were inspired by. System Shock 2, for instance, has more interesting choices in the first hour of the first level than the entirety of Isolation. That&apos;s no exaggeration.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s very unfortunate, because the game CAN be a masterpiece. The atmosphere and level of immersion is perhaps the best I&apos;ve ever experienced in a game. It&apos;s just that good. The sound design is also on a level that&apos;s hard to recall in any other AAA game. The sound is so good that it ends up being your primary tool, because you NEED to know where your enemy is at all times - and your motion tracker, as useful as it is, is not as efficient as your ears. Just make absolutely sure you&apos;re playing with surround sound!
<br>
<br>The level design is fantastic when it comes to recreating the Alien film - but it&apos;s also lacking in originality for the same reason.
<br>
<br>To me, the game feels like the developers wanted to have sex with the Alien movie, but since they couldn&apos;t quite have that - they chose to make this game instead.
<br>
<br>What I mean by that is that they bring almost NOTHING of their own to the table in terms of story or imagination. It&apos;s like they&apos;re idolizing the film to such an extent that they consider any deviation sacrilegious.
<br>
<br>Such a slave-like disposition is not how you create strong art. You have to use your own vision, and they should have let the movie serve as inspiration - not a rigid blueprint.
<br>
<br>To make my point clear, I have to say that Aliens: Colonial Marines had more original material than this game does, and as terrible as that game was, at least it tried to expand a little upon the familiar stories.
<br>
<br>Isolation does NOTHING without it having been part of the source material, and everything you see can be traced back DIRECTLY to Scott&apos;s film.
<br>
<br>Maybe a lot of the fans just want to exist in that environment, and nothing more. That&apos;s cool - but I was never really into seeing the same things over and over.
<br>
<br>After I got used to the strong sense of place and ambience, I started hungering for something interesting to happen in the story - and nothing ever really did. It doesn&apos;t help matters when the game gives you more &quot;endings&quot; than you can count, and each of them more ridiculously drawn out than the next.
<br>
<br>Near the end of the game, it becomes a big &quot;experience-fest&quot; - like you&apos;d recognise from the worst AAA titles - with explosions going off everywhere you go and constant little QTE triggers that you have to do.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s like they had too much money and they felt like throwing in a pointless and trivial action movie at the last minute.
<br>
<br>Oh well. It started on such an unbelievably high note - and I&apos;ve never been that scared of a computer game in my entire life. I guess there was no way it could sustain that throughout - but I must say I couldn&apos;t have imagined the negative direction the game starts taking around halfway into it.
<br>
<br>The ONLY reason this game doesn&apos;t get a lower score from me, is because it did something no other game has done in terms of atmosphere and immersion. During the first hours of the game, I was THERE. In that place. No barrier.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s too rare for me to ignore, and so it gets a higher score than it might deserve.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-isolation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612481">Expand</a></span>

It absolutely sucked me in. Brilliant sound effects and music, lighting effects, superb atmosphere and it keeps the tension thru whole game. You simply feel the game, if you know what I mean ;)</span>

This one by feelings is very close to first film Alien. IGN was totally not right about this game. It&apos;s really interesting, scary and intense and I can&apos;t stop playing it!!
