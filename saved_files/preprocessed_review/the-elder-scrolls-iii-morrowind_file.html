I played the console version 2 times through with different characters and the PC version once through. And STILL have NOT done every quest there is to do. It is a huge open world and the expansions add to it. There is countless replayability, and endless customization for making characters. And even still has a nice graphics engine for it&apos;s time. It has a long and in depth story and really indulges you into the game world. I believe this is a must buy for any RPG fan and will not disappoint.

Oblivion compared to Morrowind is a failure. And still today 2009 due to the awesome quantity of mods, i still play Morrowind, while Oblivion has been sold after 3 weeks of weak gameplay, options and tale. I hope, but surely ain t waiting, that Oblivion V will be as grand as Morrowind. IF the company can only backtrack to its RPG heart as were Daggerfall and its predecessor i&#xB4;ll be happy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=83154">Expand</a></span>

The world is beautifully drawn, exciting quests, and just plain fun to wander. Be sure to check out the islands far out in the oceans! </span>

<br>
<br>Quests are always interesting, most of the time not straight forward. You actually have to think about things and make connections between different parts of information. No GPS here, you have to use the map (a paper one can come in handy)! There are many alternative ways of dealing with situations and several outcomes. Sometimes you can skip an entire quest just by bribing someone if you would wish to. You can also trick people or double cross them. It is also possible to kill any NPC in the game (if you accept the consequences that accompany such wanton slaughter)
<br>
<br>Unlike in Skyrim, some guild memberships are mutually exclusive, which is positive roleplaying wise.
<br>
<br>The only negative is character animations were not so good. You can either play 1st person or download an animation mod (morrowind overhaul contains one).

The main criticism seems to be the combat - (and in-game NPC&apos;s even say this about a zillion times) to hit enemies you need a high lvl of fatigue. When you think theres enemies about slow to a WALK. Is that really too taxing on your brain? Nearly every &quot;review&quot; I&apos;ve read has criticised not being &quot;able to hit things&quot;, I cant believe theres people still criticising the game for this a Decade after its release...

The main story is intoxicating and the side / guild quests are also well written. For me it doesn&apos;t matter but the graphics look really dated today (It was good at its release time). The soundtrack still holds up today. The battle system is fine. I had never problems while fighting enemies. The level up system is also really good (It is different from Skyrim. Skyrim got rid of stats like strength, dexterity etc). It has also a job system (You chose a job at the beginning of the game and get higher stats in some skills). Overall this is a timeless classic and a good choice for rpg lovers. For me it is better than Skyrim in many parts (Could not decide which is the better Elder Scrolls game).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=4504556">Expand</a></span>

<br>Executive Summary (TL;DR)
<br>
<br>8/10 for its time: This is largely due to tons of exploits and bugs that never should have been day 1 bugs, muchless persistent. (I just love exploiting games, but it is an indication of poor quality control.) The general fun I have playing, the compelling story, and overall replayability make the flaws it has easy for me to overlook. This is a GREAT addition to the Elder Scrolls franchise as well as to the corpus of RPG games.
<br>
<br>-----------
<br>
<br>Detailed review:
<br>The Bad:
<br>1. Attributes and other boosts aren&apos;t checked/capped. There is no upper limit one can boost these to with potions. The number will also suddenly flip to a largely negative value. This is near inexplicable behavior if you don&apos;t know the innards of a computer (I do). If you love exploiting things look at the next item for why this is bad even if you don&apos;t cross that magical negative flipping boundary.
<br>
<br>2. Some temporary boost potions can kill you when they wear off, if you have boosted yourself more than 2x your HP, and have taken more than 1x your HP in damage that&apos;s unhealed. I experienced this with 30seconds of a quick save and 6 hours of the prior regular save. I eventually survived...
<br>
<br>3. Buggy on release. Many of these bugs persist, long after the game is no longer being maintained. Too many mods are needed to fix all of the bugs, bogging down the machine running it, doubly true for the hardware of 2002.
<br>
<br>The Mediocre (Not bad, not great):
<br>1. Melee combat. It&apos;s serviceable, but rough.
<br>
<br>2. Spell crafting. I like crafting spells, but the UI is merely serviceable, even by 2002 standards.
<br>
<br>3. Side quests are a mixed bag for writing and presentation.
<br>
<br>4. In game books -- like real life books the quality of the writing in these is all over the place. The reasons to read them are three fold: a) skill increases (very rare), b) increase player knowledge of the game realm that is Elder Scrolls, c) you actually like the book(s). (some people do!) The reason to carry them in inventory is for gold. Skill books command a good price.
<br>
<br>5. You can talk to almost everyone! But not everyone has something valuable or interesting to say. Those with little value to say pretty much share the same dialogue tree.
<br>
<br>6. The DLC was a mixed bag in my view. For me, the stories for those felt forced at times, with the exception of Bloodmoon.
<br>
<br>7. The graphics were mediocre for 2002. They&apos;ve not aged as well as one might have hoped. But I still enjoy the game a lot, despite this.
<br>
<br>The great:
<br>1. Well thought out main story with great writing. I felt motivated to figure out if my character was actually the Nerevarine. This was a very enjoyable experience for me.
<br>
<br>2. The RPG mechanical elements, such as skills, attributes and the like are well thought out, tho not perfectly balanced. These allow for a lot of replayability while having to master new gameplay mechanics each time.
<br>
<br>3. In game tutorial woven through as part of the game at the start. This is a huge bonus as it ensures you know the basics of how to play and manage your character.
<br>
<br>4. Magic is well done in this game and the variety of schools to master is a detail I find highly enjoyable. While spell crafting can be tough for the faint of heart, you have no absolute need for it. You can buy good spells in every Mages Guild.
<br>
<br>5. Factions/Guilds have separate agenda&apos;s and their own involved quest lines that can rarely come into conflict with each other. While not as thoroughly polished as the main quest, these are still intriguing and fun to play, especially when you must choose to never complete a quest or to get ejected from a guild. If you don&apos;t like such tough choices, don&apos;t join any guilds.
<br>
<br>6. The volume of side quests, while fulfilling the main archetypes for quests, is just astounding. You have to play for a very very long time to find, and complete them all.
<br>
<br>7. The world map is HUGE. It&apos;s open, more open than even its descendants, and is very detailed for its time.  The types of landscapes you&apos;ll encounter are varied, and with no loading screen for moving from the swampy areas to the desert and then to the ash-blown wastes that is the volcanic center of the island-nation of Morrowind. But be warned if you try that, you will be doing a lot of walking. Mage Guild Teleportation, or Silt Striders are your best fast travel options.
<br>
<br>8. You can keep playing after the main quest is done! Yay!
<br>
<br>In conclusion 8/10: This is a GREAT addition to the Elder Scrolls franchise as well as to the corpus of RPG games. I find this an immensely replayable, fun, well written game with a larger than desirable share of non-game-breaking bugs. If it had better QC it would have gotten a 9 or 10 from me. But as a professional software engineer of over 20 years, and having played video games since Pong in the 1970s (I was a wee tot then), I have high expectations of software, especially games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=5773531">Expand</a></span>

Oblivion wasn&apos;t my game, because the world was too &quot;plastic&quot;. But Morrowind was a masterpiece. You can explore the world more than 100 hours. Yes, i know, the story was not the best and you can play it through in 1 hour, but the RPG gameplay was revolutionary in this age of time and for me. The graphics are today irrelevant, when you are a real RPG-player.

Bethesda created a beautiful, huge and unique world of Morrowind that catches you, immerses you and won&apos;t let you out so easily and when it does, you will be blessed with a fantasy experience to remember. The world and the creatures inhabiting it were all so unique, atmosphere so mysterious, politics between the houses intriguing, main Nerevarine story very epic, game mechanics amazingly complex with so much freedom, creating your own spells, mixing potions, joining countless factions and doing quests, building your own stronghold and living there including taking care of your own staff, flying all over the world, just doing what the hell you want to do. Morrowind was also the first time The Elder Scrolls introduced talented Jeremy Soule, his spectacular soundtrack and theme that continued to be amazing and one of the trademarks of the entire series, but it was exceptionally good here. I love Morrowind and it&apos;s definitely not just nostalgia, recently I played through this again after playing through all the other TES chapters and it only proved my opinion that Morrowind is without a doubt the best of them all. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=4395892">Expand</a></span>

<br>Morrowind was my first true open-world RPG experience. It was massive. Unbelievable, how big this world was, and how realistic it feet. It was true immersion of the kind that I had been looking for in a game for so long - Morrowind made it come true. The key to that experience was that the game world didn&apos;t make me feel too welcome. I had to find my place there myself. Following the plot, I could become a great hero - or focus on advancing in the ranks of a guild that I sympathize with - or I could avoid the sociability and just explore ash deserts, climb mountains ... follow a river, hoping to hit a village soon, not knowing if a would find allies there ... or enter dungeons, not knowing if I can make it out, or if I will find the treasure. Morrowind is rough, it let me die under lots of different circumstances. Stealing, fighting, or just talking - none of it is easy from the start, but depending on my own focus, I can make it work. Well, in fact, a little more common sense could have prevented me from dying most of the time ... Still, it was worth it - dying out of stupidity made the world consistent! Reality doesn&apos;t do that anymore.
<br>
<br>Trivia:
<br>Vivec, the capital, is the most annoying virtual city I have ever been forced to visit. I would *not* live there.
<br>I love the magic skills in this game: you can play completely different types of magicians - or, as before:  ignore it and whack the wildlife with club, sword or bow instead. Why fly, when you can jump? (But flying is cooler.) You can do both.
<br>Once I got myself trapped on a roof and didn&apos;t want to reload, so I started jumping in place until my Acrobatics were advanced enough to let me survive the fall. Needless to say, skilling took more time than replaying the lost part would have - but it felt like an achievement. Stupid old days.
<br>
<br>Reasons to stay in Morrowind:
<br>What happens when the nostalgia fades? Well, even then Morrowind should still be worth a (longer) look, and that is because of its freedom, and because of its world. Some may call it barren, lacking vegetation, or miss people riding about. Yet this is not a big deal, I think. The different regions have a lot of character, despite the raw textures. Not to forget that essentially you are an explorer in a rough world, and people would be strange to have around in a desert. People stay in their towns, that is what towns are for. The only thing I missed, are more trees and animals. The latter can be modded into the game.
<br>
<br>Bugs:
<br>Some are bound to happen. Quests might fail because of dysfunctional pathfinding or unforeseen events. Saving and loading skills required. Be careful: As realistic as it is to be able to kill anybody - without some characters, certain quests (even the main quest) will be impossible to complete, and some doors will stay closed.
<br>
<br>Tech:
<br>While the sound is great, the graphics are not. I would not call them ugly, because I do value a fitting texture, and I really like the water, even when I&apos;ve seen better. This game does not need hi-def graphics, but if you do, then it&apos;s simply not a match :)
<br>My opinion regarding the basic technology, the interface, and the modding capabilities are basically the same as those in my review for Oblivion, Morrowind&apos;s successor. It was mostly negative criticism, though. As a result, after hundreds of hours of installing and running modifications, I&apos;ve decided to stop doing that entirely, for as long as the foundation of the Elder Scrolls games is so not fit for modding. Here my review ends on a bitter note (because I love the things you can do with mods).
<br>
<br>I rate Morrowind one point over Oblivion, rewarding its deeper roughness, its greater cultural richness, and higher exploratory qualities. Ash deserts, you are my true home!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=4943904">Expand</a></span>

I liked this for sure, as well as other chapters, however it is good to analyze the strengths and weaknesses in detail.
<br>
<br>The plot of Morrowind guarantees the quality typical of The Elder Scrolls. The story is exceptional, cured in every detail, and nothing is left to chance. Characters, settings and events are mixed to create something fantastic. Also the island of Vvardenfell has a charm all its own, and the prophecy of Nerevarine is a narrative device that captures immediately. Everything works and is simply excellent.
<br>
<br>The gameplay of Morrowind was certainly innovative for the time, there is no doubt about this. True free exploration, organized inventory, editor of the character quite nice, day-night cycle in real time, excellent management of dialogue, freedom in clothing rather extensive, many selectable abilities and their progress is quite realistic: the more you use it, the more you become good at it. Obviously, the game also has its flaws. Maybe I&apos;m being too fond of the gameplay in Oblivion, that I played first, but I can not tolerate faults in Morrowind: the absence of teleportation in places already visited (the map is tiring to walk), the absence of the indicator of the missions&apos; objectives that I found personally unthinkable; and especially the fighting. The fights are too complexed. The feedback of the combat system is strange: you do not know if you really hit the target or not, or even if it is a malfunction of the game. Really, simply absurd. However the gameplay of Morrowind, as criticable, is also incredibly advanced for its time. Morrowind is simply immature, being the first real change in the saga, and its gameplay would be developed over time.
<br>
<br>The graphics are beautiful, even after more than a decade, remarkable work especially in the environments. The soundtrack is fantastic, composed by Jeremy Soule.
<br>
<br>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is really a fantastic game, a turning point in the genre of rpg-games, and an important starting point for the subsequent chapters of the saga, that despite an immature gameplay, is able to maintain an exceptional quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=5207008">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Morrowind is a game for explorers: set mostly on the island of Vvardenfell, it immerses you in perhaps the richest game world created to date, with kilometres of geography to explore from the claustrophobic swamps of the Bitter Coast, to the sparkling beauty of the Ascadian Isles, to the harsh wastes of the Ashlands and much, much more. The lore of the world is equally rich, with a complex historical, political and cultural background that will take you hours and hours to fully understand, if you ever do. The best part is that this lore isn&apos;t just there for interest - it&apos;s directly relevant to both the main and the myriad &apos;side&apos; quests, which are often just as immersive as the main quest, and constitute a full game in their own right.
<br>
<br>Vvardenfell is a harsh, unforgiving place. The native dark elves, or Dunmer, are a gravelly-voiced, proud and reserved people who by-and-large regard outlanders, such as yourself, with little more than disdain. That is, until you prove yourself to them. This is perhaps a reflection of the land they inhabit, a volcanic island infested with all sorts of nasty predator, and plagued by constant infighting between the great houses of the Dunmer, as well as countless other factions such as the Temple, the Empire, the Cammona Tong etc., most of which you can join. The history of the world is incredibly rich and original, and is tangled in the conflicting lies of those who wrote it - whose side you believe is up to your own interpretation. There are hundreds of books scattered throughout the game world to help you with this, but most of it is picked up in a sort of osmosis as you wander through the island, which is so alive with its own history, perhaps due to the rather backward-looking inhabitants.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is equally harsh and unforgiving. You are thrust into the world with vague directions to see a guy in Balmora, and no equipment but what you can beg, steal and eventually earn. You are not handheld, there is no levelling system, and stumbling into fights you can&apos;t win is a common feature of your early days. This imparts a sense of vulnerability that&apos;s lacking in later titles, and a sense that the world wasn&apos;t just created for you to beat - it&apos;s been there long before you arrived and will still be there long after you&apos;re gone. It feels like a real place. There&apos;s no fast travel and no quest markers - finding things in the world means listening carefully to instructions you&apos;re given by NPCs, and this makes questing feel like real exploration - frustrating and long-winded but full of surprises due to the rich game world. This is not a game you can sleepwalk through; for even the basic quests you need to be switched on.
<br>
<br>For players of Skyrim I&apos;d liken TES:V to a trip to the zoo and Morrowind to a safari. Sure, it&apos;s more effort, and it&apos;s dangerous, and the lions aren&apos;t marked out with a big sign, but that&apos;s sort of the point.
<br>
<br>This all makes it so much more rewarding when you reach your full potential - a god-like mortal wielding artefacts of legendary power, many of which you may have created yourself. The lack of levelling is not a missing feature - it&apos;s there to keep you on edge when you enter a fight, not knowing for sure if you can win, and make you feel like a badass when you&apos;re a high level, because you&apos;ve earned it. That&apos;s not to say you won&apos;t be surprised now and again - there&apos;s always a bigger fish if you go looking for it.
<br>
<br>The quests are generally interesting, designed not just as excuses to send you down a dungeon to kill more undead, but as chances to expose you to the varied environments and lore of the world (all of which is detailed wonderfully in your journal for reference). This is fortunate, because the gameplay is easily the most lacking part of the game. Combat can be a chore, as it is essentially a click-fest. Whether you damage the enemy is decided by your skill levels, and this can mean repeatedly swinging your sword or spear or whatever only to see it harmlessly pass through your target. This is probably the game&apos;s greatest flaw, and one that I would unreservedly change to the updated system of Skyrim, or perhaps something like Dark Messiah.
<br>
<br>The graphics are a little dated, though still beautiful in their own way, and this can be fixed with mods. Animation and AI have aged badly too, and seeing NPCs standing facing a wall for, well sometimes forever, day and night, is also a little immersion breaking at times.
<br>
<br>But look beyond past these flaws, and you will be rewarded with the most immersive, rewarding and fascinating experience. An adventure like no other where you earn your place in a harsh world that at first seems totally alien, but gradually starts to feel like home as you grow to know and understand its people, its history, its gods and its soul. Oh, and do try the mods.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=5183998">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What a wondrous game in the literal sense of the world. To this day I still remember my first playthrough. Came from old school jRPG&apos;s like FF and had no clue what Morrowind style cRPGs were about. Gave up after first couple of hours. Persevered because of a lot of free time at the time and it really began to shine through. I remember creating a Nord, finding a steel dai-katana and thinking it was the greatest weapon ever. Through some miracle defeated an Ordinator, wore his armor and the rest is history as they say. Needless to say I restarted pretty quick.
<br>
<br>Unparalleled in its ability to captivate you and draw you in. This is not nostalgia speaking either. I&apos;m enjoying it immensely again on a very fresh playthrough: I havent played the game since Oblivion, then Fallout 3 and after that Skyrim came out. After trying to replay FO3 again (it was impossible) this feels so much better. The atmosphere, music, distinct races and peoples of Vvardenfell and sheer content and the way it all goes together is, to this day (13 years since release!) unparallelled. All it needs is some polishing of the graphics (ie MGSO) and it&apos;s good to go. Unlike Skyrim and Oblivion which were good games with their own merits but &quot;needed&quot; tons of mods (IMO) to really give them replay value. I can honestly say that with MGSO, this came looks better than many current-gen games. As I own a PS4 as well, I&apos;m able to make a good comparison (with say, Destiny which looks pretty damn good) this is what really struck me.
<br>
<br>This is one for the ages and a game I will never forget. I STILL haven&apos;t found everything and I must be on my tenth playthrough at least. Only &quot;bad&quot; thing about this game is the lack of urgency in the storytelling but on the flip-side, this is also what gives the game its soul. So I&apos;m not going to deduct a point for that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=5262170">Expand</a></span>

For hardcore RPG and The Elder Scrolls fans is, perhaps, the best of the series. However, technical issues and gameplay mechanics may keep away potential players. I will be reviewing the game in its vanilla status and without the expansions.
<br>
<br>The premise in Morrowind is to offer the player an open world to enjoy a complex rpg. This game does not hold your hand, even from the start off you are only told how to move your character and interact with the world. After the short introductory section where you pick a race, class, sign; you are thrown into the world of Morrowind with a scratch of the main story and vague directions to follow it. Yes you are free, bound to bad mechanics and to new comers this freedom can be overwhelming at start. I had to try it four times until I actually began to feel the game and enjoy it for the summ of its parts, except combat.
<br>
<br>The story: you begin as a prisoner who is liberated in the island of Vvardenfell, an island of Morrowind. The empire has a partial control of the land, but the ashlanders (the original people o Morrowind or dark elves) see the outsiders with distrust and would like to see the empire gone. Anyway, you soon learn that you are an agent for the empire, a position you must accept as a condition for your liberation. However you are not forced to follow the main quest which, in short, is to learn and discover the truth behind the legend of the Neverarine, a lieberator of Morrowind. The story is interesting, but if you are the kind of player who does not like to read dialogue, forget it. Later on, you will be immersed with different political and religious factions, so reading dialogue is a must.
<br>
<br>The journal is key to follow the quests and your progress in the story. However, the implementation in the vanilla game leaves a lot to be desired. A couple of hours in the game and the journal will be filled with information and keeping track of what you have done and what you should be doing in a quest can be a quest on its own. A pen and paper is your best friend, because the in-game journal is a liability.
<br>
<br>The game world: Morrowind is a strange land; it has marshes, deserts, giant mushrooms as trees, and even unique architecture in cities like Ald&#xB4;Ruhn. It has also a huge city called Vivec which for new comers will be a challenge to get around. Traveling in Morrowind is both a dangerous and long process. There is no fast travel, only silt striders in major towns, or you can use scrolls (provided you have bought them)  to return to specific places, or be teleported between cities which have a mages guild.
<br>
<br>But the story is the excuse to learn to play Morrowind. You can join the Fighters Guild, the Mages Guild, Thieves Guild, the local criminal syndicate Camonna Tong. You can adventure just to build up your character doing whatever you want. But this game is hard, you will die a lot, so saving is very very very important (also because it will crash sometimes).
<br>
<br>The combat mechanics is a feature you may to get used to. It is very bad actually. Whether you hit a target with your weapon depends on the stats behind the scene, and since you do not have any indication if you hit your target or not, in  the beginning of the game, combat can be anything but immersive and fun, and a trial by fire. If your character is going to be a warrior, be sure to pick the right perks. If combat in rpgs is your thing, Morrowind is not for you. Later on the combat is improved by your character&#xB4;s stats, but it is not the attraction of Morrowind.
<br>
<br>However, the thing about Morrowind is that you actually feel you build up your character. Yes, the beginning is hard and is a chore to say the least, but if you endure, you may get the satisfaction of your hard work. That is why this game is for those who enjoy spending time, failing, finding other ways to do things. It does not hold your hand, but rewards your persistence as you gain experience and if you overlook the bad combat. The NPCs do not level up with your character, so the weak ones who were a chore to defeat swinging your weapon like and idiot, will be a piece of cake later on; and the ones who made your life very hard because your level was too low, will be challenging but not unbeatable once your character is of a higher level.
<br>
<br>Morrowind offers also an alchemy system. In the beginning you may actually fail to make potions, but little by little things work out for the better. Again, you gain experience with dedication.
<br>
<br>Morrowind is a game that is and will be considered one of the best of the TES series by the hardcore fans. The joy comes from the freedom of Morrowind when you have high enough level to survive a rat or worm attack, and from mechanics exploits. While it is good that the game is challenging, the bad combat mechanics, awkward animations, the absence of fast travel and the comboluted journal, makes the life of the player harder than it should be and less fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=5485045">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is complex, the char creation very free, unfortunately has some weaknesses, but anyway there are a lot of possibilities. You can do a lot of things, even creat new spells. The world is amazing, open world at its best: there are so many things to discover and rewarding. There is so many content to discover and understand, epic in onw word. And the whole world is adult, very immersive. No childish dialogs, no arrows above NPCs and so on. Music perfect, I still listen to the main theme in my car. Graphic is good even today, but only if you put a lot of mods, otherwise is very outdated. Normally I dont like games that demands 100 or 200 hours of your life, but this game made it. I dont know any better open world RPG.

Sencillamente explorar las ruinas, tumbas y cavernas es una delicia, perderte en sus regiones y poblados para luego encontrar un artefacto legendario por pura coincidencia, es una impresi&#xF3;n sencillamente extraordinaria. Aun hoy son pocos los juegos me han hecho pasar tantas horas frente a una pantalla, todas ellas dedicadas a explorar los recovecos del Morrowind, todo eso a pesar de las modernas mejoras gr&#xE1;ficas y de hardware. La historia a pesar de no ser extraordinaria es ciertamente interesante, la cantidad de cosas que hay que conocer es inmensa, el &quot;lore&quot; es colosal y ciertamente interesante, la cantidad de gremios a los que puedes unirte es tambi&#xE9;n grandiosa y a&#xFA;n hoy, todav&#xED;a sigo encontrando misiones que jam&#xE1;s hab&#xED;a realizado. Es un juego grandioso y no es la nostalgia la que habla por m&#xED;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=6027651">Expand</a></span>

But it is really hard to find a game, in which you actually want to return to. Now, even RPG started to be simple. Just another game to entertain you for a dozen of hours. Meh. Morrowind offer you a world so deep, that you can drown in it. There was a lot of games after Morrowind. It all better looking (Morrowind was released in 2001, many people forgetting it). Some of them quite interesting. But here I am again, making my way through Ashlands, keeping my eye on this cliff racers or trying to sell a stolen silver vase to a Breton trader in Peligiad... Its a nostalgia, that making players to start this game over and over again. To dive in a world of  fading beauty, immerse landscapes, loneliness and adventures, waiting for you to make few steps toward it.
<br>Is it boring? Well, yes. If you used to hack and slash games, that pretending to be RPG, and waiting for game to spit a world right into your face,  this one is not for you.
<br>Try to understand, that Morrowind truly offer you a different world. Explore it. Live in it. And you will be rewarded with one of the best RPG of generation.
<br>P.S. Than, if you want to try something new - try Tamriel Rebuilt (or other mods). Or create your own mod for Morrowind with TES Construction Set)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=2522873">Expand</a></span>

I think this game gave me more enjoyment then any other RPG I&apos;ve ever played. Truthfully I think the only improvements Bethesda made in Oblivion or Skyrim were the graphics and combat system. Otherwise I would say that Morrowind is far better then the later sequels. The storyline, quests, and factions are very deep and I loved being a wizard with a levitate spell flying all across the land. Each town has its own distinct feel and the towns don&apos;t feel copy pasted like they do in Oblivion. Perhaps the greatest thing about this game is it gave you the feeling of a treasure hunter as you could find any item at any level unlike Skyrim and Oblivion where both monsters and items level up with you. This game is a game I will always remember as a true RPG. It wasn&apos;t just a game it was an experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=2496555">Expand</a></span>

If anyone wants to always hit then go playing OB or any other hack&apos;n&apos;slash. Pros: an incredibly well-constructed story, with a very detailed politic background, a stunning enviroment diversity, a very good, quite balanced skill system, same for the magic system, satisfying side-quests, a great soundtrack. Cons: too many bugs (without (un)official patches), combat system sometimes a bit &quot;scabby&quot; switching between phis. and mag. attacks, and I preferred more RPG style weapon attacks with random damage. Conclusion:there would be many other things to say, but the fact is that THIS is a masterpiece, to enjoy little by little, without being in a hurry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=743118">Expand</a></span>

The joy of exploring this dense and diverse world, will leave you coming back for more, and more. While today its hard to find the graphics amazing, now that the game has been out for 7 years, they are still well done, and the concepts solid. The main weakness is the combat system, which in the early levels of your character will be incredibly frustrating, but as you progress this becomes less and less of an issue. You basically miss a lot until you get some decent skills. The sheer number of items, weapons and armors has yet to be matched in a game. This game is far better then its successor oblivion. If you are into a good story, and a world filled with intriguing lore then this is the game for you. This is perhaps the only game where you pickup a book and you can actually read it, and not only can you but you want to because it further immerses you in the world. Add the huge user content community and you have hands down the best RPG to ever grace the pc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=425326">Expand</a></span>

First the story is intertwined with history as set out in books and quests and is just like reading human history. There are different accounts, different opinions, ambiguous reports. The picture you build up is incomplete and often makes you revise your judgements about which historical characters are good and which are evil. Eventually you realize that just as in real life, there is often no clear boundary.  Second, the game world is so convincing and lifelike, it draws you in until you feel like you have actually been there and witnessed the events. All RPGs try to do this but Morrowind (and Oblivion) do it better because the physics is better. Most games impose limits on what a character can do e.g. there is an object, therefore you cannot go there. In Morrowind, you can move anything if it is light enough and not fastened, jump on anything if your jumping skill is good enough, climb any terrain if your you have the capability. You have to try this.  It is very realistic, and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=1834271">Expand</a></span>

Most games start out flashy, and then after a while you realize how boring it really is.  Morrowind is sort of the opposite.  You start in the ugliest, dingiest town in the game, and it builds its way up from there.  You don&apos;t really know what you&apos;re supposed to be doing when you start out--the main quest isn&apos;t even really revealed til later--so the game motivates you to try different things and go exploring.  But boy when that main quest line starts revealing itself, it is one epic tale, and it would have made as great a novel as it does a game.  The sheer attention to detail in this is mind-blowing.  Every area of the game feels hand-crafted, with hidden areas to explore; items, weapons and armor to collect; all sorts of enemies to test your power against; a story full of religion, politics, and conflict; and an extremely complex and rich society.  It doesn&apos;t hurt that you can explore every region of the map at any point (you just might not live through the encounters you face) and uncover some very strange and exotic locales.  And on that note, it&apos;s hard to have strong diversity in a game and still keep it feeling like a uniform and unique region all on its own.  Once again this game succeeds, with desolation, swamp, coastline, open pastures and the like.  The only criticism I have for this game is the combat.  I personally do not mind the by-the-numbers real-time combat, where a low skill means you might miss, but I think transitions between melee/ranged and magic could have been better.  I also would have appreciated a reason not to simply click the &quot;best attack&quot; button on options, and in this respect I think Daggerfall had better combat.  Overall however, Morrowind is classic.  Anybody who has the patience for reading a great novel would love this game, as it winds up being a game of epic proportions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=1760209">Expand</a></span>

In all reality it is my second favorite game of all time.<br><br>If you like oldschool rpgs, a very large world, tons of things to do, all quest lines give you only moderate direction of where to go forcing you to have to hunt, and an overall challenge, then pick this up.<br><br>While it is true the hit and miss system is a pain there are so many easy ways around this if you know how, if not look it up. Here is a hint, &quot;master trainers.&quot;<br><br>The only thing I can say about this game, and its the reason I must give it a 9 out of 10 instead of a perfect score, is that on release the graphics were not even close to dos related 3d graphics. The whole character models look terrible even by standards set 6 to 10 years before the game came out. This alone is the reason it got knocked down one point.<br><br>Again the only issue can be resolved by mods at this point in time, the better bodies mod, better heads (discontinued but still able to be found) and morrowind enhanced (type mods) actually can make this game look graphically appealing and honestly, lets just say this, I have wasted so much time on this game and I still have not completed everything there is to do, I always find something new and I have played for ages.<br><br>The modding community is, quite possibly, larger than oblivion and skyrim combined but this is to be expected. It is now 20 dollars on steam but I can say it is worth a lot more.<br><br>Just be careful, if you like to be hand fed everything, please go play a bad game now and don&apos;t waste your time trying to rate this poorly or play this game, you wont look intelligent.<br><br>Overall playtime for real gamers is expected to be around 1260 hours, give or take.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=2439162">Expand</a></span>

Ever since I seem to always be on a search to find games that allow me to sink into the world within the game so deeply. There&apos;s only be a few games since I played this one a few years back that have captured me so fully. Deus Ex, Gothic 1&amp;2, Mass Effect 1&amp;2 are probably the only other games I&apos;ve played that would be anywhere near as good as this one. And yes, I like Morrowind a lot more than Oblivion. Oblivion was good, maybe even deserving of a 10 rating also, but the story in this one is much more interesting, and my desire to explore the nooks and crannies of the universe were much greater in this game. I don&apos;t know how many hours I spent on this game, but I do remember taking a day or two off from work just so that I could play this game. There&apos;s never been another game that has made me quite so lazy.

The scenery was memorable. The lore was interesting. And the gameplay options were immense. Its boundless flexibility let you play the game the way YOU wanted to play and does not force you to play in a linear fashion. It was bundles of fun to enchant armor and weapons and alchemy was useful as was spellmaking which added a new dimension to the game that no other game to date has come close to matching, not even subsequent Elder Scrolls games. I still remember floating around with levitate or laughing in my 100% invisibility suit. Yea they were game breaking but in a game like this, it really did not matter since the game was not 100% about combat. It was just plain fun to do and once you do, you store the suit away and try something else for fun. No game has ever held my attention as long except maybe X3.
<br>
<br>Despite being my all time favorite game, it still had flaws that persist even in Oblivion and Skyrim.
<br>
<br>#1 - Combat was boring. Even though making spells is fun, normal combat is dull and enemies were way too easy to beat in part because they are just weak inherently and because the AI was bad. Some improvements were made in Skyrim but combat in ES games is still a weak point and needs to be addressed.
<br>
<br>#2 - There is no economy balance. I remember the great promise in Oblivion of a living, breathing world with NPC&apos;s doing jobs and participating in the world. It never happened. Turned out they were just scripted and the economy and world were still static. Morrowind was the same. by mid game, you pretty could own the entire island. Wealth is too easy to find which makes things somewhat dull since it does not feel earned.
<br>
<br>#3 - Lore was very strong in Morrowind but ironically, the story was somewhat meh. I wish there was a little more flare to the end game with harder enemies and a much grander finale but as it turns out, combat was simply trivial even if you did not exploit the game in any way. The enemies were just too weak and defeating the final boss was a trivial matter. Even the god Vivec was lame and could be defeated at level 1 with a bow and tons of arrows. I suppose this is just an extension of #1 above in some ways but I really wish that fighting was more epic. At least equip these bosses with game breaking items akin to what the player can make.
<br>
<br>Its a fantastic game, possibly the best RPG ever made, and with texture upgrades it still looks great today but it is still not a perfect game. Hopefully they will read this before they make the next game as the series keeps devolving. The ES games are still great and I liked Skyrim but it is not in the same league as Morrowind.

                                        <span> Morrowind is an amazing game that you can play for 10 minutes or for 10 hours. The only problem I felt was the fighting. The swordplay was a bit boring. Another is the sense of overwhelming you get when playing this. For someone indecisive like me, it&apos;s very hard to choose what to do. But overall, it&apos;s an amazing game.</span>

                                        <span>Morrowind is probably the best RPG I&apos;ve ever played. It&apos;s truly free-roaming with almost no bounds. The game play is addicting. The drawback is the ridiculous amount of walking around, trying to reach places without fast-travel. Plus many of the towns and regions are pointless or repetitive, limiting the seemingly free-roam feel.</span>

Definitely superior to Oblivion; can&apos;t say anything about Skyrim, as I haven&apos;t played it yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=2159185">Expand</a></span>

Although the graphics in Morrowind were much better than Daggerfall (Morrowind was released 6 years after Daggerfall) the game&apos;s dungeons and world seemed small in comparison with Daggerfall. Also, the game seemed to be tuned to be too easy. It was really hard to be killed in this game. The character creation was not completely open, unlike Daggerfall you could not create your own custom class with specs and abilities. This game was released on console too if I remember right so it probably had to be smaller to fit the console system. But overall this was a good game. I also don&apos;t remember encountering any bugs in this game which was a good improvement over Daggerfall (the buggiest game I&apos;ve ever played).
<br>
<br>Elderscrolls III: Morrowind was a good game, it&apos;s only real failing was to be small in comparison to its predecessor, Elderscrolls II: Daggerfall. I will give it a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=2599542">Expand</a></span>

Concern yourself with the politics of the gods or find a peasant&apos;s lost trinket, or maybe just do a million things in between, the scope of this game is staggering. The architecture, the landscape, the inhabitants, it&apos;s all believable. So believable that armour made out of glass  seems completely natural as does travelling about on the back of a giant flea type creature. Far far better than Oblivion and the only thing preventing a &apos;10&apos; is the end game which I felt was hugely anticlimactic ,and a final boss whose appearance reminded me of a humorous children&apos;s tv character from long ago.  Also, high level characters tend to turn out very similar to each other no matter how you started them. But enough criticism - A groundbreaking game in many ways and still worthy of anyone&apos;s time even now. Surely you&apos;ve tried this game at least once already?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=1735266">Expand</a></span>

Oblivion may have better graphics but Morrowind has true heart and soul. It&apos;s just a must-play! So buy this, download mods, then play for 100+ hours. This game deserves a Metacritic score of around 95; it&apos;s that good.</span>

The game is extremely old for the technology world and it does have its flaws. The game itself is not buggy or full of glitches unless you actually go around the world trying to find them (For example, you can enter the world before completing the Census Office if you jump into the corner between the wall and the building with Sellus Gravius, but you constantly have to jump into it to get through it). The game has a lot of information to take in (and I mean a s*** ton of information) which can generally be found by reading books and adventuring as well as through the questing system. The questing does take FOREVER to complete and it is relatively linear in the sense that most quests are similar (but, hey, what do you expect it is an RPG) in some way like go kill this monster, report to this bro, etc. For anyone who says it is an MMO without the second M or O, you are an idiot (I didn&apos;t really want to go to insulting, but it is true) because the game is a SINGLE PLAYER game, not a MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER ONLINE game. The story is intricate, and though the questing objectives are similar, the lore behind them is not. I was actually disappointed in Oblivion after playing Morrowind because of how cartoony everything became and the quests were probably just as linear (again, quests in RPG&apos;s are usually relatively linear or at least similar... Even in Skyrim). For the year this game was made it has some of the most amazing graphical detail I have seen in a game from that time period, and if you have it on the computer, you can go beyond Skyrim HD graphics. The World: The world is monstrous in Morrowind and your only form of fast travel are Silt Striders and Mages Guild teleportation (which sucks because not every place has one of these). I think it was built this way on purpose, however. It seems that Bethesda wanted people to get out and explore for things instead of stay in their comfort zones going from city to city, and only going to places quests required them to. The spell creation in Morrowind is so unlimited, that it is literally broken. You can create spells that can one shot any damned thing in the game, but you have to have a godaweful amount of money and mana to do so. Magic can also do everything for you, and is an easier way to do things then train your Lockpicking skill or whatever else (but you are supposed to try everything... Again RPG). NPC&apos;s are relatively generic because they are all based on the presets, and there are only about two voices per gender, but there are also hundreds of NPC&apos;s. I would like to see someone try to give every one of a thousand people a different voice using a thousand different voice actors. If that happened, I would commend the idiot that went out of their way to do so.
<br>If you want to play an RPG, then play Morrowind. Besides, it brings concepts to the other games. If you want to play a game like CoD, then play CoD. That game right there is linear. All you do is the same thing, but I don&apos;t hear complaining about that.
<br>All in all, if you want to play a well-made RPG, then try it out. Sure it may piss you off because you may die, and it is annoying to hit things at lower skill levels, but it has a rich culture in and of itself. Playing an RPG is all about the story and how you get to the end of it, not about how easy it is to use magic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=2466029">Expand</a></span>
