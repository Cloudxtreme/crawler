If this game was created 2/3 years ago I will say  It&apos;s a nice sequel of Human Revolution and will play all day/night allover. But meanwhile one thing will happened and it&apos;s name is Witcher 3. I know it&apos;s other kind of climate and mood of the game but if we talk about scale, epic moments, mood, characters, main protagonist, optymalization of the game and few other things Witcher is few laps ahead.
<br>When I bought newest Deus Ex I expect something great, something new, something even epic. Through the eyes of imagination I saw great  overpopulated cites, skyscrapers of steel and glass, blood and chrome on the streets, hard choices on the cyberpunk streets. But I get only a demo version of this all. For example in one quest we go to the club and I expect something like club in Blade film ..but when i get inside only few corridors and about 6 NPC dancing inside -WTF !! This is a club ?
<br>
<br>Technical game need some patches, loading is extremely slowly  (I don&apos;t have SSD disc), video effects are rather  few years old (but no so drama like Fallout 4), music is nice and have a mood of industrial mood of game. Street isnt crowded and I feel that in newest Hitman is two time more people on the streets, locations arent big, there are rather small I think Thief has bigger and better created. But gameplay isnt bad, I play hacker type of protagonist and feel that I&apos;m very weak in combat situation but can do all I need by programs and hacking.
<br>
<br>So if You are great fan like me of cyberpunk mood, love rpg like Interface Zero, Eclipse Phase must play this game but wait for some sale, now game isnt worth Your money.
<br>
<br>And CDProject hurry up with Cyberpunk 2077 !!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6662402">Expand</a></span>

<br>First of all it could have been a good game. The world and the theme are interesting. But they just **** up the execution.
<br>
First the Pros:
- Interesting setting and theme
- Adam Jensen and his voice
- Beautiful Prague
- You can solve problems your way, ghost, panther or assault gameplay are possible
- very interesting side stories

<br>First of all it could have been a good game. The world and the theme are interesting. But they just **** up the execution.
<br>
<br>First the Pros:
<br>- Interesting setting and theme
<br>- Adam Jensen and his voice
<br>- Beautiful Prague
<br>- You can solve problems your way, ghost, panther or assault gameplay are possible
<br>- very interesting side stories
<br>
<br>Then the cons
<br>- 1 use microtransactions
<br>- Day 1 DLC
<br>- **** up mouse controls
<br>- **** up performance
<br>- **** up weapon balance and handling in general
<br>- useless weapons
<br>- dumb AI
<br>- 1 **** Ending only
<br>- your choices in the game doesnt matter at all
<br>- numerous bugs that prevents you from progressing the story
<br>- stealth gameplay gives the highest rewards, people who goes in like rambo wont even get half the points a stealth player gets
<br>- boring story
<br>- boring characters with no depht at all
<br>- unbalanced skills
<br>
<br>and I could go on with that but I would run out of space before Im finished.
<br>
<br>The Pros are obvious. The setting with the conflict between naturals and augmented is highly interesting and well implemented in the game.
<br>You will really feel discriminated by the NPCs in the game.
<br>The city of prague with its many faces and places to discover will invite you to actually use your new skills to find new and hidden spots.
<br>But the crown jewels in this game are the sidequests. Each of them are highly interesting, well written and with possible choices that makes you think of it twice.
<br>
<br>The Cons however drags this game into the hole (too) close to games like Ride to Hell or Mindjack.
<br>The day 1 DLC and the 1 use microtransactions for singleplayer (!!!!!) makes you feel like a cow thats milked by the company. Next thing are probably day 1 single use DLCs which forces you to pay every single time you start a new game. Its like you buy a new car with all the fancy extra things like autopilot, a powerful air conditioner or more comfortable seats. But then you have to pay for it everytime you use them even tough you actually bought the entire car.
<br>
<br>No idea how they managed to **** up the controls and the performance but they did. The mouse sensitivity is a complete disaster. The sensitivity in the game is  complete different than the menu and inventory ones. The mouse sensitivity in the minigames is also a complete different one. And even when you aim down sight the mouse sensitivity suddenly changes making precise shooting hard to impossible.
<br>
<br>The weapons are completely unbalanced. A unarmored and not augmented enemy can eat up to 10 shots from the pistol or 8 shots from the assault rifle but goes down with 1 shot from the battle rifle or the sniper rifle.
<br>The most pointless balance choice are the doors in this game. Each of them can eat more dmg than some of the best armored enemies in the game. And you cant shoot the lock open, you have to deplete the HP bar of the door. Yes! The **** doors in this game have visible HP bars.
<br>This makes the SMG for example completely useless in the game. And you will have to find or buy your ammo yourself. It doesnt matter you are working for Interpol, obviously it was budget cutting time again.
<br>
<br>The performance is shameful, the FPS sometimes will go down to 5  in the batlles and probably kill you more than just 1 time.
<br>The AI is dumber than white bread. Enemies even on the highest difficulty level will only be dangerous trough their superior numbers. FFS these idiots dont even flank you if they have the opportunity.
<br>And the bugs just break what was left of the good stuff.
<br>The most severe I have encountered prevented me from finishing the game and probably even corrupted several of my savefiles. (Google M14 subway crash bug if you want to know more)
<br>
<br>The story in this game is almost generic and your choices during the main quests have no actual consequences.
<br>Example: In 1 mission you have to get past the police to gather some evidence. But even if you dont kill or touch anyone your boss will still **** on you for murdering police officers.
<br>After 3h top you wont give a **** anmore, not even about yourself. The characters in this game are all completely replaceable. Some voices in this game are just cringeworthy.
<br>And the freedom of operating how you want is just an illusion. You will get 20 points, 40 top if you take out an enemy in stealth. But going in loud will reward you only with 20 points for every kill. Plus 10 maybe if you hit his head. At the end of the game stealth players probably will have 1 or 2 levels more than other players.

Seriously dont buy this game. If you do wait 6 months once they fixed the majority of bugs and maybe fixed the performance.
This game wasnt worth 50 bucks. It wasnt even worth the 35 I have paid to my north korean keytrader.

Wait until its like 30 or 25 before you give it a shot.

I would have given this game 4 points but since I can even play the last 25% cause of the said bug it will totaly get 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6669545">Expand</a></span>

<br>Micro transactions are bad enough, but 1 use? For paid digital content that is simply ridiculous I find it hard now to review this game as anything but a scam.
<br>Also putting a shop in the main menu of a single player campaign is just sleazy, how low are Square&apos;s expectations of their customers standards?
<br>Honestly the decent gameplay is just overshadowed by these factors so I stand by the fact that my review is a real statement on the product as a whole.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6661796">Expand</a></span>

<br>The huge issue though is when they try to insert micro-transactions into an offline, single-player game. This isn&apos;t a free-to-play, multiplayer, online game. I purchased it, it&apos;s mine to do with as I want. They messed up on the pre-order DLC and the way it was handled multiple times.
<br>They are far too greedy, the game was already way more expensive, for a mediocre console port, that tries to gouge more money out of you with micro-transactions and paying for non-existent future content.
<br>Save your money, wait a year until it&apos;s on sale, all content is available, and the bugs are fixed.
<br>Never pre-order, never pre-purchase future content that doesn&apos;t exist.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6660638">Expand</a></span>

I could tell from the advertising alone which went from the uplifting, artsy, philosophical, and augmented (heh) reality affair. It was in the aesthetic, which somehow made a modern clothes fashion out of something very Renaissance. It was clever. It was so clever. And everyone still talks about those marvelous ceilings. What really glued the final experience together though was the narrative. Yes, the end was a little weak, but the experience as a whole was worthwhile.
<br>
<br>Mankind Divided, by comparison, is confused and cowardly. The first whiff I got of this was with its advertising campaign, which was decidedly unga bunga to appeal to a low-brow mainstream. I suppose Human Revolution didn&apos;t sell well enough, after all. So this Jensen is dragging his knuckles. It tries to be &apos;relevant&apos; but it does this with base animal mimicry by aping Black Lives Matter instead of telling a story of its own. The comparison of augmentation with racism is disingenuous at best, not because there wouldn&apos;t be prejudice there, but it&apos;s such a gross misunderstanding of the type of prejudice. If they&apos;re trying to form an allegory about the prejudices people face, they need to look at ableism, not racism.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a skeevy, craven little coward in how, unlike Human Revolution, it&apos;s too afraid to say anything about any of the issues it clumsily and ham-fistedly brings up. This is Deus Ex for stupid people. It&apos;s like they took Human Revolution, and fed it through an idiot filter. Out comes Mankind Divided.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s frustrating, because aside from the silly approach to its ending (which I suspect was due to deadlines and money)? Human Revolution was a very intelligent game with so much promise and potential, it was Deus Ex again for a younger audience, and one that hadn&apos;t been intellectually stunted just for the masses. Sadly, we&apos;re at the point now of what I feared Human Revolution would be. I guess it took a sequel for it to happen, and it really is a shame. Money talks more than artistic expression at EIDOS Montreal, I suppose. Which is impression I got from THI4F, too. And this is very much Deus Ex&apos;s THI4F.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6665832">Expand</a></span>

I am a dumba*s for doing this.  I purchased the game because I love Deus Ex so much, and I have not been disappointed.  Although the idea of microtransactions in a single player game is definitely abhorrent, at least they have it designed in such a way that it doesn&apos;t interfere with the experience; it is subtle the way that they did it.  It does take away from the experience but it doesn&apos;t ruin it.  The rest of the game is excellent, considering the way things are these days; it is not complete yet but it will be and I am looking forward to the rest of the story when I complete this one.  It takes a lot of resources to make games these days and I can understand where they need to try and increase income; still I would have preferred that they did not introduce microtransactions.  This issue (which seems to be the main issue being discussed with this title) aside, the rest of the game is top notch.  Sure it has a few wrinkles to iron out but that is normally the case nowadays; I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll get everything fixed.  Having stayed up all night last night enjoying the game and barely scratching the surface because I love to drink in the entire experience, I fully retract my previous idiotic action in reviewing the game before having even looked at it, and give this baby a 9.  The only reason I don&apos;t give it a 10 is because I do respectfully disagree with the idea of microtransactions in a single player game.  Excellent work Eidos, but leave out the transactions from now on, please.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6663940">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story is ok though, nothing unusual, the same bland story that surprise you but does not makes you want to think about it that much. I like to play after work, gets things off my head, really nice.
<br>Gameplay is fine too, it hinerits its predecessor, no big glitches, everything goes smoothly.

<br>Seeing the microtransaction menu piss me off though.
<br>Sure I don&apos;t HAVE to buy some extra Praxis, but I can&apos;t stand the fact that other people will fall for that trap.

<br>I&apos;ve been a Deus Ex fan since day one. I own physical and digital copies of the original. I even own The Fall (for what it&apos;s worth).
<br>
<br>Deus Ex Mankind Divided looks good, feels good, but there&apos;s little else underneath.
<br>You are faced with pivotal decisions...or at least decisions that seem pivotal, but it doesn&apos;t seem to make any difference which you pick.
<br>The story is best told through the live-action trailer, which was just pure excellence. The story in game is vague and there&apos;s no underlying feeling of &quot;mechanical apartheid&quot; other than a sign here and there or a guy checking your papers. More of a minor inconvenience than an impact.
<br>The load screens are abysmal for a game of this spacial size.
<br>All of that, I can still handle since the gameplay is so much fun and so well done, with excellent leveling system, interesting augments, fun weapons and all kinds of different approaches to every area.
<br>
<br>What I cannot handle is an in-game store in an SP game, with once-use items. Regardless of it being used or not, it doesn&apos;t belong there.
<br>The story ends so abruptly that one can only assume it&apos;s to either sell the DLC or to prepare it for a sequel. Problem is that after this experience I have no interest in a sequel. At this stage even Invisible War is more memorable.
<br>In a way it feels like Eidos Montreal tried to succeed and Square Enix tried their best to cash grab.
<br>
<br>Deus Ex Mankind Divided is my biggest gaming buy regret of the year. Proof that pre-ordering really isn&apos;t worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6659703">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Day one DLC and microtransactions in a single player game is another way for game companies to show no respect for gamers wallet, they want every dollar in there and then move on to every dollar in your bank account.
<br>You&apos;ve already payed full price for the game, you should then have access to everything in the game, there should not be a single thing locked behind a payroll.
<br>It&apos;s a disgusting practice and should not be supported, Just for that reason alone is enough to not ever wanting to even look at this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6660192">Expand</a></span>

Totally wooden characters and animations. Performance... is this game running additional stress test program  for cpu and gpu in the background during gamplay? AI... non existent. You can walk inches behing and side enemies and they cant spot you. For comparison ... in 2007 Crysis koreans could spot you from long distance and instantly switch to &quot;go and check&quot; mode. Im a BIG fan of original deus ex for pc and games overall but look.... if we continue to accept this kind of &quot;quality&quot;, make preorders and so on... as a gamers community we will hurt ourseleves very badly. Dont buy, if you bought make a refund... say no to medicority.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6669933">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>#1 Console port features - I understand they wish to hit a larger market and it makes sense to develop it this way, but please don&apos;t shove those console wheel selectors in my face when on a PC. It&apos;s useless and RUDE.
<br>
<br>#2 Augmentations - It&apos;s a little confusing when just starting out, I find lots of people end up asking the same question &quot;How do you disable an augment?&quot;. Some highlighting/arrows would be nice.
<br>
<br>#3 David Sarif - Why did you have to go and change his voice? Even if you had to, could you not find someone who carried a bit more emotions in their voice?
<br>
<br>#4 Apps - Could you not have merged Deus Ex Go with DX Universe? This is just poor development planning, and this is regardless of whether or not the two apps are made by different developers. Work TOGETHER.
<br>
<br>#5 Cut scenes - Skip function please.
<br>
<br>#6 Quick Save - There should be two slots for quick save. No brainer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6660075">Expand</a></span>

Once you get past the shady practices, you&apos;ll find that the game is basically &quot;Deus Ex: Human Revolution 2.0&quot;.
<br>
<br>Like I&apos;ve stated the story is amazing, it&apos;s pretty much everything you&apos;d expect in a Deus ex game which is great for the fans. Sometimes the story does get overwhelming but you catch on eventually, also the story is well thought out, showing characters from previous games (like Morgan Everett which you only see in the first game.) the deus ex universe is coming full circle which is what fans would love to see. But the big difference to the story that it&apos;s different. Instead of focusing on the Illuminati primary. It really focuses on Task force 29 and Jensen which isn&apos;t a bad thing. But for some people they&apos;ll like more Illuminati content.  The choices you make in this game is nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before, before you just play pacfist/non-lethal for the best story outcome but now Mankind Divided is strictly focusing how both actions poses rewards/risks which makes the user think how to approach the situation for the best outcome. Also character interaction is great as well. Every single character you speak to, whether it&apos;s a NPC on the street or an interactable NPC... they have each different things to say which makes it really feel like you, yourself is interaction with real people. Also gameplay is like Human Revolution but they&apos;ve fixed the aiming which was a confusing problem at the last game. Also you have your old augments so you can enjoy the augments from DE: HR. But in Mankind Divided you have a few new awesome augs which you can choose from as well. And they have a interesting way to make augment stacking not too powerful so it&apos;s a fair game in the end. The ending does seem a big cut out... but because we know that the deus ex universe isn&apos;t over, they will probably finish the story with a DLC and with another Deus Ex game so we can expect another game to come out in the next couple of years. Remember, there is still 19 years of Deus Ex lore until we reach Deus Ex 1 so a cliffhanger ending isn&apos;t surprising to me at least, but it&apos;ll be nice to have some closure.
<br>
<br>But the biggest concerns is 2 things, one is the performance issue which occurs in this game, MSAA is broken, with 50% less performance with MSAA you might as well turn it off until Nixxes patches MSAA to be operational in the future. Also in general the game is demanding, I was lucky to run this game on high settings &amp; triple buffering with a 55 fps avg with a r9 280x in prague which is nice. But I feel like the Dawn engine isn&apos;t really optimized because of the fact the game engine is new. And the final problem is the marketing practicing that Enix decided to pull off. Microtransactions for a single player game, that&apos;s a really dumb idea to do, I don&apos;t personally care for microtransactions because I never buy them, but the good thing about the microtransactions isn&apos;t &quot;in your face&quot; so you DON&apos;T have to buy them. I feel like it would have been more acceptable to add microtransactions in the &quot;Breach mode&quot; NOT the single player campaign. Also the season pass is really lacking too, unless if Eidos or Square Enix annouces more content for the season pass... then it feels like a waste of money. If the season pass was 15$... then it would be acceptable for 2 standalone dlcs and a couple of single player &quot;one time usables&quot;.
<br>
<br>All in all, get this game if you are a Deus Ex fan, chances are if you hate the idea of microtransactions and protesting about it, you will still like the game because it&apos;s basically the prefect successor to Human Revolution. If you are expecting a Human revolution clone... then this is the game for you 100%.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6659586">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only real complaints about the game so far are the moderately jerky-feeling animations (this is probably completely subjective), the lipsync which is off at times and the slight mouse acceleration action that&apos;s going on. Other than that I really see no issues with the game.

<br>I didn&apos;t even realize there were microtransactions until people were throwing a fit for no reason. The game gives u so much money and praxis in sp that its not even noticeable. When publishers throw in these things they count on a very very tiny portion of people to even buy these things, not the majority so they don&apos;t design the game around it, just extra money so they can justify new content in breach mode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6660331">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game looks good and runs excellent on a mix of medium and high settings. As for everything else, I could repeat my review from Human Revolution: GREAT soundtrack, complex characters, and even better gameplay this time around. It&apos;s a good time to be a Deus Ex fan.</span>

<br>This is one of the most underwhelming, disappointing, and boring games ever made. The plot of this garbage is unsatisfying and ordinary enough to have been a basic side quest of the first Deus Ex game. None of the characters are interesting, none of them have any depth in this humorless, linear, predictable, and plain world. To add insult to injury there also is no closure in the end; the game has the audacity to conclude in a massive cliffhanger, as if anyone would want to buy the next installment after having experienced this unpleasantness.
<br>
<br>The gameplay itself is childish and offers absolutely no challenges: more than three quarters of all the usable items/weapons/augmentations are unnecessary for a complete playthrough on even the highest difficulties. In retrospect,  the entire game can be beaten in less than 6 hours without killing a single person, not that there are moral consequences or anything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6906212">Expand</a></span>

The story is short, ends with a cliffhanger, and was not all that interesting to begin with (you can certainly tell the developers wanted to sell you a sequel).  The graphics, while beautiful on the surface, is plagued by awkward animations, poor lip syncing, and an otherwise static atmosphere.  The gameplay does not differ much from the game&apos;s predecessor, although slightly more complex.  This complexity can be fun, but can sometimes be tedious as well.

<br>Oh, and there are microtransactions in the game.  To be fair, you don&apos;t really need to purchase anything to have a complete experience (these microtransactions seem more like cheats than anything), but as others have said, it is insulting.
<br>
<br>Avoid purchasing this game at full price.  Instead, wait for a sale if you really want to see what happens after Human Revolution.  If you have money to burn, try last year&apos;s Witcher 3 instead.  That game blows this one out of the water.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6688982">Expand</a></span>

<br>Solid game, however it does not improve enough on the last one (human revolution) especially after making us wait 5 years, it makes you really wonder where the time went, it must have been the engine, as the gameplay is 95% the same and the story is significantly weaker. Get it, but wait until it is on sale.
<br>
<br>Longer version:
<br>The atmosphere and music is top notch as it was in the last game. The story takes a large dive south when compared to Deus Ex and HR. The scope of the game is just so small, the characters are horrifically one dimensional, and the allegories the game attempts to tell are so surface level and ham-fisted you will find yourself laughing at its attempts when you hear or see them (think black lives matter and SJW parallels). It also suffers from the same exact problem HR had, where the game just abruptly ends, with no satisfying conclusion what so ever (and numerous questions left unanswered, sequel bait, please don&apos;t make us wait another 5 years).
<br>The gameplay is exactly the same as the previous incarnation. Either lethal or non-lethal(with total stealth as an option) or any combination of the three. The level design that accompanies this gameplay is a high point as each area you are in has many, many different paths and areas you can stick your head in and explore. If you explore, you will never be short on credits, ammo, or any other item you may need in this game. Downside here is that there are just not many areas. There is only 1 hub city this time around. The other areas you will explore (bank, research facility, slum, etc) are very much &apos;levels&apos;, where you jump in, do what needs to be done, and leave. Some of which you cannot not see again once you leave.
<br>It is obvious this game is a console port, I have heard reports of issues on higher end PC&apos;s not getting the performance they should be getting, however with my i5 2500k showing its age anymore, the performance I got on med-high settings was fine. The UI is not though, with numerous hamstrings put in place (like only being able to hotkey 5 augs), and a very **** slow moving, and clunky map due to the games console roots.
<br>Length wise, the main story clocks in at just over 10 hours, which is short IMO for a AAA 60 dollar game, but average nowadays. The caveat here is that there are numerous, high quality, side quests to find and do, and lots of exploration to be done for flavor text and items. I clocked in at just over 30 hours and I don&apos;t think I missed anything, damn near 100% completion, 90%+ for sure.
<br>Also to add, as people won&apos;t stop crying about it, I really don&apos;t care about this games microtransactons. The only people crying about this haven&apos;t played the game. If you had, you&apos;d realize that, as I said before, with adequate exploration you will never be hurting for credits or items. Praxis? You&apos;ll be fine as well, as long as you don&apos;t expect to be able to unlock every aug, which you shouldn&apos;t in an RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6695198">Expand</a></span>

I mean, bugs can happen, but when they have enough time to implement an ingame store, but skip the testing and quality assurance, then something is very wrong. And there&apos;s no good place to report bugs either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6889380">Expand</a></span>

I mostly enjoyed Deus Ex HR, but literally couldn&apos;t continue this game after trying to enjoy it for 5 hours. I almost never quit games this early, but this is really a trash experience.
<br>
<br>In summary:
<br>
<br>The graphics are mediocre at best. The art design is uninspired and dated. The animations are embarrassingly bad.
<br>
<br>Everything about the movement feels clunky, from the awkward climbing to the weird floaty sprint, to the unsatisfying and fiddly jumping, to the weird and disorienting one-second blackout before any melee combat takedown. Combat is awful. The enemies kill you within seconds if you don&apos;t strictly adhere to cover the whole time, and if you do the game just becomes a mediocre CBS with laughably piddly gun sound effects and uninteresting enemy AI.
<br>
<br>The story is truly pathetic. There&apos;s no real hook, no compelling characters, and the atrocious voice acting strangles an already below-average script.
<br>
<br>The game is littered with terrible design decisions. Making Bioenergy, the resource which lets you do all the things that are almost fun in the game (e.g. punch through walls, use SmartVision, do melee takedowns) a NON-RENEWABLE resource is a truly bizarre decision, meaning you&apos;re constantly walking around with the bare minimum energy, for fear of wasting the few biocells you&apos;ve managed to buy from vendors (who then run out of them entirely). This essentially locks you into a low-power, low-fun mode for the vast majority of the game.
<br>
<br>The game seems to be designed to make you have as unpleasant an experience as possible, mostly by presenting you with either a direct route filled with enemies, or an arbitrary route filled with air vents and demolishable walls. I didn&apos;t feel satisfied or smart once in the 5 hours I played - it doesn&apos;t feel like you&apos;re solving a puzzle when by far the easiest solution is always to just tranquilise everyone from a ledge and watch as they stupidly don&apos;t understand what&apos;s going on.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t even care about the whole DLC/microtransaction issue. This game is just terrible all on its own.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6686836">Expand</a></span>

<br>90% of this game is waiting for the story to start, the last 10% is disappointment that it&apos;s over when it was about to begin.
<br>
<br>Human Revolution had a story that was clear. Characters that had depth. Plots, character archs, conclusions. This game is great as far as the tools from Human Revolution being fleshed out. The scope has been drastically shrunken down. DRASTICALLY smaller feeling than Deus Ex, and Deus Ex HR.
<br>
<br>The game is still better than any non-Deus Ex game, but basing the game on its own merits it falls short story wise. That is a main, actually, it&apos;s THE main part of Deus Ex that sets the series apart from the rest of the plebian games around.
<br>
<br>If you don&apos;t play good games you&apos;ll love this title.
<br>If you&apos;ve played and really liked and held Deus Ex and Deus Ex HR high, then you&apos;ll be left with an empty feeling at the end.

<br>TLDR. 1 hub, unclear stories, unanswered quetions, Microtransaction blindside, and the game ending when it barely felt like it had started. Buy it if you want, but don&apos;t expect to feel whole at the end of it.
<br>
<br>Score Breakdown
<br>If the game was a full game and not 1/2 of a game then it woulds start at a 10 and go down from there depeding on the story quality, depth, logistics.
<br>5/10 for half a game
<br>
<br>Microtransactions in single player game, and a season pass that is a microtransaction with 1 time use items -3
<br>
<br>5 - 3  = 2  potential spoiled by Square Enix splitting dev team into 2 to charge for 2 games instead of 1 whole game.  Followed by forced pay game Breach, and forcing devs to add microtransactions.  Sad day for Deus Ex and the devs whose hard work was spoiled by Square Enix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6686901">Expand</a></span>

<br>I could go on, but I already feel like I&apos;ve wasted enough of my time and money on this game. The issues overshadow any positive aspects the game has. The planned DLC isn&apos;t going to be incorporated into the story and instead will be standalone missions. I was super excited for this game and looked forward to it for 5 years, now I just feel sad to see what Square Enix has done to one of my favorite franchises.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6681456">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;ve played Human Revolution, there is no reason for you to buy this game unless you get it cheap.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>- it&apos;s still Deus Ex, and I liked Human Revolution (but the first part was arguably the best game in the computer games history). If you like sneaking, knocking out enemies (but not killing them), figuring out patrol routes of guards and hiding unconsious bodies in corners, this game will do. Yet Hitman and Thief do these things much better
<br>- graphics are very good, as is the music (very close to Human Revolution)
<br>
<br>The so-so:
<br>- all the &quot;cover&quot; mechanics with tons of messages about what buttons to press - ruins the feel somewhat and makes an impresson this game is made for iPad. In fact you can run around from cover to cover and knock out enemies hardly ever touching the WASD buttons but instead just positioning the cursor, then pressing SPACE to change covers and then finally Q to knock an enemy out.
<br>- the GUI is optimized for consoles, together with the constant 3rd-1st person swtching
<br>- you can now see thru walls, with enemies highlighted in red, and all interactable objects having yellow outline - yes, this makes the game easier but also feels like the game is dumbed down
<br>- the sight range of the enemies is pathetic, and wherever you go they are always with their backs to you by default. Add to that an &quot;invisibility&quot; and &quot;silent walking&quot; augmentations, and this makes a very easy game
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- microtransactions!
<br>- no real progress or anything new compared to Human Revolution
<br>- idiotic, trashy story (btw it was pretty much trash in Human Revolution, too)
<br>- levels are littered with objects, some of them containers, some just trash you can throw around. Also there is just so much junk on the levels that without the &quot;smart&quot; vision you would have hard time seeing enemies. Even moving around isn&apos;t easy without constantly checking the minimap.
<br>- the player&apos;s character does just too much for you: jumps on ramps, pulls himself up etc, all with a single button press. It works like this in console games but feels stupid on PC
<br>- stealth too often means just finding a ventilation shaft, not much imagination in that
<br>
<br>This game is made for console players who have never seen the first Deus Ex. If fans don&apos;t like this, the developer just don&apos;t give a ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6863724">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is full of bugs and terrible hitbox detection, you can see Adam melting into walls and the floor, the animations are poorly done and the executions are lame as **** It does not even look like a true action FPS game. That&apos;s a shame because human revolution was such a good game, the idea is still there but the PC port is just very poorly made. I hope that those microtransactions are not needed to beat the game succesfully, but still, The story is confusing and the characters are boring. The combat mechanics are just not good at all.
<br>I don&apos;t recommend this game, buy only if you are a true deus ex fan.

<br>But what the actual **** is that main story. it is equivalent to human revolutions first chapter. just when you expect things to get serious you fight a random subvilain and BAAAM curtains down.
<br>This is the biggest let down in video games since watch dog.
<br>This game isnt even half a game its just a prequel to some upcoming **** of god know what from dlcs to marketing sequels.
<br>Just call it deus ex - ground zero like the zero they ****ing deserve.
<br>i really can&apos;t understand how people are able to give this game a good rating when this game is nothing but 60dollars stepping stone just look at the last cinematique .
<br>And what the **** do you mean but your choices matter , oh really eliza speak of them  in the news , great i feel 100times more important.
<br>****ty graphics this game isn&apos;t a new gen game , disastrous performance on high spec .
<br>
<br>So let me put this straight in the last five years you spent creating the game you achieved :
<br>-better gameplay
<br>-better sidequests (we are talking about 10 of them)
<br>-moderatly good city hub
<br>
<br>But you failed to upgrade your graphics , create a good story , and finish the ****ing game.
<br>whether you chose not to or you couldnt finish, this is unacceptable.
<br>
<br>i finished this game in 20 hours (all side quests possible and a little of exploration) 5 of these hours spent in the metro with the incredible long wait time to get from zone to zone.
<br>
<br>and i still dont get why they did the 2 districts instead of one exept for boosting the on paper play time.
<br>Plus the marketing scandals of the day 1 dlc , the preorder and mircrotransaction isn&apos;t something that really surprised me , as i&apos;d always know square enix as being first grade **** .
<br>I bought the game +season pass for 70 dollars dont make the same mistake i did , and dont buy this pilot episode</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6668172">Expand</a></span>

<br>- RPG elements of the game are not that well implemented and some of the upgrades are not that useful</span>

<br>-The game was cut to sell DLC&apos;s. The plot ends on the half way, dlc at release day and one more dlc coming this months that was also probably just cut from the game
<br>-Microtransactions
<br>-The game is too short at a result of cutting
<br>-Lack of bosses. Bosses are easily neutralized, are dull and not unique like in Dark Souls.
<br>The good:
<br>Deep atmosphere</span>

This is the feeling I get from this game, Deus Ex has zero innovation in the overall experience.  The game is very short, I did all the side quests, fluffed around exploring and completed the game in 22 hours.  The big issues with this game for me are, the very limited area to explore, it feels very closed off, very linear with more places that can&apos;t be explored than ones that can.

<br>If you have ever been to Prague there is a land mark bridge which you can see in the distance in the game but can&apos;t get to it.  Where is the astronomical clock?  Where is anything that would give me the feel of being in Prague?  The train stations are so small and this is a Major city in Future Europe, and the train stations are so pointless, just walk around, its quicker.  It just feels like a generic city that could be anywhere in Europe, and this is just lazy game design.  The game lacks real atmosphere, I feel HR had better immersion but was way too linear. I played through on the hardest difficulty available and it was too easy, the AI are dumb and praxis kit are plentiful, so much so that I had too many augs by the end.  Everything is just a little to convenient in this game, there just happens to be vents where I need to go but no where else, weakened walls right where I need to go, heavy boxes blocking a path, you guessed it, right where I need to go.  This makes it feel like a dumbed down experience that doesn&apos;t give the player the feeling that they are finding new things in the world, it is so artificial, so closed off and makes the player experience the sense of a mouse trapped in a maze.  Wait till it is about $10 as that is about all it is worth with the very poor game design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6689308">Expand</a></span>

I have played ever Deus Ex since the first, which is one of my favorite all time games. With Mankind Divided, I never felt super gripped by the primary story, and was more interested in the side stories, which were all relatively interesting. I went through with an almost entirely stealthy approach, very rarely killing anyone, and the fact that I could choose that path was pretty cool. The game was fun, and the stealth was pretty good, but I never felt like I was getting more powerful as the game progressed. There are only a couple stealth tools, and I had them all pretty much fully upgraded within the first couple levels, leaving nothing else to look forward to for the remainder of the game. Maybe if I had gone in with a more combat oriented approach I would have had more fun. Overall, I would recommend this game, but I just don&apos;t feel it compares to others in the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6798756">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll support the game and will eventually buy the DLC when it goes on sale...I have higher expectations for Square Enix though, hopefully the next iteration will bring a great story to go with the gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6809502">Expand</a></span>

Oh man what a game that was. When it comes out, i put her on the throne, where my top favorite games where sitting. Then after 5 years it&apos;s come back, and i was incredibly excited, i wanted to dive in that again. But expectations were to high sadly. Mankind devided feels more like a bridge between human revolution and whatever third game gonna call. I am absolutely love how game looks and sounds, the visuals are so awesome, the art and level design are superb, music is great and voice actors also. The gameplay is polish in cool way. I am also like side quests - they are well written and
<br>interesting to play. But story is weak compare to HR and characters also. Game is using microtransactions, also got cut content  from (by the way) main game as dlc s for pay. There are lots of plots never finished and the game finish at nowhere. When i saw words you have unlocked new game +, i was just like WHAT? where are the other half of the game? Its good game, but just it, only good and not gonna put her mark in memory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6857751">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. when after a while you encounter something of a mid-level boss fight like in its predecessor: the game is finally over. Ups!
<br>3. Micro-transactions and small portions of a separate game: no fun. Period. And most of all:
<br>4. no story. Yes, I know, there&apos;s one, but it&apos;s not intense. It&apos;s not DX like. The fate of the world is not to be decided ... There&apos;s nothing that will get your thoughts moving. All in all the story is too easy to see through and doesn&apos;t surprise much.
<br>
<br>DX: MKD has its strong moments. When you can play detective in one side mission (that&apos;s a fresh perspective on Adam Jensen and to the game-play). When you have to decide what to do and which mission not neglect. The graphics and European setting in Prague. That&apos;s nicely done! But will I play it a second time or a third time or forever, like I did with the first and third DX? No. I will un-install it like the second installment of the series.
<br>
<br>It seems, that only the uneven parts of the games are living up to the original. So number five (the next one) should be much better again. Fingers crossed, but I won&apos;t hold my breath.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6709188">Expand</a></span>

<br>After starting the game I am immediatly asked to register with Square Enix to get some free items. The money the publisher tries to grab with the DLC and microtransactions semm to be unsufficient, as they feel the need to sell my data too. I refused and started to play.
<br>After about two minutes into the first mission I discover the first hidden room. Expecting to find a little extra ammo oder something nice I instead find a chip that asks me to install an app on my phone and scan a code to recieve an item. Really, Square Enix?
<br>Needless to say that totally broke immersion, again. As someone who played the original Deus Ex on release I am NOT gonna sit there and play a game that breaks immersion every 30 minutes by asking me to register online, scan some code or buy additional credits with real money.
<br>I refunded the game and I refuse to buy from Square Enix ever again. Shame on you for treating Deus Ex like this and shame on you for treating your full price paying customers like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6666701">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all let me say I&apos;m one of those who didn&apos;t have technical issues on my PC and I&apos;m a huge cyberpunk fan (DeusEx, SystemShock 2 are some of my all time favs).
<br>
<br>Tha being said I absolutely loved Human Revolution, it was a huge step towards right direction. Naturally I expected that MD will improve upon that and those I pre-ordered.
<br>
<br>THE GOOD:
<br>- better action gameplay (if you choose to play it like that)
<br>- Side Quests (some are much better than the main plot)
<br>- improved graphics if you ignore animations
<br>- soundtrack
<br>- improved hacking
<br>- new augs are really cool
<br>- dialogs are more fluid
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>- even tho there are many hidden rooms that you can sneak into, main hub just feels a bit of console oriented and claustrophobic
<br>- that being said, there is only ONE main hub in the game which makes this game feel kind of like Dragon Age 2 compared to Dragon Age: Origins
<br>- very unstable frame rate (even on high end PC-s)
<br>- FOV is a bit to small even on max settings
<br>- weird mouse acceleration
<br>- stealth is not as fluid as before
<br>- STORY and MAIN QUESTS fall rather short if not disappointing
<br>
<br>Overall it is a nicely done SF/CyberPunk world with fun gameplay, some nice quests and great soundtrack. It is also a game that creates much less of an atmosphere compared to HR or DX1, story is really weak, animations and lip sync are bad, there are a lot of technical issues at the moment and the game lacks variety of the world around you (even tho main hub changes a bit over time).
<br>
<br>It&apos;s solid, very good game, but it just doesn&apos;t deliver after much better Human Revolution. Fair 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6667582">Expand</a></span>

This game feels more like an expansion of Human Revolution, than an entirely new game. The atmosphere is disjointed and unimmersive, from a character perspective, yes the lore is there but that is it. This is a far cry from what this game could have been and what I had hoped this game would be. 4 out of 10 for the graphics, the fact that it is Deus Ex which we needed more of but it fails to deliver, anything beyond the 2011 Human revolution, I dare say that HR is still the better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6684511">Expand</a></span>

Are optional. I beat the game on Give Me Deus Ex with lots of praxis and consumables to spare, without touching any of the preorder/DLC items. All you could ever need can be found by exploring and hacking (i.e. actually playing the game).
<br>
<br>With that out of the way, what Deus Ex M.D. brings to the table is a few new augments and a greater plot involvement from the forces behind the scenes of the original 2000 game. However, these are not really enough to freshen the experience considerably. The new toys are fun, the familiar names tie into the narrative, but sticking to old augs and ignoring the plot works just fine.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is still solid with multiple paths to your goal and different methods of achieving it through force or cunning. There are great episodes allowing for creativity and fluid action and then there are big stretches of the game that more or less force the player to do what the designers wanted the player to do in order to see some exposition, denying some obvious logical solution to the problem that would also bypass those stretches of the game.
<br>
<br>The exposition is still somewhat of a problem. The game tends to wrestle control away from the player and show them how Adam walks through a door to engage in a plot-delivering conversation with some character instead of allowing the player to check the door with augmented vision and make their own decision on how to proceed. A few obvious traps are also forcibly ignored. Of course &quot;two guards stand still and wait for Adam to come close before delivering some atmospheric detail through fully voiced dialogue and going their separate ways&quot; is still omnipresent, but these voiced dialogues almost never deliver any important information, which is hidden in personal secretaries and computers instead.
<br>
<br>Prague serving a central hub for the game also results in a frustrating amount of back and forth shuttling between the two districts, especially towards the end of the game, where every side mission will be delivered to you when you&apos;re in the other part of the city and will require at least a couple trips back and forth to get all the objectives.
<br>
<br>Through my entire 30+ hours with it the game only crashed on me once, in the DLC mission, but there were some minor glitches with interaction controls not working until a game is reloaded. The graphics and performance are quite satisfactory.
<br>
<br>Why an 8/10 for a game with &quot;more of the same, but more accessible&quot; as its driving force? Nostalgia, I guess. However small, Deus Ex M. D. is still a chapter in the universe even if it&apos;s filler.
<br>
<br>P.S.: Breach does not seem like an overly interesting game mode. It&apos;s different enough from the main game but too much of an F2P experience with random booster packs and single use modifier cards. Maybe that&apos;s where the &quot;we all hate microtransactions&quot; part comes in, but let&apos;s be realistic - nobody bought this game for Breach.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6670187">Expand</a></span>

<br>First up, Value for money.
<br>
<br>It definitely fails my &#xA3;1 per hour of gameplay = true value of the game, test. The game costs &#xA3;40 but is only 25 hours long. However, fans of this kind of game will definitely play it more than once so for them it would be good value for money.
<br>
<br>Plot
<br>
<br>The plot for this game clearly takes place some time before Deus Ex 1 and references many NPCs that later appear in the Original game.
<br>
<br>Unlike normal presequels this is rather well done and builds up the backstory for the original leaving you wanting to load up Deus Ex 1 right after finishing Mankind Divided.... but that 20 minute credit list spoils that moment.
<br>
<br>Unlike Human Envolution, this game does take the original DX1 plot alot further than just argumentations. I could ignore Dx Invisible War (which is a farce) and even DX Human Evolution and just play Mankind Divided and then Deus Ex 1 and not feel like I missed anything vital.
<br>
<br>However i recommend ignoring Deus Ex Invisible war, it really is a terrible game and starting with Human Evolution, then Mankind Divided and finally at this point... Deus Ex 1...
<br>
<br>I suspect there will be another game made to fit between Mankind Divided and DX1, it feels like it but I am hoping for a DX1 remake at some point now they have perfected the gameplay and level designs.
<br>
<br>The DX1 camparision.
<br>
<br>All previous Deus Ex sequels failed to meet Deus Ex 1s standards in some way. DX Invisible war was just farce and I like to pretend it simply does not exist. DX Human Evolution got the core game play right and improved on it, but the levels let it down.
<br>
<br>Because of that, DX fans had gotten used to Deus Ex sequels not living up to the original.
<br>
<br>So what made the original so great ?
<br>
<br>Well, lots of choice, gun ho, none lethal, hacker... you could choose how you played the game, though it nearly always ended as a gun fight in the end. Lots of great levels too, my personal favourite was Hong Kong in the original and I still recommned players play the original even today.
<br>
<br>How does Deus Ex Mankind divided compare to that classic ?
<br>
<br>Honestly... it completely blows it away in every single area.
<br>
<br>Seriousy, this game beats the original Deus EX 1 hands down.
<br>
<br>Its levels are better, the characters are better, the choices work all the way through the game and not just in the first half of the game. There are very real consiquences for the choices you make so you cannot have your cake and eat it, you have to choose a path thats constantly changing and giving you more options on how to proceed.
<br>
<br>I for example took the none lethal approach but at times I just had to load up my shot gun and go gun ho because some levels, whilst possible to complete as a none lethal player, where far easier to complete with a shot gun in my hand.
<br>
<br>Others where easy to complete in a none lethal manner, so using weapons made it harder to win.
<br>
<br>In the end a combination of skills proved best, though the game fully supported all the choices I chose and was very well balanced.
<br>
<br>I played though the game on what appeared to be a fairly normal difficulty and had no real problems once I realised most boss fights had the solution to the boss on the level with the boss. You just have to go and search.
<br>
<br>I especially liked the last boss fight which I finished with a sneaky hack.... so do not think you have to Go Ho it.... you dont.... go searching.... you will be surprised :)
<br>
<br>The Original Deus Ex did not do this in the last half of the game, it was a pure shooter by then.
<br>
<br>Even ammo vs enemies matters, some enemies cannot easily be tranquilised, others needed emp ammo to stun them to give you a chance to destroy them with conventional ammo without being shot dead your self. The none lethal take down does not work all the time either and some enemies need multiple tranqs to drop.
<br>
<br>Then we have Breach, a game that is included in Mankind Divided. You can find Breach levels through out the Mankind Divided game and unlock more of Breach at Mankind Divided&apos;s main menu.

Breach is separate from Mankind Divided but part of it, rather complicated to explain and I may have gotten the details wrong here but this is called going the extra mile and counts as one of several extra miles the devs went in this game.

You can also find triangles that you scan with your phone to unlock things in the phone game, not something that interests me but still cool.

By only playing the game itself and doing side quests I had so many praxis kits I did not even know where to put them in the end. If people say this game feels grindy, they outright lie. It is possible that if you do not do side quests, you might lack on praxis, but that was the same in DX:HR and it totally intended. Side quests reward you for doing them,
<br>
<br>This is a SP game, if it does not interfere with your own game (aka, makes it harder for you to play) why are you so butthurt about people putting additional money in the game (and yes, they make it pointlessly easy for themselves, but once again how does that affect you?)
<br>
<br>Now for the actual game itself, I loved every second of it, I loved Prague (for me it was a bonus point considering I live in it, and hearing all the Czech lines which were actually quite hilarious - feel kind of sad that other players couldn&apos;t understand them], the game is amazingly optimized {I played it on 6 years old Phenom II X4 965 BE CPU and ran it on medium settings like a champ).
<br>
<br>The gameplay itself is amazing, my first play was stealth and the game absolutely supports it. Will try more FPSish on newgame+
<br>
<br>The game will lose one point for the story ending. The story itself is absolutely enjoyable but it is true that the end of the game leaves too many questions unanswered.
<br>
<br>Summary:
<br>Playtime: 27 hours
<br>
<br>+ gameplay
<br>+ optimisation
<br>+ graphics
<br>+ Prague settings and mechanical apartheid feel
<br>+ side missions
<br>+ Elias Toufexis&apos; voice being awesome as usual
<br>
<br>- story ending (too cliffhangerish)
<br>- David Sarif having new voice (but considering that is not their fault, that is a very tiny -)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6670499">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Major performance issues.
<br>- Denuvo.
<br>- Day one DLCs.
<br>- Microtransactions (if it wasn&apos;t insulting enough, they&apos;re single use transactions!)
<br>- Bland story.
<br>- Grindy feel to the game (hence the microtransactions).</span>

I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll fix a lot of these issues, and it will be a solid game in time; but as it is now: try before you buy......Oh wait, it has Denuvo as well; so just don&apos;t buy it ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6661842">Expand</a></span>

<br>People are complaining about 2 things mostly:

<br>1. Bad optimization
<br>
<br>- I didn&apos;t find this was an issue. I had smooth 60 FPS most of the time with GTX 1080, 16 GB of RAM and i7-2600K. I did however turn off MSAA set shadows to High instead of Very high. People probably try to set everything to Ultra on their GTX 770 and then complain that it can&apos;t run.
<br>
<br>2. Microtransactions
<br>
<br>I never made a Square Enix account and was never prompted with any microtransactions so this didn&apos;t affect my experience.
<br>
<br>My only complaint excluding the story would be the multiplayer mode Breach. From their marketing I figured out it was an actual multiplayer mode where players fight each other using Deus Ex gameplay. But when I tried it I realized it was a Single player mode with Online leaderboards. Not realy multiplayer in my book. But Deus Ex for me is not a multiplayer experience so I don&apos;t really care it sucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6674702">Expand</a></span>

I am a stealth gamer at heart and I always try to go the stealth route when playing pretty much any game that&apos;s not just a straight up shooter like Halo. Mankind Divided disappointed me however as it made me a stealth God and I&apos;m sure its the same if you were going in shooting everything as well. While I love the gameplay, even on the hardest difficultly level, the game was way too easy. I only died a handful of times and that was mostly to some trial and error parts of the game.
<br>I can sorta forgive easy gameplay but not a bland story. The ending of the first game, and I mean the very end where you select what to do to give you one of 3 choices, might as well have never happened. From the end of the 1st game to the beginning of the second, there&apos;s quite a bit of down time that&apos;s not very well explained and the devs should have spent more time on what exactly happened. But beyond that, the main story of this game was majorly bland. The open world that came with it was decent but a bit too claustrophobic and it seemed like they were more interested in finding ways to connect buildings with some sort of duct or sewer then building a world that was in-depth. It&apos;s not the worst I&apos;ve ever seen but it could have used alot of work to make it better.
<br>All of this goes along with the massive framerate issues I had and the multiple crashes I suffered while playing the game. Now having properly set up for a 3rd game, it felt like the developers were stuck with the ending of the first game and tried their best to make it work with a very clear idea of what was going on in the story. I don&apos;t exactly agree with half of the stuff that was being implied by what was going on but I can give them credit for trying to tie the game into some of the social problems our society faces in real life.
<br>In the end, I would say I had fun with the game but it&apos;s nowhere near as good as the first one. Lots of unexplained questions, lots of characters that were clearly just in the game to introduce them for the next one, and the poor marketing campaign that Squeenix did for it, leaves me wanting more. They definitely have alot of ground to cover for the 3rd game but the basics of a great game as still there. They just really need to get away with some of the design choices from this one when they do that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6672533">Expand</a></span>

At the writing of this review, in fact the day of the review, a patch is finally out that has alleviated some of the technical issues.  The game would suffer from huge drops in FPS, from 60 to 7 or 8 with no warning or apparent reason, forcing you to quit and restart and in some cases even completely rebooting your PC to resolve memory leaks.  Despite these technical issues, Mankind Divided is a great Deus Ex Game .  For those who are saying its short they are robbing themselves of the full experience - you really should do all of the side quests and take your time, explore and drink in everything that the game has to offer and you will be playing upwards of 40 plus hours - I played for over 60 hours and loved every minute of it.  Had it launched without the technical issues this game would have easily scored a 9 for me.
<br>
<br>TLDNR: If you like great tactical stealth/combat games, you will love this game.  If you want to run and gun, you should look elsewhere.  Otherwise this is well worth your time and your money in my opinion.
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS:  Beautiful game to look at, very immersive (when not plagued by the technical issues).with the exception of HORRIBLE CLIPPING ERRORS.  Jensen&apos;s face, neck and hair would constantly clip through his collar and that drove me insane - very immersion breaking and odd looking.
<br>
<br>SOUNDTRACK: Awesome score that is well orchestrated and adds tons to the atmosphere.
<br>
<br>SOUND: Excellent sound effects and source to reception recognition, which is very important in stealth and tactic oriented games.
<br>
<br>LEVEL DESIGN: Excellent level design with multiple paths and approaches to every mission including all side missions.
<br>
<br>GAME PLAY: Excellent controls that can be reassigned, good shooting mechanics, excellent stealth mechanics and a lot of player choice and it avoids the use of &quot;boss&quot; battles that were a bit of a hinderance to Human Revolution.  Just simply a great game to play.
<br>
<br>If you like RPG atmospheric cyberpunk stealth shooters you should absolutely play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6675966">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m about 30 hours in to my first play-through and so far it hasn&apos;t been a &quot;pay to win&quot; experience, nor have I had any crashes/performance issues.  It&apos;s been an enjoyable game, maybe not fun as the original DE or DE/HR, but still a good DE experience that I plan to play through more than once, so it&apos;s worth it to me.
<br>
<br>I will agree with the few that complain that the story is pretty unforgettable - I get the sense that there are sequels planned in the future that will expand on the story and hopefully give it more depth.  Don&apos;t buy in to all the crying about micro-transactions though:  I&apos;m playing through on the game&apos;s &quot;hard&quot; difficulty in stealth mode and can easily maintain a surplus of Praxis Points (the points you use to buy/improve skills).  I&apos;ll try it in more of a shooter/combat heavy mode next play-through and will update my review if that changes things.
<br>
<br>As in past DE games, you can discover many options for completing your missions.  Hacking, sneaking (my God they make very large and sturdy ducts in the DE universe!), parkour-ing your way around obstacles - there is always an option.
<br>
<br>Inventory space is still very limited, but not to the point where I feel that I can&apos;t carry everything I need to succeed - just enough to wish I had more space to care more things that I&apos;d just sell later.  But since money seems abundant (since I rob every carport, safe and drawer I can open), this isn&apos;t a huge issue.
<br>
<br>The graphics are average - the characters all look like they&apos;re wearing too much makeup or something.  The environments are nice to look at though; they did a great job imagining a near-future Prague, and many of the areas within.  The sound/voice acting is above average - convincing accents and emotions, certainly nothing immersion-breaking there..  I haven&apos;t had a single performance issue yet so I don&apos;t agree that this is a &quot;bad port&quot;.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d say my true score would be 8 of 10, but to compensate for the whiners I&apos;m adjusting it up to 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6672889">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Clunky, console style, stiff gameplay shooting mechanics
<br>- A complete festering pile of garbage compared to how awesome Human Revolution was
<br>- Ridiculous, nonsensical inventory that is a frustrating mess
<br>- It feels like playing a really bad, amateur Doom clone from the early 1990&apos;s when it comes to the gameplay.
<br>- The people who made this game absolutely cannot be the same people who made Human Revolution. It&apos;s like somebody claiming they made the rarest, most beautiful diamond in the world (Human Revolution), and then saying they made Mankind Divided (A pile of festering horse manure)
<br>- Ugly out of date graphics that still cause a slugfest framerate in even high end Rig.
<br>
<br>Eidos. Please sack every person on this design team. They have completely lost the plot. Not one single element of this abomination resembles Deus Ex in any way. It&apos;s like they sat down and decided to make the worst game ever, &quot;Hey let&apos;s take a beloved franchise and make a hackjob, consolitis fest that will be sure to anger every PC gamer, from the horrid mouse control to the clunky, consolitis gameplay. Because we all want to get sacked for bad gameplay design.&quot;
<br>
<br>I despised Invisible War, but even that is immensely superior to this epic failure of a game.
<br>
<br>Thank god for Steam refunds. Thank god for all the negative reviews. Only the negative reviews are accurate. This game is vomit trash garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6731197">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-i hear people saying the graphics aren&apos;t  impressive and i just gotta ask what the hell are you smoking? The game looks abosolutely beautiful. The enviroments in Prague look incredibly detailed to the core. Sure it&apos;s not Destiny level of impressive but it more then gets the job done.
<br>-the story all though it can get convoluted at times is pretty good. It continues the story from human Revolution marvelously without it feeling out of place
<br>-the gameplay is basically human revolution 2.0 and if you liked the gameplay from human Revolution (like me) then this is right up your alley. But sadly there&apos;s a big downfall to this game
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-the microtransactions. Everybody loves them right. But the thing that completely destroys this is that the microtransactions are in the singleplayer!!! WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKKK!!!!!! ARE YOU **** KIDDING ME!!!!! granted you can play without them but it&apos;s still crummy as **** oh and btw even if you bought the microtransactions you only get them for 1 save. once you make a new one or overwrite the save it&apos;s gone. Come on Square,come on!
<br>
<br>In conclusion if the microtransactions weren&apos;t present this game would&apos;ve scored a 7/10 from me but that greedy practise ruined it. If you can get past that bull**** and if you liked Human revolution then by all means go and get it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6665949">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it is that great.
<br>
<br>If you have not played the 2011 one, i`ll bet my life you will want one after playing the Mankind Divided (2016), because you will never get enough of the cyberpunk-themed story and all those event surrounding Adam Jensen (the Protagonist of Deus Ex 2011 and 2016), ESPECIALLY the 2011 one because it tells the first story of why Adam Jensen was augmented, he never asked for this (pun intended).
<br>
<br>Do not trust all those Negative Reviews, I played Deus Ex since the JC Denton era (the FIRST Deus Ex in year 2000) and i can safely say that the Deus Ex Mankind Divided (2016) and Deus Ex Human Revolution (2011) are a great PREQUEL to the Deus Ex year 2000 and both deserves to be great games in their own rights.
<br>
<br>If you are cyberpunk-themed movie, games, or artwork fans, you OWE YOURSELF to play Deus Ex Mankind Divided!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6675798">Expand</a></span>

It is possible to complete the game without killing ANYBODY (even the final boss can be taken down non-lethally), yes.  There are microtransactions, yes, but guess what?  YOU DO NOT NEED THEM.  Forget about microtransactions in this game.

<br>If you like the last Deus Ex, if you like stealth gameplay, if you like convoluted and difficult to follow plotlines, if you like any of that even just a little then you&apos;ll like this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-mankind-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=6672129">Expand</a></span>
