<br>Even if we are kind and ignore the plague of technical issues that this game shipped with (I only experienced the mouse issue and enabling vsync fixed it for me) this is still a terrible game.
<br>The graphics are simply dire: no shadows, no reflections, muddy textures and extremely low detail all throughout - it loks like a DX8 game.  Running this at max details I get a very high frame rate (though it constantly bombs up and down for no reason) and it looks like a game from 10 years ago.  It is a flat, boring, featureless world.
<br>The controls are vague and fairly unresponsive and generally you never really feel as though you are in control of the (utterly hateful and idiotic) protagonist.  He is happy to bomb around, doing as he pleases, attacking what he wants, jumping where he fancies and generally ignoring the hell out of you while you miss target after target, normally as arbitrary and pointless countdowns expire meaning you fail the mission.
<br>The one thing I could have noted as a good point for this game is the ability to save whenever you like, rather than the usual console auto-save nonsense, but even that is broken.  Saving produces a pointless replica of the previous auto-save, utterly ignoring anything you did since.
<br>Even if all the technical issues are fixed, the graphics will remain far below par (even for an xbox game), the port will remain horrible and utterly bereft of care and attention and the story line will be pallid and uninteresting.  Do yourself a favour and install the first game - you&apos;ll be a lot happier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2547632">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Today steam unlocked Prototype 2 and having pre-loaded it I quickly launched it on my default computer. An Intel Core I7-3770, dual ATI 6990&apos;s, and 8GB of ram on a 64-bit Windows 7 system. The game would not start with all 4 graphics cards enabled (the 6990 is a dual-gpu card). As such I had to disable down to one card. I game on three 30&quot; HP LP3065 monitors each running a resolution of 2560x1600. Prototype 2 does not even SUPPORT 2560x1600 and as such I&apos;m forced to run at a non-native resolution of 1920x1200. With the single ati 6990 (the others are disabled using Radeon Pro) the game stutters and chugs. All of the &quot;in engine&quot; cut scenes are unwatchable due to the fact I&apos;m getting 3 to 5 FPS according to the built in Radeon Pro fps counter. In play, the game behaves better but if I attempt to turn a quick 180 the game will either crash or it will lockup for a few moments and then continue on normally. While the 6990 isn&apos;t bleeding edge anymore its the equivalent of an ATI 6970 and shouldn&apos;t have these kinds of problems. From the 65 minutes that I&apos;ve played Prototype 2 feels identical to Prototype. I honestly wish I could give a more in depth review but at this point I can&apos;t even play the game. I know, this might read as a rant but if you&apos;re running a crossfire configuration, a 2560x1600 resolution, or didn&apos;t care for the first Prototype I would recommend avoiding this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2540370">Expand</a></span>

<br>Although there&apos;s a difference in focus and scope, Prototype 2 grows on its predecessor&apos;s stealth and guerrilla tactics. Graphics are OK, and just like Prototype 1, the amount of cutscenes, memories and missions is astounding. The character upgrades really make you feel like a super-powered badass, but most importantly, this game allows you to hunt your target, put yourself into position, drop in, take your target, and disappear by blending into the chaos. This is particularly where this game shines in comparison with other games on its category, and especially with the AC saga, thanks to an accessible and fun system that allows for almost total freedom in  mission execution: not to mention collectibles that actually DO SOMETHING for the character, instead of being just another counter in your HUD to fill. No need to take a given path, no need to just smash on your &quot;riposte&quot; button until you go numb. On that respect, keyboard controls are poorly implemented and kinda suck. Not game-breaking, but can get kinda annoying.
<br>
<br>Game worked perfectly in an i7 3770, 8GB RAM DDR3, GeForce 650 2GB DDR5. If it doesn&apos;t work in your next-gen &#xFC;ber computer... well, try without running it on crossfired dual-proc graphics card, you goddamn moron.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3418256">Expand</a></span>

<br>Technical specs aside, how you felt about this one compared to the first aside, and any possible bias towards Activision out the window; this game is essentially a mature renovation of a spider-man game. Same extensively repetitive button mashing, same endless and stale side quests, generic &quot;your the good guy but actually the bad guy too&quot; plot wherein being good/evil doesn&apos;t decide anything game changing. Bottom line, it feels like this game is 4-5 others mashed up together into an excuse for a sequel. Replay-ability is 0, and the story line is forgettable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2878065">Expand</a></span>

Also the combat was pretty good, especially liked the battles with the giant monsters, there is a real feeling of superiority every time but you still need to put the right moves together which made for a strangely stress-less gaming experience.  The length is just right for me, i was getting a little tired of the generic missions so i stopped doing the altogether after a bit and just rushed the main story. So i don&apos;t know, this game has very good gameplay and looks very good, but has a very poor story and non-existant replayability. But still it was more or less enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2577522">Expand</a></span>

<br>Personally, i think its really fun. You basically have unlimited power and few like a semi-god running around new york. Free roaming and some repetitive side missions, but very rewarding. The story is bad and does not let you relate to any character (because you play both &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; guys), but the main missions are usually fun and the fact that your powers make you feel like you could kill superman with a click of your fingers compensate to all that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2841485">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As far as graphics go, they are EXACTLY the same as the first one..... Gameplay is a 7-8, but I have to dock it for being so lazy
<br>

At least one main story mission is broken for a lot of people, stopping any progression at all.  Way, way, WAY too many &quot;challenges&quot; for the kiddies to stroke their e-peens on.  Seems like most of the game IS challenges now, with very little story, and nothing to do on the side except try for gold medals and the best time among your friends.  I loved Prototype I and expected far more from the sequel at the price they charged.  Unfortunately it fails on almost every level with a dull thud.  Wait for more PC reviews and/or gameplay videos on YouTube before buying this disaster, or just pick it up when it is on sale.  Note to Activision and the now-defunct development team: PC gamers expect more than e-peen stroking and bland gameplay ported from a console.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2541605">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. Heller (the main new character) is one of&#xFEFF; the most overdone and stereotyped black man in video games. 2. Ruined the story of Prototype 1- no conspiracy-ex- Pariah, Greene, etc. 3. HEY KILLED OFF MERCER FOR NO REASON.</span>

If you&apos;re not that big of a frames per second critic then you&apos;ll hardly notice the bad fps during all this awesomeness</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2548337">Expand</a></span>

It could have had a great story that sucks you in, but that&apos;s not the case. The story is boring and the only thing you&apos;ll want to do while watching a cut scene is to make it stop so you can go back to destroying sh*t. If you enjoy that, then maybe you&apos;ll like the game, but I got bored after 1 hour of gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2697192">Expand</a></span>

Run up walls, jump 15 meters, glide through the air, rip tanks apart with your hands, thanks YET ****ING AGAIN TO A MAGICAL VIRUS! Story is just uninteresting, mainly due to the poor writing, as it consists purely of cliches and a common profanity after every 3 words. This silly game feels unfinished and was entertaining for about an hour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2936728">Expand</a></span>

However if you level up too fast, like I did, the gameplay can become very bland before you reach the third island (red zone). I didn&apos;t do this on purpose, I just thought I need the extra power and did all side missions before the main missions. The dialogues between Blackwatch and Heller are extremely amusing some times, this helps not getting to worked up about the mediocre AI. You can even turn your enemies into living bombs, but they wont get alarmed if you do that in disguise (poke a sting in the back of the neck of an enemy). Most of your actions won&apos;t cause any counteraction by your enemies. Hell, even the pedestrians are smarter: They get distressed and panic when you act strange. Took the time to do side and main missions and finished just after about 12 hours with 95%. That&apos;s a good bang for your bucks if you can get it cheap. Once you&apos;re finished there&apos;s freeroam mode wich gets boring real fast. The activities and side missions can be replayed, but they are less fun that the core game. Almost every important character is an infected (called evolved) which is annoying after a while. The consolized controls and low-res textures however ruin everything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2541210">Expand</a></span>

The only thing about the satisfyingly gory gameplay is that it can be a bit repetetive when you think of it as &quot;do mission - cutscene - run there - cutscene - end mission - cutscene - run somewhere else - repeat&quot;. Of course, like every other PC game this year, from a technical point of view, it&apos;s terrible. The game has broken mouse support, I played through it with a PS3 controller. I found, although i amlucky enough to be able to play the game, that after every 30 mins or so my frame rate had slowly dropped to such an unplayable level I would have to quit the game and restart whatever mission i was playing - the game has an obvious memory leak.
<br>
<br>Aside from the now common problems that PC users face with cheap, rushed, console ports, (even though this game was delayed for 2 months or so) if you can see past these problems, the game itself is quite good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544645">Expand</a></span>

I do not feel that the technical issues with Prototype 2 are centered around people with high end computers, however, as I, and many of my friends have high end equipment. It seems to me as though there are technical difficulties within the software launch that users are experiencing across the board. Although this is a terrible thing to see, I don&apos;t think it can be condoned that users simply come and spam 0&apos;s for such a great game. That is why I appreciate your honesty in giving the game a realistic score and a separate score if it did not have the primary launch software issues. As for the game itself, I think @Dudda has an excellent review. After being on the second play through of the game, still no technical difficulties what so ever--call me lucky I guess, I still find the primary storyline interesting. However, I&apos;m not going to try and fool anyone, you shouldn&apos;t buy Prototype 2 for the storyline. If you instead want to feel like a completely badass, indestructible beast, that can scale an entire skyscraper in a single bound and probably give the Hulk a run for his money, than yeah I would totally buy this game. As for any consumers that are worried about purchasing a game that may turn out as some of these users are experiencing, wait a bit. Because on my end the game runs perfectly, so I&apos;m sure there will be a software patch out soon that will fix any lingering issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2540833">Expand</a></span>

The new protagonist falls flat, and the missions quickly grow as repetitive as in the first. Although some attempt has been made to inject more flavour to the missions to make them feel slightly more varied and more linked to the overarching story, they still feel like hollow padding for additional stats. I would see this game as a typical high-budget romp, only the technical issues from the first remain. Many confuse these technical issues as a mere matter of PC strength, yet for reference my system is quite stable and capable of running Crysis 2 and Skyrim on high settings at a solid framerate. No, these technical issues run deeper. For many, the game generates gradually worsening performance lag akin to a memory leak, just as the first game did. The longer the play session, the more severe the performance is hit. Others have to search for fixes just to open the game or to enable sound. Once again, the developer has shown complete disinterest for those in the &apos;dead spot&apos; between fixes, either unable or unwilling to ensure full compatibility for their port. Some of the official fixes being listed as &quot;disconnect your keyboard and mouse for the duration of your play-session&quot; or &quot;manually overclock your graphics card to factory default settings&quot;. It is worth noting that the port of the original Prototype game had similar issues, that were mostly resolved by deleting a sound pack of ambient sounds of all things. After struggling against the issues until halfway into the game, I found an unusual work-around in simply alt-tabbing out for a moment or two, which seemed to calm the progressive lag. No, it wasn&apos;t a heat issue on either my CPU or my GPU, I checked. Then finally, when I pushed through to the ending, I was faced with a blank screen. The game decided to feed me the ending as audio-only. At this point I was no longer phased. I almost expected it.
<br>
<br>The game content itself is squandered potential, but provides a mediocre &apos;high budget&apos; affair minus the fine polish. Chock full of typical annoying boss-fights, in-plain-view &apos;stealth&apos; moments, character tropes and stat chasing. The novelty wears off fast. Purchasing this game is a giant gamble on simply being able to play, and that alone is a sad statement for PC gaming, when the number of discontented customers is so easily swept under the carpet. Your customer base is not a disposable team of bugfixers, youtube is not a valid way of showing the ending, and telling people to butcher their settings isn&apos;t really a &apos;fix&apos; to your product, y&apos;know? Score heavily influenced by technical issues, though had there been none, I feel it would have only earned something in the region of a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2987499">Expand</a></span>

Turns out, it was that bad. Frame rate stutters often at the most random intervals when the graphics is turned on high, and even when the setting is high, the game still looks like something out of 2005. The buildings looks as if they were copy and paste, and the whole city feels artificial, lacking in any kind of feeling or personality. This, unfortunately, complements the artificial story. Even in the beginning of the game, the player is left wondering how Heller was able to completely overcome his hatred of Mercer so quickly.
<br>On top of this, the gameplay sucks pretty bad as well. Why is it that while sprinting, a shockwave pulses out from your character, and it is completely ignored by the patroling soldiers. And why allow people to pick up the plentiful guns if the game lacks any kind of free-aiming? Plus, how is your character able to jump into the air and flying jump kick a helicopter 50 meters away? Things like this make the game feel as if it is some low budget knockoff of some generic superhero story.

<br>
<br>The plot is completely an excuse one and the protagonist is extra stupid with a side of macho man pain, which really lowers the amount of care given.
<br>
<br>The graphics are rather outdated, too. With no real innovation and a reduced array of fun activities this might be worth buying at a sale but only if you&apos;ve completed over 90% of the original and desperately want to see a couple new enemy types.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3904083">Expand</a></span>

<br>Good things? Some new features compared to the first one like tearing miniguns of choppers.
<br>Not recommended for fans of Prototype 1 but for those who want action-packed game on their screens and don&apos;t want to get first one yeah go for it it gets 6/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3843866">Expand</a></span>

I actually thought it was a pretty decent game. The powers are fantastic and otherworldly, and by the end of the game I wanted those powers myself. The minigames were quite fun too. Travelling around the city didn&apos;t feel like a chore, as you can run at race car speeds and jump over any obstacle in your way. It was actually quite fun just pressing the sprint button and seeing what will happen. This game makes you feel like a serious bad ass.
<br>There were a couple downsides. Graphics are just mediocre, and the story was dull. In fact, the story felt kind of nonexistent. The game felt more like an open world experience, with the story sort of like the main minigame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3096438">Expand</a></span>

<br>Apart from the negatives, this game is very entertaining. If I would rate it on the console I&apos;d give it a solid 7 for it&apos;s (not so well written but) interesting story, mind-blowing non-stop slaughter action and it&apos;s very efficient way of letting you roam the streets and rooftops of New York .

I liked the game, but two times was enough for me. After a while, Prototype 2 came out, and I suddenly remembered how much fun it was to plow through crowds of standard sods and military personnel alike. Needless to say, I was very excited. But also very broke. So I put off playing this game. Not too long ago, however, this game appeared on the Steam Summer Sale for 5 euros. I bought it without a second&apos;s hesitation. I was very excited.
<br>
<br>So now for the fun part: it didn&apos;t work. The game would start up, show me the first developer logo, and then freeze, so that I had to manually kill the process. I&apos;ve googled the problem, still optimistic, hoping for a quick and easy solution. What I found instead was a literal tome of complaints, bugs, glitches, issues and other nasty stuff. I dug and dug the google search results for days on end, and didn&apos;t find any solution to my problem. At this point in time, mind you, the game was already out for more than a year.
<br>
<br>After a week or so, I managed to find a solution, and even posted it on Steam forums, in case it could help someone. But then I stumbled upon another set of problems: abhorrent lag and graphical issues. Those two were easier to fix, but at a great cost. I had no other choice than to use a third party program to cap my game at 30 FPS (!), while on my machine, it should be running at atleast 100. Also, I had to restart it every hour or so, so the lag wouldn&apos;t come back.
<br>
<br>Apparently, the issue was my graphics card. The devs were very kind to nVidia users, optimizing their game to those cards. If you have an ATI though, you are truly, for lack of a better word, **** This port is HORRIBLE. It has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. Textures are rendered at half resolution, the options menu is lackluster to say the least, the framerate skips and jumps on ATI&apos;s, and is locked to 30 from what I read on nVidia&apos;s. All in all, absolutely revolting port.
<br>
<br>But, me being a fan of the first game, I managed to live with all the problems, and found the game itself quite good. The gameplay is fun, the story is not half bad, and there are a few new additions to the gameplay. Overall, it&apos;s an improvement on the first game.
<br>
<br>So, long story short. If you own an ATI card, don&apos;t buy it. If you want it to look and run well on the PC, don&apos;t buy it. If you don&apos;t want a headache from having to deal with all the problems, don&apos;t buy it. If you don&apos;t care, are willing to persevere just to play it at mediocre settings and graphical fidelity, give it a try. The game is good, the port is **** terrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4378315">Expand</a></span>
