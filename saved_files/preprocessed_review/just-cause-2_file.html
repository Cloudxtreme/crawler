The fun to Just Cause 2 is how open it is and what all it provides for you to do. Yes, if you focus solely on collecting the stupid collectables, you will get bored (it does get pretty boring) but you don&apos;t have to do that, nor do you have to focus solely on the missions. The main point to Just Cause 2 is to &quot;cause chaos,&quot; a seemingly cliche way to tell the player to do whatever the heck they want to blow stuff up and have fun to progress to further missions. I&apos;ve played over 150 hours and still found new, fun things to mess around with, the most recent being grappling a truck to a helicopter and swinging it around to the speed that it starts swinging my helicopter around. Basically, it comes down to this: If you&apos;re into games that push you (the player) to make decisions about how you want to play the game and to make the game fun and unique to you (whether you fast travel everywhere, drive and take in the gorgeous sights, or hijack helicopters and fly everywhere), you will enjoy this game. If you enjoy open world exploration and the freedom to try crazy ridiculous stuff, you&apos;ll enjoy this game.
<br>However, if you&apos;re looking for a strict, linear, engaging story telling experience, you probably won&apos;t enjoy this game. If you&apos;re looking for a realistic portrayal of physics and gunplay, you probably won&apos;t enjoy this game.
<br>Personally, I find the game&apos;s story to be absurd and insane -- which I feel is the point. I think they wanted to focus more on the content and free-roaming nature and I feel they did a very good job of that and it got me on board with the crazy storyline. The voice acting adds to this ridiculousness, it&apos;s almost that they don&apos;t want you to take the story seriously, and so that&apos;s how I approached it. My personal opinion is the negative reviews this game is receiving are because players are expecting the game to tell them or show them explicitly new and fun things to do, where Just Cause 2 pushes for creativity. Yeah, you could simply walk up to that radio tower and shoot it and be done, but what if you hijacked the helicopter over there, grappled a car to it and used the car as a wrecking ball to smash the tower? Then when your plan falls apart and you accidentally crash the helicopter into the tower instead, you can hop in the car and drive off. You, as the player, have to have some vision in order to see all the potential and fun there is in the game. There&apos;s things to collect and upgrade, there&apos;s things to destroy, there&apos;s semblance of progress, and there is an immense amount of fun all in Just Cause 2, you just have to be open to playing around and trying ridiculous things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2863358">Expand</a></span>

People will lock themselves in their houses and refuse to leave because the combination of close-quarters contextual combat with the ability to pin enemies to the environment and turn them into viscera-filled pinatas will be like cartharsis on a stick to anyone who loves to play sandbox games.<br><br>Funny way to start off a review about Just Cause 2, but I feel that this is the major misstep that the game makes. As a sandbox game it follows in the footsteps of GTA, the trigger-happy titan among sandboxes. Just cause 2 does everything I&apos;ve seen done in the GTA franchise and it does it smoothly and cleanly. But as a sandbox game trying to do something different it should&apos;ve cast a wider net  in looking for inspiration. Because while it is a sandbox, it is NOT a GTA game. The grappling hook changes all the rules, but I don&apos;t think the folks at Avalanche really cottoned onto that because the hook feels underused, and under-developed. Some more combo/contextual moves coupled with the ability to upgrade it and streamlining of certain manoeuvres (like dragging enemies behind your car, or holding a grappled enemy so you can fling them OFF of things etc.) would elevate this game beyond simply being a &apos;more interesting GTA clone&apos; to something truly exceptional.<br><br>That is not to say that Just Cause 2 is not fun. It is, and more fun than the last GTA game I played in fact (San Andreas for those of you keeping score). The vehicles while nowhere close to real-world accurate in terms of handling are massive fun to drive, skipper, and fly. The slingshot mechanic which turns your parachute into a paraglider is a stroke of brilliance, and the gunplay, while not stellar still manages to perform better than other sandbox titles. I just find myself wishing that the developers hadn&apos;t stopped on the threshold of greatness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2160501">Expand</a></span>

However, it does provide fun on a scale of the huge map that expands from many different seaons. It looks beautiful. Sunsets are astounding and the dynamic weather is well executed. The gunplay, on the other hand, is not so strong. Point and click mechanics are, however, balanced by the opportunities provided by the grapple - which provides a new dimension to shootouts. Definately worth a buy on a Steam sale, although not full retail.

Just Cause 2 has a grappling hook and parachute mechanic, which - when used correctly - allows you to scale buildings and jump out of planes. In the story missions there are a few big explosions, which look visually impressive. The graphics are very good, too, and it&apos;s playable on many systems. But although hopping between cars, planes and boats is entertaining, it&apos;s only enjoyable for a few hours before it gets old. It&apos;s worth noting that there are lots of people claiming that this game has a fully - or mostly - destructible world. It doesn&apos;t - there are a couple of things that look different when you blow them up, and that&apos;s it -- just to clear that claim up.
<br>Now, then, on to the bad things. Firstly, the voice acting is awful. It is without doubt the worse voice acting in any game I have played, bar none. The game is set on some sort of island in south Asia, so all of the voices - from the main protagonist to the least important character - are Americans putting on atrocious Asian accents. You might not think that bad voice acting can let the game down, but it cannot be avoided here. The missions are repetitive and necessary for progress; I actually ended up giving up on the game eventually because the missions&apos; repetitiveness wasn&apos;t justified by the bland storyline. The story is just bad. You have no idea what&apos;s going on and just seem to be doing things for no real reason - and that&apos;s because the game tells you what&apos;s happening at the start, and by the end of the first mission you have forgotten. The other main problem with it is the open world - it is a sandbox game, but no one of any importance exists in it except yourself, which reiterates my point about the game getting boring quickly.
<br>Overall, a fun game for a few hours - good, looking, too - but massively let down by its exceptionally bad voice acting, uncompelling story, dull world and horrendous repetitiveness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874556">Expand</a></span>

<br>1.  Repetition, throughout the whole game, there is lots of repeating yourself.  Every mission is very similar, and finding the pieces to the base is SO ANNOYING, because there is always ONE that you can&apos;t find.
<br>2.  Story line:  Horrible    Voice Acting:  Worse
<br>Ok, now  it was too short, too boring, too pointless . . . Overall it was bad, very bad, in fact, bad doesn&apos;t even begin to describe it.
<br>That is, if you are looking for a good story.  but I was looking for fun, and thought it was hilarious.
<br>Now, what&apos;s more fun than killing a bunch of villagers, then hijacking a military helicopter as it shoots bullets at you, and then flying it up as high as you can and skydiving out of it?  Or how about tying a jeep to a helicopter and using it as a wrecking ball?  These features alone make the game great, but it could have been SO much better if Square Enix put some story into it, and maybe some online multiplayer.  This is what gave it a 7.  But hey, the game definitely had a lasting appeal, now when I&apos;m playing GTA IV I think, where&apos;s that grapple hook when I need it?  I loved and hated the game, but overall, the fun gameplay shone through the crap story line.  For me at least.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2923590">Expand</a></span>

If this game were judged solely on the aspects listed previously, then I would give it a zero in a heartbeat. However, I have a feeling that Square Enix purposely made it out to be this way. Just Cause isn&apos;t a game to be taken seriously, it&apos;s a game to mess around with in your enormous sandbox of countless toys. As soon as the first mission&apos;s over, you&apos;re free to explore the island of Panau to your heart&apos;s content. From hijacking airplanes and crashing them into congested areas, to keelhauling an enemy soldier along your speedboat, the possibilities are seemingly endless. You&apos;ll have loads of fun simply testing out your grappling hook on unsuspecting enemies, discovering all the ways you can mess with your prey. Once, I tethered my grounded boat to an airliner, which then proceeded to drag me across the runway and lift off, carrying me with it. It&apos;s all a bunch of silly nonsense, but it&apos;s what makes this game so enjoyable. If you&apos;re looking for a giant sandbox to piss around in, you can&apos;t do much better than Just Cause 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2020971">Expand</a></span>

Not only is the world amazingly huge but with your grapple your grapple hook, you have at least 4 hours in a row just messing around. (I hope people get that sarcasm). When you do get bored of that can go out and attack police and start a police chase, out of the 65 hours of game play i have had so far i can say half of it just running from the cops then getting out of my flaming car, and then getting in another car. A side from the stupid fun i have mentioned so far, the game has amazing graphics and tons of possibilities! The only reason this didn&apos;t get a ten is because of the teeth grinding things like when the game gives you an awesome jet, and just crams a bunch of AA guns of your backside, and the fact that the game had much more potential. The game can flip you off sometimes but the rest of the time is dumb fun. Of course if your still not sure there is a demo on steam that a gives you a chunk of the world to mess around on so you can see if your self. I hope this helped!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2756389">Expand</a></span>

After 25% the  hard-core completion person will continue to 100%, the casual person will mess around, and the experimental people will start modding (if they haven&apos;t already). Repetitiveness aside, you can explore about 400 square kilometers of land and ocean, killing any Panuans in your way. The voice acting is average. The missions are entirely subjective though. Some may like them and think they&apos;re fun and interesting, and some may completely ignore them and think they&apos;re a waste of time/use them as cash. Factions drive cars around, and it&apos;s fun to get on them and shoot stuff. You can use a ton of weapons and upgrade them. The modding community is amazing also. I recommend the first person mod, multi-player mod (maybe), and other mods may bring interest such as realistic clouds and underwater planes. I&apos;ve put almost 200 hours into this game between Xbox and PC.

The plot and acting for the story mode is sub-par, but this game is not about the story. It&apos;s about bouncing around a massive Island chain flying jets, riding bikes, attaching gas canisters to unwitting bystanders and sending them to the moon, and generally f&apos;ing sh&apos;t up.</span>

Took a few weeks of nights away from me but well worth it, only wish more missions were available as the game was over too soon, but lots of other stuff to do that will keep you busy for some time.

I keep saying &quot;I&apos;ll just 100% this tiny little base&quot; then the next thing I know I&apos;ve hijacked a helicopter and I&apos;m blowing up another base. Or I start out in some base (after getting blown up or crashing or being shot) far away from where I want to be so I order a plane. Next thing I know I&apos;m swooping low over the ground trying to get low flyer achievements or ogling the sky and water or trying to swing under a bridge for the bridge limbo achievement. The gameplay is just so much fun and there are so many moments in the game that make you love it. You can go from feeling god-like and overpowered to dead in a matter of seconds because that tank you commandeered just got filled with bullets from the Panuan helicopter that you knew they had scrambled but just plain forgot about. This game is NOT meant to be taken seriously. You can hop out of a jet flying at several hundred miles an hour and just stand straight and tall looking like a bad ass. You can haul a minigun with unlimited ammo around and lay waste to everything in your path. You can grapple swing parachute for miles. You can base jump out of a helicopter, land safely and then get crushed by the helicopter as it falls out of the sky In Just Cause 2, you can do all of that and more. The story is hilariously over-the-top. If it wasn&apos;t clear at first, there&apos;s a mission where they throw ninjas at you and a nuclear sub pops out of an ice lake... on a tropical island. I don&apos;t think they were going for believable, they were going for fun with James Bond class mega-villains and stereotype allies.
<br>
<br>Yes, there is nothing realistic about the game, and isn&apos;t that really the wonderful part of it? This is a game where you need to be open to embracing the silliness because it&apos;s all an excuse to play and have fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2577053">Expand</a></span>

You have a parachute and a grappling hook along with more than a hundred vehicles and tons of weapons as well. It only took 20 hours to get through the main story, and the game has so much more than that. Some badass things I do: standing on a boat and shooting rpgs off of it, grapple hooking my low-flying 747 to a boat and flying away with it, defusing nuclear missiles while riding them, and base jumping out of a hot-air balloon. The great thing about this game is that none of the things I said will ruin the game for anyone because the world is so many kilometers wide that you could play for 100 hours and not even see any of the things I&apos;m talking about. I truly recommend this beautiful, action-packed game for anyone that likes sandbox, FPS, action, or story games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2126857">Expand</a></span>

The game doesn&apos;t support multiplayer, but watching/taking turns with a friend is extremely entertaining. The campaign is bad. But that doesn&apos;t matter.</span>

Thankfully there aren&apos;t any story progression map restrictions like Grand Theft Auto, otherwise I don&apos;t know if I would have played it. The missions can be extremely repetitive and tedious. The redeeming factor is the surreal action, which is what keeps me hooked if I just wanna be a bad ass for a few hours.</span>

The map is huge, too huge for me to explore it all, and while its not really &quot;boring&quot; it was still not intresting enough to make you want to see it all. The main storyline is not linear at all, Its just not very interesting, but I think the story&apos;s only goal was to give you moral obligation to cause as much chaos as possible in the entire state so I think the story did fine overall, even had few nice So why 9? Because of those staff that simply keep being fun no matter how repetative they are: Hijacking helicopters, Hijacking airplanes, Pulling vehicles stunts, flying around while doging bullets, and of course attaching things to each other. Yes, it probabaly wasn&apos;t the most effective to attach the two cars chasing you to each other near the bridge. And yes, shotting that guy instead of attaching him to a gas tank and shooting the gas tank could probably save me some time and health. The rope and parchute machanic is distinctive enough to make this game worth buying. The closest game mechanic to this game was that of infamous (where you can also hijack helicopters). but somehow this game is still very much different (And not only because its more challanging)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2581286">Expand</a></span>

The factions give you adventure missions to prove your loyalty, get cash and power ups. Also - jump out of planes, off of trees or mountains, and base jump with a really cool parachute - if you can say something in Japanese then say it now !<br><br>OverallScore 9.7 Played the SteamPC version  in 2012.03 (2 years after release)<br>[DRM] Steam only (and always easy)<br><br>[Challenges] Main mission run and gun adventures provided by the factions are straightforward and short (just right for that ADD in me). Weapons are standard and great, the grappling hook is awesome and essential to the game and easily mastered - this is so cool - allowing you to parachute fly across the land. RPG-like progression requires accumulation of parts, armor, money, and chaos points by completing missions (which are easy and abundant). To help your abilities progress complete enough SIDE  missions. If you like to run and gun the highest adrenaline side missions are to take over military installations (always lots of fun like that first latte in the morning); if you like to explore and run away then discover the towns around the countryside for loot (simple and repetitive after a while - like eating marshmallows). I played on expert level and rapidly RPG-maxed out my favorite weapons and cars making the game much easier. There seems to be a mission for every mood. There is a bunch of optional but lucrative mini games like racing with cars, planes, boats, and base jumping - they all take skill - and if playing on a PC then you need a Joystick for full enjoyment of flying minigames. The AI is good and will kill you (do not eat cheese doodles while playing) [Value] This game is quite fun and quite long. I do not think you can replay this game - if you try to complete every side mission I think you have a 300 hour game on your hands.... The real fun ends around 100 hours - sounds like too much eh? [Children] This is not for kids - this game keeps track of the number of headshots; at least there is no smoking (smiley face wink) [My PC] i7-2600K 3.4GHz / ASUS Z68 ProGen3 / 8Gig RAM / Radeon 6870 / 1920x1200 / W7 PRO SP1 [Graphics 9.0] Why is there so much texture popping?<br>[Controls 10] I always play with a Logitech keyboard and a Kensington trackball. Remapping the keys was easy and appears in the onscreen instructions.<br>[Sound 10] I always play with headphones. I liked the way the music energy moved with the action - like Deus Ex - and at times was soothing; there was a good music variety; I turned up the volume !

The environment was something I did enjoy quite a lot, the beautiful graphics combined with the setting, think Cuba combined with North Korea was very pleasing. The vehicle driving is implemented very nicely as well. If you don&apos;t mind stunts that are totally unrealistic, a mediocre story (Most cinematic are skippable though) and a massive free roam expanse filled with explosions, gunfire and god knows what else, this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2112067">Expand</a></span>

The environment is immensely interective, I hate when I feel like I&apos;m in a plastic scenery just there for decoration. Not so now. You can blow up any of the literally hundred villages. I spent over 100 hours on this game, if you&apos;re a completionist you&apos;ll love it. I like sandbox games but what&apos;s good about this one is that you have constant goals - every area has a percentage of completion based on items you must find and things you can blow up. Basically, I never felt bored in all my exploration, unlike other sandbox games lacking such goals. These strong elements for me greatly outweigh the weak story, because the game is so much fun and I just spent 95% of the time playing anyway, and not listening to story. So that&apos;s it, one of the best games I&apos;ve played in my life, if you don&apos;t like it in the first hours I&apos;d say that&apos;s normal because the story is bad, but get actually playing and driving around and you&apos;ll absolutely adore it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2441594">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is so much fun, when you get the hang of it. Jumping around with your grapplehook and parachuting from tree to tree to avoid gunfire is just one of the many aspects of this game that makes it awesome. Here&apos;s the catch: Storyline is thin, and can be finished TOO quickly. Once you&apos;ve completed the campaign, you get stuck in &quot;Mercenary Mode&quot; where you then attempt to complete the rest of the game (blowing stuff up, driving every vehicle available, etc.). Unfortunately, once you&apos;ve gotten to that point, it just loses it&apos;s fun-value (unless you&apos;re comfortable running around and blowing stuff up for hours on end). Good enough game to buy if you can get it on sale. 7/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1920018">Expand</a></span>

Many people focus solely on the open-end aspect, saying &quot;Wow, the land you can explore is amazingly huge&quot;. When you broaden your sights on the major aspects which make a great game you see Just Cause 2 misses a few crucial aspects. First off is variety: After you&apos;ve completed 30% of the game you realise you&apos;ve been doing the same thing over and over. Blowing up fuel tanks, knocking over transmission towers and going through the tedious hi-jack animation. It all becomes a bit tiresome.<br><br>The voice acting is some parts is terrible. Sometimes the voice stops but the lip-sync animation still runs for seconds after. And in other parts it sounds like the developers are patronising people who actually have accents of those portrayed in the game.  The story, no doubt a crucial part of any game is lacking with the ending being unbearably corny. There a plethora of bugs yet to be fixed. Such as the faulty Heat-system (think of the 6 stars in GTA). Many timer I find myself with no enemies around yet my heat refuses to decrease. Also if you are stand right up to a wall and fire you grapple the animation of you hand puts the grapple through the wall, and he doesn&apos;t grapple on anything. Apart from all that, the game does have some interesting features. Grappling two objects (or people) never seems to get old. And you do get some pretty hilarious moments. But overall, this game could have a lot improved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1369776">Expand</a></span>

The grappling hook and parachutes in this game will just make you wanna play for hours on end. And did you know there are 104 different vehicles? From cars to motorcycles to planes to jets to boats to...other stuff. And for 50 bucks this game is cheaper than MW2 or AC2(which are both good games nontheless). I think that reviewers rated this game in all the wrong aspects. This is definately not a GTA close, it&apos;s more like Uncharted 2. At least it looks like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=747596">Expand</a></span>

Rediculously good graphics, pimped out for PC, and comes with free DLC if you get it through steam.  I&apos;ve got 50 hours of gameplay and I&apos;m only 39% done, only on the 4th game mission, because the islands of panau are GIGANTIC.  you will have tons of fun retaking the hundreds of villages, districts and military installations from the corrupt government, who even cares about the story quests? haha.  it can seem repetitive at times, but the close to 200 vehicles available and the great grappling hook mechanics keep it from being tedious.  The heat AI is a little dumb, eg: if you manage to run out the gauge, say, right before a truck full of policia crashes into you, they&apos;ll have completely forgotten that you&apos;re the guy they were furiously chasing 2 seconds earlier.  Kinda messes up the immersion, but the gunfight AI is pretty decent and helps draw you in to each little destruction operation, as do the day/night cycles and the random rainstorms etc.  Long story short, this game is excellent, give it a try as it becomes less than ten dollars when it&apos;s on sale, and it was clearly paid a lot of care in ensuring your enjoyment.  I&apos;ve never had a single player game outside of MMORPGS that gave me so many hours of fun.  And I own some 100+ high end PC titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1460530">Expand</a></span>

<br>Just Cause 2 is effectively a playground of destruction. A lot of vehicles (on land, sea and air) and plenty of weapons.
<br>And the grappling hook. By far the most entertaining part of the game. It can be used to pull yourself up a building, or pull an enemy off of one. Or, you can tether two things together, such as an enemy to a rocket and watch the hilarity ensue.
<br>Classic example of gameplay: I&apos;m flying an unarmed passenger plane; enemy helicopters are dogging me. I fly high up into the sky, climb out of the  and jump onto the top of my plane. Plane starts losing altitude, but I wait until an enemy helicopter gets close enough. I jump, going through free fall, diving past the helicopters. Midair, I grapple onto one of the &apos;copters, haul myself up onto it&apos;s nose, proceed to shoot the co-pilot and then beat the pilot senseless and throw him out of the  I am now flying the helicopter and I use it to shoot down the remaining enemies flying after me.
<br>And that&apos;s how the game goes. It wasn&apos;t part of any mission, it was just me toodling around and only a few hours into the game.
<br>I can&apos;t comment too much on the story, since I really haven&apos;t been paying much attention to it. Basically, you&apos;re a spy/agent and your mentor was deep undercover and went rogue; now it&apos;s up to you to find him. To do so, you need to get in good with local rebel groups (by running missions) to destabilize the tyrannical regime and flush out the rogue agent.
<br>
<br>Problems:
<br>Camera shake. Nearly everything causes the camera to shake, sometimes horribly. My eyes can&apos;t really handle it and there isn&apos;t any way to turn it off. Might not be an issue for some, but it is for me.
<br>Mods: there are only a few, and they&apos;re somewhat useful, but nothing like an overhaul or texture packs.
<br>Bugs: I haven&apos;t really noticed any; although sometimes physics will wig out, but I&apos;ve only seen it happen a few times. Although, I did just fall through a bridge, but it&apos;s the first time it has happened in the 30+ hours that I&apos;ve been playing it.
<br>
<br>tl;dr: playground of destruction, a lot of fun, and it&apos;s $15 on Steam. Definitely worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2954229">Expand</a></span>

However, I don&apos;t even have to.  All I can say is that this game is just plain amazing!  It is quite possibly the best video game I have ever played.  In fact, the story is the one thing about this game that I would have to say is wrong with it.  It sort of does have a cruddy story that is like your average B-movie, however, the story is not at all what this game is about.  What this game is really about is its awesome gameplay.  This game is open world, and has so much to see and do.  One thing that this game definitely wanted to pull off was be like the average action movie.  In fact, if I didn&apos;t know this game better I&apos;d say that it was possibly satirizing action movies.  However, I do know this game better, and I can safely say that if this game was going for being like an action movie, it undoubtedly succeeded.  This game has so many different areas that make you feel like you&apos;re in a movie like Die Hard or the Expendables.  The areas have several different destructible objects, enemies to fight, and make you feel like your character is an unstoppable war machine while the enemies are nothing more than mere toothpicks.  There are also several elements in this game that are much like the average action movie as well.  Does this game have you taking over enemy bases?  Definitely!  Does this game have car chases?  Absolutely!  Does this game have any other vehicle sections?  Plenty!  Does this game have high falls?  Assortment of different weapons?  A tropical island setting?  You bet!  Speaking of the island itself, let&apos;s move on to the graphics.  These are some of the best graphics I have ever seen in a video game!  They are very detailed, very beautiful, and very vibrant and colorful!  There wasn&apos;t a single thing in this game that wasn&apos;t detailed properly.  This game is a very beautiful sight indeed.  The sound is also quite good.  In fact, it is amazing!  The explosions have a punch to them, the guns have just the right sound effects, and the vehicles sound just the way they should.  One thing that people are bound to love about this game is how little emphasis it has on story.  I have criticized story in the past, however, in this case I don&apos;t feel the need to do so. This game proves that a video game does not need a big emphasis on story to be good (I&apos;m looking at you Assassin&apos;s Creed).  The game&apos;s story is very short (only seven missions long), and the rest of the game is spent exploring, raiding bases, going on car chases, and completing faction missions.  There are plenty of these faction missions all throughout the landscape of the island, and they are all unique, and a blast to play.  Overall, I&apos;d say, if you do not own this game, then what the heck are you waiting for?  It&apos;s cheap on Steam (only $15).  This game has everything that an action game junkie would want.  It has a beautiful setting, little emphasis on story, and a giant emphasis on explosive, extremely fun and fast-paced gameplay!  Buy this game right now if you do not yet own it.  Do not hesitate, it really is that awesome!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3190730">Expand</a></span>

You can hijack jets, helicopters, cars, boats, and motorcycles. You can harass the citizens, or just fly around and enjoy the scenery.

Lush gorgeous tropical environments that are beautifully rendered. Really fun and interesting gameplay mechanics like the grapple/dual grapple hook. Tons of sweet vehicles. I&apos;ve put in about 50 hours on the game, only about 5 of those hours max were actually playing the game. The game itself is pretty lame to be quite honest. That might sound funny but it&apos;s the truth. Rated on it&apos;s &apos;intended&apos; gameplay I&apos;d give this a much lower score. In fact, I&apos;d love if they just threw out all the run around and shoot things and people attacking you elements, blah blah blah. Bored me to tears really. But HOT DAMN, what a sandbox. This game is definitely on the top of my list for when the Occulus Rift gets released. I&apos;m gonna be jumping off them mountains and parachuting from helicopters for hours on end.  Great on the PC with the First Person mod installed (also can&apos;t go wrong with 2 KM grappling hook.)

The game is one bold love letter to the bygone era of fun-if-slightly-trashy action movies. It&apos;s an enormous playground where the player is free to do anything he wishes, as long as it&apos;s blowing stuff up and causing havoc. It&apos;s surprising that the gunplay is the weakest part of the game, with bullets feeling very flimsy and explosives being rarer than they should be. Of course, this encourages the player to experiment with the game&apos;s more unconventional ways of fighting back. Using the grappling hook to tether enemies to various objects in the world never gets old. There are no barriers in this game. See something on the horizon? You can get there. The combination of parachute and grappling hook enables the player to effortlessly traverse Panau and take in the stunning scenery. And make no mistake, the game looks incredible.<br>All in all Just Cause 2 is an outstanding open world mayhem simulator with an unrivalled sense of scale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1502344">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is great, the story is alright, replay value is high, the graphics are well done, the characters are decent, and the style is cool. A great recommendation for those who have played games of the Grand Theft Auto series.</span>

Things should really change once you&apos;ve &apos;won&apos; the main story, but they do not.

It&apos;s so wondrously over-the-top it makes me wonder why all sandbox action games don&apos;t give the player a grappling hook and a parachute. It makes Grand Theft Auto IV look like a game about a 12-year-old kid&apos;s newspaper route. It makes Red Faction: Guerilla look like a shiny tech demo on Mars (Oh wait, it&apos;s always resembled that).<br><br>What about the story? Oh right, there&apos;s a story. You are Rico Rodriguez, and you have to overthrow a corrupt regime on an island nation. You work for an agency. And you have to shoot and kill your way into a number of crime factions in order to cause sufficient &quot;chaos&quot; that the regime&apos;s leader will finally come out of hiding and confront you. That&apos;s about it.<br><br>I skip every cut-scene the game shows me. I just. Don&apos;t. Care.<br><br>The fun in this game is being able to explore the largest game world I have ever played. I understand that larger game worlds have existed before, like Asheron&apos;s Call. I&apos;ve never played that game, so the worlds to which I can compare that of JC2 are from Fallout 3, Oblivion, and Far Cry 2. These worlds are mere islands in JC2&apos;s vast nation.<br><br>One final note: Just Cause 2 is the best game to play in conjunction with Steam&apos;s screenshot feature. F-12 yourself some excellent shots.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1707587">Expand</a></span>

Flaws - while it&apos;s a brilliant title, it certainly doesn&apos;t use its full potential. The amount of missions and their variety could be higher. The AI could use some work, but show me a game with a good AI nowadays, huh. It also isn&apos;t a game for people who prefer being hand-pulled and follow a straight line.

What this game is, however, is everything GTA 4 wants to be and isn&apos;t. No more annoying phone calls from your virtual friends. No more game dates wherein you never get to see any closed-doors action. Murder, of everything and anything, is the name of this game. And if you&apos;re looking to waste hours of your life destroying haphazardly anything and everything, then this is certainly what you&apos;re looking for. Expect a game that sacrifices narrative for cliche characters and big explosions, but requires you to follow the nearly propagandist plot to find the biggest and best of all the die-hard scenarios.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1677889">Expand</a></span>

Overall, the game has great scenery and super weapons.  Just Cause 2 is much more entertaining than its predecessor, and that was a great game too.  I may actually buy the DLC for this one.</span>

First: the missions get boring with some time, and second: that indolent control drives me crazy!!! Please, Square Enix, improve that the next time!!</span>

<br>I found that it takes the players too much time to drive or hiking around the island,the mountain,for there&apos;s no fast plane for them at the beginning of the story.Meantime,the quests seem need the player to get the very locations to start or complete.As we know,some other known games,such as Sleeping Dogs and Assassin&apos;s Creed IV are with the mechanic of quest auto-interaction and ignoring the journey for the quest location.Sometimes,when the mechanic not triggered,we can use the cabs or fast travel.
<br>For short,the time wasting and amusement killing journey at the beginning consumed my patience for this game.
<br>Looks like the cloud save of it is not functional on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4514832">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only things that stops this game from being a 10/10 is the very small variety of weapons, poor vehicle controls, and repetitive nature. Most of the missions feel the same, but it doesn&apos;t really matter too much because it&apos;s a lot of fun anyway.
<br>
<br>If the gameplay mechanics weren&apos;t as fun as they are, this game easily could have been a 5/10, due to all the reasons people have listed as well as the ones above. Regardless, the most amazing $2.50 game I have ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3277738">Expand</a></span>

You can go around killing random enemy bases just for fun, or follow the story and complete missions.  It is generally very hard to complete 100% of this game if you want every single thing done, takes a long long time because there is just so much stuff.  The story is pretty fun too, I really enjoy the game.  I think you will too.</span>

Although, the game gets very repetitive after you complete all the faction missions and the main story line. I wouldn&apos;t say this is a game to play to completion, but very fun until you get to about 60% completion.</span>

The Controls are quiet nice. The amount of Biomes are amazing, Mountains, Tropical Forest, Desert. The city is very nice to drive/fly around. The story is quiet nice. The music is ok.</span>

<br>Story - The storyline is absolutely non-existent in this game. There are roughly 10 story missions which would take 2-3 hours tops to complete if they weren&apos;t locked behind open world requirements in which you had to destroy X amount of **** to unlock them.
<br>
<br>Voice Acting - It is horrendous and cringe worthy. Any line of dialog made me want to puke, not literally but you get what I mean. The dialog is that bad that I cannot find any other words to describe it.
<br>
<br>World - Is massive, maybe a little too big and areas such as the sandy desert, snowy mountains and forest are very bland particularly between key locations and areas of interest. Only the military bases where some effort has been put in to make them feel unique, emphasize some. However the open world&apos;s main downfall is that it is absolutely dead. There is barely traffic on the roads and civilians are nowhere to be seen even in the city region.
<br>
<br>Driving - Is crap and clunky.
<br>
<br>Shooting - Is crap and clunky.
<br>
<br>Destruction/Chaos - Nothing that couldn&apos;t be done in a GTA game which offers more than just mind numbing destruction.
<br>
<br>All this game offers is mind numbing destruction which loses it appeal very quickly especially when the mechanics to carry out such a feat are clunky as hell.
<br>
<br>If you are one of those guys who enjoys a story as an integral part of their experience then this game is not for you. If you have grown out of the nostalgic boyhood days when playing GTA where you used to run around causing absolute mayhem for no particular reason, then this game is definitely not for you!!! Game offers nothing other than destruction which gets tiring after 10 hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5364385">Expand</a></span>

If this game defines anything, it&apos;s repetition. Most cutscenes are repeated, the dialogues are generic and voiced badly, the story can&apos;t be named a story. The grapling hook is an interesting feature, but it stays the only interesting thing about this game. The driving physics are bad, the vehicles are slow, the map is enormous but with so few details, that you just take a jet, and fly up to 5 minutes in a straight line with afterburner on, just to get to a point 6 km away. Technically the game looks fine, but not great at all. Repetition is the main motive, trees, rocks, streets, landscapes get repeated so often, that the large map is of no use. Anyone can blow up a map using ctrl+v. Blood looks strange, explosions lack a real bang but the lighting of sunsets is quite nice. But gta4 looked better.<br>Driving by car is annoying, all 30 sec the police starts shooting. They are not very difficult to fight back, but still it gets repetitive a lot. Just like Just Cause 1, the game is a nice feature, but fails to fulfill the rest of qualities a good game needs. The upgrade system does not make a big difference, there are very few  different guns and all the good stuff is available from the beginning so you have seen all the game has to offer in the first hour of gameplay. After that, nothing new happens. Really, nothing. Some parts are ridiculously difficult, but just because 3 helicopters and a lot of soldiers fire directly at you after reloading. The controls are ok, the helicopter controls are really good, the only thing I&apos;d like to see in another game. Countless counters track you during the game, but nothing interesting happens when accumulate 500 or 600 headshots, more than 100 stunt points and so on. And it is so easy to progress these stats, that you start to ignore them. In hindsight I wonder why i played this thing for over 15 hrs. I think I wanted to know if the end is as lame as the rest of the game, maybe I had some hope that the game surprises me with a good ending. But no. Not at all. So buy this game only if you have alzheimers and don&apos;t realize when things get repeated every 2 minutes or if you really want to waste time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2373925">Expand</a></span>

<br>the bad - why can&apos;t i look straight up? too complicated to change from inside a car to the mounted gun on the back. cars have the best wheels of all time - virtually no friction, u must stop the car before u jump on the back to shoot someone otherwise u&apos;ll be rolling down the street for seriously as far as it is straight. grappling up a building has you looking straight at the wall when u haul urself in which is pointless because u then have to move the mouse again to look back in the direction u wanted to go. why are there low lying snow covered mountains within sight of seemingly warm tropical islands? lack of background story or foundation when u start the game. i was confused about the agency thing, they seemed like a government agency, but the guy is an absolute terrorist.
<br>
<br>to summarize - its a game u play if u just want some pointless blasting, any seriousness about a story or any real envolvement is long gone. its playable and sometimes quite fun but its like a badly made corny movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1453806">Expand</a></span>

For me it is the best open world game, far far ahead of overrated GTA 4 which is total opposite - frustrating, repetitive and boring. I just loved JC2 2 years ago and I still do and play it from time to time.</span>

I spent hours trying to locate and destroy last piece of government property just so I can capture the settlement. I also hate the idea of running around collecting weapon and vehicle parts that are scattered the whole map. It is repetitive and boring. Weapon and vehicle parts upgrade could have been more meaningful if I get larger sum by attacking real-difficult-to-reach mountain and military bases. I have the grappling hook don&apos;t I? But no, more than half of the mission enemy or boss rarely put up with a challenge. Instead, I spend majority amount of  hours trying to be like a dragon-ball collector looking at radar to pick up weapon/vehicle parts. If you are reading this by now, it is 2012. Skip this game and go for something else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2800279">Expand</a></span>

True, the story and characters are pretty shallow (who would expect interesting characters from a sandbox game? well GTA4 but thats very rare), but the gameplay makes up for it. While the gunplay can be somewhat simple and Rico may seem overpowered (you can easily manage with one un-upgraded pistol headshotting everyone for most of the game), the game&apos;s real richness is its in freeform exploration. You get the whole map at the beginning, you dont need to unlock new areas. When not using fast travel the map feels HUGE. There are many things to do from surfing on top of an airplane to running amok around the island causing chaos everywhere. The slingshot/parachute mechanism is well made. Warning to realism seekers: you can kiss goodbye to laws of psychics, because this game employs its own. This is one of the most things I like: you can experiment with everything try, and fail with different things and then fail some moar. Mission design is pretty sloppy, but they are GRAND! You can expect lots of big things to blow up. Just Cause 2 is not a perfect game, far from it, but its able to deliver a very entertaining experience and is game which you will be returning to play for some moar freedom.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=747030">Expand</a></span>

But does the storyline really matter? No. I love exploring in this game and the the graphics are insanely beautiful even for two years later. The grapple hook is fun to travel around with and there are mods for this game, such as free vehicles you can buy, when they actually cost a lot of money which makes me play the game 1000 times more. The game is simple, go blow up stuff, and kill if you want or need to. The game may be repetitive but it&apos;s still fun. This game is very well optimized and if you have a bad card then you&apos;ll have to lower quite a few things..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2303850">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re looking for a pointless game to blow stuff up in, this is it. It also has the biggest playable map I&apos;ve ever seen, with tonnes of easter eggs and unique vehicles there to find. The mod community for the game is also pretty incredible. Definitely worth checking out at least.

The island paradise game world is huge and strikingly beautiful, but despite the game being so big, it never gets tedious getting from point A to point B, because you have your trusty grappling hook, and multitude of vehicles you can steal GTA style or purchase on the black market. The black market guy can also extract you to any previously discovered location, for a price. The combat is quite satisfying, it can get really hectic when a lot of enemies are on the screen. The explosions are over the top and incredibly fun as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1510201">Expand</a></span>

If you like being able to do whatever you want, whenever you want, and approach every mission from a multitude of difference angles, this game is for you.  On top of that, if you&apos;re a completionist, there are hundreds upon hundreds of gameplay hours available here.  I have also spent countless hours grappling up a mountain, just to single-handedly destroy an entire communications base with rocket launchers, then steal their helicopter, fly to the beach, then destroy a military base with missiles, causing multiple choppers to come out and have a dog fight.  If my heli gets blown up, I can safely land on the ground by *pulling myself toward it* with a grappling hook  or by deploying one of my infinite parachutes.  Physics be damned.  Realism be damned.  This game is utterly ridiculous.  Kill everything and everyone.  Blow up all the things.  If you don&apos;t like this game, you are hereby deemed clinically-depressed, a boring human being, and I hate you.
<br>Just Cause 2 is one of the best games I&apos;ve ever played, and one of the only games I can pick up year after year and find something new to do.  Poor reviews on this game disgust me and make me lose faith in humanity.

Although, the game gets very repetitive after you complete all the faction missions and the main story line. I wouldn&apos;t say this is a game to play to completion, but very fun until you get to about 40% completion.</span>

But sadly, I realize that JC2 requires quite a powerful PC to get the full affect of the beauty of this game.  So, all-in-all, it&apos;s an amazing game but only if you really have the good enough PC and if you have the sense of knowing a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3288872">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also too damn big, with something like 2700 collectibles and over 300 towns/bases to ransack. Rico is a fun character, with that grindhouse Hispanic style and signature do-anything grappling hook. Though the grapple is fun and easy to use, JC2 is at it&apos;s best when you&apos;re in a vehicle, racing or flying about, doing stupid stunts and blowing things up left and right while Rico hums Flight of the Valkyries to himself. JC2 throws the laws of physics out the window in the favor of thinks like grapple-jacking helicopters and surfing nuclear missiles. Just look at the Steam picture. It&apos;s like Robert Rodriguez directed a Mercenaries sequel. It falters on occasion, especially when it&apos;s just you, a gun and a horde of bad guys with improbably good accuracy, but the rest of the time, it&apos;s literally a blast. On top of that, it at least partly inspired Renegade Ops.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507916">Expand</a></span>

The incredibly short main storyline is rather disjointed and seems to be over before it really gets going, hinting at plot twists that never materialise. The worst oversight is that some of the most spectacular missions are optional, and it took me hours of extra toil to find one particular one that friends had raved about, but on the flip-side, some missions are SPECTACULAR. The best I&apos;ve seen from any game of this type. I also found myself wishing that the wanton distruction Rico dishes out every other second has a more meaningful impact on the game. After blowing up every fuel silo on the island, for instance, it seemed strange that the military could still field an infinite number of jeeps to persue me endlessly across the map. Often there are floating messages to say you have weakened the regime&apos;s grip on the island in various ways, but nothing actually comes of it. It would have been an extra carrot on a stick to see the &apos;chaos&apos; rico incites actually occur. Lack of a cover system is also a little unforgivable in this day and age. These gripes out of the way, Just Cause 2 is incredible. The island of Panau is beautiful on an unparalelled scale, it is literally a joy to just fly around for an hour or so and take in the views... until you see another aircraft that you decide you&apos;d like to hijack in mid flight. The explosions are satisfying, as is hooking an enemy to a propane tank and launching him into the stratosphere. The parachute and grappling hook combo is an inspired bit of game design, and so easy to use you may never want to drive around like a mere mortal ever again. All in all, avalanche have strayed dangerously close to a perfect game, but just missed the mark in a few key areas that will leave you dissapointed if not spitting with rage. It all bodes well for the inevitable Just Cause 3 though. I for one am counting the days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/just-cause-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=747145">Expand</a></span>
