It is a character based shooter so different characters have different play styles.  For the release which just happened about five hours ago they have added a new hero.  Nerfed and boosted some heroes to get a more equal playing field and added two new maps and a new game type.  I have logged about 20 hours in the beta and have had a blast.  Even when your team is down a bunch you can fight your way back to victory with a few lucky breaks.  The gun play feels nice and weighty and the zero gravity areas on the maps adds for some interesting attacking a shooting dynamics.  I think this game will end up being a great game and grow in content with each season like LOL or Rainbow Six Siege does.  It is a great game and you are supporting a small studio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7453154">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I never wait for matchmaking more than one minute. Ranked is not out yet so there are some imbalances, players leaving early, etc. I remember Overwatch had the same issues in the first month.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve ever enjoyed games like Quake, you need to own this game, as it brings the same level of polish as Overwatch did to the genre as a class based shooter. Being compared to Overwatch is NOT a bad thing, as both run buttery smooth. The gameplay of LB fixes some issues I have with OW - namely overpowered ultimate abilities in OW.

Combat is very fast paced and makes kills feel extremely rewarding, verticality and freedom of movement play very important role (not only inside 0G pockets) just like in Tribes series, each class plays completely different but doesn&apos;t force you into any limited &#xAB;role&#xBB; so you can both earn kills and fulfill objectives with any of them (even medic). This game is very polished, full of small nice details (both aesthetically and functionally, like cooldown bar on health pickups or allies warning you about direction of incoming damage for example) and well optimized. Developers are transparent and listen to players&apos; feedback (as you can judge by their RapidFire Update youtube videos or activity in official Discord channel).
<br>Totally worth 30$ especially considering that all updated are free and work on new classes, maps and competitive mode are in progress right now. 91 hours and I still want to play it more.
<br>Also, the ball in Blitzball is voiced by Justin Roiland from Rick and Morty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7474587">Expand</a></span>

LawBreaks is awesome it is the cure for having played to much Overwatch.  Despite what you may have heard this game is no overwatch or team fortress 2 clone.  If you had to classify it I would say it is a mash up of old school quake and team fortress combined with the gun play of newer modern warfare type games.  The game consists of 5 player teams</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">9/10

<br>LawBreaks is awesome it is the cure for having played to much Overwatch.  Despite what you may have heard this game is no overwatch or team fortress 2 clone.  If you had to classify it I would say it is a mash up of old school quake and team fortress combined with the gun play of newer modern warfare type games.  The game consists of 5 player teams across a bunch of different maps.  The game types are a couple variations of capture the flag, king of the hill and capture the point.  Unlike a game like overwatch that is very dependent on a quality team make up in Lawbreakers you have still win with two players that don&apos;t know what to do and our playing the wrong character for the map. This is refreshing because you still have a chance to win even if you are down with half the objectives already claimed.  Game typically last for about 10 minutes but on occasion against equally matched teams they can go for the entire 20 minutes.  The gun play is very tight and the weapons feel weighty.  As far as I can tell the netcode is running really well and the hit boxes are accurate to the character models.  Right now I believe Wraith is a little OP given the range of his weapon and his speed but all characters are viable.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>1.  Great gun play
<br>2.  Good net code
<br>3.  Quickly match into games
<br>4.  All heroes viable across different game types
<br>5.  Quality graphics
<br>6.  Unique IP from small studio that plays like a AAA title
<br>7.  Great game for teamwork
<br>8.  Multiple routes to victory not a rock paper shotgun type of game
<br>9.  Not pay to win
<br>10.  Highly addicting gameplay.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1. Blitz ball team can be carried by one player that knows the map and is playing a quick character
<br>2. Some heroes are less viable at higher levels of play
<br>
<br>Questions:
<br>
<br>1.  What is the post beta anti hack going to be. Hope it is battleye.
<br>
<br>Overall this is a great game easy to learn but difficult to master even if your team is down you always feel like you can come back and possibly win.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7453132">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>People need to remember this is NOT an AAA game. Just because it has a range of characters and classes in a shooter format does not make it overwatch
<br>
<br>This game has a a great USP to offer to users who want a more unique experience. This game is far from an overwatch clone as it plays completely different with an individual setting and playstyle. I honestly dont see the comparisons of people claiming this game is overwatch meets call of duty just because it is low gravity. This is a complex game that mixes up the FPS genre with a fun and engaging arena shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7457417">Expand</a></span>

Gunplay is nice and havent had any issues with net code like you usually do on multiplayer shooters when the first release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7453444">Expand</a></span>

It takes after quake, Titanfall 2, and UT, with a little modern flair thrown in with class abilities and stash drops Overwatch style. There is no easy mode button in this game. It&apos;s like someone smashed all the previously listed games together while surgically removing the tumors.</span>

From that big moments starting in 1999, the only big skill-based competitor for this games were Halo 2 and Halo 3 (and UT sequels of course), but Halo started spoiling and other proposals just hadn&apos;t the sauce, focused in other bearings or just tried to replicate Quake III and Unreal Tournament III. Call of Duty, Battlefield, Destiny, Nexuiz, Section 8, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Toxikk, Reflex... You may have played any kind of multiplayer shooter but never got something that good from 2007 (Halo 3&apos;s year).
<br>
<br>Today, and almost 10 years later, we finally have a worthy successor. LawBreakers has adopted the popular (and necessary to attract the masses) hero based distribution of weapons and habilities successfully, bringing back weapons from Unreal Tournament, with simmetric maps, innovative thread turn to objective based modes, with a new special sauce: Different sprints for each hero that just bring a new dimension of organization and fun. All decorated with the top-tier Unreal Engine 4 and running with a netcode that works awesomely good, something I really appreciate after thousands of hours playing CSGO and other competitive based games which connection is incohompresibly bad for the running times.
<br>
<br>Please, just don&apos;t listen to those who says that this is an &quot;overwatch-like&quot;... That&apos;s hilarious because then they&apos;re practically saying that Team Fortress 2 is an &quot;unreal tournament-like&quot;, if you know what I mean...
<br>
<br>Obviously the game has defects, heroes balance is really good but need little improvements, which is perfectly normal given that a several amount of content (including modes, maps and heroes) have been being included from a few months ago, when we were playing the alpha, even a hero that just wasn&apos;t in the last week (before launch) open beta. The other problem are little performance issues that, as balancing, will be solved in upcoming patchs for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7454936">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Medics that can actually kill something
<br>- No &quot;kill them all with no skill&quot; abilities
<br>- Great gameplay, gravity doesn&apos;t feel gimmick at all but add interesting strategic elements
<br>- Fun game modes (but would need more variety)
<br>- Every class feels different and have really fun abilities, I&apos;ll probably spent countless hours to master my favorites.
<br>- You do not have to choose the class you&apos;re playing based on the game mode/on the composition of your team, but you can actually play the one you like and still make you team win.
<br>
<br>Bonus :
<br>
<br>- Great graphics and level design, run smoothly on my 970/144hz/2k
<br>- All future update will be free
<br>
<br>Definitely give it a try if you&apos;re into that kind of game, and if you&apos;re not, you may still be surprised.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7460256">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Lawbreakers has all this and the arena feel I was craving in modern shooters for years.
<br>
<br>I liked playing all characters from the get go. Normally I have to warm up more to characters which don&#x2019;t fit my playstyle as much. Here everything feels FPSy and fresh.
<br>
<br>On the technical side I had a good experience. Fast matchmaking time. Enjyoable UI. Fluid mechanics.
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s not a huge game content wise. It seems Boss Key takes the route afformentioned games took with their payment model.
<br>From experience I can tell, that if they generate the revenue, more content should be released regularly for some time.
<br>
<br>Lawbreakers really pushed my right buttons, I&#x2019;d like to see into what it can grow. Join in if you like first person shooters. I already feel home.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7458765">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But between those moments of brilliance there is alot of downtime in form of mostly very boring and annoying  gamemodes and really bad map design. In most gamemodes  you have to camp most of the time in small rooms or small areas to charge up your objective, in order to win.There is, for example, some very bad thought out king of the hill variant where you have to stand literaly most of the round in a 5 meter big circle which spawns and despawns on different places on the map and arent allowed to leave this circle if you want to score points.So you basically have to camp the whole round in a 5 meter big area of the map! In two other gamemodes called uplink and overcharge  you have to bring the objective from the middle of the map into a small room (on every map its a small room!!) near your spawnarea and then protect it there as long as it charges up to 100 %. Who builds campy gamemodes like this where you have to play most of the time on the least interesting spots of the maps?
<br>
<br>I have nothing against games which have only objective based gamemodes. But those games should at least then make sure that their objective based gamemodes are actualy fun to play and not totaly unfun clusterf... like most of them are in this game. This game has 4 bad game modes and only 1 good gamemode (turf war), which actual is fun to play.
<br>
<br>30 dollar sounds not much, but i would save my money as long as they refuse to fix their gamemodes, or at least let the player pick the gamemode they want to play and dont randomly spawn you into a mode you dont want to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7455468">Expand</a></span>

The mechanics are on point, the pace is exhilarating, and the attention to detail is impressive. As if all of this is not enough of a reason to pick up this title for the $30 price tag, the developer team behind Lawbreakers is truly one of a kind. The reputations of the individual members of Boss Key not withstanding, the team as a whole is present and they are treating this title as a service that they hope to continue to provide for many years rather than a one-off money maker. The devs regularly frequent Discord and the official forums, answering questions and taking note of feedback.

It is only 30 bucks, provides a unique experience, and caters to various play styles. Did you like Unreal Tournament and Quake back in the day? Then this is your jam. Please support these devs, they did a fantastic job and have provided us with a game that is genuinely fun, not P2W in anyway, and gives us some amazing moments in regards to the zero gravity and fast as hell pace of the firefights.

Give it 4 games modes and 7 maps (with three new ones in dev) and put it out there.
<br>
<br>Is it going to be huge? No. This is not a franchise like Overwatch, The characters are mostly generic badasses (with some notable exceptions like Nash and Maverick) and the visual style, while very nice, is a little generic overall. But if you want fast and fresh gameplay, you&apos;ve got that in Lawbreakers. You&apos;ve got it out the arse.
<br>
<br>Combat is fast, very fast, if you&apos;ve never played an AFPS like UT or Quake before, you&apos;ll be smashed. You need fast reflexes and the ability to **** aim at fast moving targets to even be competent in this game.
<br>
<br>This means that ultimately Lawbreakers is not for everyone, and it will slowly grow over time but it will never be a behemoth like Overwatch because it&apos;s simply too hard. It&apos;s a niche game and if you&apos;re in that niche, you&apos;ll love it. Otherwise, this might not be for you.
<br>
<br>Matches are still easy to find though. On average I queue about 20-30 seconds to find a game and if it goes longer then one minute just requeue and you&apos;ll find a new match easy. Even with the low player count, no one is just letting the game sit idle right now.
<br>
<br>This being said there are some issues. Firstly the voice chat in the game depends on Discord and often does not work properly. Also there is no ability to switch teams in a casual game, something that it is largely agreed should be in the game. Finally you can&apos;t join a group or invite someone to join one without returning to the main menu. A minor issue but it is annoying.
<br>
<br>Either way it&apos;s a well balanced (yes really, if you know how to play) and decently polished game that makes up for what it lacks in presentation with some incredible gameplay. Solid game at a cheap price too at well under standard RRP. I paid $60 AUD for the preorder pack after playing the beta for a while and even that is about $30 cheaper then the average launch price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7461988">Expand</a></span>

Just skill baby.  Sound engineering is superb, soundtrack is rad.  Can&apos;t speak highly enough about this game.  I LOVE IT - already 33 hours in.</span>

It&apos;s got interesting controls and mixes up typical fps gameplay quite well. After a few games however, I started to realize that what I thought was me being bad because I was learning the game seems to be more of a class balancing issue. The mobility aspect of the game is really cool, but classes with less mobility are at a distinct disadvantage. The assassin and wraith classes both seem overpowered since they can drop most other classes before you have any time to react, and with their quick movement it isn&apos;t hard for them to be constantly behind your team harassing you. I&apos;ve played games with class disparities and that have high skill caps, and I&apos;m not always the top of my team. That being said, this is the first time I&apos;ve felt helpless in a game. When you first get hit by an assassin that&apos;s behind you, you&apos;re pretty much dead unless you can react with ungodly speed and get them off you. Wraiths slide in from nowhere and kill you before you have a chance to do anything, and the only remedy is either great team work or hiding in corners all the time.
<br>
<br>This is mostly personal preference, and maybe it&apos;s a bit early to tell but it was way more frustrating than any game experience I&apos;ve had before. Hopefully they work on balancing over the next few weeks and it&apos;ll be less annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7455106">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I feel like Cliffy B continues to prove himself to be one of the most overrated minds in recent gaming, and he is coasting on the success of Gears of War with every article he writes and his games are proving the same.
<br>
<br>Since some don&apos;t seem to get this aspect unless it&apos;s shoved in their face so: this is clearly my opinion on this game. Your mileage may vary. If you enjoy Lawbreakers, awesome. Game on. Fun is what it is all about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7472369">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is not actually a proper review, just played for 5 or 6 hours, but I&apos;ve asked for the opinion of some of the community on Reddit, and I have my own ideas on the game, this is what I&apos;ve sum up, and there&apos;s a lot to talk about this game if you have the time and patience to listen.
<br>
<br>Lawbreakers it&apos;s a twitch arena FPS that tries to emulate that old Quake stile games based on skills and map knowledge.
<br>
<br>Pretty much there&apos;s no story in this game, at least one that makes any sense, so let&apos;s forget about that. For most players that&apos;s not important, but I have to mention that. Even the characters have no backstories and are kinda undifferentiated, and most times I didn&apos;t even know if I was one of the good or bad guys.
<br>
<br>It has a good number of maps, but they are almost all very similar and not very exciting. Generically they all follow the same scheme, a flanking route and an in your face straightforward path to the objective that usually is in a central open low gravity field. There was one exception that I&apos;ve loved, Vertigo map that was so open and allowed me so much more strategical options that I could spend an entire day just playing that one.
<br>
<br>Graphics are vibrant, with a large spectrum of colors without being childish or cartoonish, but sometimes it&apos;s a bit confusing when we are engaged in a mid to long range 1v1.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve liked the sounds from weapons, they are distinct, but sometimes I had some trouble distinguishing the hitmakers from the other sounds around.
<br>
<br>2 &#x2013; GAMEPLAY
<br>
<br>As usual in the genre we play a 5v5 team match. The game modes are more or less the same from other games, except blitzzball where we have to do something similar so score goals, but it&apos;s essentially another capture the flag with a twist. We have 9 characters each one with different roles. They are quite distinct and they&apos;ve seemed balanced. Even the community didn&apos;t mention overpowered classes when I
<br>
<br>discuss the game in reddit, so that seems not to be an issue. It&apos;s easy to try them out and quickly you will understand witch one you like the most.
<br>
<br>The key feature about this game is the low gravity fights, and when you get the hang of those they are quite cool and satisfying. Really thumbs up here. Also, the skill cap to master this feature is quite high. Not so high as I was expecting, but even so we are easily played around by a more experienced player, and that&apos;s how it should be. Despite that is quite easy to get into the game and take fun out of him.
<br>
<br>When the low grav is so important in a game I found strange that most times the choke points are inside small rooms where we are permanently hitting the ceiling and objects, making the battles chaotic and sometimes disorientating. On most maps the objective is inside a room, and the playerbase is so small that any try to make a custom match just to choose the maps will end up in a empty match. It&apos;s annoying.
<br>
<br>Now the game has a competitive mode, but maybe too little, too late. I&apos;ve queued several times, two or three times for over five minutes without being able to find a match, so I was unable to play any competitive game whatsoever in this free trial.
<br>
<br>That leaves us with quickplay. Almost zero communication and teamplay, but also almost any toxicity that I&apos;ve noticed.
<br>
<br>3 &#x2013; CONCLUSION
<br>
<br>Lawbreakers is quite a good game. Gameplay is rather good, it has good game modes, well designed characters and team roles, well balanced. Easy to get into, very mechanically rewarding, since the better players will almost always outperform worse ones.
<br>
<br>What went wrong then?
<br>
<br>The game does not have much content at the time, and even I noticed that it can become boring quite quickly.
<br>
<br>Despite being good and balanced the game does not excels in nothing particularly, so people had stick around their previous games. The genre is now oversaturated and players need something outstanding to change for their main titles, just the overall quality of gameplay is not enough nowadays.
<br>
<br>For a newcomer is not easy to find balanced matches because there&apos;s no matchmaking, just a match balance. In the other team it will surely be a good player that will dominate all newcomers, that will not have a proper learning curve. There&apos;s no kill cam so you have no chance to learn with your mistakes, and believe me when I say that half of the times you will not understand how someone killed you. It&apos;s hard for a casual, that will learn even slowly.
<br>
<br>Now people like the loot and shiny stuff, and Lawbrakers&apos; crates give uninteresting stuff, seems there&apos;s no shiny reward for our effort.
<br>
<br>It seems also that at some point changes were made to the game that annoyed original players. That didn&apos;t work well. Even assuming that the changes where overall good, they have upset the current players that left, and didn&apos;t attracted new players to the game, since the player count was quite low.
<br>
<br>Well, not enough characters left. tl;dr, just give this game some love guys!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7736384">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What I like about this game the most is that every class or role in-game can actually heavy frag! Support that can actually get kills? Check.
<br>Fun game overall? Check
<br>Intense? Check
<br>Need&apos;s a LOT of skill? Check
<br>Team based game? Check
<br>Suitable for competitive scene? Check
<br>Spectator mode? Check
<br>
<br>I mean.. yeah. It is worth to at least try it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lawbreakers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7527980">Expand</a></span>
