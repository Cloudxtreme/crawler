<br>
<br>I thoroughly enjoyed this game, unlike a selection of the critics who have slated it on the basis of its &quot;sense of humour&quot;, which is a blindingly unfair criticism of a game whose dialogue is procedurally generated. If you pay closer attention to what is actually going on, it&apos;s quite clear to see that this game itself is a comment on the state of the gaming industry and the state of us as players, and our nurtured expectations. Offering a very meta criticism of narrative and how violence is justified in modern games. Take a second to look past all the &quot;willybag&quot;s and &quot;pissflaps&quot;, and actually pay attention to the overall message.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun and challenging game who has the ability to understand an entire sentence rather than getting hung up on individual words.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/not-a-hero/user-reviews?user_review_id=5260213">Expand</a></span>

The Bunny Lord character isn&apos;t as funny as it thinks it is but thankfully it&apos;s skippable.

<br>It&apos;s a very funny game and I&apos;m looking forward to the port over to PS4 and Vita along with Broforce. If nothing, you&apos;ll laugh if you have a twisted sense of humour.

After the seminal OlliOlli and OlliOlli2, Rool7 decided that they would be best followed up with a crude political satire, just in time for the UK general election. And there&apos;s a lot of potential in the barmy premise: a bunch of assassins help a bunny who&apos;s travelled back in time in his electoral campaign by bumping off crime around town in the most violent ways imaginable. The game plays out like a 2D cover shooter where you cower behind whatever before moving in for the kill. The level design, however, gets rather repetitive. It&apos;s mostly the same corridors where you take down two or more enemies in each corridor, with the minimal amount done to spice it up each time. So yes, it&apos;s repetitive, but I can live with that when the actual game plays out so well each time. The cover mechanic does keep you on your toes and remains challenging. On top of that, the music is brill. Not a Hero is not the beautifully streamlined treat that was OlliOlli, but the fun aesthetics and mechanics will make it a good selection for most - just not an essential one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/not-a-hero/user-reviews?user_review_id=5849588">Expand</a></span>

Most of characters are useless, and not suitable even for beating some special levels. And characters unlocked later often not better then previous ones. I&apos;ve beaten almost whole game with two-shot shotgun guy, because of his speed and silent execution - why someone even need more?
<br>Most frustrating thing is being knocked by an enemy, who supposed to be tuckled. Better - be shot in air by same guy. Almost instant death. But sometimes happens even better thing - you stuck between two **** punching you back and forward, and slowly killing you, dealing one by one shots in between knocks.
<br>Somehow, I&apos;ve beaten this game with Megalord ending. It was kind of fun, but mostly pain in the ass. I think I&apos;m not gonna replay it a lot, except maybe several first levels, when game not behave like spoiled kid - unforgiving, and doing things seemingly just to irritate you.
<br>
<br>But WORST of everything is lagging spikes, followed by FPS-drop. This game is totally about FPS. Some levels are piece of cake, if you turn your Fraps on, in order to slow down game-play a little bit. Other levels are freaking hell, because somehow FPS-drop slows not only enemies, but your gunshot-rate.
<br>
<br>Overall: If you got ice in your veins and balls of steel - that&apos;s not so bad game, have some nice feeling of kick-ass. Otherwise - skip it. You hardly gonna pass middle of the game, and it&apos;s almost impossibly-hardcore to beat last level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/not-a-hero/user-reviews?user_review_id=5324444">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s addictive like crack and plays like butter. This game is meant for perfectionists and completionists, so if you&apos;re not into games like &quot;Super Meat Boy&quot; I&apos;d suggest steering clear.</span>

<br>
<br>The classic mechanic of beat this stage and complete these objectives in order to unlock a specific ending.
<br>
<br>Some gameplay issues that should be fix are IMO:
<br>- A specific button to execute on the ground, sometimes fails to do it.
<br>- Others: icons better visible (stunt), stacking of corpses sometimes can not  allow you to see the alive enemies.</span>

<br>
<br>The game has you work for Bunnylord (a purple rabbit from the future) in his quest to become Mayor and save the world by stamping out crime in the most exteme way possible and thereby winning voter confidence.  You begin as Steve as balaclava, gun-toting mercenary, but as the game progresses, you unlock further characters, each with their own abilities, weaponry and distinct personalities (and regional accents).
<br>
<br>Each level has one promary goal, and three secondary goals.  The primary objectives are generally quite easy, but its those pesky secondary objectives that will have you retrying missions over and over and over and over and over (repeat until you get the point) again.
<br>
<br>I loved this game.  The gameplay is simple but fun and the humour is spot on. I&apos;ve continued to play long after the completing the levels.  Its just too much fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/not-a-hero/user-reviews?user_review_id=6228913">Expand</a></span>
