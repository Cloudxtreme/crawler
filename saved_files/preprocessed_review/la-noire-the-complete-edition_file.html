Despite some people claiming its the users fault, the game is simply not optimized for some hardware. Numerous reviews have also commented on the less than acceptable FPS on many systems.I am playing on a Intel Duo core 3ghz, 4gb ram and geforce 560 ti, and even on low it is unplayable. I can run Shogun 2 and Skyrim in full glory, no FPS slowdown whatsoever. There is no reason why LA Noire needs a quad core to run acceptably on low using a mid range system. The fault lies with a shoddy port, not with peoples&apos; systems. If you make a port, do it right, or don&apos;t do it at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1846154">Expand</a></span>

I am playing it on a pc with 2x 1gig 4870`s in Crossfire,8 gig of ram and a AMD Phenom BE quad core @3Ghz and i cannot get this game to play smooth at all. I have gone from CF to a single card,had settings on max,had settings reduced,changed GPU drivers but nothing helps which is a big shame because i think its a brilliant game. The thing i don`t get tho is that apart from the characters faces the graphics arn`t all that,i can run Crysis better than this game and that game is in a completely different league when it comes to graphics. I thought that when this was released later for the pc that they had not just ported it from console but it seems that they have done just that.Also the controls are a bit awkward but with all that said,i do think its a clever game,not just some shoot`em up,it does get you thinking,lets just hope that with the second one,they iron out the faults and its because of these faults it only gets a 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2089271">Expand</a></span>

Then there&apos;s the interrogation segments, which regularly involve your character verbally abusing a suspect when you chose to &quot;doubt&quot; them, followed by you apologizing and backtracking. The whole interrogation system is just too illogical and unpredictable: you have no idea what your character will actually say, given any particular option, and backing up your accusations relies on having previously discovered particular clues--catching them in a lie or making reasonable deductions doesn&apos;t seem to count for much. One thing the game does do well is providing a detailed and convincing environment of 1940&apos;s LA, and the facial graphics are pretty advanced. But these aren&apos;t enough to make LA Noire more than a mediocre game in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2823511">Expand</a></span>

The game has been capped at 30 frames per second, this can be removed via the latest patch and a -60fps command. So I won&apos;t mark that against the game. The game also requires a very powerful pc to be able to run at 60 frames per second. It is choppy and unplayable on lower end hardware. If you have a duel core cpu and a low end gpu, take this as a warning. Now, onto the actual game. La noir is a breath of fresh air, taking cue&apos;s from adventure games in it&apos;s mystery solving, focus on clues, and providing you with the successful illusion that you are solving them. It tells a long and involved story though a string of murders you have to solve, that delves into the territory of serial killers, police corruption and more, and it allows you to travel around an open world while doing so. This alone is enough to cement this game in an interesting heavy rain territory. However it goes a step further by introducing some facinating and downright impressive face animation mapping technology - and implements it in an innovative and involving way. You have to actually study peoples faces to gauge their honesty/personality, and make final decisions that rely entirely on your very own instincts. Putting actual detective skills in the players hands is so worthy of praise - that it makes other game&apos;s &quot;new and innovative features&quot; seem dull and lifeless in comparison. When you are as ambitious as this game is however - there will always be a price. In this case the main issue this game has is the outcomes for failing/succeeding. They mostly lead to the same results. Guess wrongly? You still progress in the same way minus a few points that can unlock intuition points (a free answer, basically). This makes your actual detective skills feel consequence free. And that&apos;s a shame. In the end, what the game does provide - is unique. Entertaining. Sometimes emotional. An experience like nothing else on the market. If you don&apos;t have a monster pc - get the ps3 version instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2160401">Expand</a></span>

I would like to play through scenes a little more specifically rather than doing every case over from the beginning to try and obtain a perfect score (the save and load features didn&apos;t seem that obvious). This is a good game, but if you&apos;re buying this based off of &quot;I like GTA&quot; then this might not be for you. While the game does have a GTA feel, it is not really a sandbox and they give you the option to let your partner drive you to locations for a reason (saving time, and causing city damage lowers your score). This is a game for people who like point and click adventures, mystery games, or puzzle games more than a game like GTA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2073739">Expand</a></span>

As far as graphics and gameplay complaints voiced by others, I did not experience any problems whatsoever. I ran the game on full graphics with minimal tweaks and did not experience any framerate or crash issues at all. The detail level was fairly impressive. This game will keep you busy for a day or two, but after that, you&apos;ll either be finished or bored, and it&apos;s replay value is non-existant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2112943">Expand</a></span>

This game is about interrogation and I think it&apos;s a great idea but sometimes I get the feeling that you can&apos;t really predict anything Detective Phelps is gonna say nor do I know if there is anything to back up doubts or accusations. This feels kinda blurry to me and crashes the fun a bit because you&apos;re not being rewarded. And even if you get 90% of the questions in a case right the tall grump (your boss) is gonna diminish your police work - that sucks at best!
<br>Okay, away from that main point to game mechanics:
<br>Walking and driving feels dull and clumpy. Your mouse won&apos;t respond the way you&apos;d expect. Thanks for porting the game so badly... The shooting sequences should&apos;ve either been taken out of the game or done better - those are really boring to be honest. Run. Duck. Wait for the others to reload. Quick shooting session. Done. Always the same. I don&apos;t even want to get started on certain bugs as auto climbing failing to work, your keyboard/mouse input is just being ignored by the game and so on...
<br>Conclusive it is a decent game with a very neat idea and overall awesome facial expressions that unfortunately WON&apos;T give you any hint what people are up to... sad but true. So it&apos;s either me and my minimalized mind for crime or really the game. That&apos;s why 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4070500">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m also incredibly fond of all the characters, and the animation is brilliant, particularly the expressions. LA is beautiful, and so are its cars. Someone really knows their history as well, and it shows. Over all, excellent and under rated game.</span>

I think the facial animations are not that good. They seem accurate to the dialog, but look like blending over images from a 3D scanner: teeth and lips morph into a goo of polygons.... Driving through this city is horrible. Despite you are a cop obeying the traffic laws, other cars stop in front of you at green lights for no reason or pedestrians run in front of your car, dropping their bags, turning around, heading a totally different direction and don&apos;t give a damn about their missing stuff. Do people actually not want to go somewhere!? Are they just aimlessly wandering around!? Interrogation is also difficult. You can tell, when people are holding back or lying to you (looking around after the statement). But it is weird, that it is incorrect to accuse them of a lie using a piece of evidence on them, where it was correct to doubt their statement, where the dialog uses exactly that evidence you originally failed with (replayed the game). Street crimes are also resolved by killing every armed criminal, no chance to overpower them or persuade them to give up like &quot;Hey, I just shot your ten friends! Do you want to die as well!?&quot; This makes so little sense. *** The game has its good ideas but some of them are poorly executed. Details the player sees cannot be pointed out in the game (Lemma of player knowledge vs. character knowledge). Some general things are repetitive and annoying (better let your partner drive when you can!). It is -- as said -- a diamond in the rough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4008438">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay itself is typical from the publisher of GTA, perhaps a bit more pedestrian than usual (in terms of combat), but it was easily made up by the enjoyable car physics (and various things your partner would say while running into a variety of things...always entertaining) as well as the incredible gumshoe framework. Gathering clues and interviewing people never got boring. The most disappointing part of the game for me, in the end, is actually the finale: yet another gigantic combat scenario with a finish that left a HUGE bitter taste in my mouth. SPOILER: The ending is just awful, imo: everything that Phelps is working toward is completely erased, and his memory is pissed upon at his funeral, with the corruption of the police establishment firmly intact. I suppose that there&apos;s hope that the honest ADA who remains could, over time, fight for less corruption, but it would have been nice to have more details about what happened in the future, so that I didn&apos;t feel like all the work I put into my character was all for nothing. Not being able to bring the chief of police down is a MAJOR disappointment, and although it might have been &quot;historically accurate&quot; it left the plot completely unsatisfying. Makes me less sad that the developer went out of business after the production of this game: they clearly aren&apos;t very good at plot endings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2137424">Expand</a></span>

The crime solving and scouring for clues and reading peoples face expressions are all just so damn fun to do and you get a real sense of accomplishment when you correctly call someone out who was lying. The groundbreaking technology used for the facial expressions is amazing, unfortunately not every character in the game has it so the animations for those characters looks really bad when they are side-by-side with one that does. Also, sometimes people will do the exact same thing when they tell the truth and when they lie, making telling the difference quite difficult. The game also has numerous &quot;noobie friendly&quot; features such as intuition points that can show you locations of clues or tell you whether someone is lying. If you fail a chase sequence or shootout a few times in a row you will get the option to skip it and continue on with the crime solving.

<br>Unfortunately this game has a large amount of bugs and flaws. I have only played the PC version so I am not sure if some of these are specific to the PC version or not. The sound can glitch during some cutscenes. I had the sound of my machinegun firing throughout an entire cutscene a few times and then it continued after as well, forcing me to quit the game and restart. The actors use modern lingo a few times such as &quot;legit&quot; and that really bothered me as the voice acting was suberb and lingo from the 40&apos;s was prevalent throughout. Sometimes cars will just disappear off the screen. THis one was quite common and I found cars just vanishing from my screen as I approached an intersection. The controls are floaty and when you run you feel like you are that fat cop who eats donuts all day instead of an agile ex-marine. The combat and cover system is bad. I would commonly fund myself unable to move through my cover, leave cover or even go into it. You can still get shot while behind cover. Aiming isn&apos;t fluid and you will often find your crosshair skipping along. I can see why the xbox version had aim assist as it is just hard to do manually. The graphics on weapons isn&apos;t very good, but the effects of the guns shooting and the recoil of them is very well done.
<br>
<br>There are a lot of collectible that are made easy to find by the Rockstar Social Club which lists all of your accomplishments in detail on their site. The story was great and the ending was great as well (But it seems some people didn&apos;t feel this way) The big twist that came near the end of the game was seemingly out of nowhere, i&apos;m not really sure why the character did that but what came after that point was a more sensible, easier to follow story that i really enjoyed. The biggest problem i had, and this was prevalent on all version of the game, is that the FPS lags a ton. THis is very noticeable during driving sessions as your vehicle will skip forward. Luckily you can fast travel anywhere in the world which is great. Overall, the uniqueness of this game makes it well worth a look, but there are many flaws to bring it down. Do careful research before purchasing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2308329">Expand</a></span>

It follows a very linear style as it is, what I consider to be, &quot;mission driven.&quot;  With such a large city, I was shocked that you can only explore it while on a mission/scenario.  With the &quot;random&quot; events happening within a scenario which you can choose to do, or skip, it&apos;s up to you.  It&apos;s not as free roaming like GTA.  Hopefully a next version will make it a free flowing and working city, that&apos;s more open, with the story elements tied in.  Overall, a good game, especially if you got it during Steam&apos;s Summer sale at $4.99.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2538245">Expand</a></span>

Over all this game is pretty solid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2531185">Expand</a></span>

Rockstar&apos;s woefully-terrible DRM methods made trying to get this game to even start almost impossible until the first patch. After that, the loading times, and general stuttering of the game made it unplayable most times. It&apos;s really unfortunate, too, because I played a bit of the console version and was just blown away. While the PC version has potential of playing just as well, Rockstar really needs to nail down the performance issues before this game can ever be thoroughly enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2278543">Expand</a></span>

All in all, the story is great, the characters are enjoyable, the ending could have been definitely better. With the exception of shooting and driving, the controls are often awkward, remembering it is a console port. The graphics are great. The city is big, but the interaction with it is limited to what pertains to the cases you are working on. The investigation is good, the questioning and intuition system is a great addition. For most people, it is a one play through game. For completionists, they will probably have a second play through. With the lack of alternate endings, I doubt I will play it over again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2809049">Expand</a></span>

Games like Just Cause 2 have better graphics, more textures and more amazing visuals with half that lag. What helped my performance was to run the game in single processor mode; for some reason, it ran faster since then. Now: about the game itself. It&apos;s cinematically a masterpiece, it feels like you&apos;re watching real actors - which you are! The story is the only reason to play this game, however, as the gameplay is just an excuse for progressing through the story and is nothing amazing. The funnest part of the gameplay is to watch the interviewed characters and decide if they are lying or not by their facial expressions, and to select the evidence that counters their claims. Although the game is not nearly challenging enough, or even challenging for a detective game, I found it satisfying to detect when the subjects were lying for the sheer satisfaction of being right. Otherwise, there is no real penalty apart from lengthened missions. I&apos;d say this game is on par with games like bioshock, so I&apos;m rating it a 7, for its unmatched acting, great story and good integration of detective work, however with some issues like being a laggy PC port, lacking challenge and having a boring gameplay if you strip away the story elements.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2530388">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3014666"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I just completed this game. At least the main &quot;case load&quot; including DLC. While I found the overall gameplay experience joyful at times I also found it quite tedious other times as well. Overall I rate this game a bit above mediocre.
<br>I must give Rockstar props. Its an original concept no-one has ever tried before. I am a fan of Film Noire and so when I learned that a game based upon the same style and philosophy was being created I was very excited. In practice, sadly, I&apos;ve got to say the plot of the game often disappoints. It is frustrating in the middle of the game when you know full well your fingering innocent people for the black dahlia murders but have no real option other than to arrest innocent people for the crimes. Case completed! You locked up some innocent sap. The main plot line of the game doesn&apos;t really rise up except in newspaper clippings until you are 2/3 through the game and I found that disappointing as well. You never really see the bad guy&apos;s get the comeuppance. One of them is killed by the doctor who gets choked by his own servant later on (So you weren&apos;t involved at all) and another gets shot in the leg. Thats it. As well there is the bizarre move for you to take command of another avatar for 3 of the last 4 missions. You&apos;ve been playing as Phelps for the entire game and his blank by the book manner is great if not tiring after a while but why switch to a different protagonist? Or if your going to go that route integrate it into the whole game experience. Not just the last couple of missions. Strange.
<br>
<br>This brings me to my largest complaint of the game. Mismanagement of time allocation. How much time does it take to program a set of pipes? Some. And yet you need to &quot;build&quot; them to fine a piece is missing and it counts as a clue. There are some odd finesse pieces in the game that are often completely retarded. Swear to god. Only game I&apos;ve ever played that required me to use an in game calculator. And guess what? Its less intuitive and harder to control than the actual calculator that comes with windows. All to unlock a clue. What sort of skill testing is that? What were they thinking?
<br>I could understand these points if the main body of the game was more polished but they aren&apos;t. As others have complained the driving mechanic (where you end up spending about 50% of your time) is reminiscent of one of the early GTA games. We know they have better code for a driving mechanic than that. Why? The shooting mechanic is also sub optimal. Either pretend bullets are endless or show how many you&apos;ve got left. Nothing like your big gun running out mid fight only to have to go back to you handgun. Some of the &quot;street crimes&quot; were rewarding however I eventually began to dread them. It&apos;s like they were programmed to pop up on the farthest corner of the map at the least opportune times to stretch the game out. Additionally I liked the unlockable cars even if they all drove somewhat badly. However being unable to trigger street crimes in them meant I stopped using them and didn&apos;t go back. The main feature of the game was the &quot;interview&quot; mechanic. It was certainly the most hyped feature. However in practice I found it became like taking a quiz after a while. And as pointed out before sometimes the evidence for a lie made no sense whatsoever. In practice I ended up doing each interview multiple times and quitting before it saved so I could repeat it until I got the &quot;right&quot; answer. Not the most enjoyable experience. Especially when I had to re-search a scene before the interview. Overall though its not a bad game. It is a finished product. There were some novel elements and fun to be had. They did a good job of the noire feel while driving between clues, and at a lot of the cut scenes.  It just easily could have been a better game. With a bit better direction and a smarter plot. If they had re-focused their energies on the components most used it would have been a better experience. The last mission for instance you get a flamethrower right before the end but it is so horrible to use you wish you could go back to your handgun to take out the last 6 thugs. Outside of gameplay I should comment I had major issues with the game installation for the first time in my life (And I am a quite seasoned gamer). The necessary download patch that came out after I purchases a hard copy of the game failed to install correctly preventing me from playing the game and it was a month before they released an improved patch which fixed it. Rockstar tech support is a step above useless it turns out.   Lastly I&apos;d like to point out to anyone looking to purchase this game. According to Rockstar social club 9% of the people who started this game are doing the last missions or more likely finished the game. They show a nice breakdown of which 1/5 of the game people are in. It looks like a lot of people got 1/4 to half way into the game and quit because the numbers didn&apos;t change the entire month I played</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3014666">Expand</a></span>

Narrative is top-notch, and the overall setting is authentic enough for most of gamers to immerse themselves into this game. I can confidently say that L.A. Noire is just like GTA, but taking place in 1950&apos;s Hollywood. This means, that L.A. Noire suffers same shortcomings that GTA has also suffered.
<br>
<br>I want to start off with interrogation system first, as it is the main focus of the game. Here, you need to find out whether suspect is hiding something or speaking truly by looking at their facial animations. Then, players can choose three options after listening to the suspects  you can either believe them, doubt them, or prove them that they are lying. This is where the problems with interrogation sequence kicks in  There are no place for player&apos;s reasonings to come in. You just choose one of three options, and your avatar  Cole Phelps or his sidekick will do come up with all the reasonings. It is fatal flaw for game that focuses heavily on investigations for its gameplay. Rather than feeling like detective in 50s, it feels more like watching detective film. That said, if you buy this game looking for action, you better look for other games.
<br>
<br>This is same problem suffered by the GTA series. You&apos;ll feel freedom when you&apos;re racing through highway with cops on your tail, but there are little to no freedom regarding what you do in in-game missions. In L.A. Noire, whole game is basically an in-game mission of GTA, so there aren&apos;t any freedom in it, except maybe running over some innocent citizen with bouquet on their hand. Lack of freedom leads to one conclusion  L.A. Noire didn&apos;t do well enough to utilize its open world setting. Although there are whole world to explore, after finding few hidden cars and solving emergency dispatch missions, you&apos;ll just going to hear lot of &quot;straight through the intersection.&quot; You&apos;ll find the open world interesting at first, but it will just all come down to boring rollercoaster ride once the amazement has weared off.
<br>
<br>The action part of the game is... questionable. Since it is an adventure game that focuses on the investigation, it is normal that the action part cannot compare to other AAA quality TPS games. One might argue that the action part is good enough for games like this, but one might also argue that the developers could&apos;ve done better job with it. It depends on your perspective really, so there aren&apos;t much to say to it. Only problems I&apos;ve found is that each emergency dispatch missions basically all boils down to &quot;run from point A to point B&quot; or &quot;Shoot all the baddies&quot; or &quot;Smash baddies&apos; car&quot;, or &quot;run point A to point B, shoot all the baddies in process and smash baddies&apos; car&quot; so even though there are over 40 emergency dispatch missions, there aren&apos;t a lot of incentives to play it unless you want to desperately prolong your playtime of this game.
<br>
<br>So, from what I just said, L.A. Noire just looks like a adventure game with questionable action sequence and questionable investigation sequence, but here is a catch  this game is heavily narrative driven, and L.A. Noire does supreme job with their narrative. Believable settings, authentic looks and reference to the 50&apos;s culture all adds up for great narrative factor. This game feels like watching detective film, but a good one at that. Also, all those flaws I&apos;ve listed, I didn&apos;t notice it until I completed the whole story mode. Each cases in story mode takes almost an hour to complete, and even more if you&apos;re looking for all five-star completion. There are many cases to solve in this game. So, what are you waiting for? grab your fedora and detective badge. The case isn&apos;t going to solve itself, right?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3843771">Expand</a></span>

The city of L.A. is beautifully presented but somehow doesn&apos;t feel alive. Do not expect a well optimized port.</span>

Since all these elements are woven around the same story, it really works, at first. After about five or six cases, it loses its luster somewhat. The foot chases, gun fights, and fist fights are too easy. The car chases are easy too as long as you remap your keyboard so that you are driving with two hands. The interrogations are HARD. Even if I read all your evidence carefully, and review your conversation log, and look carefully at the expressions of the suspect, I still get the answer wrong almost half the time. When you get an answer wrong, you often miss out on evidence that is necessary for later interrogations. So once you start bad, things just go downhill.  The case always &quot;solves itself&quot; at the end no matter how bad you screw up the interrogations, and it does this in a very confusing way. It is very frustrating because you can tell you have missed out on half the story. I have replayed some of the cases using a walkthrough, and found out there were big chunks of the story that I completely missed because I botched the interrogations. I replayed a few cases hoping that I could learn to do better on the interrogations, but it hasn&apos;t helped yet. The concept of the detective part of the game is very cool, but in the end too difficult and frustrating. The action part of the game is a little too easy and a little too repetitive. The graphics are very good, the facial detail, the period music and details are great, clearly a AAA game in terms of production values. It seems like this game went straight from concept to game, without any play-testing to calibrate the gameplay to a level where it is challenging but still fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2895998">Expand</a></span>

It&#xB4;s on the PC yes, but non or less the game has to be played with a controller, because you have to sit in a comfortable chair and enjoy the world. The graphics are not as beautiful as people expected. The new technology which has been used for the facial expression which is a essential gameplay factor in this game, let animations be so smooth and realistic that you think this game was touched by god! The game is mainly about being a detective solving cases so if you are more the action guy, you shouldn&#xB4;t buy this game especially because all the action happens only in side quests. The side quests are emergency calls from your police station, you can answer to in your police car. Sometimes you have to stop a bank robbery and sometimes smaller things like killing some gunmen. The story is fantastic and well written and you will suck it up fast. So the game is good, it has it&#xB4;s flaws in graphics and it has not enough action for most people, but everything else is just perfect. WELL, the PC port is not quite as good as the console versions. The framerate is limited to 30 frames because that gives the game a movie like feeling. I understand that. No fps drops though, its stable, but they  up DX11. DX9 runs smooth, but DX11 has some technical issues for some. Just test it out. It&#xB4;s recommended to play the game with a controller, but the mouse and keyboard works fine too. Despite the fact that the technical side of the game is non or less weak except for the animations which are the best ever seen, the game is really only for slow paste type guys who like a adventure with case solving elements. Go and get it, lick the sexy looking box and play more than 20 hrs of pure climax! OH before i forget it: GET A  QUADCORE YOU HILLBILLY! What do you expect? A dev who never developed for PC to optimize the game on your oldass Dual Core which can&#xB4;t even play Black Ops straight?  you should get a console then, you poor bastard. OR maybe getting a new job.

Noire&#xFEFF;, the execution leaves much to be desired. Do not buy on PC unless you are patient with crappy mechanics/sloppy concept execution and the game is on megasale.
<br>
<br>The most challenging aspect of this game is overcoming the  game mechanics to enjoy the story. The &apos;investigation&apos; part is less about finding clues and more about walking around designated spaces and waiting for a chime. You don&apos;t have to figure out what objects are relevant since the game does it for you. You can&apos;t go first person and you don&apos;t get a visible cursor meaning this &quot;detective&quot; game isn&apos;t about attention to detail or finding clues as much as it pretends to be. So if it&apos;s not about this it must be about the interrogation and using social finesse to get the truth out of people, right?
<br>
<br>Yet, if that&apos;s the case why are interrogations are linear rather than dynamic? They are an it&apos;s A (truth) B (doubt) or C (lie) right or wrong type situation. If you get it wrong, that line of questioning is shut down. This means you can&apos;t accuse people of lying or doubt them to get them to reveal more information like feeling desperate to prove they are telling the truth. It therefore becomes formulaic and repetitive interrogating people; if you think they are telling the truth you pick truth, if you don&apos;t think they are doubt them unless you have solid evidence. You don&apos;t have any control over the tone of what your character says or any notion of what he will say when you select something (he nearly always comes off rude). It takes all the subtly out of the art of interrogation and the control of the interrogation out of the player&apos;s hands. That does leave you with trying to read body language and determine if someone is lying and that&apos;s interesting but it takes all the fun out of it when you can&apos;t purposefully choose to say things, even if untrue, to gauge their reactions.
<br>
<br>Reason I give it a 5? There&apos;s excellent acting and the fun of driving around like a maniac GTA style but not much else. I still want to know what happens in the story. It&apos;s just one of those games I have to force myself to finish just to say I played it all the way through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3239232">Expand</a></span>

Facial expressions are great they could give you just information you need to call someone on a lie and get viable information for the case. I&apos;ve not seen a game like this yet and that what makes this game so good. I highly recommend to try this game.</span>

<br>I&apos;ve enjoyed my time with L.A. Noire so far though. The voice acting is well done, the lip sync technology is awesome. I&apos;m generally not very peeved off by clunky controls; I get over them quite well. Some people might not though, so you might want to play the game with a controller or on a console.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5400795">Expand</a></span>

Tying the unique tech to an interrogation mechanic is a great idea, though sometimes the interrogations themselves can be frustrating and illogical, even to the point that I&apos;d just restart the mission if it became a wash. Shooting and driving are both passable and functional, except for a frustrating sequence in the finale which involves way more shooting than the rest of the game.
<br>
<br>What I love most about this game is its adherence to Noir style, complete with all the backstabbing intrigue that comes with it. Nearly every Noir trope is in full effect here, and there&apos;s some truly excellent acting to be found, on par with Hollywood productions, probably because there are a great deal of talented character actors involved that you&apos;ll probably recognize from this thing or that. The story is solid and kept me hooked, and its final scene is brilliantly delivered. As with others I&apos;ve enjoyed, this is a game I recommend not for the strength of its mechanics, but for its &quot;feel&quot;, and in terms of making you feel like a hard-boiled Noir detective, you won&apos;t find anything better on the market.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5666176">Expand</a></span>

The setting, the style, the acting, the story, everything is just awesome. It starts pretty good but, you longer you play it&apos;s getting better, better, better,... In the end L.A. Noire is a Masterpiece.&quot;

However, the core gameplay mechanic is a simple guessing game. It&apos;s truly impossible in many places to correctly get the right answer. Often times an accusation + evidence combo that makes perfect sense is not valid and evidence that makes nearly no sense is the correct choice. Google &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; for a prime example of this. If you mess up, that&apos;s it, done, you don&apos;t get to replay that scene and you are likely going to botch the case or miss out on big parts of it. (There are exploits to let you replay things, but no &quot;official&quot; way) The learning curve is non-existent; you have to deduce and see things specifically how the dev/writer imagined as there is only 1 answer to every question.
<br>
<br>I very much want to give this game a higher rating but the core gameplay mechanic is low-effort guessing game. So much wasted potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7202427">Expand</a></span>

It certainly seems to control better than, say, Dead Space 1 or 2 did on the PC.  The acting, story, and facial animations are world-class, and the facial animations really do raise the emotion of the scenes...you can see people&apos;s Adam&apos;s apples move when they gulp, for crying out loud!  Doesn&apos;t sound very important except when you consider that much of what you&apos;re doing in the game is trying to find out if people are lying or not.  I would say this is a GOTY contender if it weren&apos;t for the fact that Arkham City is about to come out, which I assume will dominate.  My only gripe is that the cars handle way too well for cars of that era.  They&apos;re very &apos;sticky&apos;.  It has worked perfectly &apos;out of the box&apos; for me (purchased on Steam), no stability issues at all, except the game crashes whenever I quit.  Obviously that is a non-issue, doesn&apos;t affect the experience at all because it only happens when I quit. I also don&apos;t have any of the frame-rate issues that some are reporting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1898186">Expand</a></span>

It requires a lot of patience and if you&apos;re the type of person who just wants to kill everything in sight and be done with it, this game is not for you. TL;DR ver. Rent. It&apos;s a good game, it just doesn&apos;t have a lot of replay value. I&apos;ve been waiting a while for this to be released on PC and while it&apos;s not the best game I&apos;ve played in a while, it&apos;s still worth checking out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2081102">Expand</a></span>

The game makes you feel like your in the 1940&apos;s. The detective work, which maybe a little easy for some, I found very interesting &amp; exciting. As the levels progress the cases get more detailed and try to keep you guessing. I really didn&apos;t expect to like this as much as I did. 9/10.</span>

The &quot;sand-box&quot;, or &quot;free&quot; style of gameplay however, is very lacking in comparison however.  The game follows the career of a Detective, some &quot;bad-ass&quot; veteran from WW2 and his hijinx.  It would be reasonable to say that this is a cross between an adventure game and a very small part action.  - That said, there is also an &quot;interrogation&quot; mini-game to find clues or whatever.<br>Whilst on the cover it seems to sound pretty damn cool, it is actually let-down by a number of issues.  Firstly, them damn graphics.  I mean, they&apos;d be quite good... if it was released by the same time San Andreas came out.  But by the release, them flickery shadows, and jaggy edges - you can see that they must have been cutting a few corners.  Dated.<br>Secondly- the &quot;motto&quot; of Rockstar, so far, (if you looked at GTA, or even Red Dead)- would be SAND BOX.  This game is VERY linear.  there are &quot;street crime&quot; events that happen in the city, but you&apos;ll be doing the same thing for each  - Chase, shoot, suspect dead, repeat.   To progress the story line, you had to go around interrogating people.  you get 3 options &quot;TRUE&quot; , &quot;FALSE&quot;, or  &quot;DOUBT&quot;. - there were many-a-time I had meant things in a certain way and the detective goes nuts for no reason-poopie!  That said. &gt; you could actually ask mostly wrong questions for all your suspects- then STILL manage to continue the story.  - as punishment, solve street crimes- then carry on the story. pagnnhn!<br><br>Conclusion &gt; I actually had a good time for the first hour or two.  I mean, the story isn&apos;t bad, but it&apos;s vastly inferior to anything that GTA gave out. Graphics? They&apos;re OK.  Game-play?  Not too good- not going to touch this for a LONG time.  Instead of a detective game like I wanted, it was more like a Japanese style graphic novel where you just watch.<br>As a Graphic novel, Im gonna give this a 7, but cos its in the &quot;Games&quot; section, ... 5?  but... I did actually want to know what happened... so.. 6?  yah...<br><br>- I think its time I dug out that copy of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; again,  now THAT was detective work!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334776">Expand</a></span>

GRAPHICS: well face motion capture is awesome, you feel like you are in a movie... The city is big enough and the content is really ok, the stores have 3D fronts having a lot of things in it and also, what is thrilling is that you will see, a lot of non-gameplay places are even detailed, just go to the union station or go into some sight-seeing buildings which you can enter... ANIMATION: Hell yeah, euphoria engine and so on. Which is a bit disappointing are the cars&apos; movement (not the controlling, that is good enough, but see how are cars going on the streets). CONTROLS: good enough, no signs of f****d-up console porting imho. And the challenging part is when you have to aim on bad guys behind boxes and covers, you don&apos;t see the aiming point which is a good thing. STORY: I am in the start-middle of the game but the cases are really awesome, I am currently waiting how things will join together later because there is a big thrilling story behind all cases as I know. The characters are really movie-like, I feel like I am back that time and place and that is what I liked in Mafia for example. Games which can bring you a unique indistinguishable feeling are the greatest of all. Noire feeling is also ok. ORIGINALITY: 99%. OPTIMIZED HARDWARE-USAGE: I did not have problems but i am a kind of exception as I saw, most of the gamers had problems with the game. Let&apos;s hope for a good patch boys and girls. GAMEPLAY: A bit single threaded but a great story have to do this with a game. Just think again of Mafia (of course I talk about the first, the second game was totally sh**). Some other minor things like you can collect cars and take some street calls and go sight-seeing to some dedicated places... The last one and the car collecting I think is a bit ruining the overal gameplay, I mean I am in the middle of a story, I don&apos;t want to go other places. Maybe when I will end the story I start it again and go sight seeing... OVERAL: 10 points where I mean 95% and this 5% minus is for the inconsistency of extra content (i don&apos;t want to interrupt a case for going to sight seeing and so on) and the unoptimized graphics</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1951944">Expand</a></span>

I suppose the detail in the city of LA was fantastic, which, while it was artistically impressive, didn&apos;t add much to the enjoyment of the game.  I&apos;m giving Rockstar a little credit for the effort. I appreciate what they set out to do, but I don&apos;t think it was executed competently.  Firstly, the foundation of the gameplay is crime-solving via scrutiny of simulated facial expression and a collection of evidence. This means you are evaluating the veracity of statements based on the performances of actors (of variable talent) who are all essentially lying (since they are acting) as reinterpreted through the facial rendering engine. This technology is another failure. It looks like nothing more than low res video being played over a 3D model of a human head. All the characters looked like dead-eyed, shifty, slime-faced androids. Many were hard to distinguish. Which brings me to the characters.  There was a lot of content to this game, about 18 hours for me, but it was vastly more concerned with breadth than depth. I never felt invested in any of the characters because none of them felt human. I still don&apos;t understand the motivations of the protagonists. This game could possibly have been something in another studio&apos;s hands, I still find the idea intriguing, but in the state it was released it&apos;s not worth either the investment of time or money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123729">Expand</a></span>

The game I&apos;ve been waiting for Rockstar or someone else to MAKE this game!<br>THE GOOD GUY! This is like Mafia II, but you are the good guy, has great car controls and movement control of the characters. Had Mafia II been able to get their vehicles to control as good as L.A. Noire it would have been almost just as good. Their new facial movement technology really helps you get into the story with way more realism. Call me strange, but I&apos;m always bothered by boxy, jerky mouths and unnatural body movement in cut scenes.<br><br>My only complaint so far is it&apos;s not as &quot;open world&quot; as GTA 4 but there is plenty to do. This game does a good balance between a true to live Police game and a fun action game. Not 100% real, not 100% action and killing. If you are looking for an open world like GTA this might not be the game for you. But if you are looking for a fun game as a Police Officer/Detective with mixed action, clues, shoot outs, chases, investigations, and more, it&apos;s a great game! I gave it a 9 out of 10 and knocked off 1 point because it would have been nice to have either multiplayer or a &quot;FREE RIDE&quot; open world option. THANKS ROCKSTAR for finally coming out with a &quot;GOOD GUY&quot; game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2093252">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t have a great PC at all, but it&apos;s playing very smoothly for me. Quad Core 2.33ghz, gts 450, 3 gigs ram. Maybe because my top resolution is only 1440x900, but I&apos;m not experiencing problems. Great, great game as well.</span>

Amazing acting, with especially the interrogation and investigation scenes jumping out, this game is one to be reckoned with - and to be seen as an examplary piece of storytelling, one that merits further elaboration! So game developers, get your **** together and start hiring the Team Bondi guys as they know where it&apos;s at if you want to make a real game. Thanks a million for bringing back storytelling and adventures to the gaming world in hi-def! Suggestions for improvement: make he interrogations more interactive, maybe with actual dialog / question choices (a la Monkey Island), make the investigations slightly more difficult- but this is the way things should be heading!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2016818">Expand</a></span>

If you have a dual core, you&apos;re so out of luck.  A dual core is no longer considered mid range even.  Even basic boxes all come with dual core.  Quit kidding yourself.<br><br>I also hear this is a bad port.  I got news for you guys, PC&apos;s only represent 10% of the gaming market.  Until the next gen consoles come out that all support DX11, you&apos;re going to have to live with this.  Take Skyrim for example.  You played it yet.  Don&apos;t expect a massive improvement from Oblivion.  Despite the 4 years, it&apos;s still DX9, why...  Why do you think.<br><br>The facial animation on this is outstanding.  Go play Skyrim.  Tell me what you think.  Also, if you&apos;re looking for COD non stop action, you really should not be playing a detective game.  Put it one way, in Skyrim, you&apos;re walking for 90% if the time.  COD, its non stop.  This game, it&apos;s stop start, but that&apos;s to be expected, it&apos;s a Adventure game, like the old school games.  If you&apos;re game does not run on steam, contact their tech support.  Or Rockstar, I seriously doubt it&apos;s not working for everyone who purchased it on steam (like me).  Obviously it&apos;s your machine configuration.  You seriously can&apos;t give a game a zero because of this, especially a game you obviously haven&apos;t played.<br><br>The atmosphere is excellent.  The facial animation, characters are great.  It really sets the scene for that era.  I read that the cars are &quot;sticky&quot; and that they don&apos;t suit the cars from that period.  Really.  You&apos;ve actually drove cars from that period have you.   I imagine they would be sticky, given the weight they used to be.  But anyway, it&apos;s not a driving simulation.  I don&apos;t want to spend my time trying to be a formula 1 driver, I want to play the actual game, which is detective work.<br><br>If you like the old adventure games, you&apos;ll love this.  If you don&apos;t, why did you buy a detective based game in the first place.  Do you not realise that the majority of the time will be spent looking for clues and trying to deduce motives...  Wait for GTA V if you want action, or call of duty if you don&apos;t want to think.  Or skyrim if you&apos;re REALLY into hiking.<br><br>FWIW, this game is awesome.  People are giving a low score because they bought something they had no idea about and thought it was going to be something else, or they are deluding themselves about what kind of rig they have, or they have technical issues that they feel is someone elses fault to resolve.<br><br>You&apos;re going to need a quad core CPU (as did GTA IV).  It runs smooth as silk on my stock SB 2500K and 560ti.  at 1640 x 1050, everything maxxed out.  If you have anything around this, and like adventure games, you&apos;ll love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1904181">Expand</a></span>

Example 1:<br><br>You&apos;re chasing a boyfriend (unknown location) and girlfriend suspects. You&apos;ve caught up with the girlfriend and are interviewing her.  You just found a train ticket on her dresser that&apos;s 1-way from Hollywood to Akron OH.  You ask about her &quot;Plans to leave town&quot;.  Your character inquires if she&apos;s trying to skip town.  She says she&apos;s not and has no idea what I&apos;m talking about.  Obviously you have solid evidence she&apos;s lying.  So &quot;lying&quot; would be the obvious choice with the train-ticket as evidence.  Nope.  If you click &quot;lying&quot; your character accuses &quot;You know where your boyfriend is, tell me!&quot;.  The girlfriend challenges &quot;You can&apos;t prove I know where my boyfriend is!&quot;.  Ok... but these things are totally unrelated to the original statement. WTF game.<br>Example 2:<br>You find a dead wife, you go to her husband&apos;s residence and look around for clues.  One of the clues is some boat rope found hanging off a boat in his yard, your character notices its the same braid as the ligature marks on the victim&apos;s neck.  When questioning the husband you ask about &quot;Potential Suspects&quot; by asking the husband if anyone didn&apos;t like his wife.  He answers &quot;No, she was well liked by everyone, she&apos;s fun to be around, I don&apos;t know anyone who didn&apos;t like her&quot;.  The correct answer is &quot;lying&quot; because of the boat rope.  WTF? How does boat rope prove the husband knows of someone that didn&apos;t like his wife?<br><br>How about those apples?  Game just slapped me in the face.  How dare you think the game has to make any sense.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2084666">Expand</a></span>

The game may have some technical issues, but the game itself it is just amazing. They have made an real life effect into the game, and in the game it is much things that is like real life detective cases. I think Rockstar Games and Team Bondi did make this game really look awesome. This game may not be loved by everyone, but I like it as an fan of murder/detective games.
<br>I give this game a 10/10. In case you like detective/murder games then I highly recommend you to buy this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2794929">Expand</a></span>

It looks good, but it would hurt less if the game looked stunning and ran this poorly. I mean, even Crysis runs better and that&apos;s still the graphical high-mark of the last five years. This game doesn&apos;t come close to that graphical fidelity and runs much worse. As far as the gameplay goes, I&apos;m having a pretty good time solving cases and I enjoy the facial expressions. It&apos;s just hard to swallow yet another flawed Rockstar PC port after GTAIV&apos;s failure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2530422">Expand</a></span>

It really brings to life the world of James Ellroy to an extent I didn&apos;t think we could see in a game, at least not yet. The plot is intricate, the characters are cruel but nuanced, the city itself is alive. The ending is excellent. It holds no punches and it makes no excuses - it is the thinking man&apos;s GTA (which is how we also explain the less daunting sales figures) and if you want to piece every part of the plot together, you&apos;d better pay attention. If you find this appealing, this game is bound to be something very special for you, otherwise you shouldn&apos;t bother.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>Just driving through LA (which you will do a lot of) is astounding in itself. For a long time, the game suffered from poor graphics performance and fairly weak visuals but with the DX11 version now running perfectly, the game is absolutely great to look at. And that&apos;s really important when so much of the game is the ambiance, the visual details, the feel of driving through 40s LA. The gameplay is original and the storyline is fascinating. Your fellow characters have real depth and so does your primary protagonist and the city itself. The world is dirty, corrupt, greedy, harsh, sad, all the things the world of Ellroy needs to be and it pulls no punches. There are no heroes here but that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re all villains either. The content is very large for a linear, story-driven game. Lots of cases, lots of societal aspects covered and unapologetically unfolded before us, lots of nasty little secrets to uncover. If you ever felt drawn to the world of true noire detectives, this is for you.
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>Very little, obviously, since I give it a 10. A few times, the game mechanic used during suspect interviews can feel a little arbitrary - that what you expect something to mean isn&apos;t what is actually meant by accusing a certain person of something at a specific time. Sometimes the game and the player will misunderstand each other which will lead to the player quitting and replaying a segment and feeling annoyed because he expected a different outcome from an action than the game presented and the player had no way of anticipating this. It isn&apos;t always exactly clear what the consequences will be from selecting a specific dialogue but most of the time it works. The facial animation can still seem slightly outdated (or very) but you can recognize the actors and the acting itself is top notch.
<br>
<br>Do not buy this game if you&apos;re looking for a new GTA, do not buy if you don&apos;t like stories and want action. But if you like stories, noire literature/film, Ellroy, just trying something a bit new to gaming, you HAVE to play this game. Very rewarding, extremely well done. This game was cared for down to its smallest detail, I hope we see more like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4878339">Expand</a></span>

This also has some nice graphics and I learned that it is not all that laggy like the GTA IV graphics engine but yes, If you want to be a detective and ask criminals lots of questions then this is your game.</span>

<br>this game deserves a 10. I respect all opinions but this is a niche game for me, that excels.
<br>add some sweetFX to it, and the visuals are just awesome.
<br>The game play might be between adventure games and 3rd person action games, but the combination is just right. Get a few drinks, a pack of smokes, and be ready to deep  yourself on a black novel all the way.

However, I loved almost every second of this game. It played perfectly on my average spec gaming Win7 PC (5.9 system rating) and I didn&apos;t experience any of the technical issues reported by others such as low frame-rate or sluggish controls. So, why did I enjoy it so much? For a start, the main storyline was fantastic. Not only was it original, it was also both suspenseful and pretty deep without being far-fetched. The characters were believable and were strongly developed over the course of the game. As for the gameplay, it combines open-world driving and gun fighting with crime-scene investigation and witness/suspect interviews. There&apos;s a healthy split between GTA-style action and clue-hunting with the option to skip the majority of the driving by asking your partner to take the wheel. I disabled the crime-scene visual/audio clues and would suggest doing the same if you want a challenge. The interviews are quite hard but if you pay attention to clues and people&apos;s body language they&apos;re doable.
<br>
<br>There are quite a lot of cut-scenes but they are of high quality and really help with the immersion.
<br>
<br>My only criticism of the game would be the lack of first-person perspective. I grew up playing FPS and find the recent shift to forced 3rd person cameras in PC games to be a pathetic pandering to console kids but hey, that&apos;s an issue with the gaming industry not the game.
<br>
<br>I mentioned how I dislike GTA.... no matter how much I try to enjoy it I always get bored after about an hour of gameplay. If you&apos;re the same, try L.A. Noire. However if you really liked GTA you might really hate this game, since all my GTA loving friends who have tried it said they found it too boring. Personally, I&apos;d rather investigate the murder of a hooker than run one over and steal their purse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3721822">Expand</a></span>

<br>Top notch story, acting, music and production.
<br>Could of used a little more &apos;game&apos; content and was a shame not to &apos;use&apos; more of the huge L.A. map they made.
<br>One of the best games out there and sincerely hope Rockstar makes a follow-up.</span>

<br>
<br>Sadly though the end product is nothing like it could have been. This is basically a snooze fest disguised as a game. Honestly, if it didn&apos;t have Rockstar&apos;s name on the box it wouldn&apos;t be rated highly as it is or sold as well despite the fact Rockstar did not make this game.
<br>
<br>My main dislikes with the game are.......
<br>
<br>1- You never really detect anything. You walk around till you get a little chime meaning you press the x button and pickup the clue. If the clue needs to be examined further the game will tell you so. Once you have the clues your partner will signal you it&apos;s time to go somewhere else. The game basically walks you through detecting everything and finding clues. It tells you when you need to hit what buttons and where.
<br>
<br>2- You can&apos;t mess up interrogations. This was lauded as a big feature for the game. If you blow the interrogation then you just do it again. Even if you guess wrong when your judging a person&apos;s true intentions you can still win the game without ever getting one right. You can go right through the game by guessing everything wrong when its decision time while interviewing someone. The game basically won&apos;t let you make mistakes that stop the game play and there are no consequences for anything during interrogations. There is no need to study a person&apos;s facial reactions or what they say because it doesn&apos;t matter. Guess right? No advantage. Guess wrong? No punishment.
<br>
<br>3- The facial animations while good are just a gimmick. Another big selling point for the game is just a gimmick. Again looking at people&apos;s faces during interrogation to guess if they are lying or not doesn&apos;t matter since you don&apos;t have to be right. The facial animations are nice but it doesn&apos;t matter aesthetically because their bodies still move like stiff puppets. And they still aren&apos;t lifelike because they are over exaggerated to be noticeable. I personally wish they hadn&apos;t wasted all the money on filming actors in a fancy studio with all this high tech equipment and instead used the money to hire better writers for the game and work on making it more fun instead of just being a gateway for their facial animation tech. Honestly the animations felt more like a tech demo they were hoping to get other developers to license the tech for their games.
<br>
<br>4- The game is incredibly linear. Yes a couple times you can chose to shake down a bartender instead of checking up on a drug addict but you never really get to chose anything. The game firmly holds your hand from the start to the finish and never let&apos;s go. I felt more like a errand boy out driving from point A to point B and then from C to D.
<br>
<br>5- The storyline while not bad isn&apos;t that great. The main storyline starting out builds and builds and builds then suddenly it just stops and comes to a half with a very paper thin plot excuse and then suddenly you thrust off in another direction with no looking back. They just go to all this trouble of building up to something and then suddenly pull the rug out and leave you unsatisfied. The ending is very, very unsatisfying as well.
<br>
<br>6- Team bondi has been saying the game isn&apos;t finished and that&apos;s easily noticeable just playing through it. They left the game kind of shallow in order to sell more DLC to gamers and that&apos;s obvious since they have been releasing DLC since its release and have recently announced more. It&apos;s just a shame they would release a 60 dollar game partially gutted so they can sell DLC and turn it into a 100 dollar game.
<br>
<br>7- 60% of the game is still just grand theft auto. Just like in grand theft auto you have to drive a car for hours and hours and hours while you playing doing absolutely nothing but going up and down the same boring streets as a time sink. You can take any car you want like in GTA, you&apos;ll waste hours of time driving just like GTA, when you run it&apos;s just like in GTA, when you shoot or fight it&apos;s just like GTA, in fact everything that isn&apos;t investigating or interrogating is just like GTA.
<br>
<br>In the end this game is wasted potential. I really wish I had waited till it eventually drops to 25 bucks or less because that&apos;s all it&apos;s worth. I had a lot of fun for about 6 hours and after that I find myself playing it just to finish it since I paid so much. I was really disappointed in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3012408">Expand</a></span>

Running around seems to watch the TV serie The six million dollar man, its terrible. Beside that i have to tell also the controls are not really working good too and the game its so easy that it seems to play an interactive movie, tbh its one of the worst ports ive seen so far, and the game itself it seems made for 5 years old kids. I wasted money, this game is garbage</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1977499">Expand</a></span>

Great idea and nice graphics totally ruined by illlogical and dump dialog and interview decisions. You accuse people with most faint evidence like rope match which is for sure can be found in every 2-nd house in LA. You sit affront a suspect and wandering which size of shoes he wears instead of just looking at his feet. You accuse hobo of &quot;being in some place at 2 a.m.&quot; just finding a purse of a victim. He could pick it up later from a dead body, which is normal for his kind. It can&apos;t be a sure reason to say he&apos;s lying about his whereabouts in exact time! --- So great idea totally buried by dumb scenario.((((</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-noire-the-complete-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2068917">Expand</a></span>
