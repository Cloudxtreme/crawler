<br>Pros:
- Fantastic story. Creepy, interesting, engaging. Dripping with atmosphere.
- Wonderful voice acting. Every single character does an excellent and convincing job.
- Despite the low resolution, visually striking.
- Very original altogether. I haven&apos;t played anything really like it.

Cons:

<br>Pros:
<br>- Fantastic story. Creepy, interesting, engaging. Dripping with atmosphere.
<br>- Wonderful voice acting. Every single character does an excellent and convincing job.
<br>- Despite the low resolution, visually striking.
<br>- Very original altogether. I haven&apos;t played anything really like it.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Controls are simple, yet still unintuitive and inconvenient. Would have been better to bind more keys for specific action (e.g. browse inventory using different keys than the ones used for walking).
<br>- Resolution is too low for this day and age
<br>- Some puzzles are too difficult or don&apos;t make much sense. I had to check a walkthrough several times.
<br>- Save game system is limited to 50 saves. There are workarounds to save more, but you only learn that you need to use those workarounds after discovering that many of your latest saves are not there.
<br>
<br>Overall: The pros far outweigh the cons. This game is a must!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=4521089">Expand</a></span>

The story is one of the best I&apos;ve seen in a game for a LONG time, and I play hundreds of games. If Harvester Games had a large budget, this game would&apos;ve definitely been GOTY material. But instead it&apos;s underestimated and overlooked by other popular games. If you want a good scare-not a cheap jumpscare-but a scare that messes with your mind for days on end, then get The Cat Lady. The atmosphere is also a very strong point, it reminds me of Scratches. It&apos;s perfect for setting the mood of a very dark, and depressing game. Your actions and choices matter a good amount, and the achievements on Steam are fun to get. Very awesome game, you need to get used to the graphics/animations and gameplay (there isn&apos;t much gameplay), but if you can do that, you&apos;ll experience one of the best horror stories out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=4137688">Expand</a></span>

It felt trite and cliche at first I had no idea why people found themselves enjoying the game so much. But as I progressed on, I discovered some interesting personalities. Albeit, they come a bit far and wide. But when they do, I found them damn memorable.
<br>
<br>I found the protagonist boring, until a support character synergistically made the two of them engaging- to a point where it almost took me off guard. The game blends reality with fantasy in a way I enjoyed. I can see how others might disagree.
<br>
<br>The bad: I didn&apos;t find myself enjoying the characters and story for quite a while. Graphics are EXTREMELY low budget. The theme of the settings are great, but the fluidity of character movement is clunky and awkward. UI is absolutely horrible. I found myself frustrated with puzzles simply because interactions with the environment was unjustifiably lengthy. I HAVE the key. Why on earth do you need me to stand in front of the door, press down, scroll through my items, press enter on the item, and pick the &quot;use&quot; option to open a damn door.
<br>
<br>I could game very easily give this game a low score for its glaring inadequacies, but it simply gets too many congeniality points. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=4295239">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles are not too hard but not too simple either, mostly just a way to get to the next bit of the story. The voice acting is good, though the lead actress sometimes has a slightly annoying way to phrase statements as a question. The storyline is original and entertaining with the occasional scare, it keeps you interested and wanting to see what happens next. The story is more important than the puzzles or the environment and the artwork and style evoke the mood of the game well. The music score is excellent.
<br>
<br>On finishing the game you get an overall feeling of closure and the final message is something that will stay with you.
<br>
<br>Not a game that has a lot of replay value I think but definitely not something you will regret playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=4264706">Expand</a></span>

<br>+Simple yet great atmosphere, great psychological horror environment
<br>+Good graphics and soundtrack

<br>+Interesting characters
<br>+Nice puzzles
<br>+More than one ending

<br>-You may not get the entire story on the first time
<br>-Very linear although it seems like it isn&apos;t
<br>-Mediocre voice acting at times
<br>-Some minor graphical glitches (very few)

There really is some heart touching moments in this game and for once, I didn&apos;t laugh at babies.
<br>Visually game is just out of this world. Although game may seem colourless in the trailers and so -it really isn&apos;t so. The Cat Lady has a real sense of when to highlight things and make contrast with the elements at hand. And believe me, there are really nice coulurfull scenes in this game!
<br>As said, the controlling is easy and it has only 5 button interface  and it doesn&apos;t need more! Puzzles in the game usually are made of combining things you collect straight into the world. There is no need to fiddle with stuff in the inventory. And as I side note, you usually do know where to use your stuff so you won&apos;t be having a over-stuffed inventory.
<br>World of Cat Lady is full of sound. The music played in the game varies from sweet piano melodies to heavy-metal. But don&apos;t worry, &apos;cause all the music has it&apos;s place in the game making the story go along and getting you buffed up to do stuff and to just drive you forward. Voice acting is average, but none of the voices do bother you or anything
<br>
<br>All an all a good game with great story and visuals. Only complaint could be, that there&apos;s too much of the weirdness going on  it kinda smothers it self in it from time to time.
<br>But still, get this game and enjoy something, you&apos;ve  have never before seen</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=3050915">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Conversely, when goth goes mainstream the result is Hot Topic, and why a lot of mainstream horror titles like Alan Wake and Resident Evil just don&apos;t work for me.  They&apos;re too slick and too packaged.  They might as well have call-outs on the screen that say &quot;Be Scared Now&quot; or &quot;Feel a Sense of Dread For Next 15 Seconds&quot;.  Cat Lady feels like it was written by a schizophrenic in the bowels of an asylum.
<br>
<br>Just being indie and &quot;crude&quot; is not enough, though.  There is a lot of indie crap out there that the anti-mainstream will label as brilliant simply because it&apos;s indie.  Cat Lady brings the goods.   It took a couple hours but the story sucked me in and now it&apos;s one of those games I don&apos;t want to play because I know eventually it will end.
<br>
<br>Many indie titles like Minecraft started out playing in the minor leagues but all the while hoping for mainstream success (and of course, with that game, they found it). But to me, The Cat Lady is exactly what an indie title should be: unafraid and un-apologetically creative, and without ever even the concern of appealing to a mass audience.  Bottom line: this is a avant garde video gaming at its finest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=3270070">Expand</a></span>

<br>Thank God the developers saw this project through to the end, because The Cat Lady is an absolute gem.
<br>The art direction is superb, and the story as it unfolds touches on the surreal and macabre, taking us to the dark places of the human psyche that no other game I have played ever has before, but at the same time, we see a beautiful relationship developing on screen between the two heroines that is touching and funny. Although at first the rather deliberate delivery of the voice acting seems amateurish, it fits really well with the game as a whole.
<br>There were some issues with the game however: some overlong conversations without the ability to skip through the dialogue; no facility to replay the different chapters;  there were a couple of the puzzles that didn&apos;t seem to have any logical solution, just press some buttons and hope; the plotting of the story was a little sloppy here and there. But these pale into insignificance when you take the whole experience into account.
<br>The Cat Lady is a point where Art and Video Gaming merge.
<br>I understand that this game has been Greenlit on Steam and I for one wish it every success</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=3482537">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Cat Lady is an opaque and rough diamond that shines with sick colors. You&apos;ll love the introspection and the mature story. Easily one of the best adventure games of the last years. VIRTUALINN.IT</span>

<br>Warning
<br>
<br>This game though two dimensional does have very brief (two sections that I encountered) nudity,
<br>
<br>and lots of blood/gore. Do be warned if you&apos;re very easily put off by blood or gore it may be
<br>
<br>something to consider. There is also a lot of involvement with suicide and
<br>
<br>depression, if it is a sensitive subject matter to you you may not (or may) want to play this
<br>
<br>game.

<br>The Story (Don&apos;t worry no spoilers)

<br>Enough about the horror though, there&apos;s clearly a lot of it. The story is where it is at, end of

<br>story. *punintentional* Seriously though as I stated in the title this is similar in style to a
<br>
<br>Stephen King novel. In my opinion much better than a number of his works. (trust me I love
<br>
<br>Stephen King) It will have you guessing and I mean GUESSING as to what exactly is going to
<br>
<br>happen and even at times what is happening in front of your very eyes.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>
<br>An immersive story that keeps you wanting, nay, CRAVING more each and every moment. I honestly
<br>
<br>couldn&apos;t turn this game down and I have many other games I&apos;ve been itching to get to and play
<br>
<br>such as the Bioshock series and Skyrim. Multiple choice adventure wherein you actually CHANGE
<br>
<br>the game and how the story unfolds. Honestly, it&apos;s not just some choice where it changes a thing
<br>
<br>here or there...there&apos;s real choices to be made that change EVERYTHING.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>
<br>On the down side there are no options to skip dialogue, and with the dialogue a few typos on
<br>
<br>rare occasion that take you out of the moment but nothing so game breaking as to be a failure in

any way. Also very minor British terminology  cultural slang that may be missed out on by her

western cousins across the sea.

Replayability

In terms of replayability there is actually some, considering it is a point and click adventure

style you do get multiple choices for which road to follow at times and it does in fact change

the game and ending.

Summary

I personally would rate this game with flawless marks because it is so well crafted, my only

annoyance is that I once had to check how to figure out a single puzzle on the internet, but

that was my own inability to realize the answer.

I would reccomend this game to anyone who loves adventure. To any one who loves to read books as

well. Especially to fans of horror and dark subject matter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=3279677">Expand</a></span>

If you are good with side scrolling games, basic graphics, then I would say give this a look. Music is nice, some of the backgrounds are really nice, it&apos;s easy enough and a nice diversion. Unfortunately, the UI can be clunky at times, and the story, a mix between serious adult themes and supernatural, tries to straddle both and not entirely successfully. To keep the story moving along and within the environment given, the story takes shortcuts or leaves subplots dangling. The story has some nice elements to it to stay interesting. All in all, I would say anyone who takes their gaming more seriously and likes something different, add this to your collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=4905104">Expand</a></span>

Especially if you&apos;re not a patient person, or you don&apos;t like adventure games at all. But you must play this game if you were searching for a good horror/thriller adventure game for a long time. I think this was the only good horror/thriller adventure game that I played after the White Chamber or the Mirror Lied.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=4392931">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles, such as they are, are pretty much linear, &quot;use A on B&quot;, and are either damn obvious or so pointlessly obscure that it&apos;s best to look them up on a walkthrough and avoid repeating wads of dialogue. There don&apos;t seem to be any user-choices affecting the route of the story (so far, I&apos;m probbaly about 1/2 way through) The dialogue is impossible to skip, and the UI is almost insultingly basic.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s all the bad stuff  the good side is that it&apos;s quite well-written, well-acted, well-drawn, and well-directed. The horror element works by putting the character mostly in very mundane environments and then popping something nasty  actually quite disturbing to look at, credit due to the artist  on the screen.
<br>
<br>Anyway, don&apos;t pay more for it than you would if you were renting a horror movie or a paperback book. On reflection it&apos;s mostly quite &quot;schlocky&quot; stuff but as is often the case it does feel like more than the sum of its parts at the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=3682742">Expand</a></span>

The volume of the sound/voice/music can&apos;t be adjusted, so it&apos;s not a game that is friendly to headphone-wearing gamers. The controls can&apos;t be remapped and don&apos;t include gamepad support. Basic actions, like using a key on a door, are cumbersome because there is no mouse support. The graphics are beyond basic - the avatar is so poorly animated that she kind of shimmers and shakes when she moves, inducing eye fatigue and headache after just a few minutes - yet the game takes forever to start up.  Since there isn&apos;t any menu or anything there doesn&apos;t even seem to be any proper way to exit the game. I couldn&apos;t even alt+f4 to exit, I had to resort to alt-tabbing out and using the task manager. I honestly have not a single good thing to say about the game.

This game will contain a ton of dialogue and you&apos;ll need to pay attention to be able to understand what&apos;s going on. Although, even if you do pay attention, the story does get a but difficult to understand in some place. Nevertheless, i was genuinely interested in what was going to happen to my character. The gameplay is more on the simple end for adventure games. One of the biggest problem was the very poor sound quality and the lack of optimization for the scenes with fog.The inclusion of actual voice actors is a great appeal as most indie adventure games don&apos;t do that. Also, I would have preferred if the story centered on someone who has chronic depression (Suffers it their entire life no matter what) instead of someone who is simply suffering a depressive episodes as i think this would have provided many more options and unique elements that could have been introduced in the story. Overall, Cat Lady is a great attempt at an adventure game but it just needed a slightly more coherent storyline to make the game great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=3893330">Expand</a></span>

This is a game with sad story but it ends on a positive note(at least it did with me). Just take the protagonist. When you start the game she has just failed to commit suicide and is in hospital. But perhaps failed is not the right word, perhaps she actually succeeded...
<br>
<br>The game has a dark theme. This is the tale of someone who believes her life to be a failure and decided to end it. The overall colors are black, grey or a sharply contrasting white. What other colors there are are subdued. Except for red.You know blood red. The story is told with colors and the music supports the overall mood. It&apos;s a dark theme certainly, but often very beautiful done. Not realistic mind you, but made to visualize the emotion that the protagonist undergoes and thus communicating this to you as the player.
<br>
<br>As a game it is probably not a very challenging for experienced players. I can&apos;t tell as a seldom play such games. My main reason to play it was because it was cheap on steam and the art intrigued me. That the story was actually captivating was a bonus.
<br>
<br>I think that you choose this game for the story  and art more than for the challenge it offers as a game.. Perhaps it would be better to say that this is a guided story.Games that matter because of the story and not so much because of the gameplay.
<br>Some like that, others don&apos;t care for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=4588014">Expand</a></span>

<br>The overall atmosphere, the look and the narrative structure of &quot;The Cat Lady&quot; reminded me strongly of &quot;Frank Miller&apos;s Sin City&quot; and the movies of Quentin Tarantino of whom I am a great fan. If you&apos;re into really dark, depressive, suicidal and ultra violent stuff then this game is most definitely one for you to enjoy.</span>

The main problems were the graphics and gameplay/difficulty&apos;s simplicity; graphics were extremely basic, including the very simplistic animations, while the gameplay was too simple and easy; it was hard enough to be considered a game but it was relatively easy and simplistic.
<br>
<br>However, the game in overall was fantastic, or at least much better than 95% of what&apos;s out there. The atmosphere of horror it tried to produce was fantastically done, the characters too real, and the story almost perfect (it did not make sense in some cases but that can be forgiven since it was the point that it was kinda psychotic to begin with).
<br>
<br>All in all, all adventure fans will love it, but be warned it&apos;s scary.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=7258373">Expand</a></span>

I enjoy it a lot. I am curious what would happen, so I kept playing for more. I also enjoy its story, puzzles, characters, and arts. I made many screenshots there and bought its foil trading cards.

<br>
<br>Instead of singing the game constant praises, I&apos;ll list the pros and cons below.
<br>* Very unusual protagonist. You won&apos;t necessarily agree with everything she says, but hey - you can see what the world is like from someone with a mental health issue.
<br>* Memorable characters. I liked Mitzi in particular.
<br>* Great storyline.
<br>* Choice. Or, at leat, the illusion of it.
<br>* Puzzles.
<br>Cons (they&apos;re all really small)
<br>* The dialogue is sometimes very cringey, not helped by the voice actors really overdoing it at times.
<br>* The voices were poorly recorded in some cases. Mitzi in particular sounded rather distorted.
<br>* Visuals don&apos;t always match the sound exactly.
<br>* Animations are a little jagged around the edges.
<br>
<br>But hey. It&apos;s an indie game - and a fantastic one, at that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-cat-lady/user-reviews?user_review_id=6157888">Expand</a></span>
