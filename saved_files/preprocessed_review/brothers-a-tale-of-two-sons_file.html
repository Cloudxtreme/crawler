I recommend this game to anyone who likes a good adventure. The game is only 3 hours long and there is not too much of a challenge but overall it&apos;s an awesome experience. i enjoyed this more than any of these recent blockbuster games. Yes it&apos;s that good.  9/10</span>

I give the developers full credit for creating some astonishingly beautiful art, which truly enables the fairy tale world of the game to come to life. I was swept away by breathtaking vistas of misty valleys and snow-capped mountains, as well as some of the most gorgeous water effects I&apos;ve ever seen in a video game.
<br>
<br>That being said, I didn&apos;t find any other aspect of this title to be particularly noteworthy or enjoyable. The puzzles are extremely simplistic and I was never, even for a moment, at loss as to how to proceed. This simplicity might lead one to think that this might be a good game for kids, but the grim tone and surprisingly gruesome middle section quickly put that idea to rest.
<br>
<br>I question the decision to implement a made up &quot;language&quot; for the characters to use to express themselves. I think it badly detracts from the seriousness of the story. I would have preferred either no dialog at all (pantomime would probably have been sufficient) or some concise dialog/narration in a real language. Perhaps something written in a fairy tale style would have fit the mood of the game perfectly.
<br>
<br>Finally, I have to take major issue with the ending. I think the developers were going for grand  operatic tragedy, but because of the complete lack of characterization things fall completely flat. The shrill and melodramatic music that underscores &quot;big&quot; moments makes the lack of true drama all the more obvious and jarring.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sure many people will enjoy Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, but based on my own taste in games and art I don&apos;t find anything to recommend here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3599557">Expand</a></span>

Well, okay, maybe that&apos;s not entirely true and I may be a bit melodramatic when saying that, but I really can&apos;t figure out a reason why someone would dislike this game, other than the fact that it&apos;s pretty short. Although making this game longer would most likely deter from it&apos;s beauty. Simply put, this is one of the best and most original puzzle games that I have played in a while, and although it&apos;s not exactly the most difficult, the reward is in the storytelling. It&apos;s not easy to portray emotion in a video game without saying a word, but this game pulls it off in style.
<br>
<br>While I agree that all video games, no matter how bad or good they are, are a form of art, this game is a shining example of it. Emotional storytelling combined with controls that make sense not only to the gameplay, but say even more on a narrative level, &apos;A Tale of Two Sons&apos; shines the most when it comes to how we interact with the characters. By giving players the opportunity to control both brothers at once by utilizing the dual sticks on your gamepad, &apos;Brothers&apos; takes storytelling through gameplay to a new level. This may sound difficult to control at first, but after a few minutes you&apos;ll get the hang of it and will often forget that you&apos;re controlling two people at the same time without much thought.
<br>
<br>This game more than deserves the amount of praise that it has been given and I hope to see more video games that utilize this control concept. The art style here is fantastic, the variety in gameplay will keep you entertained the whole way through, and the puzzle elements although simplistic are incredibly fun when combined with the controls. The asking price may be a bit high for such a short game, but the next time this one is on sale, I would recommend picking it up to pretty much anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=5073708">Expand</a></span>

At first it seemed to be exactly what I expected: a simple little puzzle game with an original mechanic/gimmick (controlling two characters at the same time). Nice graphics, fun little puzzles, but nothing extraordinary. The longer I played the more it struck me how great the game looked though, with lots of different areas, from meadows to caves to the remains of war to frozen villages and beautiful lakes again. Also the puzzles kept varying constantly, so it never got repetitive. However, the best part about the game is the story. It starts with a very simple plot: save sick dad by traveling to some distant place to get a cure. Perfect little plot for a little game, I figured. For a long time it didn&apos;t seem to be any more than that, but the game has a big trick up it&apos;s sleeve and it&apos;s innocent appearance is part of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=4389069">Expand</a></span>

<br>Otherwise, the game treats the two characters with independently, which flies in the face of the supposed meaning of the game. Why create this odd control style and never deliver unique mechanics? The game plays like a million other puzzle platformers, which is a shame considering the potential.

<br>The ending has a great mechanics-as-metaphor moment, and it feels like the entire game was a setup for that one well-done moment. That said, it&apos;s incredibly predictable and intensely cloying. It&apos;s a short game as well: my playthrough clocked in at about two hours.

<br>The graphics, the audio(save for voice overs), and the gameplay were decent if not great, but it just was never meant to be a game; a movie or film, YES!
<br>
<br>FYI parents...there is some extremely violent material in the middle; be forewarned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3834339">Expand</a></span>

I am not really familiar with the nordic culture, but it is a wonderful adventure worth to be played more than one time (achievements are also not easy to find, and no description will be given). Stunning scenery, wonderful graphics, and it looks amazing in 3D if you like 3D. 90/100</span>

<br>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a small Adventure game based on two brothers, who after losing their mother, must go on a quest to retrieve something to help their sick father. A usually simple premise.
<br>
<br>However, the gameplay is unique in that it&apos;s co-op... with yourself. You control both brothers; with a controller, the analogue sticks and triggers are dedicated to each brother, while if playing via keyboard, the WASD keys control one and the arrow keys control the other. There is very much a sense of trying to pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time, using these controls. At first, while travelling the world is relatively easy, you may struggle but soon you get used to it.
<br>
<br>The world itself is beautiful to wander around. It looks like an oil painting come to life, with many inhabitants and objects available to interact with in both humerus and very moving ways. They breathe a certain kind of life in this game that only few games actually achieve. The landscapes become more and more epic as you progress. One certain area (and how you manoeuvre this area) left my mouth agape for it&apos;s entirety. You&apos;ll know which one this is.
<br>
<br>Although it starts out almost child-like, the themes become very dark, quite quickly. You&apos;ll stumble across some helpless individuals, which require assistance. The story-telling of these, even though the dialogue is not a known language, can be an emotional experience.
<br>
<br>And emotions run very high in this game. I completed this in one 3 hour setting (recommended), and 3 days later, it is still sitting with me. Towards the end, you might even find it hard to continue due to it&apos;s emotionally draining circumstances.
<br>
<br>Definitely one of the best Indie games I&apos;ve played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=4909111">Expand</a></span>

Started and finished in one sitting just shy of 4 hours (I paced myself as I didn&apos;t want it it end).  Will I play it again?  Probably not for a few years at least.  Even with that in mind, I highly recommend anyone give this a bash as it&apos;s worth your money and your time.  Enjoy.</span>

<br>The journey this game takes you on is pretty fantastic, its lasts about 3 hours and is really well paced with no parts that will bore you. The game is mainly summed up of puzzles which will require you to use the characters at the same time in order to progress which is pretty daunting at first and takes a little time to get used to but once you do its really fun.
<br>
<br>The game is also rather pretty, with some great vista&apos;s. To be honest its hard to talk about this game without spoiling the experience, its a game you need to play yourself and for the price you should. If you liked to play something different, you should play this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3610347">Expand</a></span>

Just keep in mind that the controls can be fiddly from time to time, and the puzzles are easy and obvious.
<br>
<br>I think what stops me from giving it the 8-10 mark is that we&apos;re introduced to some beautiful ideas and lands in at least three chapters, but we pass through them and they&apos;re gone, with no note or interest in telling us more about these lands. This game could have been a much much bigger one if they had to budget to expand on each land, and then progress to the next. Take a note out of The Walking Dead series, and maybe do it as chapters if there&apos;s a Brothers 2. For me, the end felt rushed to, I wanted to find out much more about the earlier levels to complete the world story. And the make-up language limited them in giving the sons (plus parents) any decent backstory, I&apos;m not sure it was a great idea, but I compliment them in trying.
<br>
<br>All that aside, it is a very fine game, worth playing, short enough, and once you get the keyboard mapping good for your two hands, you&apos;ll have an enjoyable experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3812281">Expand</a></span>

The environment is very scenic, often having you traveling high up and admiring beautiful landscapes. It&apos;s inhabited with trolls, giants, griffins and other mythical creatures. Everywhere you go there&apos;s always something nice to look at. The camera&apos;s position often emphasizes the best fragments of a scene. It&apos;s not photo-real, but definitely eye pleasing and charming.
<br>
<br>You control both brothers at once - left hand for the older one, right hand for the younger. Many puzzles rely on syncing them well together. For me that was something new. Personally I had to keep them on the left&amp;right sides of the screen in accordance with the control scheme. Whenever they switched positions due to my running around, my brain just went out of whack and chaos followed. I had to slow down and reposition them to be able to continue comfortably.
<br>
<br>The puzzles themselves are fairly easy. Some variants are recycled throughout the game. There is no greater planning involved and you solve many as you go. There is also no backtracking, so even if you&apos;re not sure how to tackle a specific problem, in most cases solution would present itself after simply going a little further. I feel that puzzles are just meant to be a way of reinforcing the bond between brothers and making player more attached through gameplay. Most of them require both protagonists working at the same time or in a longer alternating sequence.
<br>
<br>The reception of the story differs from person to person. Many people got their hopes up by other reviews/opinions and were disappointed. Others were ecstatic. For me the general experience is above average, that&apos;s for sure. Also the ending squeezed a tear out of me or two, so the narration trough gameplay mostly did it&apos;s job. But I didn&apos;t experience strong emotional response from the beginning to the end like some. Still I find the whole journey enjoyable and well worth my time.
<br>
<br>The game is pretty linear. No choices to be made, no events that can be prevented or played out differently. Apart from the main task that the boys are focused on, you can interact with many objects or NPCs and observe separate animations for each brother. Those do not affect anything, but make the world feel more alive and characters more fleshed out. All the inhabitants communicate in a made up gibberish sounding language, so the gestures and body language are especially important.
<br>
<br>The whole world might look like it&apos;s fable-like, but in reality it&apos;s quite harsh. Brutal and cruel at times even. Good things happen, then bad things happen. You save someone, someone will die as a direct result of helping you (or even a worse scenario). One has the impression that no good deed goes unpunished. Sometimes you won&apos;t be able to help - you&apos;ll just witness the effects of a tragedy that already took place. You meet both friendly NPCs, and mean or outright ill willed &amp; hostile ones. Although there are very few moments in the whole game that actually pose any danger (story wise, not from manually letting go a ledge or other mechanics associated deaths).
<br>
<br>Completing the game takes about 3-4 hours, even when interacting with every possible object/person. So it&apos;s quite short. There is no need to replay it, other than experiencing the exact same story again if you really were swept away by it. If you have a chance to grab it on a sale - I wouldn&apos;t hesitate, fully recommended. At full price, I would say it&apos;s not for everyone. Definitely for people that can appreciate the emotional content and enjoy the journey aspect without making fuss about easy difficulty, length or minor issues - basically, recommended for informed customers :)

<br>Subjective Assessment - 7.5 (more than nice, not yet great)

<br>-The puzzles aren&apos;t all that challenging, but they are still very entertaining and innovative. I feel this is a good choice since hard and frustrating puzzles would make it harder to enjoy the story and the world that surrounds you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3628168">Expand</a></span>

<br>HOWEVER, according to my opinion, there are two major flaws in the plot:
<br>First, the game stays not true to itself. It starts as a childrens&apos; tale with a giggling grandma and similar stuff - and in the second half of the game you suddenfly find yourself on a battlefield with blood all over. While I usually like games with gore, I didn&apos;t like it in this game. In fact, it spoiled the experience. How special this game could have been if it simply stayed true to it&apos;s fairy tale flair. But no: It has to bring in senseless violence plus a macabre sense of humor (e.g. when you destroy frozen people).
<br>Second (SPOILER!!!), it&apos;s the ending: I am a Game of Thrones fan so I am not shocked anymore when main characters die surprisingly. But in this game, the girl that&apos;s supposed to fall in love with the main character turns out to be the villain and, moreover, the main character dies. This simply breaks with the atmosphere. I&apos;ve seen many people praising this &quot;unconventional&quot; ending, but those are the types of people that always praise if something is different (so you can talk about it and feel good that you like the special thing even though it&apos;s stupid). This was a fairy tale and, imo, it should have ended as such. You could have even played it with your children then...
<br>Therefore: Just a three out of ten. I was REALLY unsatisfied afterwards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=4787561">Expand</a></span>

The concept of controlling 2 characters at once has come up in a handful of games on Kongregate already and hasn&apos;t become boring yet. The story is great as well. I especially liked that everything is told without a single word  the animators have done a great job. The locations are filled with details and small objects. Music is great. The whole theme of the game is very positive, even educational. The negative sides are: 1) you can&apos;t customize the keys! This is just plain carelessness of the developers and is unforgivable. On my laptop the arrow keys are small, so my Up key is actually on the same level as the right Ctrl and I had to keep the right hand awkwardly positioned, with the elbow shifted left, touching my belly. Playing the game was physically uncomfortable. I&apos;d remap the keys to use the keypad for controlling the small brother. 2) there is not much actually gameplay since the only thing you can do is to press &quot;action&quot; keys in some places. There are no actual puzzle to solve, there is not much to do. It&apos;s more of an interactive cartoon than a game since you can&apos;t do much except running and watching animations. 3) the graphics are pretty dated and low poly, somewhere on the level of 2003 games. I give this game a 6 for the interesting concept but frankly I dropped this game after 20 mins due to boredom and painful controls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3712306">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll be a second part, but if it happens it&apos;ll be a first day buy for me.</span>

In fact, not just stopping, staring and saying whaaaaat?!?!

My one complaint is that I wish it were longer. It&apos;s a short but bittersweet fantsy-adventure-puzzle game that will probably haunt you. Well worth the small price if you&apos;re not someone totally averse to a bit of melancholy. A warning: if you&apos;ve ever lost someone close to you, there&apos;s probably something in this game that will be an emotional trigger.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3697493">Expand</a></span>

It really does. I&apos;m going to be quick, this clearly isn&apos;t a triple A game, it&apos;s something more. The particular thing here is how the gamer became the bond between the two brothers, not merely the one who moves them. Because of this, the connection between the game and the person who plays it became strong, really strong. And at last, well...this connection will be the cause of your ultimate depression.
<br>This game is something beautiful that will break your heart in many little pieces, but this is how real life is too: you will experience sorrow and joy with the two brothers in a way that isn&apos;t common today with videogames.
<br>
<br>Definitely worth buying,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3758728">Expand</a></span>

It is otherwise a rather linear game that is meant to tell a story while you perform puzzles. The puzzles can be frustrating at times, but they aren&apos;t that difficult to deal with and beating the game will only take you about five hours. I would not suggest this game to anyone who focuses only on gameplay and always skips cutscenes, but it is a great game to unwind on for a relaxing time. It uses stunning art and an engrossing story to draw the player in, and it was a great time overall. It does lack in replayability however. It relies more on the overall story and the experience than actual gameplay, so while being fun, it has the replayability of a book. I beat the game twice for fun, but I probably won&apos;t play it for another year when I feel like picking it up in a year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3961063">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Best Game Of 2013. Nevermind that, this is the best game of all time. Forget Half Life 2, forget Bioshock or forget GTA V. This game knows how to play with your emotions. Never once a game made me to wish if we could change a part of the game. Never once a piece of Media ever made me drop manly tears from my eyes. This game could do it. This is more than a game. This is a piece of art.</span>

And gameplay in Brothers is primitive and repetitive. It doesn&apos;t give player a challenge in any way other than if you want to sneeze when characters hanging on cliff you must resist the urge to cover mouth with your hand. How this game get so many 10/10 is beyond me.</span>

During game play you will feel a whole range of emotions from anger, sadness all the way to happiness and excitement. This game in my eyes is a 10 out of 10 no questions. Anyone who has a PC, Xbox 360 or PS3 should definitely play this game.</span>

<br>its such a beutifull game when i first played it i had no idea how grim it would get later on yet it still retained its beuty</span>

<br>But the great problem with this game is the controls. Not only is using two tumbsticks to control tow different characters, doing two different things, somewhat awkward  but the use of the triggers for action makes it very tiring and painful to play for more than an hour.
<br>The game has a couple of interesting puzzles, but nothing really inspiring. They are just there and end up being more of a chore, than a challenge.
<br>By the time I was finishing the game, I could only think about the awkward controls, the pain on my fingers and the plot holes, to even care about the drama.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3661043">Expand</a></span>

<br>$15 for 3 hours of game play that has virtually no story telling value or challenge is not worth it.

The lack of characterization renders the later portions of the game, which I&apos;m sure were meant to be emotional and hard-hitting, laughable; the fact that the characters express themselves using a made-up language does not help either. The only good thing about the game are the graphics, which are quite pretty indeed, although they do suffer from asset-reuse: I have come across 5 identical broken ladders throughout the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=4205473">Expand</a></span>

In terms of positives, it is a unique approach to gameplay having to control the two characters at the same time and there are patches late into the game where you can start to feel a rhythm to it and you don&apos;t have to concentrate so hard on what you are doing and that feeling is rewarding. Overall though, the game itself doesn&apos;t feel that rewarding. The puzzles are fairly simple and the execution of them similarly so. What it does have is a fantastic mysterious atmosphere which is maintained by the surreal backdrops and the absence of understandable dialogue. However, to me the game felt a little bit rushed and I am justified by Steam in that claim as it tells me I have 4 hours in the game and that is having completed it once through. So the ending which is supposed to be touching and emotional doesn&apos;t quite hit home as I&apos;ve barely gotten to know the two brothers. It seemed to me like the developers couldn&apos;t wait to get to the ending of the game and so the middle feels a little lacking. Where the game really falls down though is in some massive bugs which completely halted the game for me to the point where I had to google the solution to a puzzle only to find out I was doing it right but the game was broken. This was a common problem across forums and happened in two separate parts of the game requiring me to restart and redo some of the level. In a game so short these major flaws are hard to look past. There was also a third issue where I had to switch from using a controller to the keyboard even though the game had a warning saying that it required a controller to play. The reason I had to switch was because a part of the game was literally impossible using an Xbox 360 controller. Again I wasted so much time trying to figure out how to beat the puzzle only to find out I was doing it right but the game wouldn&apos;t let me progress. As well as that of course, I had to relearn how to control the game with the keyboard just so I could get past that part of the game, talk about shattering the immersion. So overall, it&apos;s a quaint little concept but it was extremely poorly executed and for a game which took around 4 hours to beat including time wasted due to bugs, it&apos;s hard to forgive such major issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=4056767">Expand</a></span>

<br>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a fairly original game where you control two brothers simultaneously, one with each joystick on your controller. Given its incredibly high Metacritic rating and uniqueness, one would think this would be a good game. Sadly, it is not.
<br>
<br>Story
<br>
<br>The story of this game is supposed to be one of its big draws. It is, essentially, the quintessential sad story. The brothers&apos; mother drowns, their father gets sick, and it falls to the two of them to go through the world, overcoming challenges to get the cure for him. The story, as it were, is very sparse; there&apos;s a few moments where the brothers help out each other, such as the big brother diving in to help the younger one throughout one level, and then at the end of the game, when the big brother gets hurt, it is the little brother&apos;s turn to help out.
<br>It ends with the older brother dying just before the cure gets to him, the brother returning home with the cure for his father, and them kneeling before the mother&apos;s and brother&apos;s graves.
<br>The characters all speak in simlish, and ultimately communicate via gestures. Unfortunately, the net effect of this was to make me not care about them at all; I understood their personalities to some extent, but I never connected to them as people, and thus I didn&apos;t ever really care about them. Indeed, the very nature of the game - using the two brothers as pieces to solve the puzzles - really divorced me from caring about them.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>
<br>This game is interesting by being simultaneously innovative and mediocre. The underlying idea behind the game is clever - you control two characters and you have to use them to overcome various puzzles and challenges. There are times when you have to be moving both characters around at the same time, and times when one character stands there and holds a lever down (or just waits) for the other brother to do stuff.
<br>The game is at its best when you need to use both brothers at once to do stuff, but unfortunately, while the gameplay mechanic sounds really neat, it actually gets pretty old after a while; most of the puzzles are fundamentally fairly similar, and while you do various actions, none of the puzzles are particularly difficult or challenging. It generally is very obvious what you are supposed to do, which sounds like a good thing until you realize that it means that the game is more or less leading you by the nose throughout its length. There&apos;s only a few points at which the mechanics are all that interesting; for much of the rest of the game, after the beginning, you&apos;re more or less repeating yourself, with the odd new puzzle added in.
<br>The game did do something fairly clever at the end, though; after the older brother dies, the younger brother is left on his own. Throughout the rest of the game, the younger brother has been afraid of swimming, having to cling to his older brother for support when in the water. At the very end of the game, he is faced with no choice but to swim, and the controller vibrates as you push up to the edge of the water; only by using the older brother&apos;s action button can you swim across it. You also have to summon his strength again to pull down a lever which previously only he could move.
<br>Unfortunately, while this was clever, it wasn&apos;t very deep, and that&apos;s the trouble with the whole game - it is very shallow.
<br>
<br>Graphics
<br>
<br>The graphics of the game are okay but not amazing; the characters are all cartoony, but they aren&apos;t quite high polygon enough to really look as good as they should. There are some moments in the game where things are very pretty looking, but on the whole, it isn&apos;t nearly so nice looking.
<br>
<br>Final Summary
<br>
<br>Brothers has an interesting central mechanic, but unfortunately the overall game is very shallow. It is pretty short - clocking in at about 4 hours in length for 100% completion, less if you don&apos;t explore all the areas fully - but even in that time it gets repetitive. It is not worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=4250910">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>At first, I thought &quot;wow, this will be a great game for my nephew, he will love this&quot; until it suddenly turned teen rated (maybe even mature) halfway through, which was unnecessary. Still, I was really enjoying the exploration/journey, it felt so magical. However, the last 1/4 of the game ruined it for me. There was no climax, which I was expecting. I imagined this massive tree that would eventually appear in some grand valley, etc. but that was not the case. The ending just came out of nowhere and was very dull. I did not like the overly dramatic seriousness of it. I actually quit the game out of frustration due to a glitch during the very last cinematic and never went back to watch it again.
<br>
<br>Very disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=4461323">Expand</a></span>

<br>In fact, I really don&apos;t understand why this game have a good review. But.. some games that I don&apos;t like I&apos;m just like : &quot;ok.. not my style but it can be cool for some people I guess!&quot;. Here .. hmm.. can be cool for somebody who has never play a good game with a good story. The deep story ? Please... there&apos;s just nothing. Nothing. Really. Please, there&apos;s game with real story, real depth... plenty of them. Do them, do them and never go back in brothers : A tale of nope.
<br>
<br>Scene graphism are cool... but you don&apos;t know why this is at this place or that thing at another place. With this huge problem, this world seem empty and you just don&apos;t feel it at all. This way, graphism are useless. There is no artistic direction, artistic idea. This world wasn&apos;t here before you, and will vanish without you. It has no meaning, no story, nothing. Like the game itself in fact.
<br>
<br>Our heroes are just horrible.. it&apos;s not the case if you don&apos;t talk to any PNJ. But if you interact with only one of them, you will hate your character fors the entire playthrough. Facial expression is absent... and for a game that wanted to be deep, with empathy ... it&apos;s really disturbing.
<br>
<br>Gameplaywise there&apos;s just nothing. Oh wait... yes there&apos;s something... one act, one idea. Over, and over, and over again.. and again... and another act.. and that&apos;s a loop. A loop of nothing.
<br>
<br>Please.. please don&apos;t play this game. Never, ever play this game. Never.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=5996287">Expand</a></span>

The story&apos;s tone is flat-out bipolar, rapidly switching from suicide to whimsical hang-gliding within the span of a few minutes. The characters are shallow, cliche, and poorly set-up, like the character designers spent all their time in the office playing ping pong, with NPCs&apos; most memorable interaction with the player being the direction they point. Most puzzles are offensively obvious, while the few others rely on moon logic. The main character is simply unlikable (along with almost every other NPC you &quot;interact&quot; with), a bother to society and a burden on anyone unfortunate enough to interact with him. He has absurd fears which slow the game down, much to the users&apos; frustration. &quot;Bosses&quot; all seem ripped from other games, whether an invisible monster drawing an eye-roll, or the stupid lug who indirectly kills himself by running into walls. The controls are ridiculously confusing and frustrating without a gamepad, trying to move multiple characters at once  it clearly wasn&apos;t ported properly.
<br>
<br>Then, just before the end of the game, 505 suddenly reveals it was all intentional. Every frustration I felt, all the shortcomings I thought the game had, suddenly make sense as storytelling mechanics. My defenses were down as I realized what an idiot I am, and then they go right for the heart with the most powerful emotional experience I&apos;ve ever had in gaming. Absolutely unforgettable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3619380">Expand</a></span>

The concept and controls worked perfectly (used a controller) and the game was perfectly paced, never boring, never tedious. I&apos;m usually not the most patient gamer and rarely take the time to do things in a game that doesn&apos;t give me any tangible game-rewards. Here I played a lot more with the surroundings  becoming genuinely interested in the two brothers and the world they could interact with. I even checked out the achievement list after finishing the first time to find new fun and pointless things to do. That&apos;s a first for this veteran gamer.
<br>
<br>I also started playing this game a second time, now with my 3 year old daughter. Granted, some of the scenes were a little bit scary for her  but I have never seen her so engaged in any game before. The way the game doesn&apos;t rely on understanding the made up language makes it very easy to follow the story for children. She tried controlling a bit when she wanted to and passed the controls to me quite often to progress.
<br>
<br>One of my best purchases ever.
<br>
<br>I got a wired controlled quite recently to check out State of Decay  and I think that affected the experience quite a bit. This is the first time (perhaps except  for Tekken and the likes) that I have found a console controller to be essential for the experience  so strongly recommend you get one hooked up to your PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3723594">Expand</a></span>

Having to control two characters simultaneously was a nice challenge, and the basic message of love and cooperation was very satisfying. I also liked that the ending had real feeling that was different from what you get in most computer games. I took off a point for not being &apos;open-world&apos;:  you have a fairly narrow path to follow. I didn&apos;t get most of the achievements, but they aren&apos;t integral to the story and it would take considerable random clicking to unlock most of them. There were a lot of passages that required imagination and ingenuity to solve; it reminded me of GW2 jumping puzzles or certain platformers. The lack of English dialog was, in some ways, a plus; it certainly wasn&apos;t hard to follow most of the conversations due to the cleverness of the drawing. Some plot twists were surprising. I certainly recommend this game ahead of most shooters I&apos;ve played, mainly because of the emotional dynamics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3732292">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have to warn potential buyers that this is more of a story/movie than a game. In fact, the game elements were by far the least interesting. It requires the player to do somewhat confusing controller magic which took me out of the great involved story line. Because you control both thumbsticks and both left and right trigger at the same time (yes, sometimes all together at once) I had some failures with the platforming part because I forgot which buttons and sticks to use. But, it never got to the point where I would fail more than 3 times or so.
<br>
<br>2.
<br>The game is extremely short. I finished it in under 2 hours. This might be too short for the price for some people.
<br>
<br>Now for the good part:
<br>This game is utterly beautiful (I played on 2560x1440). It looks like one of the most lovingly created games I&apos;ve ever played. All the environments and creatures are just amazing. The game uses very vibrant colours in day time, and really bleak colours at night which really portray the mood you are experiencing. The music is also something very special. One of the better musical scores in any game I know of. There is not much of it, but what is there is of &apos;Lord of the rings&apos; ilk and quality.
<br>The game starts positive with a lot of tiny details like petting cute animals and having fun with the villagers. Gradually it turns ever darker.
<br>If you want to have an experience that has the power to move you psychologically, this is the game for you. See it as sort of an interactive drama movie.

One thing I must mention  very comfortable controls (if you use gamepad). Overall, this game is a small work of art. Try not to miss it, it takes only 3 hours to complete, but  you&apos;ll get unforgettable impressions.</span>

It was heartbreaking, beautiful, suspenseful, challenging, and uplifting all rolled into one.  My grandkids (ages 6 and 9) were screaming out loud on some parts they were so scared but then when we made it through a challenge we were all screaming for joy!!  We played from around 11 am through 8 pm and just could not stop playing until we had finished it!!  One used a controller and the other was on keyboard (big sister/little sister just like the brothers).  It was just a fantastic family experience!!  We&apos;ll probably start a new game when they come back over again we had so much fun.  Many kudos 505 Games!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/user-reviews?user_review_id=3929083">Expand</a></span>
