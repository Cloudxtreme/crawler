Been a fan ever since the original in 1995. 1, Armageddon and then perhaps Reloaded are my favorites, but with Worms: W.M.D I think I might have to change that to a singular game. In other words: This game is everything I love about Worms. For some reason Revolution just didn&apos;t work for me. Not in a technical sense, but in the sense that it didn&apos;t have that magic ingredient that is absolutely imperative for a Worms game to work. W.M.D has this in spades!
<br>
<br>First off, the vehicles! I love them! It is amazing how much it adds to the gameplay. Then there&apos;s the single player gampaign, which is actually quite well done and challenging. You sortof get the idea of what they want you to do, but since it is Worms, everything doesn&apos;t always turn out the way you thought it would. And that mayhem is just a blast to behold. Literally!
<br>
<br>The personality of the Worms also shines through. Probably THE most important thing in a Worms game is the speech banks. And so far I&apos;ve chuckled aplenty when my Worms complain or scream when a grenade lands nearby. It&apos;s just a lot of fun to watch this game in action.
<br>
<br>The new Worms design is also a large step forward. Gone is the super-cute Worms of the past. Now we have a more sinister looing worm, without shedding the cuteness completely. And that&apos;s ultimately the personality I want the worms to have. They are sortof these tough little guys who believe they are the master of the world. But they **** up over and over again, and thus we feel sorry for them while laughing our asses off.
<br>
<br>Some small glitches aside, this game is the ultimate worms game. I give it a 9 since, unfortunately, there&apos;s still no easy way to create and upload custom speech banks, tomb stones and so on. I have been wishing for this forever. But Team17 doesn&apos;t seem to prioritize it. I would love to go bananas making these things and uploading. Perhaps in a future update.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: This is the best Worms game since the series began.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worms-wmd/user-reviews?user_review_id=6679394">Expand</a></span>

<br>BUT: This game  needs a lot of changes from the developer, or the online community is dead again in a few months as everybody goes back to Worms Armageddon.
<br>
<br>Besides many small things that need tweaks and fixes, the developer needs to add a global text chat to the server browser, the option to put craftable weapons into schemes, and many missing weapons like Bow &amp; Arrow, Freeze, Moles, Petrol Bombs, Low Gravity, Mole, and others.
<br>
<br>This game is not on one level with Worms: Armageddon but if they keep working on it, it could be.
<br>
<br>Also a warning: If you buy this game you don&apos;t get all the weapons. Some were exclusive as a pre-order bonus. They have to fix this and give all weapons to all players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worms-wmd/user-reviews?user_review_id=6660074">Expand</a></span>

So cute and fun, but a really educational game too. I love playing it with kids.
