The adventure interface is pretty slick (read: simple) and there&apos;s a nice hint system (parrot) that lets you determine how much you do or do not want to spoil yourself if you&apos;re stuck on a puzzle that seems just too counter-intuitive for you. If I had to pick one thing that bugged me it would be that I had to turn voices off because the main character&apos;s voice irked me. That minor, rather subjective criticism aside, the writing and plot were far more than expected for a budget title. It kept me entertained from start to finish and you could do far worse for far more dollars!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jolly-rover/user-reviews?user_review_id=1373793">Expand</a></span>

The parrot hint system has slight hints and obvious hint that are blatant solutions for the desperate. This game has been a real joy to play.</span>

Its a shame that the gameplay is so uninspiring as the narrative is really humorous and entertaining and could have made it a stand-out. It is also very short lived (steam says that I completed it 97 minutes).

However having said that, this isn&apos;t an extremely bad game but it failed to be memorable and doesn&apos;t offer much replay value after you&apos;ve finished it once. The music scores are nice but sound far too basic for a full-length feature but the comedy gets an A+ from me. It&apos;s as good as ANY I&apos;ve seen in a point-and-click adventure including the aforementioned M.E. classics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jolly-rover/user-reviews?user_review_id=2158245">Expand</a></span>
