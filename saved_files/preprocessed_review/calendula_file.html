It&apos;s a very good meta game, and it&apos;s pretty much a psychological horror game, and a damn of an effective one. Great atmosphere, and it feels disturbing, uncomfortable, unpleasent, unnerving, and of course, memorable. The game is surely short, but overall mindblowing. It&apos;s a really good game, that&apos;s pretty much all i can say. It creates suspense and anxiety, and it really disturbs you, it creeps you out, and surely it psychologically scared the hell out of me. A 10/10, without much to say exactly why, but i really enjoyed it overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/calendula/user-reviews?user_review_id=6538588">Expand</a></span>

<br>I don&apos;t wanna spoil the experience, so it&apos;s hard to talk about it. I was amazed by how different it is from everything I played so far, and even with its short duration, how fullfilling it was for me.
<br>Want me to define it? Smart, anxious, well-rounded, uncomfortable, unique... and also meta as ****
<br>
<br>Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!</span>

It felt like a movie, very Lynch-y. It is not a game for everybody, but I&apos;ve recommended it to some friends, hope they like it as much as I do. It has just become one of my favourite indie games.</span>
