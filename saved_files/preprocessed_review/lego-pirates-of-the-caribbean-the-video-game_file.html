<br>A Bunch of busy work.
<br>LEGO Pirates tells the story of the first 4 pirates of the Caribbean movies and is hands down the most boring lego game I&#x2019;ve ever played
<br>I&#x2019;m a decent fan of the pirates movies.. I enjoy their stories and characters&#x2026;
<br>what I&#x2019;m not a fan of however is lego games&#x2026;
<br>but at least past lego games have been a little engaging...
<br>This one is just a bunch of boring chores&#x2026;
<br>like every lego game you control multiple characters at once&#x2026;
<br>and you can play local co-op&#x2026;
<br>break things to build things and collect studs&#x2026;
<br>LEGO pirates though is more about finding than it is building though&#x2026;
<br>Specifically when you have jack sparrow in your crew as he has a compass that will take you to an item you need to bring to someone else to get them to join your crew or pick up and place somewhere on the map to continue the story..
<br>This monotonous item hunting is the entire game&#x2026;
<br>its 8 and a half hours of boring finding items and trading items&#x2026;
<br>There are a few short lived fun moments in the game that I feel should&#x2019;ve been used more like rolling around in a ball cage or using the underwater barrels&#x2026;
<br>but these moments make up a grand total of about 5 minutes&#x2026;
<br>the rest of the game is aimlessly breaking things or throwing items at targets while a bunch of annoying enemies slash at you&#x2026;
<br>there are boss battles here too.. Also boring&#x2026;
<br>chasing characters around a map and mashing the attack button while your crew pretends to be helping... but they&#x2019;re not...
<br>they&#x2019;re useless throughout the entire game&#x2026;
<br>they won&#x2019;t pull switches, they won&#x2019;t stay in positions you place them&#x2026;
<br>it&#x2019;s annoying having to manage them in moments you need them to stay still..
<br>Of course I&#x2019;m thankful for them following me during the few platforming sections and I need their skill to repair something or I need their saber to pull a lever and they&#x2019;re right there...
<br>but this game definitely needed an option of making a character stay put&#x2026;
<br>I would&#x2019;ve thought that maybe this game could&#x2019;ve been saved by the story and charm of the characters.. But this isn&#x2019;t the case either as the story telling was awful too&#x2026; I had no idea what was going on... and again... I&#x2019;ve seen the movies&#x2026;
<br>LEGO pirates of the Caribbean is the weakest lego game I&#x2019;ve played to date&#x2026;
<br>I&#x2019;m waiting for one to change my mind&#x2026;
<br>but this wasn&#x2019;t it..
<br>I give Lego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game
<br>a 5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lego-pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7399263">Expand</a></span>
