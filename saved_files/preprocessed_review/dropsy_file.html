<br>Controls: Standard point-n-click adventure.
<br>
<br>Audio: The fantastic Chris Schlarb did an amazing job with the score for this game, sound effects are great.
<br>
<br>Story: Light-hearted and hug filled. But, with some dark moment (seriously... the end of the game caused literal tears).
<br>
<br>C&apos;mon and start your hugventure - you won&apos;t regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dropsy/user-reviews?user_review_id=5481645">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Dropsy is a beautiful, warm point and click varied with some fittingly disturbing elements. Like with Machinarium there is no speech or text involved, communication is with little rebuses that almost all of the time make perfect sense. There are phones and writings that you&apos;ll never be able to comprehend since well.. you&apos;re Dropsy. Your main activity will be helping - and hugging - all the people around you, gaining their trust and love while making the world a better place. It is by exploration that both story and the pretty big game world unfolds, giving you that great sense of wonder with each new screen you walk into. The surroundings feel fresh and slightly weird, comparable to those of Sam and Max (albeit a bit less over the top I guess.. maybe).
<br>
<br>There are some minor sidequests (scavanger hunts, really) to be done besides following the main story line. That gives the game some longevity besides the four hours give or take that it would take to complete otherwise, but also I do believe that you&apos;ll get different endings according to how much you have done. I only finished it once so far though so I&apos;ll have to figure that out myself as well. Steam achievements are not yet working at the time of this writing, but that&apos;s about to be fixed very soon so that will be an extra incense to explore thoroughly.
<br>
<br>So yes, give this game a hug and buy it, the fart button alone is totally worth it! 3&lt;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dropsy/user-reviews?user_review_id=5499276">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It is equally endearing and haunting, ultimately bittersweet to almost heartbreaking degrees, and has deep themes about loss and self loathing while having a button in the menu that just makes a fart noise.
<br>
<br>With it&apos;s tonal shifts, weird characters, and bright colors, it feels like David Lynch designed a Sesame Street game.
<br>
<br>You can probably beat it in a day, but boy, what a day that will be. Truly unforgettable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dropsy/user-reviews?user_review_id=5481699">Expand</a></span>

<br>I spent an hour wandering around and solved a few puzzles, but frankly, there has been absolutely nothing whatsoever to love about this game. There&apos;s a few things you can pick up, some unclear puzzles, and frankly a lot of &quot;well, what are you supposed to do next?&quot;

<br>I&apos;m not bonding with the characters, and I feel like I&apos;ve hardly made any progress in the game. What&apos;s the point of this? Why did critics call this charming?

<br>The art is intentionally ugly and I&apos;m just confused over what is supposed to be so great about this game. I get that there&apos;s an aesthetic to it - the ugly cute - but frankly, I&apos;m just not seeing anything heartwarming here as the reviews promised.

<br>Favorite Thing: This game oozes personality and style. There&apos;s a lot of feeling and emotion conveyed without using words.
<br>Least Favorite Thing: It was a basic and simple game (in a good way), they should have kept the ending basic and simple.

<br>
<br>The value of the game is being given the opportunity to help these distant, broken, sadly recognizable people, and help them and make the world better. It values kindness and empathy in way that isn&apos;t patronizing or overly saccharine.
<br>
<br>Dropsy centers around personal, internal pains, and handles them gently but maturely. It really is quite a satisfying play.
<br>
<br>Puzzle solutions are chellengingly abstract, but not so much so that they won&apos;t be discovered with a bit of exploration and paying attention to clues. Dosen&apos;t have the pitfall of pixel hunting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dropsy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6088961">Expand</a></span>
