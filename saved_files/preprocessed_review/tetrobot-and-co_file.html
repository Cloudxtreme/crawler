You don&apos;t have to be a puzzle whiz to complete it, though, since it&apos;s not that hard to access the portal that completes each level. The real challenge comes in getting all three of the bonus items in each level. Unlike other puzzles, in which bonus items are thrown in to inflate the difficulty and you aren&apos;t expected to get them, the bonus items in Tetrobot are large parts of each level and you&apos;re almost expected to at least try to get them. If you&apos;re a puzzle lover or a perfectionist, you&apos;ll want to get every one. Few games *really* stretch my puzzle-solving skills, but this is one. Many of the bonus items are fiendishly hard to get to. Anyways, if you love puzzle games, especially challenging ones, definitely check this one out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tetrobot-and-co/user-reviews?user_review_id=4403874">Expand</a></span>
