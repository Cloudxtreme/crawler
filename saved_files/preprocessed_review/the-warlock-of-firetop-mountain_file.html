Those are just my first impressions, I have read Firetop mountain and it was a decent adventure book, most of the Fighting Fantasy series is excellent.

<br>
<br>The game play consists of story driven text, each time you will given a set of choices( as per the book)
<br>there are adventuring options as well as combat, you can accrue items and do combat; in all this is a very good concept.
<br>
<br>The format of figurine turn based movement in a board like 3d environment is the best I have seen in any of the books video game counterparts, the preview itself made me want to play this.
<br>
<br>I give it points for style, substance and being an awesome idea, and have to subtract a few for the god awful combat
<br>
<br>I recommend you buy it if only to keep the format alive, and to promote future development of the other books(city of thieves)
<br>
<br>[By the way, why rate a game without saying why, I hate this and I know this is off track, but I haven&apos;t had this a day and there is a rating without review...even its a developer,  include a description and a why}</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-warlock-of-firetop-mountain/user-reviews?user_review_id=6679626">Expand</a></span>
