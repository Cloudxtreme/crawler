After playing 28 hours using two different characters I write this criticism to praise the work of developers. Everything is improved.
<br>Character classes that are available are sufficient to achieve plenty of adventures in the game. The skill tree is efficient and clear. If you fail there are always return options.
<br>The growth of the degree of difficulty between levels may require some adjustments for improved balance. There are jumps between current levels (big jumps, a canyon). Each level can show power and strength of opponents no comparison to the level of the character. If you change the difficulty of the game, imbalance reverses. We are ant on a level of the game and are giants choose one below. This is annoying. But it does not end with the proposal of the game. Only this needs adjustments.
<br>Graphics are very good. Environments load time is fast. I have no problem with online system. There may be, but I played around 30 hours and have not seen happen problems with the online system. Although, I played very little multiplayer to speak of it for sure. My view is directly to the gameplay alone.
<br>For this, the game is fully satisfying and fun as it was the first play of the series. I liked it and recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=5664349">Expand</a></span>

<br>Overall the elements are standard fair.  The leveling is particularly fast even at later levels.  The reputation system seems underdeveloped though as I was only around 10 even though I beat everything.  This makes the perks pretty much useless.
<br>
<br>Most encounters are OK provided you choose the right character. But most bosses tended to 1-hit key you because of the lackluster approach to health regen. They also tended to spawn enemies continuously. You pretty much need a &quot;heal on hit&quot; to survive.  Overall though not a difficult game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=6033368">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I first want to applaud Neocore Games for this revamped edition, enhancing almost every aspect of the previous entries. While the first releases were kind of rough gems, this final cut now renders everything more accessible, from the difficulty, to the various classes and skill trees.
<br>
<br>There&#x2019;s a lot to like about this game, from the steampunk setting, to the quality of the audio and voices of the main protagonists, to the high number of hiddens that can be found for those willing to pay attention to conversations and to explore the environment. While hack and slash games are mostly about mindless killing and loot, the incredible adventures of Van Helsing do try to bring fresh and enjoyable elements on the table.
<br>
<br>Many skills are available and almost any build can be viable, while all of them can be changed easily if your choices leave you insatisfied. One key point of the game lie in the interaction and cooperation between Van Helsing and his ghostly companion, lady Katarina, which you can level up too, as you see fit. Their conversations are often funny, while never trying too much to be.
<br>
<br>From the tower defense parts to the optional quests, a lot of care has been taken into the differents parts of the game and into details. I highly recommend anyone loving the genre to give it a try. As for now, the bugs I personally encountered have been fixed so far and Neocore games support has been fast and helpful when needed. There are still balance issues between classes, but nothing that should keep your from enjoying a great and quite unique action rpg.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=5758204">Expand</a></span>
