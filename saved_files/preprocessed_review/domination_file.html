<br>If you&apos;ve ever played Mischief Makers post-N64 era, you&apos;ll know what I&apos;m talking about here. What was, at the time, somewhat behind on graphics and sound now just comes off as &quot;an ordinary old game&quot;. It just doesn&apos;t look poorly-made anymore!
<br>The other improvement was in bugs. Very nearly all of them have been fixed.
<br>The story and voice-acting still suck though. The story is a typical excuse plot, like Advance Wars with less interesting characters, and the voice-acting is hilariously bad! But this isn&apos;t the kind of game you play for the campaign anyway, so whatever.
<br>
<br>One thing that&apos;s gone completely now is the multiplayer. The one that used to be subscription-based, for some reason. The AI is good enough, better than normal strategy game AI, but if you want to play with friends you have to get Massive Assault Network 2 instead (which isn&apos;t as good at all for single-player).
<br>
<br>This is all without reviewing the good sides. In that regard, let me just say: it&apos;s basically the best turn-based strategy game system ever made! It&apos;s REALLY good! Imagine Advance Wars mixed with Hearthstone, with a lot more randomness than either. If you haven&apos;t played both those games... um... it&apos;s just really good!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/domination/user-reviews?user_review_id=3926666">Expand</a></span>
