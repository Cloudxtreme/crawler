Ys Origin is NOT a console experience. Ys Origin is a PC exclusive. Although Falcom has recently turned to the psp and vita after they lost their PC distributor, they developed almost exclusively PC since the early 80s. The Zelda feeling people are getting should be flipped: the Ys series, which branched off from Dragonslayer, began in 1987. The first LoZ was released in 1986. Dragonslayer began in 1984. The modern day Zelda experience is absolutely nothing like Ys, and serves as a horrible comparison. Ys is traditionally known for its music and difficult boss fights. The composers are from the jdk sound team, which is the remnants of the jdk band from the early 90s. Their primary genre was metal. The boss fights and general gameplay is often cited as using button mashing. Unless you want to die every time, you won&apos;t use button mashing. Most boss fights have patterns and tiers, so you can&apos;t just inflict massive amounts of damage all at once. Many people also tend to think the gameplay requires grinding. Since levels only affect your base stats, this statement is false. The stages within boss fights do not allow you to do any more than a set amount of damage, so all grinding helps you with is staying alive longer if you get hit a lot. In short, grinding is only necessary if you&apos;re bad.
<br>
<br>A single playthrough on Nightmare takes about 30 hours the first time through. There are 3 playable characters with different stories and boss fights, so a full, 100% completion of the story could take you 70 or 80 hours to complete. There is also a time attack mode for boss fights, which helps to add a bit more replay ability to the game. For $20, this is a great game that everyone should consider trying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ys-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=2540595">Expand</a></span>

The story happened in the past, and I am afraid that there is no Adol(The legendary red hair guy) this time.  The fans of Ys series/Falcom games don&apos;t need to read my review to decide whether to buy this game or not, as they would have already got it I am sure.  For those who have not play any Falcom games before, I would need to make a few things clear.  Ys origin is not a 10years development top graphic hardcore 3D engine RPG game.  It is more like a 2.5D ARPG (looking down at the character with layers of artwork), but trust me Falcom make this kind of games good with love!!!  It is definitely the best gift for the Ys fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ys-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=2787652">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t wait! Grab it!**
<br>I&apos;m new to the Ys series and I fell in love with the game immediately. It&apos;s a solid mix of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Torchlight, and Disgaea for those who are familiar with those franchises. The controls are fully configurable between keyboard, mouse, and game controller; you can have all of one or a mix. I found the defaults to be a bit awkward, but my version is very comfortable and effective for me (WASD: movement, QEZX: diagonal movement, 123: equip skill, left mouse button attack, right mouse button: use skill, middle mouse button: boost). Note that movement using the mouse is also an option. The gameplay is tons of fun and in real-time; I have only played as the melee character so far, but I&apos;m eager to try out the mage character and the third unlockable character. I believe they each have unique stories/dialogue. As the melee character, you have a nice assortment of ground and aerial attacks that flow together and allow for combos and flexibility. The MP consuming skills look really cool, are a lot of fun, play in to different playstyles, and have hidden type-effectiveness against monsters. Your gear can be upgraded as you find better items in chests as well as get blessings or temper your weapon, but there isn&apos;t so much of it that you get bogged down with trying to &quot;gear up&quot; like WoW or Torchlight. The plot, character assortment, and character development is akin to watching a TV show; there&apos;s enough to keep you interested and know what&apos;s going on, but not so much that you get bored and want to skip. You *don&apos;t* have to grind much to keep up; clearing the rooms as you go along is enough. However, you *can* grind if you want to, because mobs in rooms respawn when you leave, like Zelda. Bosses are huge, cool, and fun to take down. You build a strategy and learn to read their attacks with each attempt, and it goes from hard to not so bad. On normal difficulty, the game is challenging without being overwhelming, which is really great since easy games get old quickly. There&apos;s also hard and nightmare difficulties for the brave and experienced. Healing and boosting items drop from mobs and are consumed instantly, so you have the challenge of not being able to control when you use them while also not having to worry about using them.
<br>Ys Origin also has great re-playability as I mentioned: Different protagonists with different attack-styles and different stories, many difficulties (very easy to nightmare), lots of upgrades to get (you might miss some on the first play-through), a long list of expensive blessings (permanent buffs) to armor and your character (faster MP regen, debuff duration reduction, etc.).
<br>I&apos;m so glad I bought this game. I&apos;m passed halfway and I&apos;ve loved every minute. There&apos;s a demo on steam if you&apos;d like to try that first; I haven&apos;t played the demo, but I can tell you that the actual game is wonderful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ys-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874936">Expand</a></span>

Ys was criminally neglected back when I was a kid, I never had a Turbografx and therefore never got to experience it. Years later, with the internet I was able to learn about this series. I love it. Both the classic games and the newer ones. Let me explain why this game almost objectively deserves a 10. First, you need to play on nightmare. Nightmare should actually be the normal mode, as it&apos;s not actually that hard at all. All enemies are unique, and all have different attacks and patterns, which on nightmare, you will have to put effort into dodging. The bosses are guaranteed to kill you multiple times, and require you to learn their patterns and practice, which are exactly how bosses should be. You will have grind, but you&apos;ll have to do very little of it, even on nightmare. In fact, just by exploring you should be fine to face the bosses. If you realize you&apos;re too weak, do 5 minutes worth of grinding and you&apos;ll be good. On lower difficulties, which were probably used to review the game, Ys: Origin probably came off as not much more than a button masher where you can safely tank everything with little worries. The gameplay is almost perfect, and is extremely elegant in its simplicity. The graphics are great, 2D sprites on a 3D polygonal environment. The artwork is all top notch, with the women not being sexualized (which is a good thing, trust me).  There&apos;s some really nice areas in the game, especially the water sections. The game has really low spec requirements, and it&apos;s a steal at $15, let alone $7.49 when it&apos;s on sale. Give it a go, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ys-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=3843251">Expand</a></span>

<br>It reminds me Dark Souls, where you learn the patterns, but you can only win when you achieve perfection - which can be frustrating if you dislike challenge

The great boss fight design, and three charactors have three totally different combat systems. Falcom also involved some shooting game elements into this game. This game is great, players who like old school arpg should play the game</span>

The graphics feel dated, and two-dimensional at times, but this game is obviously not going for ultra-realism. However, in an odd way, it brings that nostalgic feel. It is a very average game, but sometimes, average works.</span>

However, if you haven&apos;t played Ys I and II, you&apos;ll still be able to enjoy Origin.  Origin makes an excellent starting point in the series because, like the preceding Ys title (The Oath in Felghana, a remake of Ys III), it has unparallelled difficulty scaling.  Unlike many action games/RPGs that simply buff enemy health and damage on higher difficulties, Ys Origin gives bosses extra attacks, makes enemies more aggressive, changes the mechanics on certain attacks to make them more difficult to dodge, and truly challenges the player.  On Normal and lower, most bosses are only slightly challenging to an experienced player and have simplified patterns and attacks.  For example, a boss that shoots a rapid-fire stream of magic missles at you on Normal will fire 3 sepearate streams on Hard, and on Nightmare, 5.  Projectiles also may move faster and track you more accurately, and other attacks may have added AOE effects or leave the boss less open.  These changes make is so that even inexperienced players can stand a chance on lower difficulties, and masters of action games will still have a grueling challenge awaiting them on the higher difficulty settings.  You&apos;ll spend the majority of your time dungeon crawling and fighting bosses.  While the dungeons can be challenging and most bosses will take dozens of attempts on the highest difficulty, it never gets tedious because you can simply re-try from the last checkpoint (which usually aren&apos;t too far apart) and during boss fights, you can simply start the fight over from the beginning without having to walk back to the encounter or watch an intro cutscene.  While some might find he lack of punishment as a detraction, it&apos;s really a saving grace - you&apos;ll spend A LOT of time retrying boss fights on the hardest difficulty, as even the slightest mistake can turn the tides against you irrevocably.  The boss fights demand perfection and mastery of the mechanics and skills, quick thinking, and careful planning without throwing unfair challenges at you like unavoidable attacks.  However, it also demands that you carefully explore each area thoroughly for upgrades, equipment, and items that wil help you.  Missing a single weapon upgrade can make some fights nigh-unwinnable, but thankfully it&apos;s pretty obvious when you&apos;ve missed one.
<br>
<br>There are 3 seperate playable characters in the story mode and while the story is nothing special and the characters are rather shallow, it&apos;s not much of a focus.  However, the fact that the story isn&apos;t a focus doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t there - there&apos;s just enough plot to keep you motivated to continue and while most characters are simplistic, they&apos;re still likable enough to grow attached to.
<br>
<br>The music is arguably the best part of the game and while Origin&apos;s soundtrack suffers a bit overall compared to the rest of the series, it&apos;s still one of the best in the industry.  The boss themes are fitting, keeping you on your toes, getting your blood pumping, and hyping you up for the encounter.  In addition, the true final boss&apos; theme (a remix of a theme from Ys II) is a brilliantly crafted and passionate piece that will simultaneously get you motivated and fill you with despair.  Even if you don&apos;t like the game, it&apos;s at least worth giving the soundtrack a listen.
<br>
<br>Overall Ys Origin is a fantastic experience and a must-play for fans of fast-paced and grueling action games, or anyone who enjoys a fun, thrilling ride with fantastic music and absurdly polished gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ys-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=2888709">Expand</a></span>

Boss fights are intense and have as much spatial awareness as any shmup boss. The music and artstyle are also pretty good. While not required, playing Ys 1&amp;2 will add to your experience storywise.</span>

The bosses are challenging and everyone has it&apos;s own strategy to defeat. Graphics are pretty, I&apos;d describe the style as &quot;cute&quot;. 2D characters on 3D levels. Everything is bright and colorful. The controls are OK, especially if you are using a gamepad. The storyline is pretty simplistic and the characters are nothing special. Overall, a nice game here!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ys-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=2904442">Expand</a></span>

Unlike another Ys titles, all the game is placed inside a great tower but each level of that tower has its own theme. I think Ys Origin is a very enjoyable game and I recommend it.</span>

Use of a gamepad is preferred. I picked it up during a Steam Sale and am very satisfied with the purchase.

<br>It&#x2019;s a dungeon crawler (or in this case: climber) that manages to keep things fresh enough so that it doesn&#x2019;t get boring. It also has some very entertaining boss fights. The graphics will remind you of a few old SNES games, but despite that are very sharp and hi-res. Environments &amp; visual effects are also very nice and there are a few anime cutscenes thrown in for good measure.
<br>
<br>The weakest part is the story, which is a bit blah. Not as bad as other JRPGs I&#x2019;ve played, but still has that overall unserious feel (e.g. demons are taking over the world and only the axe-wielding, 12 year old girl with the oven mitts can save us) as well as the sometimes spotty dialogue. Additionally, you can play through the game as three different characters, but your experience will be pretty much the same each time aside from different attack methods, so there isn&#x2019;t much reason to.
<br>
<br>From a pure gaming standpoint, though, this one&#x2019;s worth at least one playthrough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ys-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=3661327">Expand</a></span>

I played through the game with dual Lone-Wolf on the hardest difficulty to get the best possible experience.  I have about 100 hours invested in the game as of the writing of this review.  Here is a quick rundown of the pro&apos;s and cons from my play through.
<br>
<br>*RPG Element - The RPG element of the game is deep and well fleshed out.  This is a break of fresh air considering how shallow and watered down RPG games have been over the past 10 years.
<br>*Strategy Element - This isn&apos;t a run in and destroy everything type of game.  Strategy is very much required and with the interaction with environment and very large skill trees it makes for dynamic and rich strategic combat.  Even with a perfectly built out team, best gear, best skills/spells, without implementing good strategy you will get destroyed
<br>*No Grind - One of the first RPGs I have ever played where you don&apos;t grind and yet you make it through the game trying to stay ahead of the difficulty curve.  Monsters don&apos;t re-spawn which means you can level beyond the monster which keeps the game tough, but it also eliminates the type of grinding required in 99% of all RPGs.
<br>Rewarding Battles - This is a combination of all of the above, most battles, even small trash mob type battles took me anywhere from 15-60 minutes to complete.  Again the game puts an emphasis on strategy and instead of grinding the same mob hundreds of times for hours, you fight 1 mob 1 time but they make sure you work for it and you get rewarded as if you had been grinding it for hours.
<br>Rich World - The world is rich and vibrant.  Some of the world feels bright and happy while other parts are dark and foreboding.  The developers did a great job at drawing you deep into the game both through story telling and developing a world so real you forget you are playing a game.
<br>*Good Skill Tree/Loot - The game doesn&apos;t shower you in uber gear but it also doesn&apos;t keep it out of reach.  You feel like you find good gear just often enough to make it rewarding but not so often that it becomes meaningless.  My only complain here is that is errs a little to much to the side of being too stingy with gear.  There were times where I would go 20-30 hours of gameplay before I found that better pair of gloves.  Also there are plenty of well flesh out skill trees.  You learn different skill trees, mix and match and try and find the best synergies between different trees.  Because of that there is an almost unlimited number of unique character builds.
<br>
<br>I could probably list another half dozen minor things but those are the major pro&apos;s that stand out.  My only complaint of this game is that the story line starts strong in the beginning but because a bit shallow and far fetched towards the end.  Also the graphics are merely &quot;ok&quot;.  Although the game does have very nice looking spell animation.  Overall any minor cons of this game are all but forgotten with all of the good it has going for it.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a breath of fresh air to once again play a real RPG in the 21st century.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ys-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4661591">Expand</a></span>
