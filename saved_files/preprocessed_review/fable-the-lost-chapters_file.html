It&apos;s reasonably short taking less than 20 hours for me to 100% it but with the amount of times I&apos;ve replayed it I probably have close to a hundred hours in this game. The flaws just don&apos;t bother me as it&apos;s clearly not meant to be a challenging game. The ridiculous economy means you can get super rich right off the bat and the supply of potions available in Albion means you&apos;re as good as invincible. But the game was still fun for me, if you don&apos;t take it seriously you&apos;ll enjoy it a lot more. Some people may have expected an Elder Scrolls like RPG but Fable is a lot more light-hearted I feel and it revels in it&apos;s hyper-clich&#xE9;d storyline. I spent a good deal of time with Fable Explorer as well, the only game I&apos;ve ever really bothered to do any sort of modding with. If it was fun pillaging villages with fireballs and hammers, try shooting 50 bolts of lightning from your hand at once or Berserking till you&apos;re taller than most of the buildings in the village. It may be good for reasons the developer didn&apos;t quite intent but it&apos;s still pretty damn good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2846462">Expand</a></span>

Bad things are black, good things are white, no moral dilemmas in reality, and it&apos;s consequences are not that grave. I have rouble with games that give you a divinely rendered world that is filled with the impossible places to go (invisible walls, no jumping over fences, rocks.... well over anything). Story is not very enticing, or, for that matter, interesting. Very common RPG fare and predictable at several spots. 
<br>Graphics and ambiance are very nice. Voice acting is superb and many instances of it quite funny. CHaracter faces have a lot of personality. Many nice details and proto-ideas, but that is all. Unless you devote yourself at just the exploratory side of trying all chance games, getting all tattoes, experimenting with all magics or physical paths, the games is a breeze. Super short. I think I understand why this chapters had been misplaced to begin with, we don&apos;t quite get to see them as a real treasure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=71012">Expand</a></span>

This game has a very large world with many great secrets to be discovered.  The story and gameplay is what separates this from so many other games of its type.  Obvious buy you will not be disappointed.</span>

I played this game when it first came out, and I still play it today-- the story line is a gripping one, and lets you choose here and there what you want to do based on bad or good. Your appearance even changes due to the choices. There&apos;s multiple ways of making money for an Action RPG, from just killing monsters, to renting out houses and collecting the money. I have played all the Fables, and the first is still by far the best. If you haven&apos;t played it and are skeptical on buying it, I highly recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2080309">Expand</a></span>

I can say that this game still looks and feels nice in 2012. I liked the &quot;fairytale&quot; atmosphere, the alignment features, plus the game has a lot of funny sidequests and minigames.  Oh yeah and I also loved the awesome British accent of the NPCs.</span>

This is a brilliant RPG from Lionhead that still far surpasses any game I have ever played.  The combat system is probably one of the best I&apos;ve ever seen (I have no idea why some reviewers say otherwise), the story is neat without being overwhelming or boring, the choices that you make are quite satisfying and determine several factors further down the road as to what equipment/armor you will use and what story lines you unlock.  Yes, the end result is ultimately the same, but I love that Fable didn&apos;t try to overextend itself and force several main story lines.  It stuck to what it was able to accomplish, unlike so many other games these days are able to do. If you are at all a fan of RPGs or any other type of real-time game, you will absolutely love Fable: The Lost Chapters.  I have played this game since the original was released on the Xbox years ago and I still love it to death.  No, it is not as deep, complex, or involved as other modern-day RPGs, but that&apos;s what I love about it.  My only wish is for a higher difficulty setting as the game is just a tad bit too easy, but otherwise this is the most incredible game I have ever played.....Kudos to Lionhead.  I only wish they had continued the spectacular design into Fable II and III which are certainly two of the worst RPGs of all time.  I can&apos;t possibly give this game any less than a 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2880267">Expand</a></span>

For instance, some things you see in Fable II, such as having children was planned for the original Fable but it didn&apos;t happen. The main story is rather short and there could have been a bigger variety of weapons and armor. However, most fans, including myself, consider TLC to be the best in the series thus far. Frankly, I believe it to be one of the best games I&apos;ve played, period. Although the main quest is short, you can pace yourself, putting 100 plus hours into one play through. Furthermore, despite what some critics have stated, the game has a lot of replay value. A good example of this is how people appear. In one game, Mr. Gout, the school teacher was old, bald and wore glasses. In my next game, he was young, had a full head of hair and no glasses. The children appeared different as well. There&apos;s so much to do in between quests, it&apos;s quite mind boggling. You can buy houses, play card games, get drunk, get other people drunk, and even though you can only play a male protagonist if TLC, you can marry either a man or a woman. In addition, the AI in this game is very good, and people remember things you do. If you break wind or belch in front of someone, they might call you out on it the next time they see you. The crime is also pretty good. You can get busted for stealing or even trespassing. You have the option to be a saint or a devil, where people will cheer or scream as you pass by. All in all, it&apos;s a super great game that I still play today. 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=3185984">Expand</a></span>

The lost chapters adds additional content to extend the story of the hero and adds a small area to the game known as &quot;The Northern Wastes&quot; and adds several additional quests throughout albion as well.

The concept of this game is amazing: you start as a little innocent kid and make you way to become a powerful warrior throughout the years. There&apos;s also an interesting alignment system, just like Black and White (still Molineaux&apos;s masterpiece)  do good things and you become an angel type of character: do bad things and you&apos;ll see horns growing in your forehead, and that is the best thing in this game, you can actually see the changes in your face and body, not only in your alignment, but also scars from battles, body type (strong, thin, tall short) tattoos... you can also have a life, buy houses, get married... the story is also very good (not great, but good).<br><br>That looks awesome, but the execution is not as good. First of all, despite the alignment feature, you don&apos;t have a lot of choices like the game makes you think you have. It doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re good or evil, the story is pretty much the same from start to finish, and the choices you make to get there are very limited. Another problem I have with this game is the aging system. You start as kid, complete a couple of quests and BAM! cut scene and you suddenly a teenager. A few quests later and BAM! cut scene and you&apos;re an adult. That&apos;s it. after that you keep getting older but this is not showed in a realistic way, and you face doesn&apos;t show much changes. However, that&apos;s not a huge issue, it&apos;s just a lot different and much simpler than I thought it would be when I got the game.<br><br>Another problem I have with this game is the repetition, when I played the first Assassin&apos;s Creed, this game came to my mind because they share the same problem: it&apos;s fun for a while but it gets kinda of boring when you noticed you&apos;re doing the same stuff over, over, over and over again, but fortunately this problem is minimized for the great battle system. Still, it gets boring eventually.<br><br>Marriage is pretty lame, your wife (or husband - your character is a guy, but you can be straight, gay or bi in this game) does nothing but say 1 or 2 words when you talk to her. You can have sex but the game goes to a black screen when you do. You can&apos;t have kids. The title system is a joke and the worst thing in the game: You get fame by completing quests, so people start to recognize you and show respect (or fear, depending on your alignment) and they always reefer to you by your title (chicken chaser, deathbringer and so on). The problem is that those titles are not gained for what you do in the game, you just go to a merchant and buy those, just like you buy food or a new tattoo. It&apos;s ridiculous and annoying.<br><br>Like I said before, the battle system is good, very arcade gameplay, like other people already pointed out. Battles are probably the best thing is this game, you have some great skills to learn, and you can build different types of characters (warrior, mage, rogue or a mix of those) and to me that&apos;s what makes this game a little above average. There&apos;s also a lot of different sets of armors and weapons to use that are also great. Anyway, despite all the bad aspects, it&apos;s a good game if you don&apos;t expect too much. I had fun playing it. Peter Molineaux surely have great ideas, and he already prove he can make games that are more than a game but a work of art. Black and White is a masterpice and it&apos;s because of that game I keep waiting for the next game from him. The problem, like I said in the beginning, is just that: great Ideas not executed so well. I haven&apos;t played Fable 2 (not on pc, why?), and I&apos;m on the fence in getting Fable 3 (probably will) so I can&apos;t say if those problems with the first game (or what I see as problems) were fixed or not. For now I can only hope someday I&apos;ll get my hands in something made by Molineaux so great as B&amp;W.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2098769">Expand</a></span>

I still play it today over Far Cry 3, Borderlands 2, and all the other block buster titles that i own. This game is worth it and for only 2.49 on steam you have to get it. Also Fable 2 and 3 were also great game, (more of 2 then 3), but no game that I have every had has been as good of this game... GET IT</span>

The in-game choices all led to the same end, but the game was about HOW you got there, lending it some ability to tell you about how you think of the world. The path to ultimate victory can be littered with the corpses of old allies, the remains of tortured souls, or it can be littered with whatever poor chumps were nearest to hand, it really is up to you. When you are old and withered, you can ignore the masses who scorn you, or you can scorn them in turn and devote your hero to Skorm to reclaim your youth. The demon doors have mutually-exclusive requirements, and while they can be met by more than one criteria in many cases, they still need you to replay at least once to open them all. All in all, The Lost Chapters is a massive success, and plays well to this day on any console. Just don&apos;t pick up any of the sequels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427255">Expand</a></span>

This game is horrendous. You live a whole life in under a day of game time. You can beat this game in 8 hours, 8 hours!  A RPG that took 4 years to make and none of the promised content present. Please never purchase a Peter Molyneux game. After all the lies gamers suffered from Black and White, Fable was the final straw for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833466">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Asume game with a good balance of hand to hand fighting, archery, and magic. It&apos;s great because you can play for hours and still not be finished.  THere are tones of side quest to gain gold and experiance from and many other things to do. It is awsome that you can control almost every aspect of you life from being good or evil to getting married.  I would recommend this game to anyone.</span>

However, in this game, I actually find being good fun. Also, it is very hard to remember all the things I am supposed to be doing. And I mean that in this best possible way. Once again, I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!</span>

Back in it&apos;s day, it was brilliant, and revolutionary.  Having AI that would respond to your decisions and being able to do whatever you wanted, hell, being able to STEAL from shops was revolutionary in itself.  Now though, the gameplay has become somewhat of a staple of any action/RPG, and the animations for mouth movement are...dated to say the least.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you are REALLY into action/RPG&apos;s, get this.  Gameplay is very solid and feels very good, RPG elements are very balanced with the gameplay; you could beat the whole game without ever leveling up your skills if you really chose to do so, though it would be extremely hard, but if you are picking this up for anything but the gameplay, there are better examples of aciton/RPG&apos;s out there nowadays.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=3593042">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Fable TLC is one of my favorite games of all time! It has a nice storyline and good gameplay that&apos;s even better than Fable 2 on the Xbox 360. The downside is that once the game ends you won&apos;t feel like playing that much anymore because there&apos;s no exciting quests left. But this is a recommended game if your looking for an adventure!</span>

<br>[First of all I&apos;d like to point out that I never played the original version of Fable on either the Xbox or PC, The Lost Chapters was and is my only introduction to this game.]
<br>Story: In terms of story, Fable isn&apos;t that amazing. It has a solid and engaging one, and some of the characters do stick with you, but ultimately what sets Fable appart from other games is its unique and wonderful sense of humor and charm. It&apos;s such a weird game sometimes with its jokes and inside jokes (such as certain expressions or descriptions, and even side quests) and it&apos;s all the better for it. Jack of Blades is an interesting villain, though he has way too little backstory overall, and there some very interesting characters (Maze, Scythe to name a few) but it&apos;s a serviceable story more than anything. The game also feels very rushed and, even though I tried to do everything in-between main quests, it always felt like I was getting to the big moments way too fast with no breathing room, while at the same time it managed to drag in some sections (like the Bargate Prison section). However it&apos;s Fable&apos;s interesting world and lore that do stand out and make you want to explore every nook and cranny of the world.
<br>Gameplay: Fable isn&apos;t that outstanding in its gameplay department neither, but it does have satisfying combat and some really cool spells. I do, however, feel that most of the spells are unnecesary as I beat the game using basically two (Berserk and Healing), but for whoever feels inclined to play the game as a mage, they will have plenty to choose from. One huge setback for me was the difficulty. It&apos;s painfully easy (except at the very beginning) and towards the half point of the main story I already had the best gear in the game which made me feel really discouraged to continue playing. Also the sidequests really dry-out in the second half of the game, there&apos;s not really a lot going on outside of the main quest, which is a shame considering that in the first half there were one or two side-quests for every main quest. It took me around 20 hours to complete the game and all of its sidequests (demon doors, silver chests, fighting club, side missions, etc), which is a decent amount of content, though you&apos;d expect more from an RPG.
<br>Graphics: It is a good looking game, neither brilliant nor bad. It holds up pretty well, in spite of some very repeated characters models and animations. Also the facial animations are not that good though they are good enough. The regions are very diverse and interesting, though they are somewhat small and in between a lot of loading screens.
<br>Music and Sound: The music in this game is outstanding. It really transports you into the fantasy land that is Albion and really helps give character to all of the diferent regions, each with its own music. It truly is superb. In terms of sound, the voice acting is pretty good overall, sometimes a bit cheesy though it really fits with the tone of the game; the enviromental and creature sounds are fine.
<br>Overall I think Fable: The Lost Chapters is a fantastic game. The charm and character that this game has is so unique and every time I started it I felt like I was transported into another world. Maybe the individual pillars that make this game are not that outstanding, but when put together into a whole package, Fable: The Lost Chapters makes for a memorable and super enjoyable ride.
<br>Overall Score: 9.0</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=7132965">Expand</a></span>

<br>My first encounter with Fable was on the Xbox, before lost chapters was released. Since then I have absolutely fallen in love with Lost Chapters. This is a game that I keep going back to and I have easily racked up 500+ hours in 8 years.
<br>
<br>I love the fantasy play style with bows and swords being the main weapon of choice. This is definitely a game for anyone who is a huge fantasy geek! The three hero disciplines still give way to a huge variety of play through options if you have the patience to achieve what you set out to do. There are a lot of different weapons to play through with as a purist, or you can mix weapons with magic, or just go for pure Will power.
<br>
<br>The world layout was perfect for what was needed, neither over, nor under doing it. Although there were only a few voice actors, the accents from all over Great Britain were very amusing and sometimes charming.
<br>
<br>On the downside, there was a lot missing from Fable:TLC as well. Originally, the dog was supposed to feature in the first title, not the second. This was a last minute removal by Lion Head. There were also promises of plants growing in real time, seasons changing, children and families however, a lot of this was pushed into the second title. Being an old game, there are a few bugs. Tattoos will occasionally turn to green leaves on the skin and the eyes of the hero will turn a lime green giving a fairly eerie look. There are also numerous exploits, such as the Rose Cottage silver key glitch and the ransom victim age glitch. But these just add to the charm of the game, and if they were to be fixed, it would be turned into something new and strange.
<br>
<br>Overall, I love this game and I imagine I will still put in a few more playthrough&apos;s before uninstalling. It is a game I will always go back to.

The gameplay is solid, the interface is very good and comfortable. The quests are fun and I also LOVE the good/bad hero system here. The only thing I dislike is the looks of not only the hero, but also other characters.</span>

<br>
<br>I, like everyone else at the time, bought the hype during an era when every big-name AAA game to come out some how pushed the technology or introduced something we hadn&apos;t seen before. I, like everyone else at the time, felt bitter and betrayed by just what Fable turned out to be, but soon fell in love with what fable *was* - one of the few games to actual capture the magic of what a mythical story and folklore is.
<br>
<br>Walking an incredibly fine line between silly, serious, dark and light-hearted, Fable carried it&apos;s own weight without it&apos;s loon of a creator barking promises non-stop and became a game that&apos;s still discussed positively a decade later. It didn&apos;t pretend to be anything it wasn&apos;t and it delivered a compelling story with solid controls and a gripping amount of replayability in the ways you could play it. Over the years I&apos;ve created and played the game from start to finish using a variety of characters, both evil and good or a mix of both, much to my delight. The Lost Chapters thankfully ditched the limits of the Xbox console (64mb of ram at 200hz, unthinkable these days.) and provided gamers with a more complete version of Fable, one that I would argue rivals if not exceeds Fable 2, an xbox 360 game.
<br>
<br>When Lost Chapters came out, The xbox was already on it&apos;s way out (The 360 had already been announced in May) and things like Kotor, Morrowind, Neverwinter Nights, and even games like World of Warcraft, Guild Wars and Everquest, proved to be bigger, better games for the same money Microsoft was asking, leading to reviews citing it as lacking depth or linear.
<br>
<br>Ten years later, history would show Fable 1 and The Lost Chapters as being the best of the Fable franchise, with 2 (360 exclusive) and 3 (online-only) unplayable and unable to be purchased anywhere while Fable 1 &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; goes on to be a top seller on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=6561018">Expand</a></span>

<br>Fable is an old and arguably dated game to be playing currently, but even the old graphics, details and sound effects aren&apos;t enough to prevent me from playing what I consider may well be the best RPG of all time.
<br>
<br>It seems clear that the most prominent feature of the game is it&apos;s morality system; good or evil. Every time you perform a good or evil act, your morality will change. This could span from simply damaging someones property to harming or murdering an innocent. I feel Fable may be what defined morality systems from this point forward, and it&apos;s integrity and structure works fantastically. Being an old game, it&apos;s not quite as deep as you may feel it should be, but it certainly does it&apos;s job well.
<br>
<br>The story itself is pretty decent; your hometown get&apos;s raided by bandits, and you are forced to retreat to the Heroes Guild, where you train and hone your skills to become strong enough to seek revenge on those that attacked your family. The story unravels from there, as you travel to different regions (small as they are), and purchase different items, clothing and weapons to aid in your quest. The game is also full of side quests and extra challenges, along with extra &quot;legendary&quot; weapons, which you will find around about the final quarter of the game. There are demon doors, (cryptic challenges that add a little extra depth to the game), an expansive treasure hunt, various competitions, collectibles, and a wide experience system, full of different skills and spells for you to improve and learn.
<br>
<br>The game, overall, covers quite a lot of time (about 10ish hours for the story, excluding the extra collectibles, side missions and contests), and has you making different decisions along the way to shape your destiny.
<br>
<br>Villagers and other friendly NPC&apos;s will react to your current appearance and nature, whether you look attractive and kindhearted, or hideous and dark. Interaction with NPC&apos;s via expressions allows you to potentially marry, to apologise, or to simply antagonise those around you.
<br>
<br>Overall, it is a very solid game, and some negative features (graphics, small areas, lots of loading screens, weird lip syncing, etc.) must be forgiven in place of it being so old and unique (at least, at the time). This is a must for those that can get over all these negative features, and is what I may well consider one of the best games of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4070399">Expand</a></span>

When I played it,I never heard of its hype or anything like that. Of course now I do,and game failed on that aspect,but it&apos;s still a very good RPG game. The story maybe little bit too simple,but it left me with such a warm feeling that i will never be able forget. The combat system is pretty simple,but it&apos;s easy to learn and fun to use. It&apos;s not very balanced. Some things are better than the others. There&apos;s a character progression your character changes as it ages.  When you increase specific stats, your character appearance changes as well. There&apos;s good variety of special weapons,than are unique on their own right. Also there&apos;s karma system,which changes on how you preform on your side quests or story missions, if characters goes towards good side it gets a halo,if it goes towards the dark side it gets horns. Also you get tittles which are based on your actions,you can chose variety of them.  You can marry (sort of) and there&apos;s a lot of other side content which is really important. Overall this game is not really that long,it probably took me a little bit over 35 hours to 100% ,but the whole package is amazing. Story is simple but interesting and easy to follow,combat is simplistic but there&apos;s a lot of skills and decent variety of unique weapons. Side content is amazing,there&apos;s a lot of extra stuff to do. There&apos;s a lot of choices that you can make. Overall it&apos;s one my favorite games of all time, I&apos;m probably overlooking a lot of issues that this game has,but the memories from childhood were so amazing,that I just can&apos;t get it out of my head. I replayed it in my later years,and it still holds up quite nicely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4154546">Expand</a></span>

<br>You hear about them when you&apos;re training, and you know they would destroy you if you fought, but you&apos;re on the same side (in a manner of speaking), and they keep reinforcing that you&apos;ll do great things (good or bad). In terms of RPG - it&apos;s not the most in-depth RPG because for the most part, the story is linear- but it is one hell of an adventure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=5957649">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Though I disliked and found it very frustrating that you could not save when doing a quest and should you fail, you have to start all the way from the beginning. That almost made me rage quit when trying to escort some spy and there was a massive amount of guards and no matter how much I tried he kept being killed as he dies in a few hits. So decided it was not worth the frustration to bother with that quest anymore.
<br>
<br>The game is rather linear and the world seems quite small. Hirelings are rather useless with bad AI.
<br>
<br>Despite the things I disliked I found the game fun and it kept me playing and wanting to see what is going to happen next.
<br>
<br>I recommend this game if you like RPG&apos;s and a interesting story and don&apos;t mind that it&apos;s linear.
<br>It&apos;s a bit too short for my liking. I completed the game in 30hours and I did not rush and did all side quests but 1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fable-the-lost-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4613930">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Awesome game! First time I play this in 2005 and even in 2017 I play it time to time. Great story, very detailed world, a lot of weapon, armor and spell. Someone say that this game for children&apos;s, but it is a feature of Lionhead Studios games. This game is about simple and idyllic world where you must make your decisions. Great game!
<br>P.S. Sorry for my English.</span>
