The graphics are incredible (more realistic than oblivion and it runs smoother too), the combat actually feels like combat unlike other MMOs. For me the atmosphere of the game is amazing. A lot of people are complaining about poor pvp &quot;imbalance&quot;. I think this is actually a good thing and greatly enhances the atmosphere and realism of the game. It would be a great shame if they changed it. More skill is required this way, hiding in thickets of trees while a group of level 80s rides past etc - I really love the brutality of the pvp in this game - it just makes it feel so much more real and exciting than in other MMOs. As for the instancing, people are already complaining about fps - if it wasn&apos;t so heavily instanced, for a lot of people it would be unplayable. Maybe in a few years when people have better computers, they&apos;ll change this.... One of my favourite things about this game is the extent to which you can customize your character&apos;s appearance and I also love the classes (I have 5 characters all with different classes and I haven&apos;t found any big problem with class imbalance ( actually I love all the classes I have played -they all have clear advantages and disadvantages) I do agree that the game is just the skeleton of what it will become - but even in its current form, it is still by far the most fun MMO I have played which is why I won&apos;t be canceling my account. It seems people either love or hate this game but for me, it definitely gets a big thumbs up!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=415012">Expand</a></span>

Graphics: I&apos;m guessing they&apos;d be nice if they worked correctly. If you change your draw distance to max the game looks quite nice, the problems some in many of the smaller zones. Specifically there are repeatable mansion quests that are bland, have some dynamic lighting effect coupled with the engine rendering things behind 2 walls and the celling and suddenly the FPS takes a nose dive, mobs aren&apos;t rendered loot doesn&apos;t show when it drops. This happens far too often. especially when you try to complete the final quest to leave the newbie zone. The &apos;brutal&apos; fatalities 80% of the time clip through each other so instead of hacking a guys limbs off with my 2handed axe I beat his limbs off with my elbows. Failed mechanics: The cutscene-esque view for talking to quest npcs is hysterical on a pvp server. You can easily get stuck in a conversation and slaughtered... by someone 50 levels below you. Combat: The mechanics are clunky and require real time micro managing of your timing. Combos trigger by pressing the skill button and playing simon says, the combo itself only activates if the final blow of the simon says time lands thus pvp combat revolves around closing to melee range for that final hit. Caster classes are gettign better but still a joke. Proper use of the active blocking system (consume stam for reduced melee damage) defense system (keycommands to redirect your &apos;defense&apos; to specific regions of incoming attacks depend on system performance. Which is already substandard. Large class imbalances are in place with nothing being addressed at the current time to resolve that, specific abilities are getting brought to reasonable levels but fundamental flaws in gear, class design are ignored. Itemization: Worse than wow&apos;s at the end of beta. Until recently the only effect armor had was on health/stam/mana pools and damage immunities, naked was the same as full plate except for a 4% reduction in slashing damage. Even with the fixes introduced many stats have no effect (con which should be +stam +stam regen and +health only gives a randomly truncated additional hp ranging from 3.5 to 4.1 per point of con). Stats are also itemized to be worth roughly 1/20th of stam/health/mana. Raiding: Tier 1 raiding content has been completed by some guidls, tier 2 is 3-4 months away according to unconfirmed GM reports. Raid lockouts are 1 week + many bugs reported with them. Due to the nature of combat (melee heavy, heavy system requirements and a number of other issues) a raid focus of this game is bewildering. PVP: Several pvp minigames exist in theory, nobody plays them. PVP servers are basically gank fests, luckily stealth/stealth detection mechanic is HEAVILY biased to stealth. Player made battle formations are a joke, yes you cannot run through a player but there are no choke points to take advantage of a wall of well geared tanks blocking access to your squishy ranged dps (most of your dps will be melee and clustered around your tank). You cannot command NPCs as proudly stated in the synopsis. Crafting: Gathering does work and isn&apos;t too bad just waste a few hours and get all you need, some idiotic mechanics exist but they&apos;re for pretty much a one time thing and not too bad. Crafting: Jewel crafting sort of works now, very complex and obtuse system made harder by terrible crafting control panel. Weaponsmithing not too bad, material requirements for higher tier weapons are beyond stupid. Armorcrafting is terrible requiring vast amounts of resources and time. Architecture is UNBELIEVABLY expensive with plays for a single wall segment costing the same as your inner keep (1.25g) inner wall = 15+ segments, outer wall is MUCH larger. Alchemy is broken, pots are cheap enough up to level 70 that its more expensive making your own. But you can&apos;t level alchemy up to 70 the drops needed for it are non existent. PVP endgame: The press releases spoke about player made cities and massive battles between guilds over battlekeeps. Player cities exist and so do battle keeps. The npcs that spawn to attack your city aren&apos;t implemented nor is there any space on the map for them to exist (unless they build a city over resource nodes). Battlekeep mechanics are such you can&apos;t attack another battlekeep if you already have one. Additional PVP changes are including an outlaw status (repeated griefing ie killing lowbies or camping one person) will ultimately result in players looting money/equipment from your corpse. With the aforementioned lack of itemization this isn&apos;t a consequence but an annoyance. _________ TL;DR: Interesting premise and initial design concept could make for an interesting MMO. Execution of concept poor. Game engine a joke (check out your error files, you&apos;ll have several hundred pages of mesh errors and bone errors from model rendering). Graphics memory leaks, multiple clipping bugs, poor model design, bad model animation. Combat system is simply a new skin on what 90% of other mmos do &apos;press these 6 buttons unless I need to press these 9 buttons&apos;. Content: bugged quests, confusing quest options, long clunky initial leveling process and scripted quest chains that adds &apos;atmosphere&apos; which makes leveling from 1-20 longer than 20-50 that cannot be skipped. Instance quests that don&apos;t work (which is noticeable due to an amazing shortage of instances). Support: Petitions automatically time out after 4 hours of &apos;inactivity&apos;. You have to use a whisper command to bring up a dialogue box, scroll to the bottom of the box and click a hyperlink to maintain activity. Inactive petitions are assumed to have been resolved! Petitions that are answered when you are offline are also considered resolved! Emails to support go unanswered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=414170">Expand</a></span>

No class balance. Core features broken or not implemented. ZERO customer support, some people have had bugs that caused them to be unable to even log in to their characters for days at a time. Voice acting ends after the tutorial island. Quests are uninspired, not difficult, and never make you think... especially when the game holds your hand for the entire process. Every class has skills, abilities, and feats that are broken, buggy, or just don&apos;t work at all. Animations on npcs rarely work. Tradeskills are tedious and completely unrewarding. Enemies can evade, parry, or block your attacks even if their back is turned, or they are stunned, or they are knocked on their back. Fights are either incredibly easy or insanely hard, there is no middle ground. Loot is an absolute joke, every piece of armor of any given type generally looks exactly the same from levels 1 to 80. Rare equipment is often worse than common equipment of several levels lower. Stats do nothing at all. Female characters attack 20% slower than males and do less damage. Combo attacks are treated as a single attack, if your seven attack combo is interrupted on the 7th attack, all damage caused by the preceding attacks is negated and the target is healed as if it was never struck. PVP is so unbalanced that some classes are unable to kill other classes even if one of the people are AFK. Running is based on a percentage of your stamina, yet stamina potions restore a fixed amount of stamina the result is that classes with low stamina can actually out run any other class... fighting a mage class in pvp? they&apos;ll just run away until your stamina bar is empty, making you unable to execute a combo, and then nuke you with their full mana bar. This game is so unfinished that anyone who is actually paying a subscription fee after the first 30 days is going to be paying Funcom to beta test their game for them. Do yourself a favor, wait six months or a year or you&apos;ll be wasting your time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=414409">Expand</a></span>

I applaud the mature content, active combat, and beautiful graphics (provided you have the hardware). But points have to be taken away for pretty much everything else. Right now, the only thing to do in the game is grind out quests because almost nothing else works as it should. There are no social activities to speak of - no real reason to interact with other people unless you&apos;re sharing a quest. I started on a PvE server but switched to PvP due to the boredom. And now, I&apos;m getting bored of that as well, as PvP essentially means &quot;ganking&quot; in this game. And as much as they claim to be focusing on PvP rewards and punishments, nothing exists as of yet. I would suggest buying the game and using the first 30 days free to play through the rather enjoyable Tortage Island (levels 1-20) with a few characters. Then cancel your account, because after that, the bad outweighs the good (for now).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=415407">Expand</a></span>

But a lot has changed, and at the moment this game is really worth, playing it. Best Graphics in the genre, different game play (fights) and a community, which, at least on PVE-Servers, will help any newcomers. Whoever&#xB4;s still writing nonsense about bugs, crashes, no stories, etc. can certainly not have played this game for at least 7 months. There&#xB4;s a bit to critisise because of the recent merge of PVP-/RP-Servers since there aren&apos;t many PVP-players anymore. But that&#xB4;s not the problem of Funcom, thats a problem which has it&#xB4;s origin in some stupid gankers. So if you&#xB4;re PVP all the way, make it a 7, the PVE-Fans and even RP-Fans should definitely give it a (second) chance. And hey, I&#xB4;m NOT from Funcom, and I&#xB4;m certainly no &quot;Fanboy&quot; but I can see a good game, when I play it. And Age of Conan, at it&#xB4;s actual state, is definitely one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=745296">Expand</a></span>

The beginning island is finished and is fun to play, but the rest of the game is not. PVP, Siege, quests and crafting, something you expect from an MMO, is virtually non-existent. Even though Siege is listed as being in the game - it&apos;s not. Funcom&apos;s idea of class balancing is to nerf classes and then conveniently forget to put it in their patch notes. After level 35, the game becomes extremely boring and repetitive. There is a complete lack of content, direction and story line after level 35 and to level beyond that, you will spend the majority of your time doing the same 3 level scaling quests. With every patch, performance gets worse along with game play. Simply put, Funcom, even though it has experience with MMO&apos;s, (Anarchy Online), has no idea what it&apos;s doing with this game. I was a huge fan at first, but after you begin to level, along with the bugs and nerfs, you realize just how much is missing from the game. Funcom released a buggy, machine hog lacking content, direction and story line. The mature themes disappear after level 20 or so, so again - Funcom falls short on their promises. If you spend your $50.00 on this game, you&apos;ll get something that&apos;s fun to play for about a week. After that, you&apos;ll be as angry and frustrated as 90% of the players are. The game forums are no longer an indicator of player satisfaction as each unhappy post or suggestion is merrily deleted by Funcom&apos;s &quot;new&quot; moderators. That&apos;s the game in a nutshell and from someone who played it to 80. With no end game content, no siege, there is nothing to do after reaching 80.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=415229">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Second argument is the story. The 4 main classes, Mage, Rogue, Healer, and Tank, has their own story. Also the setting is appealing. The Hyborian Age is like a dark, decadent, twisted and corrupt version of Euro-Asian history. Mix a bit of the Roman Empire, Mongolian culture and Babylonian mysticism with &apos;30s-era myths of undiscovered Africa.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=2559633">Expand</a></span>

If you like it rough, bloody, real, sexy and combo system that puts ypu into the fight like no other MMO. THis is the MMO which takes a bit of skill to play. Some of the reviews here are old as hell and do not reflect the game as it istands today. The game has been massively over hauled. Population ios going up and up due to the recent massive changes to make the combat more skill based by making CC combos also. This making the combat more fluid and let crowd control going on. I cannot think of any other MMO that makes you feel combat like AoC and on top of that. The graphic are hands down the best in the genre. No other MMO comes close though its recommended to have at least 3-4gb of ram. I don&apos;t want to spend all day wrioting reviews but it makes me sick to see all the negative reviews here from people  from years ago who have helped to keep this ORIGINAL MMO down. Nothing offers what AoC offers. In a sea of boring MMO&apos;s this MMO has the most imortant element in spades, and that is Gameplay. My Official Score is 9 but I am giving it a 10 on the board! If you are sitting on the fence go and buy RISE OF THE GODSLAYER and enjoy this game. No one should miss playing through to level 80 on  at least one class of the 12 AoC offers. They are all uniue and far superiour to the hollow versions to get in cheap games like WoW and Rift. Whats on offer? Necro Mancers with 8 pets! .. Demonologists with demon slaves... Assassins with duel daggers, Rangers, Barbarians, Bear Shaman (Twi hander hammer Priest), Tempest of Set, Priest of Mitra, Heral of Xotli, Dark Templars, Guardians and Conqeurors.  When you reach the level cap in AoC you will find plenty to do also, and that also goes for solo content. There are T1 T2 T3 T4 dungeons but you can also do hard Mode Khitain dungeons for Epic loot (Best Epic Loot in the game) or you can solo grond for a faction Set. There are 5 PvP arenas, and servers offer full world PvP or PvE servers. I think I have covered most things. Simply the best MMO in MMO history bar none!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=1623675">Expand</a></span>

<br>if you are in hard-core pvp, or a simply magnificent game, this is for you, if you like boring games go somewhere else.
<br>everything is nearly perfectly balanced, that it be the jumping height of a character or the use of each character in a succesful pvp team</span>

Everything is instanced, it feels like a console game, with fake &quot;walls&quot; where you cannot go. Not a nice, open world. Start a new character and you get to go through exactly the same yawnfest again.

My score of 4 may seem demoralizing but it&apos;s my personal belief and is not necessarily a view shared with all other players. I will explain my MMO background, what I like to see in MMO&apos;s and why, over-all the pro&apos;s couldn&apos;t outweigh the cons. First of all, AoC features amazing graphics and beautiful landscaping. These features make for great screenshots (definately useable as desktop backgrounds!) and an overall very immersive experience, for a while. I&apos;m a fan of graphics, but I&apos;d say there is a greater appeal to more casual-MMO gamers than to a self proclaimed veteran such as myself. The graphics are quite system intensive and to be honest, I really can&apos;t afford an extra $800 worth of system content to be able to pump the graphical settings higher for gameplay (though I can manage to turn them up for a screen shot if necessary). The combat system is very original. This is a pro to many, to me it&apos;s... okay. I don&apos;t mean to be negative towards unique ideas because I think they are very progressive in the evolution of games. I want people to know that the combat system is something that needs to be experienced, but generally speaking it wasn&apos;t for me. I felt like the defense stacking and directional combat/combo system made me react in different ways based on my opponents defenses, but otherwise speaking I generally was fighting the same way regardless of many other factors (this seems to be a problem in many MMOs recently. Each fight comes down to similar mechanics and not to call-and-response, think-on-your-feet ones. As a little background knowledge, Im a big fan of fast-twich, do-this-move-now-or-you-won&apos;t-have-a-chance-later type gameplay (think... spell interruption in WoW or war-spell dodging in Asheron&apos;s Call, or Missile Repelling in L2, etc etc.) I felt that I was focusing more on my melee offense in conan than I was on tactical defense (the defensive utilities available are not useful in my opinion. Double tapping to dodge still gets a hit landed on you.) I have not tried magic classes, so I will not comment or adjust my score positively or negatively based on that factor. Crafting is a big part of the game, I like the way crafting works, the instanced world and the extent of how immersive your creations can be. It&apos;s a positive for crafting happy people. As I recall SWG tried to make it so that the game didn&apos;t have to play combat oriented all the time. People could specialize in non-combat careers like dancing and could enjoy social aspects of the game. I feel the crafting here is... faster to lvl not entirely a gameplay experience all it&apos;s own but it definately fun while you do it (remember that you need to lvl a bit before you can jump into it though!) The story is captivating, but I must be honest that I never got into conan before and so none of the names and most of the world doesn&apos;t relate to any seeded memories. It&apos;s cool anyway but a story can be depleted and eventually will run out leaving me with gameplay to carry me. Overall if the game weren&apos;t an MMO it&apos;d get a much higher score, but I feel I must grade it based on one of the most key factors of MMO gameplay. and that&apos;s it&apos;s Lasting Appeal. I can&apos;t see myself playing this game much more than a couple of months. AC, L2, SWG and WoW had me playing for over 6 months, AC and WoW for over 2 years each! The bar keeps getting raised higher and higher and AoC has definately raised the bar for elements of MMOs but sadly, not for lasting appeal in my opinion. If you have money to spare, go try it out. Plenty of people swear by it and needed a new MMO experience after WoW burn-out syndrome. The MMO market is becoming more competative and I&apos;m glad I bought the game to support that market evolution, but I won&apos;t expect to be a part of this game when the release of other MMOs such as Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning, The Chronicles of Spellbourne or Pheonix Dynasty Online are released. - Paul Forte.

I along with many bought into the hype and paid $80 for the collectors addition What a complete ripoff!!! The game is drab and boring with nothing to hook you into more hours. Trust me I tried many times to get into the game and just found nothing fun about it. In fact it made me want back in WOW more than I ever imaginged. This game claimed to be the WOW killer? Haaa! There is no and I mean no comparison to the type of game warcraft is. You can say what you want but if you have played both games you can not argue AOC against WOW because there is no comparison. I only gave a four rating because of good graphics but everything else is a sore dissapointment. I even quit Wow to get into this and was left wanting so bad I tucked tail back and learned how much AOC made me apreciate a good game. The hype was a lie!! The first thing I noticed was that you have to instance into the Inn?!? What a burn. everywhere you turn is a load page and the same boring brown atmosphere. just no damn fun no matter where you turn in this game. The combat? Please just play a console if you want to experience this great combat. You could hook up a hand held controler and it would feel more like god of War than an mmor Just another rip off guild wars that has no pizazz and no style with crappy boring features that will turn you off in a week. Go ahead and pay fifty bucks and take the one week challange. All in all aside from very nice graphics which are extremely underused in making this game atractive AOC is dump for your money. I can tell you as a long time gamer you will not like this game after a short time. Please dont think I am a blizz boy because I am not. I simply bought into the hype and left very ripped off beleive me I tried to go with it there is just nothing there. If you like the game and dont agree with me more power to you I just can not see anything that would keep you interested.

The early portions of this game are fairly polished, with plenty to do; and dungeons that work as they should, but as you progress; and as you advance your character it becomes clear that this game was clearly not what it was hyped up to be by the developers. Those looking for a cut above the average MMO will be sorely disappointed, as this title fails to do anything different from the regular mold; aside from the combat system. But I will give you more information on that later. Let us start with the graphics, which manages to be the most worthwhile, and most detrimental aspect of this title. To put it bluntly, the graphics themselves are amazing, Whether you&apos;re traveling through the breath taking conall&apos;s valley, or fighting the horrific aberrations of the Field of the Dead, you will be pleased with the visuals. Of course, with these visuals come a very steep system requirement, and even though you may find yourself meeting you exceeding the supposed &quot;recommended&quot; system specs, you may have performance issues with the game. What makes this an even larger problem is that lowering your graphics setting to increase performance has the OPPOSITE effect for no adequately explained reason. The gameplay, as far as Player Vs. Environment is concerned is passable. The combination system works reasonably well; and is a breath of fresh air from the usual MMO fare. But again, this has a huge downside: I of course speak about the PVP ramifications of such a convoluted combat system. Novices and &quot;newbies&quot; alike will have a difficult time managing the excess of hotkeys you must use to be successful in combat; should you choose one of the 5 melee classes. In addition to three manual directional attacks (FIVE at level 40), you must manage an excess of activated abilities, double tap abilities, and in the cases of some classes; both a mana and stamina pool as well as managing shields and the like. Diving deeper into the gameplay subject, those looking for a long lasting MMO experience should look elsewhere at this time, as once you get to around level 50-60; the content dies down almost fully. There are no instanced dungeons to be done, quests are few and far between, and the few quests that you may manage to find are uninspired at best. Those choosing to push into level 80 will find that nobody participates in Mini Game PVP, nobody participates in siege PVP and even the &apos;contested border kingdoms&apos; lie a muddied ghost town. Facts are facts in the end, and while some may try to defend these current imperfections as typical for the genre, I will state that I have played quite a few of these games in my time; and I have never run out of things to do this quickly. When one combines the patches that seem to introduce more bugs than they fix, sieges that not only have no incentive, but are broken; and a lack of a PVP system this game is only good for about a month of semi casual play. Is 50$ worth a month of game time? That&apos;s question you will have to ask yourself; but as this game is now - I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone.

I leveled a character up to the maximum level and played around with a raiding guild for a while, but ultimately I stopped playing because it was just too similar to World of Warcraft which had a lot more content at the time. It was still well made, and by now it probably has a lot more content. I&apos;d recommend it for anyone who&apos;s interested in trying out an MMO.</span>

Secondly i never believe funcom will fix this game at all. cheers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=423059">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve never seen anything quite like the horrid display of insult that this &quot;game&quot; gives the genre of mmo&apos;s and somehow still manages to stay alive. What were you assholes that still play this playing before now? Super Mario Brothers? This game is TERRIBLE....and I say that with no qualms....it is absolutely....TERRIBLE....don&apos;t believe me? Try it, new players. I only ask that you think about this short, simple, completely biased review about a game that never should have been, when you post about how much of an absolute epic fail the game is. I could have made a better game in visual basic.

I could write more on that, but feel that much has been covered already. I uninstalled, and will not be re-subscribing. Maybe next year I will check it out again. I went and bought (brace yourself) World of Warcraft. Now as a vet of Everquest, Ultima Online, and Vanguard, I was expecting what most people say about WOW.... a childish, kiddie, &quot;noob&quot; environment, and for the most part they are right, but the skilled expert players are there however, you just have to find them. I was fortunate enough to find an excellent guild (after many frustrating random groups with un-skilled players) and now I am having a BLAST!! More fun than I ever had in EQ or Vanguard. As far as people saying WOW is &quot;too easy&quot; well... I can say from experience that Conan is not any &quot;harder&quot; than WOW. World of Warcraft is indeed easy if you have a high-level character walk you through the instances, but if you don&apos;t &quot;cheat&quot; and actually run through the dungeons at their intended levels , for example: running the DEADMINES with a level 14-15 group (Yes... it&apos;s possible) You will find that there is plenty of challenge in it. Again, maybe I will try CONAN again sometime next year after they fix things, but for now, I will enjoy my new-found-friend... World Of Warcraft!!!!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=414702">Expand</a></span>

The combo system was an amazing concept however they did NOT deliver on it. The combo system isn&apos;t as much a combo system, but a self pressed auto attack. For a combo system to be effective it needs to require some reaction time...sadly AoC&apos;s combat system requires none. Honestly though even a mess up on the combo system can be overlooked assuming the other aspects of PvP are good. This is just not the case with AoC. I can&apos;t begin to understand why the game developers decided that moving around in PvP was something to not focus on. Anyone who is serious when it comes to PvP can tell you that movement, and positioning requires more involvement from the player which in turn makes the PvP more in depth. Any PvP that requires you to stand still to be at all effective is sad. Yes you can move in AoC, but it is laughable at best. So if you&apos;re looking for no-skill click fest when it comes to PvP combat AoC is pretty promising. Now what about the other aspects of the game? Well for starters the graphics are absolutely amazing in some areas while terribly bland in others. For example the cities are amazing in design and in looks. but some of the outside areas are better suited for 2D Models. Now the world PvP is a gank fest on a PvP server which is something I&apos;ve always found exciting. However whoever thought of the graveyard idea had to be an idiot. Take a PvP combat system that requires no skill and have everyone spawn at a few choice graveyards placed in an area and you have a nubfest. People like me can grief a person forcing them to exit the game and come back another time. When you die you can choose different graveyards assuming you&apos;ve explored an area. Seeing as how I grief most people when they&apos;re stuck loading into the zone they really aren&apos;t given a choice as to which graveyard to choose. Upon resurrecting they have half life and can only resurrect in one place... Yeh that system cant be abused at all... Anyways thats my perspective on just the PvP aspect. Sadly this game did not deliver and I was desperately hoping for it be a great game. Sorry to those who enjoy this game but I cant go along with the hype.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=413035">Expand</a></span>

Stats weren&apos;t even enabled when the game was released, and we&apos;re still not sure if they&apos;re actually working or not. Quests basically stop around 45-50, depending on how hardcore you are about questing. Combat mechanics are terrible. They seem neat at first, but once you&apos;ve used them for 40+ levels and start engaging in some PvP, you realize how awful they are. They&apos;re clunky, slow and unpolished. In your first 40 levels or so, you&apos;ll run into a half dozen bugged quests. Oh, and the entire world is divided into a bunch of tiny zones, and each zone has numerous instances of itself...way to completely ruin the whole massive, immersive world thing about MMOs. The first 20 levels of this game will have you believing that it&apos;s the best MMO ever release. But once you&apos;ve put in the time to get later into the game, you&apos;ll realize what a letdown this game really is. The best way to describe AoC is to say that it feels like a bug-riddled, incomplete single player game that had multiplayer thrown in at the last second.

My guess is people felt ripped off about the patches and downtime during EA and game it a 0. So far I think it&apos;s a great game.</span>

Unfortunately i was pretty let down upon release. I do not like the combat system at all. Although it is different and i give them credit for trying something new, jousting and seeing who can put out more white damage(coming from a melee perspective) is just not my idea of fun in pvp. Travel is HORRID. Quests. I&apos;m not a big quest fan. If you don&apos;t like questing this game will probably do you in. If you do like questing, then the first 40 levels should be easy sailing. Ease of use/playability - I think this game is fairly demanding on resources and somewhere in the middle as far as compatibility with all rigs. Many users have configurations it just doesn&apos;t like or work well with. It most likely will require tweaking and adjustments on the part of the user to run good fps. Graphics - I give it pretty good marks on graphics. I&apos;m more a fan of these type of graphics than WoW style graphics. I think they did a good job on the looks. Stats don&apos;t work, class abilities are bugged, class imbalance is pretty bad(somewhat expected), and hiding/perception seem broken. You can&apos;t be attacked by melee in the water. Just a huge list of odd problems that i don&apos;t have room to go into. In closing i would say the game is unpolished, unfinished, and just didn&apos;t grab me. I&apos;ll be setting my hopes on warhammer and giving that a try when it comes online. I hope my 50 bucks helps pay for some coding and fixes so that the die-hards that stick with AoC get some enjoyment out of it. Unfortunately the cash didn&apos;t buy me much in the way of fun. -Typhoid</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=413608">Expand</a></span>

By and large people are judging this game based on preconceptions from WoW - it is not like it at all. The developers have (thank God) gone into development with a different perspective on how things work; all this criticism may just force developers into creating the infuriating cookie cutter buttons. The loss of an immediate &apos;I WIN&apos; button is alienating a lot of narrow minded people. No doubt there are balancing and it is a technically demanding game, no doubt. But it is an excellent game and one well worth following as time goes on. For me WoW was too childish in community and had repetitive gameplay as well as numerous recent changes such as PvP &apos;welfare epics&apos; and such were spoiling the game. WoW just takes time not skill and has a large 10 year subcriber base. I look forward to how AoC will develop. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=413730">Expand</a></span>

Posatives: Theirs alot of players so it makes the world more fun and active. -- You level fast, it took me 5 days to reach lvl 45. -- The combat is fun and makes every other mmo I&apos;ve played look juvenile and boring. -- Putting Fatalities in a fantasy mmo is genious and extremely entertaining. -- The graphics, especially the water are the best I&apos;ve seen in an mmo. -- Most of the time you don&apos;t notice the instancing. -- All in all I think the game needs improvements but I love it and I cant wait to see what happens next and I would deffinitly recommend it. Around the end of the Tortage story line - lvl 18ish is when the game really started to grab me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=413772">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, there are a few rough edges, but the makers of the game have been fairly diligent in getting out patches and updates, and the improvements in the game are noticable.
<br>I won&apos;t cancel my WoW account just yet, but I&apos;ll definitely spend more time playing AoC in the weeks and months to come. For my two cents this is the best alternative experience to WoW currently on the market.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=72721">Expand</a></span>

This game is still undergoing beta testing and debugging: there are still screenshots of players-PLAYERS, mind you, getting debugging messages to their chat window.. Now, the plus. The first 20 levels are very well done and polished. The graphics are nothing short of incredible at times (There are some spots where it is worth throwing all your graphics options on high, accepting the 2-3 fps rate just to play tourist), and the first time you get a &quot;Fatality Move&quot;, you will be impressed. After the 50th or 60th, it loses its appeal-especially if you are fighting 4 to 5 other mobs at the same time, and are frantically hitting keys trying to keep said mobs from slaughtering you while you&apos;re twisting someones head off.. All in all, I&apos;d wait. It has potential- in 6 months or so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=415568">Expand</a></span>

It is NOT a game where you can sit down with a half hour and have a good time.... There is bloody gore and excitement to be had..at a price... and sometimes a very costly one at that. The graphics are amazing.. sometimes..and incredibly boring at others.. The views are breathtaking.. occasionally.. if it is the right time of the day.. the rest of the time you will struggle to see in the gloominess not unlike you would have to if you were living in that era. Adjust your monitor and be blinded by a blindingly white sky. See the sky in the splendor of its natural hues and struggle to make out the path in front of you. Get lucky and find out where your supposed to go... the rest of the time could be spend in endless travel. Travel 50 miles to deliver this.. then walk back. Get rewarded at lvl 40 w/ the almighty mount.. if you can scavenge 1000&apos;s of pieces of loot and sell it to vendors for pennies on the dollar. On to the good: Happen across another traveler in the vast world of Hyboria and have bashing time cutting through enemy after enemy. Combat is quite satisfying.. IF you can figure out a satisfactory control set up. Final Recommendation: Not for beginners. Good times to be had... also expect some frustrations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=418397">Expand</a></span>

<br>The world is brilliant.  It feels so realistic, that you are actually apart of something big.  It&apos;s violent, rough, sexy.  This game has everything going for it.
<br>
<br>The combat is something totally new and different you have the freedom to swing how fast, combos etc...  Plus you have to use your head a bit more, because sometimes the enemy will block a certain area and you have to use combos to hit him where he isn&apos;t blocking.
<br>
<br>I recommend this game to any old and new MMOer alike.  If your first game was WoW, and your looking for something totally new and refreshing.  Age of Conan is probably that game.  At the same time it gives the hardcore MMO players that have been around since the UO and EQ days something totally new and refreshing with the whole concept that it delivers a new style of game.
<br>
<br>Sure, you need a beefy system to run this game on high, but you can still get away on medium and low.  I have a 8600gts and run this game nicely on med-high settings.
<br>
<br>This game is going to be here for awhile.  It&apos;s fun, it&apos;s fast and it&apos;s the opening of the 3rd generation of MMOs.

The story, music, voice acting and quests have all been top notch up to this point. Climbing a volcano to disrupt a ritual, causing the volcano to erupt was my favorite quest so far. The bad: the UI is really bad. The little info they provide for ui management and skill management is mediocre. I don&apos;t really care about this all that much, since I know tweaks and custom UI&apos;s will almost certainly be introduced in the very near future. The game does require a beat of a pc to run well. If you&apos;ve been waiting to update your older box, this could be the game that makes it worth the investment.

It&apos;s Conan. Combat mechanics are much, much more realistic than other MMOs. Cons: Tutorial levels just aren&apos;t fun (1-20). You end up dreading ever making a new character just because you don&apos;t want to ever go back to Tortage. The combat system isn&apos;t entirely knew, it just requires more time to master (auto attack is split onto direction attack hotkeys). It&apos;s still just hitting hotbar buttons, but it is disguised well and requires your full attention at every moment. It&apos;s just like every other MMO in the fact that it&apos;s a major grindfest. Also, the quest system is the same as every other MMO (collect this, fetch this, kill this, deliver this, etc). Certain things completely kill the immersion: e.g. The Stygian Tempest of Set&apos;s heritage quests revolves around doing tasks for Mitra (rival God), helping Mitra&apos;s priests who constantly bash Stygians, and helping the weak and powerless (Set is merciless). It just makes no sense and would be an easy fix (replace a few quest mobs or change the dialog slightly). Conclusion: Funcom is a master of PR and capitalizes on/generates hype better than most companies, but the game itself isn&apos;t as great as everyone claims. However, if you&apos;re the type of person who only cares about being number 1 on the PvP scoreboard, then you&apos;ll probably love this game. I suggest you play something else and read the Conon stories if you want to be immersed in the world of Conan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=413105">Expand</a></span>

Did I forget to mention that this is one of the best-looking games to come out in recent years? The game has two interesting modes: Night (single-player, more storylline advancing and day (multiplayer, questing). Familiar archetypes, somewhat more granular and none of the WoW cartoonish look. Still some quirks to iron out but the game is backed by Micro$oft so we can expect a huge push to break into the existing WoW market.

Downside is if you order the Collectors Edition you may have problems getting into the game in the first place as they shipped with bad codes. Service support was good on launch day (Friday) but non-existant on Saturday, which is pretty poor for a new title being released on Friday.</span>

You can&apos;t rush it, as there are level requirements to the quests. However, the game does a great job of making you feel important in a struggle that you learn to feel something for. Each class (warrior, priest, scout, and mage) have their own quest roll, which eliminates some of that repetition that we all love in our early days of gaming :) Great work FunCom!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=413184">Expand</a></span>
