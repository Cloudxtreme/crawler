With the multitude of Trendynet server issues only unranked or solo mode is even worth playing. unless you want to put in 40 hours and then have your character suddenly get deleted. Oh and then comes Trendy&apos;s amazing idea of releasing DLC exclusively for ranked play. So even though you bought the game you can&apos;t use the DLC or play in events. Unranked characters can not be used in ranked or vice versa. This game could have been so much better. Especially if Trendy didn&apos;t punish it&apos;s players for playing the game the way they want. Even if the game encourages you to do so. Oh and they openly encourage modding of the game but then have a zero tolerance policy on any sort of cheating or glitching. With your first offense resulting in a no warning permanent ban. That on top of the disconnects, constant lag, unbalanced play and random character deletion. Good luck Trendy, you need it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1982893">Expand</a></span>

Dungeon Defenders has already proven to be not only insanely fun, but also a progressive challenge. with each level, and wave for that matter, becoming more and more difficult, I am sure I will get hundreds of hours of gameplay from this title. Although it does lack more advanced graphic options (namely vertical sync) I love the colors and the general art design. I couldn&apos;t ask more from a veteran development team with a $50 dollar release price, let alone a first title from an indie developer for $15.

<br>
<br>I guess that about sums it up. I&apos;ve played more than 500 hours of DunDef, I know the game mechanics and every single thing in this game. I literally stopped playing the game after couple of updates in March, it literally broke the game for those who have been playing since day 1. So then couple of months back I thought I&apos;d give it 1 more try to see what&apos;s new and what&apos;s remained of the original DunDef. I wasn&apos;t surprised upon seeing the awful lot of DLCs out there and god what not in game.
<br>
<br>Anyways, If you like Tower Defense and games like that, I would still suggest you to buy DunDef, coz it&apos;s a good game avoid the DLCs and you are good! Just literally avoid them, it&apos;ll hamper your experience a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2728331">Expand</a></span>

It is pretty good on iOS devices, but it truly shines on PS3 and 360. Gorgeous Unreal Engine 3 powered graphics, absurdly addictive levelling, and some properly entertaining co-op hack&apos;n slashing all add up to one of my favourite new IP&apos;s of the year. But with it not *really* clicking with the iPad&apos;s buttonless interface, I was almost foaming at the mouth at the prospect of finally being able to play Dungeon Defenders on the go with the planned Playstation Vita port. However, that has now been canned, and I&apos;m absolutely gutted. Seriously, I&apos;m devastated. That&apos;s how much this fabulous little game has me hooked. It isn&apos;t perfect, far from it in fact, but I for one utterly adore it. If Trendy are listening, and if it is viable in any possible way, please, PLEASE bring this wonderful game to Vita. In fact, with it&apos;s dual screens, it&apos;d work equally well - if not better - on Nintendo&apos;s 3DS. Either way, I need the definitive version of Dungeon Defenders in handheld form. Please, someone, anyone, make it so!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2855532">Expand</a></span>

Items&gt; level, as is the case with many games (a level 74 person with great items will do more dmg than a level 84 person with mediocre items).  The main problem with the game is the exp curve.  At around 70-75 it grows by an insane amount, in which case the game becomes a grindfest.  The ultimate way to level is to find a 90+ person with good equipment and power-level.  After about 76 you&apos;ll find yourself setting up defenses and then going afk.  Warning: leveling and item mods ruin this game, after I stopped using them the game became more enjoyable.  $50 for all of the DLC is a ripoff, I would recommend only buying this game if it&apos;s on sale ($15 for original is not even a good deal).  I bought L4D2 for $5(sale) and it&apos;s much better than this game -_-.

After 20 hours of grinding you get you first char to the level cap and at that point you&apos;ll get bored to that class and you start playing another. The same happens over again. Only then when you have all your chars at level cap and have great gear, the game becomes much fun. Actually only if you have high leveled friends... Well playing with your friends is fun. There&apos;s alot of hard challenges and trying to complete the game with all maps done on insane is hard-ish. Well overall the game has nice candy-graphics, boring grinding, fun end-game and nice multiplayer. It&apos;s cheap, just try it out, it wont cost your wallet too much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2025851">Expand</a></span>

For those looking for a comparison, this game is basically Orcs Must Die! that focuses more on multiplayer. The setup is basically the same as Orcs with the same 3rd person over the shoulder viewpoint and if you liked the setup for Orcs, you&apos;ll like this game. However the leveling aspect can turn a few people off and you really do have to grind for a few level to get very far into the game if you want to play any of the levels on a difficulty higher than normal. I personally enjoyed this game more than Orcs because of the amount of time you can put into your character to make it yours and the fact that you can play with your friends at any time. The only issue I have with the online aspect is that you can&apos;t earn Steam Achievements if you want to either play in a lan party or on a public server. You have to play on Trendy&apos;s special servers, meaning you have to play online, to get any and all of these achievements. And not being able to save mid battle can cause some issues if you dc or have to quit for some reason. Still, this is one of the better games I&apos;ve played in a long time and my personal preference over any other TD game out there and you&apos;d be hard pressed to find a better one, if you like playing with your friends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2077596">Expand</a></span>

I was afraid of buying this game because I wasn&apos;t sure if the combination would work, but it is a fantastic game with easy controls and few technical problems.... I actually can&apos;t even think of a single technical problem I have run into. (i&apos;ve played over 100 hours of this game).
<br>Like I wrote above, if you like RPG and TD games, buy this.</span>

<br>- So giving it 9/10 because of the issues of crashing, but it&apos;s a really good game with loads of fun, for a cheap price, I would recommend it to everyone, have fun! :)</span>

There is a good amount of humour from the developers with some of their items (chicken launcher?), however the game is kept from perfection by bugs and issues from launch which developers are working on, but will only get 9 or 10 when the game is actually bug-free.</span>

You&apos;ll either really like it or dislike it. I personally enjoy the zany artwork. The item textures and meshes can have a ridiculous appearance, but clearly that&apos;s the intent. Combat which is the core of the game can easily be mastered. There is a strategic element, when playing on the harder difficulties. Competitive play is included, there&apos;s a few nuances though. Overall Trendy entertainment will score pretty high with this release. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1811484">Expand</a></span>

I love how there is a lot of flexibility with items, pets &amp; leveling but it is not overly complex or time consuming to manage. Only major down side is it might get a little repetitive after playing all the maps &amp; modes but so far they have been consistently adding more content (some of it free). This game is great for modding or learning game development as all game-play code &amp; source content ship with the PC version. It uses the Unreal Development Kit.<br><br>It was a little buggy when first released but I received excellent customer service when I contacted them.

It&apos;s major downfall - for me, is that it&apos;s feature light. And even if you spend 3 times the games original price on dlc - it will still lead to you playing the same maps over and over with the same limited traps. The loot, and leveling encourages you to grind away at this game - however it get&apos;s repetitive. It&apos;s still a top game that will become better and better as more content is released. I feel a fuller featured sequel could be exactly what this game needs to go from great - to fantastic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2157346">Expand</a></span>

This grind could be fine for someone, until you discover that all good gear is probably hacked even on ranked steam server. All top results for every map is hacked, crazy gear is hacked/duped, cubes is massively duped, mana is hacked. Any 10 year kid&apos;s pc knowledge is enough to make mana infinite, to make insane items, etc. This game could be good if u just isolate yourself from rest of the hacked world, maybe with your friends, and just play from scratch till 70-s. Then the grind part starts, which is very-very VERY boring. You have to waste 2-3 hours to beat survival level to be able to find some mythical gear to be able to beat tavern defense level to be able to level so you can grind new levels to be able to grind...
<br>
<br>Achievements system is fine, it makes at least a little bit point to grind levels and gear, but nothing else.
<br>
<br>Graphics is a mess, cell-shading outlines looks like piece of shi&#x422; (basically looks like LoL, which is also piece of shi&#x422;, but even worse), massive special effects make your head sick, area of effect weapons is just impossible to watch. I just switch my monitor to white and black mode sometimes to play this game. Yeah. Its really, really sucks. If your pet hits with elemental damage, or your weapon is area of effect hit, you just cant see anything sometimes because of this explosions of whatever effect is.
<br>
<br>DLC-s is complete p2w madness. Half of them is absolutely required for beating game on nightmare difficulty (which is locked by the way, you need another DLC set to unlock it).
<br>Eternia shards DLC set costs the most and the most important part of DLC&apos;s. Without it the nightmare mode is locked, the only place you can start grind some nice gear and experience. Absolutely required.
<br>Series EV hero DLC is so overpowered that she can just do levels on insane difficulty from level one. Tower buff is completely overpowered and REQUIRED to any levels on nightmare.
<br>Summoner uses completely separate defense units which is called summon units, and has pretty overpowered defenses too, that also is required later. You CAN_NOT beat almost any levels on nightmare without this two heroes.
<br>Barbarian is one of the top dps heroes in game and he is required for some of the hardest maps in game to take down boss quickly.
<br>Jester is pretty weak compared to ev or summoner, but she still can be pretty op builder and good ranged dps hero. Also move tower ability sometimes helps.
<br>Tavern defense (anniversary pack DLC i believe?) is required for leveling and has insane pet as reward for beating it on a nightmare survival.
<br>EV lab is required for getting massive amount of insane accessories that you... get ready... CAN NOT GET ANYWHERE IN THE GAME EXCEPT ON THIS DLC, surprise! Also, it gives insane ultimate weapons on regular basis, crazy stats armor, lots of trans armor, sometimes even ult++ armor.
<br>New heroes DLC is required because this female hero versions have more movements speed so they are pretty much standard for builder hero.
<br>Talay mining complex DLC gives insane rewards for survival again (pet rock i believe?).
<br>Some Christmas map DLC gives you coal for beating it, which i believe if u have 100 of them (grinded or ... duped again), you can combine them to get the most insane pet in the game (all this pets is hacked if u find any for trade).
<br>I hope you get the point. If you want to really grind this game and spend lots of time on it, this P2W DLC is absolutely required.
<br>
<br>I dont recommend this game for almost everyone. However, if you and your friends desperate to find any co-op game to play, you might try this. Wait for sale and take your chances.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=4284584">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is really good. Its a mix between Diablo &amp; Tower Defence. Lots of loot and level up combined with the awesome and fun gameplay of tower defence. There was some launch issues but they seem to be solved now. Multiplayer is really fun and should be played this way. Single player is also very fun but if you only play SP you miss out on the great fun of MP.</span>

It even reminds me of borderlands a little (co-op, cell-shaded and GUNS GUNS GUNS) The game looks very polished and runs very well on my older  low end laptop.  The controls and mechanics were very intuitive and easy to pick up so there was no real learning curve.  I do have to say i really despise the console port trend of not giving the pc version more graphics control.  resolution and &quot;postprocessing&quot; is all you get.  I think From Dust gave more graphics options.  But it does not matter in the end because It will very likely work beautifully on your system by just adjusting resolution.<br><br>the price is perfect at the 10-13 dollar range and you will definitely get your dollar per hour enjoyment out of this game.  40 dollars for a 4 pack on steam is sweet if you got teenage sons to be your co-op teammates ;-)<br><br>the lack of graphics options would have given this game a 9 or 8 but the fact it runs smooth anyways on my old pc, great price, great value, and does not crash like magica out of the box.  I give it at 10 and a must have for your steam collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1800481">Expand</a></span>

Picked this game ups for $15 on steam on whim that some internet buddies said it was fun. I got a couple of friend playing this now together and is a real blast. Trendy games hit this little gem spot on and I believe its worth more than $15 of my time.</span>

I feel like other reviewers have nitpicked the game for not being what they &quot;wanted&quot; to play compared to what the game actually is (It&apos;s not Diablo, it&apos;s not Defense of the Ancients, It&apos;s not a tower defense game, It&apos;s not an action rpg). It&apos;s a online multiplayer action rpg/tower defense game (basically a big mashup of the bits and pieces they enjoyed). While you can play single player local games you probably won&apos;t be able to make it past the second level on your own because the game is designed to incorporate the strengths of different characters combined in order to overcome their inherent weaknesses. For example you will find that only two of the four classes have the ability to build barriers. The other two classes can only build AOE damage areas. Luckily you are able to switch between your characters between waves in single player mode to make up for this, but it&apos;s still a challenging proposition. Multiplayer though, is where the game shines. And having read many of the negative user reviews I get the feeling that this is the part of the game that was neglected in their play sessions (I often wonder if they even played more then a few campaign levels before giving up, but that&apos;s another story). Multiplayer plays off the strengths and weaknesses of characters to provide an ever escalating challenge. The fact that character creation allows you to assign skill points to either tower attributes (the things you build) or hero attributes (how bad-ass your character is in combat) means that you must focus your character into either being good at doing damage on it&apos;s own, or focus on letting your buildings do all the talking. Because of this I feel the game is appealing to different types of players. For example someone who loves tower defense can play the role of the strategist, while the action rpg fans can build a death dealing hero who runs around at a frantic pace destroying all he/she sees (A personal favorite of mine. It&apos;s quite fun!). All in all I feel the campaign was fun and rewarding to play with my friends, who are also quite fond of the game. And the fact that there are tons of challenge levels and ways for you to alter the game (you can adjust difficulty and there are modes for tower/hero use only, and challenges provide interesting twists on the game that are sometimes quite surprising.) that I have found it to be extremely re-playable. If I could advise someone who thinks this might be a fun game to buy I would tell them an emphatic &quot;YES!&quot;. For the price (it&apos;s cheap) I consider it a must buy, especially if you have a network of friends to play with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1910246">Expand</a></span>

DON&apos;T BUY THIS GAME.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1994064">Expand</a></span>

This game had me hooked. However, I did find the game didn&apos;t give me the level of info I expect out of an RPG, namely the raw numbers behind my hero/tower upgrades. I don&apos;t know how much upgrading my hero damage will do over hero health. I found out through experimentation, which is fine, but it would help if that feature was implemented. Some people complained about connectivity, which I had a minor issue with, but I was having the same issue with Borderlands and TF2. Once I get the kinks out of the new internet, I&apos;ll edit with the updated results. The camera angle/turning was an issue at first for me, but I adjusted a few things and it works great now. The graphics depend on the person. Just take a look at some screenshots to decide if the artstyle is right for you. Me? I liked it! It uses the Unreal engine well. But it&apos;s clearly not for everyone, so look at the screenshots if artstyle is a point for you.<br><br>That said, they do a lot of things right. The four classes are well balanced to different roles. Having the huntress and monk eschew towers altogether in favor of traps and auras (respectively) opens up a different approach to the game, rather than the more straightforward Squire and Apprentice tower setup. The game rewards you for your hero choices, making those ranks in hero attack (or whatever) really show in gameplay. The item level-ups are done well, and pets add another layer of customization, with pets that do various tasks to assist in clearing out the bad guys (healing you/defenses, direct damage, etc). Add on top of that the replay value due to the difficulty levels being MUCH harder (first level: medium enemies have just under 100 hp. on insane, they have upwards of 500+, with corresponding increases in attack (and speed? haven&apos;t checked this). Challenges change up the base game, adding additional value. Also, It&apos;s cheap, 4 person local play, and they&apos;ve already released a free halloween dlc, with a new map, character costumes, weapons, and possibly more.<br><br>To sum it all up, it&apos;s a great game, with a lot to keep you coming back for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1829464">Expand</a></span>

For a $14.99 indie title, DD is one of the most enjoyable game I have played this year until Saint Rows 3 and Arkham City is released. This unique Tower Defense Action RPG title brings the best of the gameplay seen in Orcs Must Die (or similar TD games), and fused it with an amazing RPG overlay with 4 distinctive classes, each with their own towers/trap to mess around with. The mage makes use of the ranged attacks and towers that deal elemental damage, while the warrior has barricades and other more conventional trap for a man-at-arms. The amount of the content is really the eye catcher here; a challenging campaign, bonus missions with specific goals and contraints, a survival mode and a mix-max mode which is out to get you in terms of difficulty. A game best played with a team, but quite enjoyable solo as long as you take the time to level up properly, upgrade your gear, and proceed carefully from there on. For $14.99, you are getting the equivalent of a $60 title. If you like action-rpgs like diablo/torchlight, and TD games like Orc Must Die, this is a must buy! :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1800292">Expand</a></span>

They constantly nerf abilities too.  Or put new content in a paid DLC that you need to just do the old levels because the new patch nerfs all your existing gear/abilities.  So one day you log in, and can actually win a few levels, next day you log in and you can&apos;t beat anything.  Unless you&apos;re a kid with nothing but free time and hundreds (yes, hundreds, not an exaggeration) of hours to waste on this game, I highly recommend that you don&apos;t bother with it.  Sad too, because it really is fun at its core.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2049219">Expand</a></span>

The game looks great and it runs pretty smooth even on lower end computers. Patches have been released pretty quickly so far and some nice DLC was released for free soon after the initial release.<br><br>Unfortunately this game is plagued by one problem after another, I&apos;m not even sure where to begin so I will just list them.<br><br>-Some features, character classes specifically were released locked to be sold in a later DLC. This doesn&apos;t entirely bother me but I do know some people feel strongly about it.<br><br>-Frequent server disconnects.<br><br>-Rollbacks of your characters, sometimes complete loss.<br><br>-Missing pre-order content with no foreseeable fix in the future. Their solution is to hand you the items in game. Should you ever decide to install it on a new computer you&apos;ll need to get an admin to give you your items.<br><br>-The ranked and open servers are full of hacked items and leaderboards.<br><br>-Steam is required for ranked play. If you don&apos;t have Steam, you&apos;ll be dealing with the bulk of the hacked content.<br><br>-Monsters, characters, and multiplayer scaling are all very poorly balanced. The Monk and Apprentice classes are more or less useless throughout the entire game. The Squire is far too powerful early on, and the Huntress is the only one who will be of any use late game.<br><br>-There isn&apos;t much in terms of variety, there will be some neat items to begin with but in the end as with most games there will be the 1-2 main items every characters ends up with. Same situation with the towers themselves, you will only make use of about 2 of them.<br><br>-The camera is one of the worst I&apos;ve ever had to deal with, you either rotate by moving the mouse to the sides of the screen or by holding down shift. I&apos;ve had to switch over to an Xbox 360 controller just to play.<br><br>-The controls are very uncomfortable, especially since there is no auto-fire. You can kiss that nice gaming mouse of yours goodbye, as well as your fingers.<br><br>-Poor support, I was very patient at first while waiting for staff to give me my pre-order items; after a while however I decided to contact them directly through their forums. I told him if he wasn&apos;t busy I was available for an in-game drop. He responded to me shortly after saying he was not available, then continued browsing the forum for several hours.<br><br>I would suggest staying clear of this title until they hire more staff and get these issues worked out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1824147">Expand</a></span>

It integrates in that amazing diablo like items/stat point deal into the game flawlessly. The controls are intuitive and the mechanics are solid. My main problem is the ranked servers have disconnect problems and like in any great game I will hunger for more  content.</span>

A year before its release on Steam, it first caught my eye with the unique art style it has to offer.  Once I knew about this outstanding creation, I kept on trying my best to stay up-to-date with the news until the time to actually play had arrived.  My personal opinion on tower defense games...how could anyone find such interest in them?  What makes this tower defense different is the fact that it also implements role-playing elements and has various heroes to choose from with very diverse &quot;towers&quot; and abilities.  Although some wouldn&apos;t really be considered towers, they make it all the more interesting.  The Apprentice is the only hero so far that would really be considered to have towers.  Apprentices have towers that appear to be slightly floating hands that use the elements to attack in various ways, while Squires use medieval style traps, Huntresses use explosives, and Monks use auras.  They also each have abilities as I mentioned earlier which makes everything about this title even better.  With a decent amount of levels in &quot;Campaign&quot; to choose from, along with &quot;Challenges&quot; which both come with four difficulties ranging from easy to insane, this won&apos;t be something that you&apos;ll play and beat once, in fact, I haven&apos;t even beat it yet.  Without rambling on and on, there&apos;s a store in the Tavern where you can buy both equipment (including pets) and services for your hero and there seems to be constant updates so far which have all been free.  I don&apos;t wanna spoil everything so if you liked my review, buy Dungeon Defenders today!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1875820">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Great Game! Solid mechanics, fun graphics and new twist on the ARPG and Tower Defense Genres.  Sounds are funny and clear, the weapons are fun and look great, making use of past titles to add alot of fun to the game, and the characters are very different and complement each other well.  The variety of each character and level will have you coming back for 100+ hours at least!</span>

The genre seemed strange as well as the visuals so I was a little weary. Within 5 minutes of actually playing the game, I was taken off my feet. True gamers who respect a game for what it is will fall in love with Dungeon Defenders. What I seemed to notice first was the quirky themes throughout the game. The graphics remind me of a mix between Sly cooper and Borderlands, which I thought suited this game perfectly. The boss fights are absolutely incredible and creative, I was blown away with every single one. A lot of people claim that you have to do a lot of grinding to get a high level but I never ran into this problem. As far as weapons go, I pretty sure there are millions of unique possibilities including rare &quot;godly&quot; weapons and armor. The character classes are equally balanced some perfectly compliment each other in online play, which is the best part of the game. So far there are 13 main quest maps and even more challenge maps including &quot;Turkey Hunt&quot; where you kill as many turkeys as you can to move on to the next round. I would even go so far as to say that dollar for dollar, Dungeon Defenders is better than Skyrim (you can quote me on that). If you don&apos;t buy this game, you are missing out on a landmark game in the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2011882">Expand</a></span>

At first you compliment your towers and it&apos;s great and then you find a super powered weapon and your towers are secondary, merely there because you cant be everywhere at once. If you build nothing but walls around the whole map you can win based on that alone. The tower defense portion of the game is extremely lacking. There&apos;s a pure mode where you can play with towers only, most the time you end up with a ninja standing behind your towers killing them and since you can&apos;t fight or build during this mode there&apos;s nothing you can do. I feel this mode was never tested as you cannot repair during a round either and at the higher waves 7000 enemies come out, the wave finishes and you then have to go round and repair and rebuild, the problem is you only get 23 seconds to do so. It seems poorly made compared to defense grid.<br><br>They then had the audacity to nerf the towers. The strength of a tower is 3k dps, the strength of a player is 90k dps.<br>The game is more an arcade action games then a strategy tower defense one, it&apos;s a good concept and i would like to see a bigger company attempt it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1872625">Expand</a></span>

They&apos;re only good about fixing patches half the time, the other half they make it catastrophically worse. Not to mention it relies on spamming a game mode that currently is boring as all **** even stated by the developer that he hates it as well, but they do nothing to fix it. And on that matter, it relies on like, 3 different servers to be up at once in order to play, which brings forth a whole new bundle of unreliability. Avoid this game, until either Trendy learns from their mistakes, or until the game is sold to a different company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2099333">Expand</a></span>

Huntress for ranged, Knight for melee, Apprentice for tower buffs (thingk the sand wall some people make at the beach then try and keep the sea out for as long as possible as the tide comes up) and Monk....well monk is just hard.
<br>Graphics are very high detail and cartoony (if that puts you off, as it clearly did for one reviewer here - then so be it - of to the dull shoot fest of Crysis 2 with you then)
<br>Also the amount of content here for &#xC2;&#xA3;8.99 is AMAZING., Level after level. It just keeps coming.And multiplayer is also an awesome experience (and I normally HATE multiplayer gtames)
<br>I&apos;m a 44 year old games (since the Spectrum) and this goes along with &quot;Elite&quot; and &quot;Lords of MIdnight&quot; as the best &#xC2;&#xA3;8:99 I&apos;ve ever spent..not just on games - but on ANYTHING</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1800323">Expand</a></span>

The scaling of the game were useless, I had to spend at least 15 h to even get to the &quot;good&quot; items and to finally get some &quot;challenge&quot; in the defending, and the HARDEST part was really not to loose connection to trendynet during this time --&gt; having to start over. ...In the meantime new DLC:s were spit out faster then i could change my underwear, trying to keep you busy not thinking about the fact that the scaling were so bad. THEN ONE DAY after 200 H game play: I changed from window-mode to full-screen mode --&gt; the game crashed and all my progress were gone. ALL heroes GONE, all items, all mana, EVERYTHING. I&apos;ve tried countless of ways to contact the developers, no one have responded. ALL i can say, it&apos;s a great idea, with too many flaws, not worth spending any time on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2102896">Expand</a></span>

DD may be an &quot;indie&quot; game, but you wouldn&apos;t know it. The visuals are detailed and gorgeous. Every level is full of creative little touches. There are plenty of levels, and a bunch of &quot;challenges.&quot; It&apos;s really meant to be co-op, not single player, but you can play alone- I have played single player for 75 hours according to Steam! You just make one of each class, then swap out at the forge so you can make whichever defenses you like it. You do end up at a disadvantage in the combat phase, because it&apos;s just you, but it&apos;s still quite doable and I&apos;ve beaten most levels on Medium or Hard. I feel *guilty* that I only payed $15 for this game. Other highlights: native 360 controller support, which allows 4-player splitscreen play on PC; 4 player online; full mod tools; and they are even testing a 16-player CTF mode. And the gameplay... it&apos;s so, so good. DD combines the best elements of tower defense and action RPGs, and it does it so well that it feels completely natural. I think this might be more Game of the Year. It&apos;s so much for such a small price tag, the quality is excellent, and it&apos;s an innovative, genre-bending title. Moreover, the multiplayer and mod support means I&apos;ll probably be playing this a year from now, which I can&apos;t say for many games. I am buying 3-4 more copies as Christmas presents. I need people to play with, and these guys deserve way more than $15 from me!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1923307">Expand</a></span>

The Graphics Look Amazing if you can max it and make the game come to life. The unique 4 player classes are very diverse and each has its own skill tree and towers. One of the more interesting elements of the game is the ability to change characters between waves. This not only adds a layer of strategy. Like I mentioned above, the only real problem with the game i have is that the enemies are unbalanced. Just in the second map there is a powerful boss you need to take down. Now I am not complaining as much as a warning. it`s still getting 9/10 because I am fine with the grinding you need to do in the first level.  Besides that the only changes in your character are the colors and their weapon. This is really sad in comparison to the amazing amount of leveling and stats you can invest in and unlike most games where they give you the whole &quot;2% increase bull&quot; you can  actually see the changes in your character and towers. Overall if you do not mind grinding and limited cosmetic changes then this game is both amazingly detailed and very solid game play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1820116">Expand</a></span>

You pick your unique class, level up your characters, upgrade weapons and armor, and distribute points to specialize your character.  You can either rely on your characters ability to fight, or your characters ability to build and maintain &quot;towers&quot;, or you can go somewhere in between.  The story is light and humorous, but falls into place well.  Having beaten the game already, I walk away remembering several intense moments, heartache, and triumph.  While the game is slightly lacking in content, it is important to remember this is a $15 download release.  Furthermore, there have been balancing patches and also plans to add a full campaign expansion to the game sometime in November.  This game is a must have for any avid Tower Defense player looking for another pleasant surprise in the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1805553">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>One of the most amazing games i have ever played. Its a tower defence mixed with diablo. You have 4 unique classes, you can have pets and all kinds of amazing stuff including boss fights and challenges. This game is good on singleplayer and ground breaking on co-op.  Game is only 10e/15 dollars so its a must-buy</span>

Battles are always fun and frantic and require a good amount of strategy. The loot is very compelling with a fun mana system where you spend points to boost stats of the weapons you are partial to. I don&apos;t know what else a gamer could ask for from a 15 dollar game. Definitely sets a new standard for budget games. If you like tower defense, co-op games, or ARPGs, then this your game. It&apos;s a refreshing and perfectly balanced blend of genres that is just really damn fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1802195">Expand</a></span>

Sure there&apos;s some issues with the server stability and I lost my charas when the game launched early and reset itself. But it&apos;s okay, this game is FUN- it&apos;s been out for 3 days and I&apos;ve got 24 hours played. This is the new TF2, the new torchlight another AMAZING indie game. It&apos;s $15 if you don&apos;t get it, only you will lose out.</span>

Unfortunately, all of the game&apos;s best efforts are lost in the less than impressive, scratch that, less than competent execution.
<br>
<br>It suffers horribly in every account of its production: Janky menus and improper scaling of the GUI. Bad use of the, obviously jammed in, physics engine. A completely imbalanced character selection that doesn&apos;t seem to be getting patched any time soon. The general use of the ever ridiculous and over rated Unreal engine. 4 Camera settings that are completely useless, 3 of which are identical. Oh, and did I mention that the game constantly switches the camera on you rather you want it to or not?
<br>
<br>Some people would argue that the cartoony style of the game takes away from the experience, but people who don&apos;t have an inferiority complex in regard to their age will agree it works well. That is not to say however, that the animations and sound feel &quot;mushy&quot; and the game doesn&apos;t give you the &quot;thuds&quot; and &quot;booms&quot; to distinguish your actions: rather than having your character take a diliberate and forceful swing that lets you know you made contact, your character sort of sways the weapon back and forth while contact with the enemy feels like a disappointment.
<br>
<br>But there are some good points to the game. For one it is four player local co-op. Let me restate that: FOUR PLAYER LOCAL CO-OP! And of course you can play online if you like having a 10 year old screach racial and homophobic slurs in your ear, you can always take it online. So while I was sitting there knit-picking the game, I also found that I some how lost eight hours without even realizing it and somehow started having fun.
<br>
<br>Bottom line, this game is just different enough and enjoyable as a group game to be worth it. That is, if you can take all of its flaws along with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1808512">Expand</a></span>

Its basically a combination of tower defense and MMO.  Its worth to note there are more &quot;AFK shops&quot; than actual game rooms with playing people, even though PvP exists, its virtually dead since there is no rewards for it whatsoever. Another problem is that If you dont have level cap and insanely good gear, you will just get kicked from most rooms, so prepare to play singleplayer for a while. The cartooney artstyle is also something that might not suit everyone&apos;s taste. But if you can get past all that, the game is very addicting and enjoyable, its definetly worth recommending, its just not for everyone.&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1803907">Expand</a></span>

Just to farm mana for upgrading your items or farming until you drop the good items from the levels you are able to do. Also **** Survival Mode, the only way to get the best items in the game, takes 5 hours each time and is extremely boring.<br><br>They also release lots of paid dlc, what&apos;s worst about that is that all the best items / characters come from dlc, recently they made a dlc called Assault Map Pack, which is a Dungeon Assault only with Hero Character Maps. The thing is the old characters are almost useless on this map, for you to be able to do it successfully on the highest difficulties you would need to buy the Barbarian Hero DLC Pack, which is extremely tanky and has many abilities that are useful on those maps.<br><br>So they sell power through DLC and keep rising the difficulty so only the most hardcore players are able to beat it. It&apos;s not worth your time, I can&apos;t even believe I wasted 300 hours on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2127146">Expand</a></span>

Highly consolized control scheme (no mouse pointer) and simplistic combat (only two offensive abilities). On the plus side I admired the art style and it feels gratifying to complete a level on Hard.

Playing with friends for a while was a ton of fun, everything flowed pretty well, and it was a unique twist on the tower defence genre. My big problem with it is how repetitive and grindy it became after the first while of fun. Once you&apos;ve played through everything a few times with a few characters, you&apos;re just grinding levels for more loot to do more of the same levels to get even more loot etc... It really sucked the fun out of it for me. The other big problem I had was the fact you needed to play on their servers, which crashed multiple times. Which meant you lost everything you had going, which was extremely frustrating if you were doing something hard and/or got something good. It was definitely fun for a while, and was worth picking up for a few bucks on a steam sale, but it just isn&apos;t fun once you&apos;ve done it all a few times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2134264">Expand</a></span>
