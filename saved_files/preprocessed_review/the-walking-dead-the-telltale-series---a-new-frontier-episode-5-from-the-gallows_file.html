I don&apos;t really know how to feel about it. The Walking Dead: A New Frontier has the best graphics of the whole series, but that doesn&apos;t matter to be honest. First season looked less impresive, but the story was way much better. I really enjoyed playing as Lee, in the next season I was happy to control Clementine, but now... Javi was kinda &quot;empty&quot;. I had no bond with him at all. I did not care about any character to be honest, only Clementine was important to me. The story of this game (which should be the strongest point) was not actually adictive. To be honest it was boring at some points. I thought that ending would be powerful... Unfortunately it felt me down. It wasn&apos;t terrible, it wasn&apos;t just as good as endings from previous games.  To sum up - Game wasn&apos;t as good as TWD season 1, wasn&apos;t as good as TWD season 2, was better than TWD Michonne (it wasn&apos;t hard to be better than it) . It had some charm in it, but I couldn&apos;t say that I enjoyed every minute that I&apos;ve spent with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier-episode-5-from-the-gallows/user-reviews?user_review_id=7402461">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately, Season 3 doesn&apos;t come anywhere near the previous seasons. It&apos;s not outright bad, it&apos;s just well in the shadows.Telltale does fix several problems that occurred in the previous seasons as they demonstrate strongly with &quot;From the Gallows&quot; a new storyline that revolves around a world that has had years to adapt to the walkers, people creating human &quot;tribes&quot; compared to Season 1 where no one understood how it all worked and tried to work together, or Season 2 which showed the downfall of society and normal trusting human interaction. New characters and a change from the traditional season ending are certainly welcome. This is also the first season where your choices will actually matter in the final episode (well some of them will).
<br>Where this season, particularly &quot;From the Gallows&quot; fall short is in poorly structured, rushed storytelling. Players will feel like &quot;Is this it?&quot; as the credits roll. The plot and emotions jump all over the place, and many plot points are simply abandoned. There is no true climax as seen in the other seasons and character deaths simply lack emotional impact by their poor handling and rushed continuation of the plot.
<br>Another area that made Season 1 spectacular and Season 3 falls short on is the ability is freely walk around and talk to other characters during down times, allowing you to get to know and care for characters as well as create your own personality (as with Lee and Clemintine in S2) This also means that you are constantly rushed through the gameplay, though timed dialogue choices broken up by quick time events which are so heavily used they lose their adrenaline impact.
<br>Many of the events that occur are repeated from other seasons and simply feel unnecessary as they do not add to the story,
<br>Overall the premises was promising and the attempt at changes were appreciated, but poor story-telling, reused plot devices, and rushed filler feeling to the Season will leave you feeling like something was missing.
<br>The after conclusion hints at Season 4, which many players will wish they had been playing instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier-episode-5-from-the-gallows/user-reviews?user_review_id=7342949">Expand</a></span>

They are both very different.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, episode 5 was a brutal one where up to 4 people died, the way that David died in my game was a tad bit unorthodox with gabe shooting him and not me but it does kind of take you back to the time where Clementine had to shoot lee. Through this you can see Clem through Gabe.
<br>
<br>The game has left too much for people to desire so I think that there will be another season based on this storyline in the future with Javier, Gabe and Clementine involved.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d recommend this game to a player who wants to sink their teeth in to a juicy game series... But if you&apos;re new to TWD I&apos;d reccommend you watch season 1 and 2 at the very least or even play them if you have the time so you have an understanding of what&apos;s gone down so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier-episode-5-from-the-gallows/user-reviews?user_review_id=7333280">Expand</a></span>

<br>Shallow characters, and boring dialog.
<br>
<br>It first it was pretty interesting but it seemed obvious to me they (the writer(s)) tried to stretch already weak story to far.

Episode four and five are some of the best episodes I&apos;ve played from any Telltale game thus far, and closes off my favorite game of their creation in the best ways possible. The ending was great, heartfelt and made my decisions feel impacting. The final episode has only been released for four days and I already can&apos;t wait for the next season/downloadable content from Telltale.
