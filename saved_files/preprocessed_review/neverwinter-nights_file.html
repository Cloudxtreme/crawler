The character creation and development is even better than it was in BGII and IWD, giving you more options and possibilities for customization. You really grow attached to you character as s/he is the only thing you directly control (as opposed to a party of 6). Personally, I LOVED the OC (and especially SOU and HOTU expansions) but I can see how it would get a bit tedious. Even so, the toolset and online play provided by the game far make up for it. If you have half a brain, like to read and enjoy RPGs, especially Baldur&apos;s Gate, this game is for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=1678612">Expand</a></span>

There are hundreds, if not thousands of user created adventures available on the NWN vault. I would say that the DnD 3.5 rules might baffle some people, but as a DnD game it loses no points for following its source too closely. The toolset and CEP are great for creating your own worlds and customized settings, wether Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, or even Harry Potter (The Harry Potter one was surprisingly good, but I havn&apos;t checked in years) Heres the server i&apos;m trying to kickstart at the moment, its a Wheel of Time server: Website: http://tabularasa.prophpbb.com/ Version: 1.69 Required Haks: CEP (2.3)/2.4 Direct Connect: 212.69.53.38:5121 CEP 2.3/2.4 will be available on the NWN Vault site, its about 1gb unfortunately but the resources are needed to make a nice world for the minimum of fuss and hassle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=1668689">Expand</a></span>

The experiences in role-play on multiplayer servers are perhaps the most unique and genuinely interesting stories online because you are helping create them.  The builder is excellent, the only thing better for people without code savvy is NWN2!  Neverwinter has aged well, despite issues needing major patches in the beginning, it now allows for low-spec online gaming great for laptops.  I honestly never got further then 20 hours or so in the story line simply because PLAYER MADE SERVERS RULE.  Multiple DMs catering to your ever Rped whim (for good or ill) makes for the best plots.  For example, I once played a dark skinned half-elf &amp; was involved in multiple Dwarven hate-crimes, hunted down for sport as Drow.  After a week of struggle, there was a political uproar.. I would log on and have bodyguards come come to my aid, spies search for the perpetrators so as to bear witness in the player made court system, and we hunted them as criminals.  NO other online game can even attempt to offer this quality of story &amp; it was all player made impromptu RP.  If you want real D&amp;D experiences with realistic RP, short of a few MUDs, you will be hard pressed to find it in any other graphical RPGs.  As a DM it is endlessly fun to design new campaigns;  it&apos;s so accurate that one can beta test P&amp;P games in NWN as a simulator.  Neverwinter Nights is truly one of the greatest games ever made because they let their players create campaigns with wonderful world building and DM tools.  Even with almost 100 people, DMing is smooth, made easier then p&amp;p because the dice rolls and tabulation are automated, plus access to all conversation logs etc. so that the DM can foreshadow and plan for any event.  Neverwinter Nights is revolutionary, so far ahead of it&apos;s time that modern MMORPG struggle to create atmospheres like NwNs and fail:  where major corporations spend millions Bioware gave the power to the players... it turns out we love the stories more then the people paid to write them.  It also helps when your guiding lights are Gary Gygax &amp; R.A. Salvatore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=1813099">Expand</a></span>

The only problem for me was that at the beginning of this game it&apos;s really hard to find a way to level. Most of the quests are to difficult to do. But with the great online game play and great story line it&apos;s a perfect game.</span>

Unfortunately, due to the multiplayer feature, it seems that you can only have one henchman, which is a bit of a bummer. Two henchmen would be great, but still, This game has most things a Rpg player needs, if you don&apos;t mind reading, that is.</span>

It makes Icewind Dale, Baldur&apos;s Gate, Dungeon Siege and Diablo 2 look miniscule in comparison. The game is huge. That is an understatement. The story, altough a LITTLE cliche&apos;d, is engrossing otherwise. The sound is amazing. The voice acting can send chills down your spine at times. The graphics are top-notch, full of deatil that really brings out the games atmosphere. The ONLY problem though, is that you must have a computer that can push some serious meat, otherwise this thing looks and plays like garbage, and sometimes wont play at all. If you intend on playing NWN and any other games in the future, I suggest you invest in a new Video Card and some more RAM. It will be well worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=1096">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> NWN is a great game. Just as Morrowind is. But the two games are very different. In Morrowind you feel the sand blown into your eyes. In NWN everyone is trying to get you emotionaly involved (scare the hell out of you when they are aggressive). NWN is perhaps a little to lively for RPG players who want to recalculate every result.</span>

The Toolset program with it is the best, the only problem, there isn&apos;t much of a tutorial or instructions with it. The game should come with 2 books. One for the rules of the game, the other for using the toolset. It took me a better part of 3 days trying to learn how to place doors in my maps. Over all, one of the Best RPG games out there.

                                        <span> NWN is easily one of the best games I have played in a long while. Everything is worked wonderfully. The story line is interesting to say the least (though not as compelling as the Final Fantasies), The Multiplayer keeps the game&apos;s value high, and the visual effects are awesome. I would definitley recommend this game without a doubt.</span>

Just make the graphics, design the experience, and bingo - recreate any game, book, movie you want. This game is amazing now, but with a good 6-8 months of user input, it will be the greatest software entertainment experience ever.</span>

Neverwinter Nights is one of the very few games I&apos;ve played in the past 15 years of gaming that genuinely deserves a 10/10. This game does everything right, but most importantly, the story, the story, the story. The massive amount of pure freedom when it comes to character creation is something that doesn&apos;t come very often. I know that this game is massively outdated, but I would still highly recommend finding a copy somewhere, somehow, and letting the magic take you for a ride. Don&apos;t spend 60$ for the new crap coming out of Bioware these days, spend nothing and buy Neverwinter Nights.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=2804159">Expand</a></span>

RPG gaming doesn&apos;t get any better than that. This is one of the apex games of the genre, and some of the most fun I&apos;ve had in front of a PC since the 1980s. Highly, highly recommended.</span>

The official and community content just keeps getting better and better. I&apos;m currently playing the best community module I&apos;ve ever played.</span>

<br>
<br>For me this is the game that made my fall in love with rpgs. I have played the single player a dozen times and playing it in 2015 it still feels good. The wealth of classes is the strong point giving the game a lot of replayability. Masterpiece.</span>

Genuinely interesting NPCs and quests. Online multiplayer. In short, it has everything. The graphics are quite dated, sure, but in terms of gameplay, it is arguably the best RPG ever made.</span>

I have been playing this game since 2004, and I&apos;m still not done with it.  It is such a great game that I ended up getting a Win7 and up optimized version from GOG (since I had the original release copy and couldn&apos;t get it to work on Win7), it doesn&apos;t have the diversity of feats and spells that it&apos;s successor does, and the fact that it&apos;s only semi-turn-based (it&apos;s turn-based, but the turn get run so quickly that counterspelling, something that I do a lot in table top D&amp;D, almost impossible.  But as I said it is one of the best applications of the 3.5e rules out there, so for those of you who are avid  players of 3.5e D&amp;D, you would love this game, hell anyone who likes a good RPG would love this game.
<br>Now the campaign itself gets boring after a while (sure I have played it over 20 times), but with the addition of premium modules you can and your own modules you can make, it keeps single player fun.  The multiplayer features, in my opinion are unparalleled across the Strategic RPG Genre.  The diversity of the various servers (almost all of which are player made), and the amount of dedication by the owners to keep playing on the server fun is amazing.  In conclusion, one of the best games I have ever played, an amazing adaptation of the 3.5e rules, and it keeps pulling you back to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=4531537">Expand</a></span>

True, this is dissapointing in a way, but the game is meant for playing with other people online with various mods. Story wise, I can not say the main plot is terrible but it&apos;s too generic and predictable. The game also suffers from way too many fetch quests (Comparing to Bioware&apos;s Modern Games, it&apos;s quite like Dragon Age 2) . However, I do LIKE this game as it offers fun multi-player experience. Overall, it&apos;s a great game but do not expect a masterpiece like baldur&apos;s gate series</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=1782115">Expand</a></span>

Fortunately as you go forth, it&apos;s getting better and better. You&apos;re getting used to the engine and starting to realize that this is a huge game, where each chapter would be enough to fill the entire content of some other games. Second chapter being much much higher quality, leaving the city and finally experiencing adventures in nature you were used to from Baldur&apos;s. Some of the quests are starting to get really good and in the end the result is actually very positive. Also, definitely worth mentioning is the music by always amazing Jeremy Soule that created a huge part of of the atmosphere in this game. Seen in retrospect, Neverwinter Nights is a great RPG, that took me about 100 hours to finish, not as good as Baldur&apos;s Gate series, but what is. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=4397534">Expand</a></span>

The party based format of the Infinity Engine games is gone, replaced with a single henchman (not even levelable/gearable by you), in a big disservice to one of D&amp;D&apos;s strengths.  The story is un-engaging.

The toolset has allowed people to make worthwhile single player adventures and wonderful multiplayer D&amp;D experiences. The single player games that come with Neverwinter Nights Diamond, however, are pure tedium. This is NOT a true sequel to the Baldur&apos;s Gate series. The stories in these games are 100% linear, character interaction just doesn&apos;t matter. You cannot have a party of characters, only yourself and one henchmen, whom you do not control and has no significance whatsoever on the plot of the game. Unlike most RPGs, which attempt to weave stories involving as many characters as possible, each game that comes in NWN is just one simple plot, drawn out with as many repetetive action sequences as possible. Technically, there is an awful lot of role playing, as you repeatedly cast spells and use special abilities. Lots of role playing, but almost no game. The game does not require strategy, as any literate person can read what spells and abilities are more powerful than another and choose them. The game has puzzles, but they are completely obvious and will always require a bunch of boring combat - just like everything in the game. This game would have been infinitely better given the character interaction, full party control, and interesting plotline of Baldur&apos;s Gate II. Those were all the best parts of BG2, yet Bioware left them out. Buy only if seeking to play multiplayer (where people have taken the time to create interesting worlds where you can interact with other people, filling all the voids left in the singleplayer NWN).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=9569">Expand</a></span>

This was great. It also comes with the toolkit that allows players to make their own adventures. This was amazing but is history now as the servers were permanently closed this year. Sad but inevitable in a quickly evolving industry. However the engine itself is not that great. Visually it is bland and I doubt anyone can seriously claim that it is better than what was already established with the Infinity Engine and Baldur&apos;s Gate. However sad to say the actual adventure of Neverwinter Nights is pretty bloody dull! It takes forever to level your character, to explore the city and make sense of the plot lines. The final result is kind of a long winded mediocrity. As an old sucker for Dungeons and Dragons I actually enjoyed it a lot in the day, but doubt that this could be considered appealing now to any but the most hard core RPGers. The GOG platinum version (when on sale) is the best buy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=2681480">Expand</a></span>

No scratch that, what in the heck was I thinking when I bought this game? This is a horrible game, and you catch the drift right once you actually start playing. Reading is tedious, and I figured Atari would have figured that out, I spent the first 5 minutes talking to the first guy. And then the next 30 reading the rest of the crap everyone else had to say. Thus leaving me out of action, and a game with no action, is a boring game. Trust me, when tomorrow comes around this game is going back to the shelf I picked it up from. The only reason I gave it a 3 was because I figured there are some people out there who like being submerged into stupid games. I suggest you check the game out at your friend?s house before wasting your time by just buying it and returning it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=581">Expand</a></span>

The graphics, even for the time of release, are fairly poor. Sound is good enough but nothing to write home about. The musical score, such as I&apos;ve heard, is pretty appropriate, and the voice acting is at least adequate. The real sticking point here, though, is the utter tedium of the gameplay. Against more than one enemy, even early on in the game, your chances of survival are very slim because of the &quot;sort of turn-based&quot; nature of the combat. The D&amp;D rules may be appropriate for tabletop gaming, but here they are simply limiting to the game&apos;s flow. I mean, come /on/ - this is a computer game, and thus the only reason to use such antiquated devices as dice rolls is verisimilitude, which is a bad thing in this case. This is the problem with most of the (admittedly few) RPGs I&apos;ve played, that they rely too heavily on rules. IMO, computer roleplaying shouldn&apos;t be about counter-intuitive statistics and linear questlines - it should be about the freedom to do whatever you desire, creating your character through your interaction with the world around you. That&apos;s roleplaying. Whereas Neverwinter Nights is more akin to work, and therefore I won&apos;t be playing it again, nor will I ever go near a D&amp;D-based computer RPG again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=11883">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> I play virtually nothing but D&amp;D computer games. I LERVE Baldur&apos;s Gate, and even think Icewind Dale and Pool of Rad II are okay. I&apos;ve owned Neverwinter Nights for six months and spent a total of two hours playing it. My computer massively exceeds the specs but the game slows down so badly in places as to make it virtually unplayable. What&apos;s going on here?</span>

And I dont give a fuck if that figure is wrong, if you took long enough to look it up, tell someone ELSE that.

SO what if the graphics are a better or you could rotate the view? It doesn&apos;t add anything fun to the game if it is still turn based computer controlled fighting. That&apos;s just primitive, we want to be able to jump at the enemy and do crazy moves, not just click a button and watch the sword swing and have some dice calculate whether you hit or not. Its so lame and the story is so slow. Hardly anything interactive in this game.

Roleplaying game is a game where you think with the character, make choices based on the traits and feel with the character. Well in Nwn all choices you do are limited to kill him with focus+spec on Axe or focus+spec on Sword. You cant finish the game for example with a rogue-based character focused on diplomacy or persuasion. The closest game to RPG is still Fallout, Arcanum and Planescape Torment, BG1. Neverwinter nights is nothing, but a simple clickfest for kids that think they&apos;re playing roleplaying game. The only positive thing is the multiplayer, but the multiplayer can&apos;t be compared to MMORPG games like everquest or asheron, its just not that good. Absolutely NWN is the worst succesful game i&apos;ve ever seen.

The way PCs interact with NPC is atrocious. I get so bored I just go around and kill everyone in the damn room. Nothing interesting happens, except you have to go to some place, fight a large group of people and try and run away so you can take one of them 1 on 1, if not then you die, respawn in a temple and have to walk back to go do the same damn thing again. Not to mention the limited weapons/outfits for characters. I think you can make a total of 6 different looking characters. AWFUL, but apparently some of you like it, however I must give it a 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=631">Expand</a></span>

All the extra storage in inventory, spell book, etc., don&apos;t add anything to the game besides greater elaboration on earlier RPG&apos;s which follow the same formula. I played about 10 hours worth and got bored. I play games for the continual challenges and engagement. On this level, NWN simple fails. The pace is slow. There&apos;s wayyyy too much reading to do with NPCs. You have to wait till rooms or scenes load over and over and over. Unlike Diablo, changes of scenery involve slow-loading breaks in the action.

I played the original campaign, the Shadows of Undrentide expansion, and the Hordes of the Underdark expansion.  I hear that the multiplayer component of this game is great, and that there are many great mods out there, but I only played single-player and did not install mods.  Here is my opinion of the main game and both expansions (with no mods and I only played single-player):
<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>The character creation system is amazing with lots of depth.  The games uses D&amp;D 3.5 rules, and there are so many options when creating a character - race, class, attributes, skills, feats, etc.  But that is where the fun ends...
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>Unlike most D&amp;D video games, you do not have a full party.  Instead, you create one character and can bring only one companion with you (in the Hordes of the Underdark expansion they allow you to bring two companions).  You control your companions and they fight on their own.  Also, in the original game you could not even equip you companions with weapons and armor, but in the Shadows of Undrentide expansion and the Hordes of the Underdark expansion you can equip your companions.  Because of the lack of a party, I found the combat to be DREADFULLY boring.  If the game had a good story, maybe you could tolerate the dull combat to advance the story, but alas, the story is also terrible (except for the story of the final expansion, Hordes of the Underdark, which was somewhat entertaining and held my interest).  But with the dull gameplay and lame story, it was a real chore to push myself to complete this game and both expansions (though I managed to do so through sheer willpower because I wanted to say I had completed Neverwinter Nights).
<br>
<br>To sum up, character creation has great depth and is a lot of fun, but you can only make one character.  After character creation, the game goes downhill from there - boring combat, boring story.  I give it a 5.
<br>
<br>Die hard D&amp;D enthusiast might enjoy the single-player campaign, but that&apos;s about it.  I hear multiplayer and the fan created mods are great, but I didn&apos;t experience any of that.  The single player game is a dud.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=6505360">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The solo campaign is, all things considered, a waste of time, with too little fun to care. And I don&apos;t care for coop things: when I want a group, I play table RPGs with friends in the flesh.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t blame too much the setting and the rules system. D&amp;D is what it is, its rules get worse with each newer edition, for reasons I won&apos;t discuss here, yet the video game version has to run with that. Using kitchen sink Faerun, the worst campaign setting ever designed for D&amp;D, wasn&apos;t mandatory, but I understand it is commercially successful, since it feels more like contemporary USA than exotic ancient times. Don&apos;t worry if you don&apos;t get my meaning, it&apos;s not an important point.
<br>
<br>Now, also with the times, the game goes 3D, losing the past appeal of the IE games, and looking seriously dull as a result. I can now play in 3rd person perspective. But I&apos;d rather not, thank you very much.
<br>
<br>Time to mention some serious flaws. The biggest possibly concerns the companions. They are gone. Now you have mercenaries, all waiting for you in orderly fashion at the same inn. No interesting introductions, no unlocking, no nothing. You can pay and pick one to come with you. Yes, one. And you don&apos;t control it and don&apos;t access his inventory. With half the fun gone with each of these restrictions, there&apos;s about 6% of fun left. I decided to play solo and never looked back.
<br>
<br>As usual, I built a rogue. I could pickpocket, but it never, absolutely ever, brought me anything of worth. And 99% of the time, nothing at all. I&apos;m serious. And for some retarded reason, there&apos;s a bloody cooldown constraint between 2 attempts. That one seriously grated my nerves. Even for a rogue, the quantity of locks and traps found on anything, even a barrel, constitutes an abuse. The fact that what a trap is supposed to protect is often worth less than the trap itself speaks volumes of the design effort. Also, thanks to insane randomisation, you can find riches in a street barrel and junk in a treasure chamber. Setting traps happened to be another waste of time; better sell them, if you can find the only merchant who will buy them (just another nonsensical constraint.) Sneaking works good though, I have to say; I&apos;ve never had the need for magical invisibility. Sneaking is surely the most powerful tactical tool in the game.
<br>
<br>Merchants also got downgraded. Their inventory, just like yours, is a mess. You have to peruse each object one by one just to see if one of them is anything special. You also buy and sell items 1 by 1. Want to buy a potion or magical item ? Description tells you what spell it emulates, not what it actually does, and that&apos;s it. Better yet, 2/3rds in the game, I realised that even merchant prices are random ! And with a huge interval of randomness. Yet another time waster of a save/load routine.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s speed up some more inanities: You can&apos;t find or even buy low levels spells after a while. At this point, leveling to Wizard 2 would cost you millions of XP anyway, because multiclassing is seriously flawed. Your equipment is much more important and powerful than your skills. Many skills do nothing but bring or save you money, therefore they are completely useless (as usual, you carry millions of weightless gold pieces in your front pocket.) cosmetic dialogues galore,  no quick load shortcut, broken path finding, dreadful voice acting, useless consumables&#x2026; Sorry, can&apos;t be exhaustive in less than 500 pages.
<br>
<br>What good is left then ?, you ask. The variety of builds, i.e., a rich character creation system. UI-wise, a good toolbar. And combat is dynamic, still varied, if never really challenging once you bought the protection belts. I can&apos;t tell you what non-undead bosses can do because they don&apos;t have a chance to do anything against an assassin. I almost forgot: if they decide to talk when nearly dead, just go out and have a 7 courses dinner to give the assassin&apos;s paralysis enough time to wear off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=6886670">Expand</a></span>

I wasn&apos;t really in to RPG games until i was introduced to Diablo 2 not to long ago and also just reciently i bought Dungeon Siege.  So besides that i have put in about 6 hours with this game and its the best ive played yet.  Also if anyone wants to fill me in on any older RPG&apos;s that i&apos;ve missed, email me at roddy57@hotmail.com.</span>

Can&apos;t wait to see what the talented team at Bioware does with Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=350">Expand</a></span>

<br>I give it a ten for overall potential, and a two for the single player campaign.  It is awesome as a multiplayer game, the toolset is great, and the user created mods are quite good.  However, the campaign that comes with the game is really just pandering to the slavering masses; it is simplistic, painful, and just like Diablo 2.  Also, the voice acting made me want to gouge out my ears with a spork.  Not to say it isn&apos;t playable, or even fun occasionally, but I don&apos;t believe it worthy of a high score.  </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=638">Expand</a></span>

It can be buggy at times but rarely gamebreakingly so be sure to quick save often and this is never an issue. i have been wanting to get back into D&amp;D for awhile, this was a good temporary fix until i can get some friends together.</span>

While the subsequent expansions improved on the game immeasurably, it remains a classic. One that I still play to this day. The wealth of quality user created content for it is breathtaking. It is a RPG that we need more of.

I love this game i have since I first played it in 2005. It was the first game I tried Multiplayer with at that time and it was amazing I had a blast then. I never tried the new Communuty made multiplayer but oh well. I&apos;m sure its fine. I loved the Single Player in this game, the main story was great, while the secondary quests still had importance, it helps a lot in this game to do as many secondary objectives as possible, it doesnt hurt too bad as not doing them in a game like Dragon Age because it has a huge skill cap compared to this. But it still helps out in the long run.
<br>
<br>Yes I do understand this game starts out slow, but it gets more enjoyable to play the more you are leveled.
<br>
<br>My favourite build style is Dex heavy Rouge/(low)Fighter/Weapon Master, i know it sounds like an odd combination but when you get to the 20+ levels and you built it right, you are nearly unstoppable unless you fdace something thats immune to Criticals or Sneak attacks. I like using Rapier for the special with thr halfling race. I start out with fighter till about level 3-4 which ever gives a feat, then I pump like 5-7 levels into Rogue untill i get the Weapon Master class unlocked (You need to focus a lot of talents into this early) and I prefer to start into that till 7 then just level rogue. Once you unlock Weapon Master the feat choices dont matter too much. This build starts out horribly slow but it gets good when you get closer to level 10 which is a long time i know.
<br>
<br>Also to the people who say the graphics are &quot;Laughable&quot; @ Zoso this is a 2002 game. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? GTA 5 or Witcher 3 graphics in those days? Now thats laughable.
<br>
<br>One of my favourite parts of this is the toolset, its a lot of fun making your own stories and inventing new weapons/armours. Sneaky tip, load a plain toolset and create a mildy to amazingly powerful piece of armour or weapon and place it on the ground, and maybe a bunch of gold, and then enter that with a new character you hope to level in the campaign and use the item(s) and then save the character then go into the campaign. It makes it a lot easier if your messing around with new things. I don&apos;t consider it a cheat as you can&apos;t do that with online games, unless the host allows that I believe. And your using it for your own benifit in the single olayer campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=5296491">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story: You begin as a new recruit in the academy of Neverwinter with the mission to find a way to combat the plague that has the city on its knees. Soon things go wrong as the creatures which could provide the cure are lost after the academy is attacked. From then on you are on a quest to find the evil behind the plague to gain the dominion over Neverwinter, and also will eventually solve side quests. What I like of the story is that although you are the hero or antihero, you are able to role play according to the character you created.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: the interface is clean and customizable according to your style of play. Whether you are a fighter, rouge, sorcerer, wizard, thief...you can assign spells, attacks, orders to your henchmen in the quickbar, which by pressing Ctrl or Shift provide you with more slot to even assign potions, torches, scrolls etc.. You can adjust how big the map is and even allocate pin and name them to guide you, the dialogue box cand also be adjusted. Your character screen is clean and provides with the necessary information of hit  points, bonuses, alignment etc.
<br>
<br>In combat you can pause the game to think your tactics according to the type of enemy you are facing. If you are playing a wizard for example, you can que various spells, defensive or aggressive and once you unpause the game, the character will act accordingly. You can also hire henchmen or summon creatures to aid you in your quests and combat.  While you are not able to form a party of six like in BG or BGII, you can still go and enjoy the game with your henchmen. Some of them will provide more background to their own story depending how your relationship improves as you level up.
<br>
<br>The single player experience is fun, engagin dyinamic and will keep you interested as long as you are an rpg fan and enjoy turn based combat with D&amp;D rules.
<br>
<br>Graphics: many complain about the graphics.  Yes they are not the best feature of the game, but do the job. Spells are colorful and varied, lighting is immersive and you feel that especially in caves or dungeons. Character models are blocky but colorful, and since you are usually looking at the game in a top down view, the blockiness does not matter much. Now with the 3d engine you can zoom in, rotate the camera and adjust it to three different options to move around when exploring the world.
<br>
<br>Sound: the music is appropriate and does accompany the situations well but can become a bit repetitive. Some conversations have voice acting, which is well done for the most part. Spells and combat sound are well done.
<br>
<br>While not as deep as Planescape Torment and not reaching the level of Baldur&apos;s Gate II, Neverwinter Nights provide a solid single player experience and replay value.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Solid Story
<br>Gameplay
<br>Replay value
<br>Role play
<br>D&amp;D rule set
<br>Lengthy campaign with different challenges
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>Character models a bit blocky
<br>(Single player) Party mostly composed by a henchmen and summoned creature if you are mage
<br>Music somewhat repetitive
<br>Story loses a bit of force before climax</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights/user-reviews?user_review_id=5455898">Expand</a></span>
