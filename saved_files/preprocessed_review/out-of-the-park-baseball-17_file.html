<br>
<br>The major pluses:  licensing has allowed use of all major and minor league players and logos.  You can create real life organizations from the Major Leagues right down to short season A ball.  A major plus!
<br>
<br>The 3D engine has grown by leaps and bounds and the graphics presentation is enjoyable.  Gove are the days of OOTP being strictly a text based sim.
<br>
<br>Then there are the issues, which don&apos;t seem to get taken seriously unless you have some predetermined number of posts on their message board.  In &quot;Historical Exhibition&quot; mode I had the AI play a relief pitcher at second base.  I also had the game totally ignore the fact that a relief pitcher made it into the game.  You could see he was in the game by go9ing to the screen that shows the current pitcher.  You could see he had fatigue from pitching.  But he didn&apos;t appear in the box score.  The response from the head developer:  This problem does not exist.
<br>
<br>The Fantasy draft is completely broken.  It doesn&apos;t display starting pitchers.  If you go to a league in the first round of the daft and have the system sort starting pitchers, there are none.  I started a season in 1994.  If I go to the fantasy draft, like I said no starting pitchers.  If I do a search for guys like David Cone, Randy Johnson or Jimmy Key, the come up in the search field.  Try to draft them... nope, not happening. I have tried this several ways: with the most recent patch, uninstalling and reinstalling an earlier version or even going all the way back the beta version, which I secured by pre-ordering the game and the problem still persists.
<br>
<br>I guess if somebody who has a couple of thousand posts in the forum ahs these problems they&apos;ll be addressed.  Right now the game gets a low rating but the one saving grace is they do patch frequently, so maybe this issue will actually get fixed.... we&apos;ll see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-17/user-reviews?user_review_id=6297956">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>They added 3d stadiums which is lame as hell. This is not a 3d simulator and people do not buy it for that purpose. The addition of MLB licence added nothing to the game. The changes to manager rating remain completely nonfunctional in every way.
<br>
<br>The bad news is this version crashes a lot. There are multiple crashes every season and there is no error log or anything to figure out what is wrong. On top of that, the developer is still telling their fans to go to review sites and rate the game very highly distorting the true score of the game.
<br>
<br>Minus one point for this years version. Don&apos;t bother with it. You can buy 2015 and not notice any differences.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-17/user-reviews?user_review_id=6416603">Expand</a></span>

The scouting model doesn&apos;t resemble anything like baseball in the real world.  The AI, especially the handling of players, is broken and doesn&apos;t resemble real world baseball.    And finally, the game has a lot of bugs (too many to count).   I&apos;m sure some of these bugs will be fixed, however some things (scouting, trading, player handling, AI depth charts, DH handling, etc...) need to be rewritten.
<br>
<br>One example... If you have a super star player that has a chance to break a few records or hit a major milestone, don&apos;t be disappointed when he is riding the bench and/or is sent to the minor leagues.  Since the AI has direct access to his &apos;ratings&apos;, he doesn&apos;t have to falter first to be demoted.

<br>
<br>I decided against joining the forum.  It&apos;s not worth the trouble of dealing with fanboys who have thousands of posts and little between the ears.
<br>
<br>I was going to give the game a 7, but all the 10s and after reading the forum, I settled on a 6.
<br>
<br>This game has enormous potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-17/user-reviews?user_review_id=6337757">Expand</a></span>

So while playing a historical career the game will adjust the minor leagues, as well as import real historical players into the ammy draft, all done automatically by the game. Pretty much everything in the game is adjustable too, so you can make your game as complex or as simple as you like.

The depth of the game is truly stunning. You can start in 2016 with the current MLB rosters or at any point in baseball history back to 1871. Or you can create a completely fictional baseball universe. Every version gets better and OOTP 17 is no exception.</span>

<br>
<br>It required far more time and patience than I was willing to give it, and after 4h, I was still unable to figure out the results of most of my choices. Feedback is very weak. Both the games I played through, I was stopped because my team had weak leadership and I couldn&apos;t figure out how to resolve it. Leadership is not a stat which was ever presented to me. After some Googling, you&apos;re apparently supposed to look through players bios to see who likes to play pranks, because they&apos;re leaders and prevent bad team chemistry. ??? Bad feedback systems.
<br>
<br>Actual baseball games lack any excitement, which is about how I remember real baseball. You&apos;re there to improve averages, so games don&apos;t count for much given how many there are (the primary benefit of micromanaging games is it sort of helps you understand how numbers translate to play - but again, feedback is very weak), and once they&apos;re boiled down to a fatalist game of probabilities, it feels particularly hollow.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve never encountered a game demanding I do so much observing and testing for such great lengths of time for so little mechanical information. -But it&apos;s the best sports simulator I&apos;ve played, by far, and it reminded me a lot of the fun I had when I was using NREL&apos;s System Advisor Model, given they have a near-identical GUI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-17/user-reviews?user_review_id=6901977">Expand</a></span>

It is so in depth in everything and there is really nothing else I could ask for. If you are a fan of baseball and are looking for a game where you are the GM or Manager or both then this is definitely the game for you.</span>
