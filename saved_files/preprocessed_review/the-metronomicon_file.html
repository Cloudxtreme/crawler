<br>The Greatest Rhythm RPG game of all time
<br>Slay the dance floor is a rhythm role playing game featuring a 6 hours long story mode that can be played single and local multiplayer, a freeplay mode, and once you complete the story an undless mode&#x2026;
<br>The game tells the story of 8 newly graduated master of the rhythmic combat arts who set out to take down these fools that dare try to step to you on the dance floor
<br>youre here to slay
<br>the game sort of mixes jrpgs with rockband&#x2026;
<br>you start out with 4 characters but youll unlock the other 4 as your progress through the story&#x2026;
<br>You start by choosing a song and you get to slaying the dance floor in 1 of the 3 difficulties..
<br>playing the game is actually a bit tricky..
<br>you have to move back and forth between the 4 characters to pull of their different movesm but you have to use the directional pad or the shape buttons to pull of directions and combinations of directions..
<br>And combinations just don&#x2019;t work on a d pad.. so youre either going to have to assign the dpad 2 rections in your head and give the other 2 to the shapes I ended up holding my controller on a weird angle and using just the shapes and switching characters with my middle pinky finger
<br>that&#x2019;s what worked for me&#x2026;
<br>switching is so important because there are different character classes here, you have characters that can do magic attack, protection for your team, healing, taunting, or tanks with tons of strength, but you cant use the same enemy over and over because they go on a cool down before notes will start dropping..
<br>as you progress the game youll end up unlocking 3 different moves for each character in your party, these moves all have an element attached them like pokemon and enemies do have a weakness&#x2026;
<br>so its also important to have a balanced mix of elements to pick at an enemies weakness&#x2026; and to make things more interesting you can order the amount of notes needed in a row to pull off an attack with those attacks getting a bigger boost the longer they take to activate..
<br>so you can make a weaker attack a little stronger by putting it on top, or make a strong attack even stronger.. and rearrange them for a boss battle&#x2026;
<br>every song has a boss attached to it, but youre only required to beat a stages final boss to move on&#x2026;
<br>you have to defeat them before the song is over or you have to restart.. this again is why its important to keep an eye on elements and arrange them strategically..
<br>characters will unlock multiple moves so you can swap in new ones if a boss is giving you too much trouble..
<br>bosses and sidequests which is basically a song you&#x2019;ve already completed with a challenge attached to it will drop items and gear you can assign to your party to increase their stats or make them immune to certain enemy effects
<br>I had tons of fun just sticking to the story and swapping my characters and their moves, leveling them up, filling up my team attack meter and waiting for the perfect song and moment to unleash it on enemies giving me trouble
<br>but theres plenty here for those that want more, there are leaderboards and again multiple difficulties for you to play on and become a dance floor slaying legend&#x2026;
<br>Slay the dance floor is easily one of the most fun rhythm games ive played and of course it has great music that will be stuck in your head for days
<br>I give The Metronomicon: Slay the Dance Floor
<br>an 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-metronomicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=7490649">Expand</a></span>
