<br>The game is on the same principle as once Limbo. A black male running isolated against white background from left to right. The color red loosens the game on but not more. The story takes players even less with like Limbo.
<br>The style is ok but after the umpteenth game of this type you are just fed up.</span>

Stylish, atmospheric, emotional. That&apos;s what Monochroma is, to me. It tells the story of two little boys without a word. You, the older boy, need to carry your little brother through industrial landscapes, giant robots, zeppelins. You&apos;ll be running away from a big guy that keeps reappearing and gives me goosebumps every time he does. You&apos;ll be exploring a beautifully realized city, in which there are a lot to look at, and take screenshots of. What Nowhere Studios delivered is a thing of beauty. I can look at it for hours and get lost in the details of the city.
<br>
<br>Although the city is beautiful, doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not scary. There are babies in tubes everywhere, robot advertising all around and at some locations, giant statues of a dictator show itself. You&apos;ll be guessing the story yourself, because there are no spoken words in this game.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are well designed, not very hard but satisfying. And over your adventure, you really begin t grow some sympathy for the brothers. There was one scene that I really felt like crying, but I won&apos;t spoil that. Monochroma is about moments, surprises, characters. You are vulnerable, it seems hopeless. What can you do in a giant city with robots? How can you stay alive? There&apos;s a man following you. And he&apos;ll get what he wants.
<br>
<br>There are negatives about this experience. Controls are not as good as they are supposed to be. Placing jumps can be problematic. I was worried that the game might fail to communicate what it wants from me in puzzles. That was never the issue. I always knew where to go, and what to do. There were some puzzles that frustrated me because of the controls, but overall, I&apos;m satisfied with the general quality of gameplay.
<br>
<br>In my book, Monochroma deserves 20 dollars. I was a Kickstarter supporter and I&apos;m happy that I was a part of this journey.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/monochroma/user-reviews?user_review_id=4230095">Expand</a></span>

Considering the background of developers based in Istanbul, it is evident that Gezi Park events were influential on Monochroma. In essence, it is an expression and a protest of a generation. Supported by beautiful soundtrack, your experience become more personal the more you play it. While you are trying to protect your brother from unknown enemies in a similar way to Last of Us, you represent a hope and the innocence. The use of red color is a sign of this hope, like in Schindler&#x2019;s List.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for an unique story and interested in an experience about childhood, journey and politic expression then you will most probably like Monochroma. It is a game about change and expression. Hence, it accomplishes to do it without using words, in a more efficient way than many other verbal games.
<br>
<br>There are of course some technical bugs in the game but I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;ll be fixed with updates. However, Monochroma is unique on its own &#x2013; it has a style, you see the difference when you actually play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/monochroma/user-reviews?user_review_id=4259053">Expand</a></span>

For me, one of the main reasons for the success is the balance created between puzzles, walking and story. Thanks to the beautiful and weird environment, you can really feel the character&apos;s agony to save his friend. It has some minor bugs, but can be forgiven due to the appreciable effort applied in this game development. Also, it has a surprising ending which I loved. The music is another important aspect of the game.

I&apos;m a big fan of Limbo (probably completed it at least four times at this point) and there is no denying that this reminds you of it from the get go.
<br>My favourite thing about it: It reminded me of Limbo and it had one or two puzzles that had me think just a bit to get through them. The &quot;chase&quot; sequences were alright however I honestly prefer puzzles with timed bits in them as opposed to having to outrun things even though they are essentially the same things.
<br>My least favourite thing about it: It was just too friekin&apos; dark even with my monitor and in-game settings cranked up to FULL (and it was so dark at times that I could not see the environment in order to figure out WTF I was supposed to do).
<br>
<br>Thanks to SweetFX I was able to get it to a brightness that not only allowed me to see everything but also made it look far far prettier than it had in my first hour or so. Very nice find and I&apos;m glad to have played it as opposed to not having known about it at all (however these games aren&apos;t for everyone if you don&apos;t enjoy puzzle games at all)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/monochroma/user-reviews?user_review_id=4358493">Expand</a></span>

Good coordination between visuals/scenes and music. Also background animations are really great and the music just awesome. It&apos;s great game. Only bad thing is price tag(20 USD). It&apos;s bit high:/</span>
