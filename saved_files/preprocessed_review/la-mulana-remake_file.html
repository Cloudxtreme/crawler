<br>
<br>Everything about this game is amazingly designed. Great controls, great music, great graphics, and most of all, the puzzles. This game has an amazing sense of explorations, paralleled by none (except maybe Super Metroid) and it has a very unique style of environmental puzzle solving.
<br>
<br>I really don&apos;t want to waffle on too much at the moment, but suffice to say I think this is probably one of the pinnacles of game design as it currently exists. Must play. Requires a bit of patience, sure, but truly a must play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-mulana-remake/user-reviews?user_review_id=4307645">Expand</a></span>

The core mechanics are similar to Metroid or recent Castlevania games - you explore huge ruins with various types of (boss-) enemies and puzzles in them. The controls are good and responsive, if you come from pure jump and run games then the jumping mechanics will require getting used to however as you cannot change the direction in midair. Also the attacks with the main weapons all require some time to execute (the whip moves behind the head first before lashing forward, etc.). This makes a few portions of the game very hard and the bosses even harder, it&apos;s not really a problem though as it is usually your own fault for getting hit. Running around, exploring the map and killing enemies is fun.
<br>The reason for this low rating is the rest. The game is littered with bad design decisions. They were all done this way on purpose (as the game is a remake of a game that was created to be as close to a classic MSX game as possible), but that doesn&apos;t mean that they aren&apos;t bad. There are a lot of tablets all around the ruins that can (and HAVE TO) be read to figure out the huge amount of puzzles in this game. The problem is that they are just a bit too cryptic at times or the tablet with the required hint is on the exact opposite part of the ruins, requiring you to waste countless hours running randomly through the ruins in search for clues (if they&apos;re not too cryptic). Then there are random walls that are destructible but without any indication.
<br>To give a few examples: One key item requires you to destroy such a wall. Nothing (not even a single tablet or any dialogue) hints you where it is - you just have to try to hit all walls and hope that there&apos;s an effect. Another path is blocked off with a destructible wall, but you don&apos;t know it from the way the room is designed. Also there is an &quot;eye of divine retribution&quot; in the room, an object that will zap you if you hit certain things in the room (except for that breakable wall) - nobody in their right mind would think about randomly hitting things in this room.
<br>There is a LOT of **** like this in the game. The only way to not be completely lost is to follow the advice given in the tutorial video (which is inside the installed game&apos;s directory): Write down EVERYTHING! Every single tablet inscription, every single thing that you couldn&apos;t figure out at the moment, the symbols for the areas, symbols that appear somewhere else - the list goes on and on.
<br>Or just watch a Longplay of it.
<br>
<br>I bought it for 10 bucks, but unless you&apos;re really masochistic and ready for unfair puzzles you shouldn&apos;t pay that much. Wait until it gets cheaper or don&apos;t buy it at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-mulana-remake/user-reviews?user_review_id=4212774">Expand</a></span>

Puzzles are hard and some of them might never open up for you without the help of walkthroughs and youtube videos. But that&apos;s ok, because La-Mulana wants to be cruel. The game begins in a village where you get a laptop to receive tips from an old man. That&apos;s where the &quot;handholding&quot; ends. You may go towards which ever direction you desire and die there. Because you will die like in roguelike games  again and again. There are traps, different enemies, poisonous water, certain room conditions that refrain you from using your whip for example. These add to the old Megaman factor that if you take a hit you will be sent flying backwards and may fall off a cliff getting yourself into even more trouble. The controls feel a bit stiff in the beginning but you will get used to them pretty quickly and understand it when the level layout presents you why jumping works as it does. If you enjoy platformer games like Mario and other easy going and simple games you should avoid this. La-Mulana is more like a Super Meatboy with bosses, equipment, very hard puzzles and riddles, and you have to save often to avoid losing all your progress in case of dying. It&apos;s also worth to note that I think it could be completely ok for not-so-hc players to enjoy this masochistic adventure by using the fore-mentioned walkthroughs and play it just for the brilliant sights, music and story. I give this game an 8 because it&apos;s probably just too much for the faint-of-heart.

Once you get into it though, it&apos;s a complete masterpiece; the world is various and gorgeous, filled of tons of secret passages, enemies, traps, bosses, equipments, scenarios and, most importantly, puzzles. A ton of backtracking will be required, your mind will be clouded with a ton of hints to uncover misteries. This is exactly everything I look for in a game, to feel like a small entity and to challenge an huge world ready to jump on you at every minimum mistake. Just don&apos;t make the mistake to skip it because you may think this is the n-th retro platformer you have grown bored of, because I&apos;ll assure you that if you found the trailer appealing, you&apos;ll be satisfied by it. It may not be perfect in how it handles every single event (though the great majority of them are extremely fair), but I&apos;m just happy to see that, for once, a game is proud to mishandle the player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-mulana-remake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2672056">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On the surface it plays a bit like Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night, but it quickly starts to feel more like Dark Souls. It is difficult, but like most hardcore platformers the difficulty can be overcome by sheer persistence. That&apos;s almost a moot point.
<br>
<br>Where it really shines is structure. La-Mulana is deceptively complex, and it&apos;s a constant joy discovering how much of the game there actually is.

Despite it being on of my now favorite games of all time list, it isn&apos;t perfect. It&apos;s also definitely not for everyone. The Good: Amazing music, great art-style, unique puzzles, awesome boss fights. The Bad: weird hit-boxes on enemies/bosses, jumping mechanics feel terrible, getting knocked off of platforms by bats millions of times, and a few obtuse puzzles. To play this game you will either need to take notes (in real life!), take screenshots, or have an amazing memory. In my playthrough, I had 15 pages of notes. After finishing the game and deleting notes I didn&apos;t need anymore, I still had 4 pages left of notes where I didn&apos;t know what hint was for what puzzle. Bad translation or wording maybe? I even checked a walkthrough after and couldn&apos;t make sense of it. Despite being stuck, resist all temptation to use a walkthrough. The game will take you 20-30 hours with guide assistance, and anywhere between 50-100 hours blind. The satisfaction of beating it blind is incredible. There aren&apos;t any other games like this, so I highly recommend playing it blind. There is no repeat value to puzzle games so this is your one chance to cherish it.  When I looked up the solution to some puzzles, I regretted it instantly. Still... I will admit some puzzles are complete BS and just require you to walk around for hours. My advice: enter this game knowing you will not beat is over the weekend. Be an archaeologist. Be methodical, be patient, take notes on everything, and keep an open mind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-mulana-remake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3256593">Expand</a></span>

Epic 16 bit music that will make nostalgia Nintendo Generation people rock out to the midi-esque goodness.

Not a game that is hard enough to throw your controller against a wall, but not so easy as to bore you to tears.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a great little title with an excellent feel, some historical &amp; educational content, and a great concept. It is best summed up as the type of challenging game that makes you want to look up a walkthrough or a FAQ for help, but your inner gamer niggles at you saying &quot;Na, dude. You don&apos;t need to do that. Figure it out on your own! You know you can do it.&quot;
<br>
<br>Indiana Jones meets Mega Man with a puzzle-ridden twist. Shades of CastleVania as well. A great buy on a steam sale near you. $3 very well spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-mulana-remake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3831551">Expand</a></span>

This game will engross you and send you on one of the biggest (and hardest) metroidvania adventures available.  You will die, get stuck on a puzzle, and become annoyed many times, but you will be motivated to figure it out and when you do you will be proud and happy.  The art is amazing, with set pieces that are only used once at every turn, tons of characters, a moving story (if you pay attention), a unique buff system, usable items, main weapons, sub-weapons, and items, and a three album long soundtrack of great tunes. Nine giant main bosses and around forty mini-bosses (not counting those in the super-challenging bonus dungeon!) will kill you hourly in this forty hour long experience.  Even when you have beaten the main game once there are still the challenges of a Hardmode game, getting all the characters in the ending sequence, speedrunning (some people have trimmed this game down to an hour and a half!), the bonus dungeon, and getting good times in Time Attack mode (a boss rush sort of thing). Even then there are the extra challenging steam achievements!
<br>More of a stress to the challenge- You will have to take detailed notes of what the NPC&apos;s and hint tablets say (probably in a notebook so that you do not cover your house with sticky notes). You should both read the manual (available on the website) and watch the introductory video before playing.  You will be confused as to where to go a good portion of the game.  If you decide to fight a boss without being prepared it could take forty tries.  There are a multitude of instant death traps and some bosses with instant death attacks, There are many minor annoyances (dropping through the trap door onto the spikes for the fifth time in a row) that will make you put your hand on your face, but it is still absolutely worth it to hear the puzzle solved chime or see the main character do his victory dance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-mulana-remake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3255017">Expand</a></span>

<br>Now, if you appreciate playing a game that could have come out on the NES- by all means, you&apos;ll probably like it. Just be wary that this isn&apos;t just NES challenging, but has most of the things about NES that were bad too- like controls.

<br>If you&apos;re looking for something like Super Metroid- this isn&apos;t the place. I love Super Metroid, it&apos;s one of the best games ever made- this game is utter garbage, and nothing like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-mulana-remake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3877965">Expand</a></span>

If you fall through a trap door, your controls are locked until you hit the ground. Honestly, I wanted to like this game. It&apos;s so charming it&apos;s almost difficult not to. But after the millionth time I failed to beat a boss that would have been easy if not for the rocks that fall and knock you back a quarter of the screen, I couldn&apos;t deal with it anymore. I wish the game followed its own advice and made me jump in my seat, instead of making me lean forward in my seat to turn it off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-mulana-remake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3407829">Expand</a></span>

I have to say that I stopped playing the game before discovering that the tutorial for the game is actually available in the form of a steam store video. If that tutorial had been displayed before the game instead of via a totally unrelated channel, it might have changed my experience drastically. But it wasn&apos;t the case. Now I don&apos;t want to play it, I just regret having bought it.

Argumentan que es algo anticuado, pero eso es absolutamente irrelevante. Para evaluar un juego hay que observar lo que ofrece, no las modas que hay en el medio. La forma de saltar funciona en este juego simplemente porque los desarrolladores saben aprovechara. El salto permite un combate m&#xE1;s complejo e interesante, as&#xED; como a&#xF1;ade dificultad a la exploraci&#xF3;n. Se supone que en La mulana eres un explorador en unas ruinas hostiles... Desde luego debes tener cuidado hacia donde te vas a dirigir y hacia d&#xF3;nde vas a saltar de modo que la inercia del salto cumple su cometido: te obliga a pensar dos veces antes de realizar una acci&#xF3;n porque no es posible cambiar la direcci&#xF3;n en medio del salto (como en la vida real). No todo tiene que ser igual a Mario Bros, gente.
<br>Por otro lado los puzzles son muy dif&#xED;ciles, claro. Quiz&#xE1;s demasiado. Pero es esa la virtud del juego. Si quieres un reto (uno de verdad, uno donde literalmente no cualquiera pueda triunfar), pocos juegos conozco en el &#xE1;mbito de puzzles como La Mulana. As&#xED; que si quieres un juego de pseudo-exploraci&#xF3;n donde en realidad no hay nada qu&#xE9; explorar pues todo est&#xE1; servido en bandeja de plata esperando a que alguien resuelva acertijos sencillos (como The Witcher 3), La Mulana no es para ti. Adem&#xE1;s, existen gu&#xED;as por doquier, yo aconsejo seguir una gu&#xED;a de vez en cuando antes de abandonar al juego definitivamente. Pues incluso es fascinante leer c&#xF3;mo se resolv&#xED;a tal puzzle luego de haberlo pensado t&#xFA;.
<br>El resto del juego, la m&#xFA;sica, la historia, los gr&#xE1;ficos, etc, cumplen sobradamente bien (la m&#xFA;sica es incre&#xED;ble). Es una pena  que lo que es para m&#xED; uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado tenga un score tan pobre por personas que al parecer no saben ni siquiera de qu&#xE9; va el juego.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/la-mulana-remake/user-reviews?user_review_id=6227680">Expand</a></span>
