<br>
<br>The gameplay is quite different to other games in the genre, mostly due to the fact you can jump, roll and even wall jump which allows for exploration and unique ways to traverse dungeons. The skill system is similar to Guild Wars 2 where you&apos;re given 3 unique abilities based on the weapon you&apos;re using, and you can switch between 2 different weapons freely giving you access to 6 weapon abilities total. On top of this you&apos;re also given 2 demon powers which are strong abilities that charge during combat. Finally you&apos;re given 2 consumable slots which can be used for potions, bombs, medi kits and buffs.
<br>
<br>Character customisation comes in the way of cards, you&apos;re given a certain amount of card slots and card points, similar to the Call of Duty loadout system. These cards allow you to build how you&apos;d like by adding passives to your character, you can opt for a couple of high point cards or many low point cards depending on your needs. It&apos;s not the most deep system but it does the job.
<br>
<br>Where the game really excels is presentation, it looks, runs and sounds great. I was very impressed with just how polished the game actually is. I enjoyed the art style and the overall visuals were beautiful with some fantastic little cut scenes thrown in throughout the story. Speaking of the story, it was interesting and fully voiced, and voiced well. You may recognise the voice actor for Victor Vran as he also voiced Geralt in Witcher III. The game also performs really well, I spent the entire 15 hour playthrough at 60fps locked on ultra settings, I will say one thing though, the in-game VSync is not recommended as it uses double buffering, so any tiny dip in frame rate causes the FPS to half down to 30fps. You can fix this 100% by disabling VSync in-game and forcing it on in your GPU control panel, I personally used adaptive VSync with triple buffering and my experience was rock solid.
<br>
<br>I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the game on the whole, it&apos;s definitely worth it even at full price, and especially so at &#xA3;5 in the sale. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victor-vran/user-reviews?user_review_id=6143197">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game also has quite a bit going for it in the area of customization. There&apos;s a lot of cards/powers/weapons to mix and match to figure out the most effective play style. Often an area will demand you totally change up your play style to achieve the goals within. Through out an entire play through I never stuck with one build or weapon for long. It keeps things interesting and avoids the typical feeling of grinding one build for hours on end. If you want to clear the harder challenges, there&apos;s an obsessive level of planning involved.
<br>
<br>The challenge system is great. It puts your focus a lot less on loot, and more on succeeding through game play, which is a bit more satisfying than waiting for the RNG to give you what you want.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victor-vran/user-reviews?user_review_id=6907862">Expand</a></span>

Four-player coop and a detailed challenge system are welcome additions. Worth a purchase at 66% off or more.
<br>Total size on my hard-drive: 4.3 GB
<br>
<br>+ Large level design. While there are a few smaller levels that house challenge bosses, most are large and spacious, with secrets hidden everywhere. One of the best features of Victor Vran.
<br>+ Good level of challenge. New areas are difficult, and after leveling and becoming OP, activate different hexes (Hex of Pain reduces Victor Vran&#x2019;s health over time, Hex of Time speeds enemies, and so on) for additional challenge and greater rewards.
<br>+ Nice graphics. Won&#x2019;t knock your socks off, but the level of detail (especially in the city levels) is excellent.
<br>+ Smooth and stable. Not a single crash or hang in 24 hours of gameplay.
<br>+ Good choice of weapons. Shotguns, lightning guns, swords, rapiers, scythes, hammers, spell books. Each type of weapon can be found with a large number of different specializations &#x2013; which bring their own buffs and debuffs.
<br>+ The card-based skills system. Victor can equip of number of cards for passive combat bonuses. There are over a dozen varieties, and again each can be had in a number specializations. One of my favorites was &#x201C;The Moon&#x201D; card, which, when equipped, grants an ice-explosion when Victor lands a critical hit. Another good one is the &#x201C;Blademaster&#x201D; card, which adds over-drive at a faster rate and grants health-regen on crit with swords. Each card is available in a number of levels as well; Levels 1 through 4 were most common, but I did loot a Level 8 card (yes, the bonuses were massive!). There is limited number of points available to equip cards, though, and each level counts as a point; equipping four Level 4 cards isn&#x2019;t possible when the point limit is less than 16 (the point limit increases as Victor levels up), forcing a continual mix-and-match of available cards in search of the best build.
<br>+ Nicely ambient soundtrack.
<br>+ Four-player coop. Drop-in / drop-out works well. The large levels work well with four players.
<br>+ You can trade items with a demon named Geban. 10/10 would trade with Geban again.
<br>
<br>+/- Demon powers. Their usefulness is limited because their use requires over-drive. It can take a while for the over-drive bar to fill in the early stages. Certain weapons and cards can boost the charge rate, making them more useful. Then there are other cards that provide bonuses only if the over-drive bar is full &#x2013; rendering demon powers useless, because emptying the over-drive bar by using a demon power would deactivate the bonus.
<br>+/- Bosses are nicely placed and paced, but don&#x2019;t require any special tactics to defeat.
<br>+/- Someone made a pact with a demon and now the kingdom has to pay when the demons come to collect on the debt. There. That&#x2019;s the story.
<br>+/-  Victor Vran is voiced by the same actor who provides the English-language voice of Geralt in the Witcher games (Doug Cockle). Victor is a near carbon-copy of Geralt. I&#x2019;m not sure if Cockle was told to do this, or if this is the limit of his skills as a voice actor. Other voice actors are good, but not special.
<br>+/- Too much loot. There are several different ways to sort it, but even for a loot-based game, there is a ton of loot. There is no limit on inventory space, though, so the primary issue is managing it.
<br>+/- + Leveling gear. Most things can be leveled using Transmutation in the hub. The outcome is completely RNG, though (unlike in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel where using Moonstone in the weapon grinder would guarantee an increase in rarity. Nothing like that here).
<br>
<br>- Some area challenges are impossible to complete unless massively over-leveled or playing online with other players. The online mode had about a dozen players active in it every time I started the game, so not an impossible task.
<br>- Some level challenges are mutually exclusive, meaning you are expected to re-play levels.
<br>- Some grinding for better gear required if soloing. No worse than in Borderlands, but expect it.
<br>- Armor is tied to outfits, which are only awarded via chests and level-up bonuses. That means the best plan is to kill the enemies fast and have a good stock of potions on hand. Worry about armor later. There are passive bonuses which can help.
<br>
<br>Overall, the looting, combat and level design are the most attractive features of Victor Vran, but unless grinding and completing challenges for loot is why you play games (not that there&#x2019;s anything wrong with either!), you could get bored with it quickly. A good effort by developer Haemimont with franchise potential. Hopefully, future installments will showcase refinements of some great core systems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victor-vran/user-reviews?user_review_id=7038620">Expand</a></span>

<br>Victor Vran is basically a Diablo clone, and a good one at that. The skill/weapon system is good and quite interesting as the is outfit system, the maps are fun, well designed and thankfully not too big, so you&apos;re not stuck in a giant map for too long, the actual gameplay is very enjoyable and the graphics are quite nice, clean and very readable (which is something that often lacks in this sort of games). The map system is great and lets you skip useless and unwanted backtracking.
<br>
<br>A really good game, but it does have flaws:
<br>Worst issue, by far: The controls are clearly designed for a gamepad, and using a mouse and keyboard is quite often bugged and VERY unresponsive; there are issues with jumping directions, sometimes the character just stops and sometimes goes where isn&apos;t supposed to go, making you die or unnecessary lose health. The pathing with a mouse is quite bad. This is extremely frustrating especially in some long boss fights. Not fun when your character doesn&apos;t respond to your imput and instead of moving off the attack it jumps right in or keep attacking. Very annoying and it costs the game a few score points.
<br>Another flaw, yet minor, is the framerate that sometimes just go down to 20-30 fps without any reason, when it&apos;s usually on a stable 60fps. That shouldn&apos;t happen, the graphics, as nice as they are, aren&apos;t very complicated and taxing and the FPS shouldn&apos;t drop so low on a i7 and GTX970 build.
<br>Another issue is the crafting. It&apos;s quite bad and not thoroughly thought: you combine items, weapon and cards in an attempt to improve them. Too bad it&apos;s extremely confusing and forces you to clutter your inventory with tons of stuff, making very hard to discern what you should equip and what it&apos;s an improvement over your current gear. This is especially true for the cards and their various effects.
<br>It&apos;s also a bit of lacking in the variety of monsters.
<br>All in all, a very nice game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victor-vran/user-reviews?user_review_id=5411600">Expand</a></span>

Filled with atmospheric and beautiful music, exploration and secret areas, stylish detailed graphics. Control with mouse and keys is pretty normal for PC and you also have the capability to jump to higher (sometimes secret) areas and roll to avoid enemies. Plenty of bad guys to kill (but not too many as in previous failed arpgs) and good control over your actions, give a nice game experience. Weapons are of specific type (so far discovered 4) which use certain different types of attack (area,single,etc). There is not an enemy respawn system for every area, for which I am grateful (they do respawn but in smaller areas which you can try again and again for certain achievements-bonuses). Spells and bonus passive cards, enrich your character. All in all,a very satisfying game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victor-vran/user-reviews?user_review_id=5426316">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are many clever secrets that hit the right spot of being &quot;fun to find&quot;, but not &quot;too tedious to find&quot;.
<br>
<br>In terms of humor: it&apos;s hit-or-miss, but at least there&apos;s a lot of it. There is a soldier called Stash. Private Stash. He manages your... private... stash. So yeah, lots of dadjokes. If you like that sort of thing, you&apos;ll have a great time.
<br>
<br>The story could&apos;ve had a bit more to it, but I suppose the money runs out quickly when you hire Geralt of Rivia to voice the main character :) It still has its moments, but this is more of a gameplay-driven experience.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve spent 10 hours on the game so far, and I plan to 100% complete it. Given that it costs much less than $50, most of the criticism can simply be ignored.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victor-vran/user-reviews?user_review_id=5392591">Expand</a></span>

<br>This action RPG is a little different form the rest. For example, the armor is tweakable: there are only a couple different armors and you don&apos;t really upgrade of loot them (well, sortof). The armor doesn&apos;t work like conventional armor, but it gives you a different effect of your Power. Weapons are also not really jupgradable, but you find/buy different weapons. These weapons are divided into classes (rapier, sword, shotgun etc) of which each class has 3 skills to use, which are sometimes very fun and can combo extremely well if executed properly. E.g. rapier dash-ability followed up with a bleeding strike to kill a minion to reset your ability-counters, so you can do the dash again.
<br>You can also switch between two weapons during combat, which makes the game a lot more divers.
<br>
<br>Combat is solid, skills are fun and leveling is done with destiny-cards, which basicaly give you some bonuses or passive abilities (like more health or an AoE strike when you do a critical hit. Everything feels rocksolid.
<br>
<br>Downside is the sloppy mouse-control. Many times the attacks just go into a different direction than anticipated, kinda killing your momentum in combat. Also, the character building isn&apos;t superb, but that&apos;s not really a huge issue.
<br>
<br>Again, the best thing about this game is the price for the quality. When Ubisoft would have released this, the quality would be worse and the proce would be higher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victor-vran/user-reviews?user_review_id=5394111">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s been years since we&apos;ve gotten a decent isometric ARPG and this one really hits the spot.
<br>
<br>TLDR: A must buy game.
<br>
<br>I have played Diablos 1 through 3, Torchlight 1 and 2, Path of Exile, Marvel Heroes and Divinity... Having said that, I think Victor Vran has reached peak perfection on the ARPG genre. This is the game you should not think twice of picking up. I was hesistant at first since I wasn&apos;t an early access buyer and just decided to buy the game based on all of the good reviews on Steam (and youtube gameplay videos). I bought one for myself and for my brother and we have never looked back.
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>- Very fluid gameplay and great graphics. Keeping things fascinating is the ability to jump, and dodge, and so on
<br>- Can downscale graphics to be playable on low-end desktops/laptops
<br>- Decent story with great voice acting (much much much better story than Diablo 3/Torchlight 2)
<br>- A bit steampunk (enough to please fans of the genre, but not too much to turn off non-fans of steampunk).
<br>- The setting and ambiance of the story and game - old eastern European &quot;Transylvannia&quot; - is very much on point
<br>- You can change your difficulty almost on the fly with hexes - plus the difficulty setting is so innovatively done (again, not like D3 where higher difficulty settings just give more health, toughness and power to mobs)
<br>- The outfit you wear essentially determines majority of your playstyle. However, the system is easy to understand but at the same time is intricate and deep. No skill trees here - but how they implemented choice is wonderfully done. Your outfit, weapons, demon powers, and destiny cards determine your &quot;class&quot;, and there are possibly a billion combination of these
<br>- A lot of people seemingly hate &quot;The Voice&quot; character but I love him. A lot of el-oh-el references and funny quips abound
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>- still some bugs that need to be ironed out. Some champion mobs don&apos;t reset from rage mode when you die even though their hitpoints goes back to full. Also there are areas where when you make the mistake of stepping on them the whole screen freezes (but the UI is still active, strangely). happens rarely though.
<br>- online coop mode works but can be confusing. It turns out that you can only be friends in-game with folk you are Steam friends with. Also, the UI needs to be worked on to show you if you are already in a party or night as there is no confirmation if you want to join a friend&apos;s party when he/she invites you. The game should immediately port you to your friends&apos; instance when you join
<br>
<br>MINOR GRIPES:
<br>- no playable female characters (which doesn&apos;t matter to me as I&apos;m a guy and I like playing guy characters but putting it here for gender equality - they should make an Irene costume or skin)
<br>- should have a costume/skin system
<br>- more addicting than crack :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victor-vran/user-reviews?user_review_id=5394838">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s like the devs didn&apos;t even bother to playtest this thing.
<br>
<br>The loot is junk. It is rare to find anything useful. The &quot;crafting&quot; system is a checkbox for the game with no actual logic or perhaps behind it.  The devs tried to throw lots of different stuff into the game and none of it is really well thought out resulting in lots of gear that really don&apos;t amount to much.
<br>
<br>The challenges are meaningless. They all boil down to either running through an area as fast as you can or defeating an area without using any abilities. This pretty much forces you to play a certain way and makes your ability/gear selection meaningless.
<br>
<br>This game is a drag and drop RPG where too much was stuffed into the game without any real thought as to how it should work. It needs a serious amount of pruning, updating and overall balancing. Cannot possibly recommend this to anybody.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victor-vran/user-reviews?user_review_id=6539081">Expand</a></span>

It has a lot of different mechanics like targetable spells/attacks and jumping, to the point where it feels almost like a platformer at times (like when you&apos;re trying to get to a secret part of level). It also has a fully rotatable camera angle, which is generally nice.
<br>
<br>The graphics are great for a $20 game. Sure the dialogue and cut scenes are obviously very low budget, there is no lengthy 3D CGI cinematics... but I certainly don&apos;t play this kind of game for cinematics at all. Mostly this is just a straight ahead action RPG that is an absolute blast to play.
<br>
<br>It is a classic time sink. Each level has a lot of objectives that can take quite a while to accomplish, but they&apos;re optional and you can just plow through the game in a few evenings if that&apos;s your style.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed this a lot. It&apos;s cheap, it runs on modest hardware, I&apos;m glad I gave it a chance despite the lack of buzz.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victor-vran/user-reviews?user_review_id=5439121">Expand</a></span>

<br>You care less on the loots, RNG and builds on the beginning unlike the other games.

<br>Also, Co-op supports 4 players which is kind of fun when you have a bunch of friends to enjoy together.
