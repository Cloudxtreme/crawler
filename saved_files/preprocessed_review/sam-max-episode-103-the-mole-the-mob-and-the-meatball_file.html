It may be slightly short with somewhat simpler puzzles, but it makes up for it all very well with the golden shiny humor it radiates. Buying this has a higher priority than bying food for your children.</span>

You can see the effort, and you can feel the giddiness behind the stuff. They are fans of the stuff and they are not ashamed to show it, you just know it. But still. There&apos;s an aftertaste. There&apos;s the lingering feeling after you finish each chapter that it could&apos;ve been much more. More so if you&apos;ve played the original 1993 game, &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot;. In these new games, or episodes as they were, you always get the feeling everything is a wee-bit forced: The quips are not quite Purcell&apos;s characteristic wit. The contrived-metaphor-spewing-fedora-wearing-Desoto-driving-anthropomorphic-dog, Sam, and even the lovable hyper kinetic lagomorph, Max, feel somewhat diluted from their original essence. And the puzzles, those fun hurdles that make any adventure game worth playing, almost seem condescending, as if they were pandering to a playing crowd that has never interacted with a Guybrush or a Laffer before. Nonetheless, it would be terribly unfair of me to chastise this game and not highlight the several positive attributes it has. After all, much of my criticism comes from my love of the characters, and maybe, even, from a bit of nostalgia of the golden adventure gaming days. A new audience, free of any concepts of the adventure genre or the Sam &amp; Max franchise, will certainly find a great, albeit simple, game. The humour is still fantastic, with very memorable situations and, as always, bizarre scenarios to explore. And, when you get down to it, it really works great as an introduction not only of the anthropomorphic duo, but, also, of adventure gaming to a new generation. So, basically: Yeah. It&apos;s a flawed series of games, and, yeah, there is the pungent feeling they are trying in strides not to be overshadowed by the original, classic, 1993 game. But it&apos;s also a really approachable game for anyone, fan of the genre or not, and considering the fact that it&apos;s episodic, at least we get a lot more to experience, and Telltale gets a lot more time to tool around with the game and regale us with brand new adventures. And, hey. After it&apos;s all said and done. And at the end of the day? It&apos;s still is a Sam &amp; Max game. And that&apos;s always a girlish &quot;tee-hee!&quot; in my book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sam-max-episode-103-the-mole-the-mob-and-the-meatball/user-reviews?user_review_id=702067">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Probably the worst of the first three episode. It took under two hours to play without checking anything from walkthrough (and I usually suck at adventure games). Also this episode doesn&apos;t shine on story department quite like the episode 102 did. So basically you get less of everything. Still enjoyed it and would recommend it.</span>
