I was expecting a cheap God of War Clone, but it&apos;s far better than that.  For one thing the Horseman War is far more interesting a character than Kratos, whose one-note vengeance act is wearing pretty thin.  Great atmosphere, fun combat, very creative puzzles, and some of the best creature design ever.  It&apos;s a long game with tons of bosses, and they&apos;re all awesome looking.  New elements are constantly introduced to keep it fresh--grappling hook, horseback combat, and even some Portal dynamics near the end.  The biggest criticism is that Darksiders doesn&apos;t do anything new, but combining all these great elements from other games so successfully IS something new.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1382904">Expand</a></span>

The story is cheesy - i mean, come on - Angels Fighting Demons!  Man!  Who&apos;s God then?..  Anyway, the graphics are good, but you are stock in a narrow point of view mode which you cannot change.  There is no leveling up system - but your weapons do level up and increase in damage with time (depending on kills).  The store (where you can buy stuff for souls) actually sucks asc - some character customization would be much more welcome (let&apos;s say a green-glowing scythe), than a combo move (you can actually kill anything without combos)!
<br>Overall, a 7/10 game.  Killed a few hours with it.  Switching to Fallout: New Vegas!!!!  ):D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2538934">Expand</a></span>

It is rare for a game to do something like this because of something called &quot;story&quot; which is something a lot of people tend to not care about anymore these days.  For those of you who don&apos;t know and have been missing out, story is this fascinating thing that makes games more than just fun, but entertaining and involving. While playing the game I felt myself driven to keep going not only because the combat was exciting and enjoyable to watch (which it was) and not to just unlock all the items and powers (which are all fun in their own right) but because I wanted to know what happens to War!  Its brilliant, and more games need it.  In my opinion even games that are poorly executed should have one of these two features:  A unique and interesting story that makes you WANT to know what happens next, just like a good book.  And if it doesn&apos;t have that then it should allow you to make that story for yourself.  And Darksiders does that first one to a well polished shine.  As far as gameplay goes that&apos;s really where the score of 8 is coming from.  Its fun and wonderful to watch but button mashing is really all you need followed by a good dodge every now and then, puzzles are well and good but we&apos;ve all seen puzzles before.  However what isn&apos;t really a strong argument is the keymapping.  Which yes DEFAULT keymapping is awkward, but surprise guys, you have the power to change all that which I did, and I was able to set it up to where it wasn&apos;t awkward anymore; amazing how the ability to change the keymapping can fix crappy key configurations.  You&apos;ll get your money&apos;s worth and more, pick it up and enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2183698">Expand</a></span>

And honestly, you SHOULD own a controller if you&apos;re always complaining about console ports. That would probably solve your gripes right from the start. Now, as far as the actual GAME goes, I find it fantastic. This is DMC meets Zelda, and it satisfies both styles very well. I would recommend this one to any fan of action RPGs with a sweet story, awesomely detailed characters and interesting personalities, as well as graphics that execute the comic book style pretty much perfectly. Again, this is a must on a controller, and only a controller!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2461008">Expand</a></span>

So much blood &amp; gore hack n&apos; slash fun with Steam achievements! Each boss offers a unique character and provides an impressive battle. A game controller is highly recommended to play this console port. There are two levels that are really lengthy puzzle environments which can cause frustration to the point of not wanting to continue playing. One comes very early at the Cathedral. All I have to say is stick with it. By no means is this game easy, but the experience is well worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1725600">Expand</a></span>

At first It seemed epic action game with the only flaw being it&apos;s graphics but I got over it and I was still thinking it&apos;s an awesome game. After some time (the bat-dragon-like-thing boss) I started to get irritated. Puzzles in this game are too hard, and maps are horribily designed (they look like remaked maps from 2D platformers, most of them at least). I managed to get stuck too many times or died because of the not very responsive controls.  I never finished this game, but I think it&apos;s worth it if you can get over the map design, the irritating puzzles and the average controls. The audio was nothing special. The story seemed a bit stupid, but I liked it after all. I recommend it if you want some fast impressive action on your screen and you have nothing better than 7/10 .

Darksiders is a small gem! It struck me for great combat mechanics, very unique setting and atmosphere, as well as the creature design. The gameplay is fun, very diversified and compelling. The music is as epic as it should be. The bosses&apos; difficulty is high and engaging. It&apos;s a very good title, made to resemble some AAA titles on the market and yet unique! The only glitch I found is that the engine is not very well optimised for PC: graphics glitches and FPS drops are a common nuisance. Also I&apos;m not quite sure that is has a replayability that could make Darksiders enter the gaming hall of fame.  For these reasons, I give it 9 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2318085">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It would be a shame of the game industry to let the franchise rot now THQ is gone.</span>

                                        <span>That game is amazing. They basically copied Zelda games (i really mean it, it&apos;s impossible to play without thinking of Zelda) then added a devil may cry combat style, more RPG elements and better storytelling. My only point against this game is its short length (approximately 20h for me)</span>

In fact in the first level or so there is nothing more to it, but after that the game really picks up and gets interesting. I was mostly drawn in by its great setting that takes place in a post-Armageddon world where both angels and demons deem you as an enemy. The art style and the environments were really beautiful as well, what enhanced the atmosphere. After you&apos;ve gotten past the first level, that&apos;s when your character starts to learn new moves, making combat very fun and engaging. In addition you get some new weapons as well, like the Scythe, for more crowd control, and also a Tremor Gauntlet, if you fancy power punching. Among all the combat, the boss fights especially stood out for me. Each and every boss fight was both challenging and enjoyable at the same time and this is perhaps the game&apos;s biggest strength in my opinion. The cool cutscenes and the special kills were an icing on the cake. Although there are so many good things about this game and although I&apos;ve given it a 9, I also have several criticisms. First of all, the game is not exactly a very good console port. The keyboard and mouse control scheme was more or less playable, but it&apos;s the fact that you couldn&apos;t change graphics options apart from resolution. Of course this isn&apos;t much of a problem for someone with a powerful PC, but for those of us with average machines, even on low resolution there is a noticeable drop in framerate in some areas of the game, making it quite stuttery. Another thing that I disliked - some areas were just a bit too long, like the Hollows and the Ashlands. Not sure whose bright idea it was that the sewers and the desert are good candidates for lengthy levels, since those usually tend to be amongst the most boring of the environments in any game. The Black Throne level was perhaps the biggest offender. Although it was a very beautiful level with some cool battles, it had way too much backtracking and also made you do the same thing 3 times! And my last criticism would be towards the puzzles. Although there were some great puzzles in the game, some others were really annoying. They weren&apos;t hard or anything. You could figure out most of them right away. It&apos;s just that to execute those solutions usually took too long, requiring too much running and jumping about, as well as tonnes of trial and error, and hence that was breaking the pace of the game. All those criticisms are quite strong for me and I guess if I wasn&apos;t so charmed by the game&apos;s setting and art style, I probably would&apos;ve given it an 8 rather than a 9. Overall the game is highly entertaining and worth checking out. Going to be trying out the second one no doubt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2696851">Expand</a></span>

Controls are good, rarely I had problems with it. Graphic is still good and if someone downvotes game purely based on slightly out-dated graphic... The story is truly epic, I like characters, finally game with some memorable ones. Voice-acting is done very well. Combat is fun, fluid and can be quite complex if you want to. The game is relatively long (took me around 12-15 hours to finish it on the highest difficulty) but it wasn&apos;t boring, it was still pushing the story forward. I highly recommend this game to God of War, Devil May Cry or maybe Prince of Persia fans. This game is often on -75% sale and for that price it is a steal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2555280">Expand</a></span>

Combat is a mix of Space Marine and God of War, which certainly is not a bad thing. Fluent combat is what makes this game shine, and when different weapons and different combos are mixed together into a single flurry of attacks, the game is incredibly enjoyable. However, the only downside is that it is easy to forget the amount of combos available to the player, and many will keep pressing &apos;Attack&apos; rapidly, forgetting about the possibility of combos and just slashing their way to victory, pulling the game&apos;s score down to 9 instead of 10. If the game encouraged you to mix combos to create a greater variety of attacks, this game would easily receive a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2966111">Expand</a></span>

I see many complain about the controls, I finished it twice with an xbox controller and it&apos;s flawless... maybe some games are just meant for a gamepad. Otherwise, though, there is only one bug that I (and apparently the community) know of. I give it a 9 only for the grief it gave people w/o gamepads</span>

<br>
<br>The story is cool, music too (they give you the soundtrack when you bought the game FINALLY a company who really think buying a game = buying the soundtrack too). Combat can be sometime repetitive and sometime you see they made the game longer with annoying things like=OH there is a door to open but 3 locks. To open one lock, you have to play for like 30-45 min.
<br>
<br>Anyway if you see this game on steam sales and you were thinking about buying it before. GET IT.

On the mouse and keyboard option for pc is feeling all right but its still recomended to play with a controller. I suggest everyone to buy this game!</span>

The game has very nice, varied fairy-tale graphics and nice soundtrack. An interesting character leveling. I think this game is one of the best slashers on the market.

While not bringing anything particularly new to the table, what Darksiders does, bring is well polished and simple hack and slash fun at its finest. Sadly alot of the equipment is torn straight from other games and almost no effort is made to hide it, as if its slapping them in the face and saying &quot;look at me I can do it better, with a bigger sword&quot;. Any way the core of this game is the combat and with the range of weapons and moves, the combos that you can pull off are extensive and enjoyable. The other side which the game is the puzzles and adventure aspect. Where it doesnt hold up quite as well as the combat, its still enjoyable and some of the later puzzles will get you thinking. Graphically the game is quite impressive, however the limited enemy roster with repainted skins can get irritating. Overall the game is a solid 3rd person action adventure which will appeal to most of the genres fans and will give you a good 20 hours of gameplay, especially on the harder difficulty setting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1389728">Expand</a></span>

I find it to be more Devil May Cry.  The story is very well done.  It has interesting characters and background.  The combat system doesn&apos;t have to be complex but it can be.  The LoZ aspects of the game are quite nice.  Finding new items and using them to gain access to areas is interesting to say the lest.  I encountered no glitches which surprises me since it is a port after all.  Aside from it crashing from time to time, which I think has been fixed in a patch for it has not happened for awhile.  My one major complaint is that the bosses need to be harder.  I found the bosses to be lacking somewhat.  Except with the exception of the bosses where you rode on horseback, that was just fun as ****  Graphics are not phenomenal, but they don&apos;t suck either.  The controls, hell I have to say I&apos;m impressed.  I expected to have to use my gamepad for it.  Vigil actually makes me eat my words when saying that mouse and keyboard can&apos;t be used with hack and slash games (I played DMC4 on my pc, its a pain in the ass on M&amp;K).  My one grip with the controls is using spells.  You have to hold Caps lock then press a number.  You don&apos;t have any controls over the graphics either, just screen resolution.  So make sure your comp can run it before you buy it.<br><br>All in all if anything give this game a play through for the story at least.  If there is one thing anyone can agree on is that Vigil created one fantastic story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1382929">Expand</a></span>

I see some of you comparing it to this or that, or parts of this or parts of that, to tell you the truth it&apos;s all actually quite new to me. The other part is I hear some of you complaining about the graphics, and that there are no graphics options, actually I appreciate that they did that for me beforehand, because it helped me get to the game ASAP, as opposed to me worrying about the frame rate and pushing the polygons and/or if it runs on my pc or not, you know  all that extra shebang that comes with most PC games. Once I got to the core game play of this game, all my worries about graphics went completely down the drain, in fact I lowered my resolution to 1280x720 to make that gameplay smoother, and hooked up my wireless xbox360 controller to my PC ( also I hooked up my pc to my HDTV!). So I firmly believe that in this game gameplay is far more important than graphics.<br><br>As for the gameplay, you may need to hit up the IGN guides to find your way through some of the puzzles that are not right of the bat obvious, and for the location of vital items that you can&apos;t miss. But, in my opinion, I would recommend this game most of the time, than not. so there we go, make your choice = )</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1478318">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s been a while since I enjoyed such game that much. I spent over 22 hours playing it and most of this time was pure pleasure. I even took my time to hunt down all the secret chests and artifacts.    What&apos;s best is that the game introduces new gameplay elements all the time and so avoids getting repetitive. There&apos;s quite a lot of puzzles, most of them quite interesting, well designed and varied. There was only one or two that bordered on annoying. And while overall the puzzling elements are balanced quite well, I fell like the developers overdid it a bit in Black Throne levels. The pace there slowed down too much, and the puzzles started to be tiring at the end.<br><br>And while Black Throne is the low point of the game, the Ashlands section where you get your hands on the rocket launcher like weapon is just so much fun that you don&apos;t want it to end. Pure, mindless fun and orgy of destruction.<br><br>Technically, the game is not a masterpiece. However, it makes up for it with great art direction and design. I believe that in few years time, it will still be able to appeal visually to gamers. Character designs are fantastic, levels are varied and well designed. Each has it&apos;s own unique look and feel. The beasts you will slain look great, and there&apos;s plenty of bosses to kill. And War finishes the beasts in great style, resulting in tons of blood. Luckily, there&apos;s no quick time events except for using the &apos;finishing move&apos; button.<br><br>The other aspect that deserves a mention is the music. The soundtrack for Darksiders is the best game soundtrack I have heard so far. It beats all three God Of War soundtracks hands down. It&apos;s the only game music I ever listened to on it&apos;s own, and I don&apos;t normally listen to game or movie music. It&apos;s that good.<br><br>Now, the game is by all means not perfect. The Black Throne I already mentioned. Unfortunately, I experienced a few crashes, which was rather annoying. Fortunately, the checkpoints are plenty so I never had to repeat too much of the level because of this. And my brother had no such problems on his rig. The gamepad controls worked great, except for aiming. No matter how I set sensitivity, it always felt wrong. I eventually got used to it, but it still left a bad impression.<br><br>And the last gripe I have about the game is War. The main character. Looks great and it&apos;s a pleasure to watch as he deals with the beasts. But he has no character. You would at least expect he&apos;s a bad-ass. But he&apos;s not. He should be. The story is all about his vengeance and implies that he&apos;s a bad-ass. But it just does not feel like it. For most of the game, he feels like an errand boy. Only in the late part of the game, he starts to show a little bit of depth, but it&apos;s just too little too late.  The potential for this character is great, but I feel it was pretty much wasted. Too bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1460080">Expand</a></span>

That sounds like a lot, but when a Zelda game pushes 50+ its a little short. However, that should not deter you from playing, and if you are more meticulous than I am about finding all the items, then you can probably lengthen this out. One thing I was pleasantly surprised at was the differences in the areas of the game. Some areas are destroyed city, dark and dank, then others are green lush and bright and it really adds a sense of atmosphere and change. The combat is tight and responsive, and for me, never got old. It was always fun trying to execute different combos to take down enemies faster and cooler. Weapon upgrades are fun and useful, however the secondary and third weapons are really just slots to hold character upgrades. You will rarely need anything but your primary sword for combat. (I never leveled the Scythe or Fist to even the first level)<br><br>The puzzles are fun, if not a little on the easy side... that is until you get to the temple where you have to free the angel of death. That temple was challenging in a fun way and I wish that the other temples would have been more like that.<br><br>I highly recommend this game, and am hoping for the 3 sequels. I think they did a great job with this and it would be great to play as the other three horsemen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1540156">Expand</a></span>

The adventuring side of things remained challenging and satisfying throughout the game. The combat was enjoyable but I found it to be rather basic, once I found a few combos and upgraded my character/weapons I managed to finish the 2nd half of the game without dying at all (on normal setting). Although it is possible to race through the game in several hours, I spent a fair amount of time seeking out the various hidden objects and achievements. It&apos;s one of the few games I could see myself playing again.<br><br>One criticism of the PC version (at least via Steam) is that sometimes the game will not register achievements (annoying but not a deal breaker). I&apos;ve also read some complaints about playing this game with a PC gamepad or mouse/keyboard combo, but I had no such problems with the Xbox360 controller.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1463993">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t want to compare this game to God Of War, or even Mark of Kri, this game is much closer to Zelda-64 or something along those lines. There is lots of exploring, getting lose, solving puzzles, and hacking and slashing.<br><br>The Graphics are decent. They are stylized and fun. Granted, I wish I had the option to beef up the Anti-Aliasing, the over all feel is very stylish with a  lot of attention to little details.<br><br>The sound is decent as well. voice acting is great, Mark Hamel yet again proves to be one of the world&apos;s greatest voice actors. My only complaint is that the echoy effect is a bit over the top, kind of sounds like you are playing the game inside a metal box.<br><br>Controls suck. They make no sense and were not optimized in the porting process what so ever. They just took controller buttons and mapped it to abitrary keys. Switching between Reg/Aim/Focus modes is annoying, switching weapons is annoying. The only thing they got right with controls was combat, which works for the most part, though i don&apos;t know why the block and dash key are the same key.<br><br>Gameplay is where this game shines. There is tons of enemys, tons of enviroments, tons of puzzles, well to sum it up, tons of variety. The biggest problem with these Action/Adventure games always is becoming monotonous. Zelda always got right but games like Devil May Cry and God Of War turned into chores. Now the game isn&apos;t perfect, some areas last to long, some puzzles are tedious and just take unnecessary amounts of time (not thinking), but its mostly forgivable. My Biggest complaint is the lack of enemy health bars. Minions aren&apos;t that big of a deal, but things like Minibosses and Bosses become hard to strategize against since you have no idea how much health they have left, leaving you blindly slashing and hoping to kill them before you run out of health. tl;dr version. Highly stylish fun action/adventure game, with some minor, but forgivable, flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1555314">Expand</a></span>

The game is perfectly playable with a keyboard &amp; mouse although the Alt button for dodge feels unnatural at first. The first couple of hours are quite boring and repetitive but then the temples kick in and the game becomes fun. The overworld isn&apos;t very big, but the game encourages exploration for treasure chests. The game may be a bit to easy for hack and slash veterans on normal so you should start on &quot;Apocalyptic&quot; difficulty, if you are. The final dungeon may be considered a &quot;puzzle fest&quot; for some people. I enjoyed it but it may have annoyed some. The story has a twist and has a satisfying ending. I enjoyed this game. All of the reviewers who decided to discredit the game on its orginality didn&apos;t mention that the game managed to add something that hasn&apos;t been included in the portal series: the ability to shoot portals through portals.
<br>
<br>Recommended, especially at its current price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1557280">Expand</a></span>

The game play, storyline and graphics are great. The game is challenging and entertaining without being an arduous slog. The benchmark has been set, I only hope the sequel is up to the same standard.</span>

This game gives many people mixed opinions but I don&apos;t understand why! The graphics are amazing, the sound too, the story is alright and animations are spectacular! Let&apos;s start with story. One of the Four Horseman from the bible, War is called to Earth to help the end of the world go on but it turns out he was framed and doesn&apos;t know who sent the call of the Horsemen and War embarks on an epic journey to defeat the demon boss who was released to attack Earth in the first place. The story I didn&apos;t much care about, I&apos;d give it a C+ at best but the gameplay I enjoyed thoroughly with its puzzles and epic animations and, to my excitement, no quick time events! The creatures and bosses are very imaginative as the weapons are too which I own all of them yet I never used any but the default one, Chaoseater, because use of weapons levels them up and by level three I was super man with this sword! Overall I give it an eight because of the stories lack of true depth to me though it still holds up well enough with its collectibles and achievements (if you&apos;re on Steam).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1726499">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is fun - who cares about graphics if a game is fun...seriously go get an IQ above 100 and then try to make an intelligent comment. I&apos;ve played through once and one of my sons has twice - we both enjoyed the puzzles and fighting. If I wasn&apos;t trying to offset the very low scores I would probably give it a solid 8.5</span>

The first few bites are very delicious - the graphic, the hack-and-slash feeling, the sounds, all feel very nice. But, when you bite deeper you find out a squashed part - in order to master the game, you need to master its controls, and the controls are so numerous, and so poorly ported from console, that they incur a heavy strain on the average player.
<br>Then you bite even deeper - you encounter the first true boss, Tiamat- and you find a rotten part. There is nothing that prepares you for this boss, and the tactics, while very easy conceptually, are just very hard to implement properly. Moreover, if you fail to do proper tactics immediately, it becomes exponentially harder to finish this boss.
<br>Nevertheless, you decide to take one more bite, but you find worms crawling in the deep core of the game. The number of controls one needs to master to advance through the game increases by every &quot;level&quot;, and the inability to see the &quot;health&quot; of a boss, or in that sense any indicator that you are doing any damage to the boss, is extremely frustrating ! This is particularly frustrating on the worm boss, where you run in circles, shooting at the boss, for a random amount of time, until the boss falls dead ? This is an insult to any mature player in my opinion.
<br>Overall, this game had a lot of potential, maybe this potential is fulfilled in the console game, but the PC version is just frustrating to play...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2619578">Expand</a></span>

The most annoying one so far is having to constantly use ctrl and alt which is awkward with the wasd setup.  Other than that the game is pretty awesome. I love the story and the portrayal of the demons and angels from christianity, the graphics and scenery are very detailed, the use of different combos and secondary weapons and ranged weapons is intuitive, the puzzles are challenging but not overly difficult, the voice acting is good and the voices fit the characters well. You pretty much have to play the game twice if you want to get all of the content and hidden chests.  The boss battles aren&apos;t particularly hard because you gain more health bars quickly and are more about mechanics than brute force. The insta-kill moves get monotonous quickly but you don&apos;t have to use them to kill enemies every time. If you hate quick-time events fear not because this game doesn&apos;t have any.  Overall a solid game that I will be replaying at least once more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1698050">Expand</a></span>

That being said, the game is literally floating in a sea of blood, surrounded by leeches, being eating by bloodhounds, being massacred by torture machines from Saw movies. &quot;Gore&quot; or &quot;Bloody&quot; doesn&apos;t cut it. The combat is exciting to watch - due to the massive amounts of blood, especially - and the graphics are great, though not customizable to any extent. The boss fights are entertaining. The voice acting isn&apos;t a marvel, but it does the job without sounding crappy, fake, or poorly scripted. All in all, it isn&apos;t really worth 40 bucks, but definitely worth it if you can get it on sale, and if you have money to spare perhaps you can drop the full price for it. If you could enjoy, say, God of War, but without the storyline, characters, or great voice acting, then you could probably enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=1562774">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, i don&apos;t think its a bad game. In fact i think its pretty decent but not what i expected.
<br>Maybe i&apos;ll find Darksiders 2 more appealing.</span>

On the flip-side, this also means people with past generation cards will be able to play this at decent FPS. Most of the puzzles are moderately interesting, but some are tedious to the point that I just decide to switch the game off, fights are actually pretty good if not for the awful controls. I personally don&apos;t recommend this to most people, especially the casual gamers like myself that only got a couple of precious hours a day.

I can&apos;t believe games like this thrive on consoles with their bad dialogue, laughable voiceovers, weak stories, and average gameplay.  Combat is extremely repetitive an environments while open and nicely designed there is a serious lack of foes to fight that make the oversimplified combat mechanics unnecessary. The worst part of this game is rewarding the players for smashing junk.  Since &quot;souls&quot; = currency with which to buy upgrades and weapons to achieve the better equipment one is almost required to smash every little object out there.  And since when does a derelict automobile have a soul to gather anyway?<br><br>This game also tries to mimic the overall game-play of the Soul Reaver series and at that it fails miserably.  The game is by no means terrible.

The progression of acquiring items to unlock new zones is exactly like in Zelda. Finally, the boss battles are epic and diverse, but I feel like some of them were too difficult- I had a very hard time with the first battle and the last battle relies on Quicktime events that were difficult to execute on my computer (I had to tap the action button at a specific rate to win, and you have to do this three times- mashing the button didn&apos;t work, and it took me over a dozen tries to find the rhythm the first time, and then I had to replicate the same rhythm two more times, which was was far more difficult than it should have been). Overall, I recommend the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=2756701">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Darksiders has a...&quot;different&quot; story. The gameplay brings nothing new. It&apos;s just a fairly good execution of things that games like Devil May Cry, God of War and Prince of Persia (PS2 era) presented us in the past. But the story makes up for that. Well, at least if you are into apocalyptic stories and like a badass main charcater with a lot of moral fiber.
<br>
<br>This is not a bad game. I enjoyed very much and if you like the genre, I promisse you, you WILL like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=3665924">Expand</a></span>

<br>The default key set of this one is a bit inconvenient for keyboard playing,so I needed to remap the keys.
<br>I am going through the story firstly in the apocalyptic difficulty and feel that the pace of the game is mostly quick and intensive and this means its &quot;enter aiming mode,aim down,shoot,quit aiming mode&quot; maneuver is annoying and destructive to the fluency,though players need to execute this &quot;combo&quot; quite often.
<br>Sometimes hints are not obvious enough for new players like me,for that I got a little confused with the complicated set of skills and enhancement.
<br>Rotating map is common among many action games but impractical at all compared with the mini maps in Blizzard&apos;s WOW.
<br>After completing all of the elements of the game,I should say that it is a masterpiece which is of the same level of those more famous games,like Diablo,Warcraft,Biohazard franchises.Though I don&apos;t think the traditional RPG parts of Darksiders 2 is interesting enough,but boring,I hope that Nordic Games treasure,develop this beautiful story and let more people try,taste it with more fascinating,clean Darksiders games.
<br>A bad glitch showed up:toggling among the game and other program while I was playing it may cause the achievement tracking/counting system/function no longer effective,which disturbed some of the achievements completion and urged me to have some parts replayed.
<br>Another glitch,the cloud save of this game is a vanity,maybe still is.
<br>A suggestion,a roaming mode after the end of the main story,having the game divided into parts of levels and bosses,and allowing replaying the story with all the collectibles completed,which would be convenient for players to patch up the missed achievements and enjoy beating the game cleanly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=4091192">Expand</a></span>

Ideally you would like to see yourself, the enemy and where you are going, most of the times you get two out of three. The story is generic as hell. Considering this game is a complete rip-off of Soul Reaver one might expect that they could produce a better story considering the Legacy of Kain series (of which Soul Reaver is a part) has the best story in gaming history.
<br>
<br>So to sum up, fun but not a game of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders/user-reviews?user_review_id=3505409">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, after this many hours, I encountered a glitch, that made the game impossible to continue. Fortunately, I made a second save  about 3 hours of playing earlier. However, if I wouldn&apos;t, I&apos;d be forced to start the game from the beginning (what happened to many gamers before, as I found out on the Internet). In my opinion glitches like that should be fixed as soon as possible  but this one was not.
