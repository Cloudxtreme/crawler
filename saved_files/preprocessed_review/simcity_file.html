<br>
<br>Let&apos;s get out the Pro&apos;s:
<br>
<br>Graphics  Yes it looks very pretty. Even though I was shocked to see the &quot;sims&quot; looking like lego characters, overall the buildings and houses etc are very pretty.
<br>
<br>Modular upgrades  Excellent idea, and works very well. I never did like the idea behind &quot;I need more firetrucks? build 5 more fire stations&quot;. Now I can add onto the Firehouse and expand it&apos;s coverage that way. Works very well for Police, Fire, Schools, etc.
<br>
<br>Curved Roads  I can actually build a realistic looking town. The curved roads are great. However they leave issues with putting down homes and buildings on them at times.
<br>
<br>Now for all the Cons:
<br>
<br>Online DRM  I know everyone complains about this. I was willing to deal with it. Then the servers went down and I couldn&apos;t play. Is it first day issues? I&apos;m not sure but it was almost ironic when the servers went down.
<br>
<br>City Size  Of course a huge complaint, other reviews mention this. Filled up my entire town in a little over an hour.
<br>
<br>Diversity of buildings  Where are all the buildings I want to build? I&apos;m talking places like Museums, Churches, Zoo&apos;s, Post Offices, etc. etc. I can think of tons of missing content. Were these left out so EA can sell us buildings for $1 each later down the road?
<br>
<br>Transportation  So far it seems all you get are buses. No Train stations, no subways, etc. I do believe you can build an airport eventually.
<br>
<br>The whole &quot;Upgrade town hall to unlock stuff&quot;  Seems silly and unnecessary. I can&apos;t build a hospital because I already used my TownHall upgrade for something unrelated so I have to wait.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s hard to really say all the issues with the game in just bullet points. One of the biggest issues I have is simply with the density of zones. Let me paint a picture for you. You have a nice suburban part of your town, where say you want your middle to upper class to live. They would live on nice single lane roads with maybe some cul da sacs shooting off that road etc. You can build the road system, and then zone it for residential. That&apos;s it.... So what happens? You get mobile homes all over, and the only way to get the houses to &quot;upgrade&quot; to nicer establishment is to put parks/recreation all over nearby (and their effect is small size wise). Or you have to upgrade the road. Now who lives on a 4 lane road in a mansion? Not many people I can think of. It&apos;s absolutely idiotic.
<br>
<br>The game is definitely driven to have you share resources with neighboring regions. If you try to do it all in your one small city, you&apos;re in for a mess. So you have to essentially pause your game, and go to another city and start fresh there. Whether in the other city it&apos;s creating better jobs, or focusing on utilities to provide to your other city, etc.
<br>
<br>Overall, I am extremely disappointed in this game. A lot of the issues CAN be patched, fixed, upgraded with a lot of work from Maxis. But in the state the game is now, it should never have been released. This will probably be a game I shelve for a bit, and hope that in a few months it becomes playable. As it sits now, I paid for a beta copy. If I could return this to EA I would.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2996527">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>2. SimVille  not SimCty (Painfully small building space. A city can NOT be built on 2X2 Km.Period!)
<br>
<br>3. DLC  microtransactions (Fine for a free-to-play game. NOT acceptable for a game you are renting for 80$, yeah you read correctly; renting. )
<br>
<br>4. Not possible to create your own regions or terrain for that matter. (Maxis, ever heard of terraforming? If you are simulating something, do it slightly believable. Or is this not a simulation game?) 5. Suck you dry. (Yes, the layout of this game is made for sucking you dry and in the bad way- if there is a good one. They will probably open up the possibility for you to have bigger regions. But they will charge you for it. One lot at a time. They will also open up landmarks and cool new building. But they will charge you for it. They will open up terraforming. And again they will charge you for it. In the end you have spent 300$ on a game you wont be able to play say in 5 years time since you are renting it from EA!! )
<br>
<br>4. Not possible to save your cities since the game autosaves for you. (If you make a misstake you stick with it  just as in real life. Matbe this is a good thing? But wait, what if my cat jumps up on my keybord and places a really expensive building in the wrong place. That&apos;s right  its a cat mistake but you&apos;ll have to live with it) 5. Me and You.  Guys, we have just supported everything we think is wrong with this game. Be it Origin, EA, whatever. We have just condoned the destruction of a game we were all suppose to love and which many of us enjoyed as kids. How did we do this? Simply by donating 80$ to EA. Yes donated, the game is on their servers. Not on your computer! Right now we are EA&apos;s  How does it feel?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2993445">Expand</a></span>

There are so many server issues right now its ridiculous. I know a lot of people are complaining about not being able to connect, which, yeah sure that&apos;s not good, but I am going to talk about something worse than not being able to connect.  Losing mass amounts of time and progress because the game loses connection to server while playing. This in all honestly has to be the most frustrating thing to happen to me by far. I would much rather just not being able to connect than to lose half my city because EAs crap servers took a dump. Normally that wouldn&apos;t be much of a problem because you could just upload data from local storage to the cloud but guess what, this game has no local save feature. That&apos;s right, none at all. Whoever made that bonehead decision needs to be fired on the spot. I honestly have a ton of gripes about this newest iteration on one of my favorite franchises(been a sim gamer since Super Nintendo and original Sim City) but I don&apos;t want to spend all my time being negative. The only other negative thing I will say is that the city plot sizes are terrible. I didn&apos;t think that they would bother me that much but they do, a lot. Only a short while into my cities life and I have already used up half the real estate. This game forces you to cram everything in the most efficient spacing possible just to get to a decent sized city. It really takes the wind out of your sails when you realize your almost out of room and you have not gotten a tenth of the things you had planned in to the city.    That said, this game has sooooo much potential. The infrastructure and groundwork have been laid out to deliver one of the best city simulations of all time there are just too many things wrong at the moment to waste your time on it. I am severely regretting buying this game. Has the time come to stop pre ordering games? I think so. To many bad decisions in game making over the past year or so has left me jaded towards developers and publishers. Im looking at you Blizzard, Bioware, EA and Maxis. You all know better but we keep taking the crap you are shoveling and asking for more so why would you ever stop?  Nah, not gonna happen until we, the consumers, start speaking with our wallets. I for one WILL start speaking with my wallet from now on. No more good faith purchases for this video game nerd.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2999606">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What enraged me to the point of physical arm waving was the fact that you had to be connected to the internet EVERY SINGLE MINUTE YOU PLAY THIS GAME. Combine this with highly unstable servers(And my router sometimes failing on me) resulted in me tens of times being trapped in the tutorial without being able to do anything, NOR GO AND PLAY THE REAL F*CKING GAME!  But thats not all! Turns out that if you get disconnected during your gaming session your game might not be saved, which means that several hours of work suddenly goes down the drain. And to top the whole thing off: YOU CAN&apos;T SAVE THE GAMES YOURSELF!
<br>
<br>The only thing that made me feel marginally better was the fact that thousands of others expressed their fury online. I recommend you all to rather wait for a pirated version where you CAN ATLEAST PLAY OFFLINE, rather than buying this smoking  pile of animal dung. But don&apos;t take my word for it, just have a chat with one (or all) of the thousands of other gamers who seem to agree with me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3000991">Expand</a></span>

Which other games publisherhas such a perfect ability of smelling out what their customers like and then going and doing the EXACT opposite. What other company is as loathed as EA, in an industry where the customers actually want to love them but can&apos;t???? Obsessed with their need for Origins to be successful, obsessed about piracy, which is irrelevant in a world where the number of happy paying customers is booming, obsessed about getting as much blood from a stone as they can with DLC and micro-transactions, EA corporate apparently spends zero time thinking about games, the gamer of the gaming experience. EA seems to be rendered insane by its own greed. It has a genius for destroying games and the fun of gaming. And by all appearances there is no one with any power or control in EA who actually CARES about this either. Look at the millions and millions they blow on advertising! Look at the way gameplay and game fun and game design considerations stagnate or go backwards and get worse! What&apos;s wrong with this company? Why are the fools crashing the ships into the rocks NOT getting sacked? The answer can only be that the rot is coming from the very top. It&apos;s the EA executives who are making this company a joke. These are obviously men with big egos who never actually play games, and feel an innate contempt for gamers, indeed for games. Gamers should seriously boycott the products of this company, because it&apos;s evident from the long string of ruined franchises and studios EA has destroyed in the past 2 years that this company represents a DISEASED corporate culture that will obviously continue so long as the corporate machine is making revenue. Until EA starts taking significant financial losses on their horribly skewed &apos;games&apos; they have no real reason to change what they are doing. This game is a horrible warning sign of how EA hopes to suck gamers into a DLC-addled, micro-transaction infested, pay-to-play, pay to win, charge by the month toll booth on our lives. They have so much contempt for games and gamers that they even try to chain us to their machine with BAD games. Like we are DUMB enough to allow it. The answer is to say NO. Don&apos;t buy their games. Score bomb their games. Don&apos;t support these people. EVER. Buy from companies with a better philosphy and with more love for the art and fun that represent gaming at its best. Starve the beast. EA is truly, really, deeply SICK. The shareholders need to replace the entire executive of the business with people who actually, know, love, understand and live for making good games. A company with the financial resources to be an industry leader should be an industry leader. Right now they are wasting and losing billions in potential revenue. They are not only losing-out in terms of game design, creativity and popularity, they are missing BILLIONS in revenue. They are a bad publisher and a BAD business model. Dozens of corporate shills in suits with no understanding of games, gaming or gamers need to be permanently retired, starting with ALL their present executives. A Sim City in 2013 should have been a blow-your mind awesome experience not only in the dimensions of cartoon world creation, but also in hyper-real SERIOUS civic engineering. It could have and should have been not only a toy, but a platform that could be used by architects and engineers to mock up real-world projects. Instead of investing in a state of the art engine however, EA blew its budget on hookers and blow again: AS ALWAYS: giving us a sad reboot of a 1997 experience on the back of a vast, wasted advertising budget. Casuals don&apos;t care and will get their kicks elsewhere. The hardcore knowingly laugh. Why do these fools make games for 12 year old, and hope to use DLC and micro transactions to get kids to hit their folks with the credit card? Does no-one with authority in EA have the slightest interest in ACTUALLY MAKING GOOD STATE OF THE ART SOFTWARE? If they stopped trying so hard to work angles with DLC and such and just made plain awesome games they would double their profits in 12 months and start to regain some of the good will they have so steadily squandered in the past three years! SACK the present boss and reset your agenda !

<br>THE GROT REVIEW CRITERIA: After a long time writing reviews like an anus, think its time to set a few bad habits straight: Stop insulting designers. Show some respect for the design process and getting games in circulation. Hence (1) No Red scores. (2) Game scores as follows: Bad Game 5/10. Poor Game 6/10. Mediocre Game: 7/10. Good Game 8/10. Great game 9/10. Stella Game 10/10. To get 10/10 it must be a game that can be (theoretically) play-able for 1000+ hours. Not only great but near endless fun. Games may be bad or poor but making them should earn respect. Thus even the worst POS will still be a 5/10. 0/10 no longer exists in my vocabulary. Yellow is the new red.

Oh, and since I am already at it here&apos;s another complaint. Nix DRM! This is an absurd element to have in this kind of a game. Make multiplayer games optional and provide users with optional updates and patches, like in the past. What happened to the emphasis on personal choice in the SimCity franchise philosophy anyways? Went down the drain with EA&apos;s fascist republic of gaming business model, I guess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2992568">Expand</a></span>

<br>Im not sure what type of this latest title the Critics got a taste of, but I assure you, it wasn&apos;t the one that consumers beta tested or paid for.    Finally, with all that can go wrong(and has) with games that have gone this route, I&apos;m not even sure if you can call this a game at this stage.....maybe software or program as a game is fundamentally redundant if it cannot be played and just merely stared at, in awestruck disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2992607">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now this issue wouldn&apos;t be an issue if the various cities in the region worked together with any consistent way, i&apos;m always getting messages that x city is no longer sending me water, but I made x city with over 1000 times the water that city needed to supply this one, sending funds or resources seems to take half a day (real time), and each of my various cities in the region saw our Regional Airport at different stages which leads me to believe large amounts of resources were probably going into cyberspace never to be seen again. I have also noted it appears you can only send resources to your closest neighbours not those further distance.
<br>
<br>Until ALL of Simcity&apos;s server issues are resolved I cannot recommend this game, it is broken and the long game just doesn&apos;t seem to be there, i&apos;ve played three cities with a region population of  300k  and a total bank balance of $55M (through electronics trading) and i&apos;ve run out of things to do, I have no space, I need to keep my utilities in each city as outsourcing isn&apos;t an option, so i&apos;m stuck just watching my balance go up, and my interest go down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3024870">Expand</a></span>

Middle of day 2, my region won&apos;t load. It goes without saying that the release of this game is a fiasco, but what is rightfully upsetting is that EA has broken very logical convention for a game of this type, and really gone out of its way to put its customers at risk of dealing with this inconvenience. If EA were a TV manufacturer, an airline, a pharmaceutical company....they would be issuing refunds right now. In the least case, they owe a very public apology to their customers who preordered or purchased before they had their servers working. As far as the DRM is concerned, I cannot imagine a poorer way to treat paying customers.
<br>As for the actual gameplay that I was able to experience: If I had to sum it up in one word, unfortunately that word would be &quot;lame&quot;.  Aside from the day one bugs, such as not being able to sell power to my partially-grown neighboring city, I was seriously let down by the abnormally anemic size of the cities and by the shallowed complexity as compared to SC4. I miss the graphs...they were the best way to show you how well you have done over time, and what elements changed in your SC4 city. The demand system is not doing well: I had half of the acreage of my city covered in middle-wealth families, a quarter in middle-wealth commercial, and a quarter in middle wealth manufacturing. What are the sims telling me? The residents say there are no jobs and not enough shopping. The shops say there are not enough potential employees or shoppers. The factories say there are not enough potential employees or &quot;places to ship their goods&quot;, i.e, shops. So yeah, that is perhaps the most essential system in the game and it&apos;s currently half-baked. It is visually decent, but the animations are still buggy (i.e. sims jittering around as if possessed).
<br>I believe it is completely fair to compare this game to SC4, particularly as the developers have spent plenty of time alluding to the connection between the two. At this moment in time, SC4 is hands-down a more challenging, more complex, and, without a doubt, more rewarding game. The multiplayer aspect was a bold diversion from the logical direction, and has thus far not only failed to add anything meaningfully positive but has made the game literally unplayable for the core market who preordered or purchased in the first days. Obviously, fixing this issue is priority one. Expanding the city size is priority two. These two glaring issues need to be fixed before we can pretend that this game is worth more than $20 (issue one needs to be fixed before this game is worth a penny!). I&apos;m not sure we&apos;re ever going to see this game being worth the $60 that so many of us have paid.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m rating a zero, obviously, for the fact that on day two I still cannot play the game. If I were to pretend that I could play the game, I would give it a 3.5. Overall rating rounded up to 2.
<br>
<br>To remake a lyric from Team America: &quot;I miss you more than Electronic Arts missed the mark, when they made SimCity...&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2996230">Expand</a></span>

You need an internet connection to play a single player game, and sometimes you got even to wait  in order to play it. This was definetly my last purchase at origin. Don&apos;t waste your money in this game.</span>

<br>
<br>You must be connected to the internet 100% of the time you are playing.
<br>...... You must connect to Origin to load or save your city (see next item).
<br>...... Games are saved to the cloud (EA Servers).
<br>...... If you&apos;re net connection goes down for more than a couple of minutes then all gameplay since last save is lost.
<br>...... The installed game is only half the software, the rest is on EA&apos;s Serves so requires a fast, reliable internet connection to transfer data.
<br>...... Other players Cities will influence yours even in &apos;single player&apos; mode.
<br>...... Saved games once loaded must be saved so you can&apos;t change your mind and go back and reload the city.
<br>...... If the game flops and servers are switched off (EA averages 2 years or so) it will become unplayable.
<br>
<br>No god mode terraforming. (This includes how much resources are available and where they are).
<br>No modding allowed at launch (if at all due to online requirements/cloud computing).
<br>No building density zoning.
<br>Buildings may spam along a single road.
<br>Dumbed down micro-management.
<br>Limited population (Max 100,000 Sims per city)
<br>The city tile size is only equivalent to a medium city in SC4, and that is the only size available.
<br>You only get European building sets if you buy the game as a digital download direct from origin.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t care how fun a game is;  Any amount of money you pay for this software should basically just be considered rent, because EA will inevitably shut down the servers that you NEED to run this game within the next six months to 2.5 years; after which you&apos;ll never be able to play it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2998794">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Which is a shame but I can&apos;t, in good faith, recommend or rate a title highly if the peripherals mar the experience.</span>

I pre-ordered the limited edition of the Sim City, however I wasn&apos;t able to actually start downloading the game until 8:00 the next morning.  Seems to defeat the purpose of pre-ordering.  After the game was installed, I was able to play for about 2 hours before I got a message saying the the SimCity servers were down, attempting to reconnect.  I don&apos;t care about the DRM, but when it effects my gameplay experience, it is unacceptable.  The 2 hours of game time I had were fun, but the game comes with so much baggage that it completely sucks the fun out of it.  I know that when I am able to play again I&apos;m going to constantly have &quot;SimCity servers are down, attempting to reconnect&quot; in the back of my mind, and wondering how long I&apos;ll be able to play.  For a company as large as EA this is just ridiculous.  They have raised the price of their games, forced you to download Origin in order to play, and then shown complete disregard for their customers.  It is a fun game to play but I honestly cannot recommend purchasing it until EA straightens out its problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2995139">Expand</a></span>

I find that I have a childish giddyness inside me as I login to the game. It seems that the serves are full, well I guess I can wait, if I could give Diablo 3 the patience that its launch needed, then I most certainly can give sim city as much patience. I just hope it&apos;s not as much of a let down. Front of the queue at last, I whiled away the wait time with my plans for the grand city of &quot;Our Land&quot;, and so begin my first steps back in the land of sim city. While playing I must say that I did enjoy the game. It was beautiful and deep (obligatory that&apos;s what she said comment!) My city was beginning to take shape, no longer a village but a town! Then I got dropped:-(  You see, I live in an area where I can only get a pretty poor internet connection. 3MB, and it isn&apos;t the most reliable either. There are the random drop offs and what not. Now, none of this is EA&apos;s fault, however when I reconnected I was back in the queue.... again..... and so I waited..... and unfortunately due to a phonecall I missed my window to get back into the game so I was placed into the queue again.
<br>
<br>Now I admit, I should have been prepared for the always on, but due to my current experience&apos;s with their queue and their DRM I have found myself unable to play the single player game I wanted to play. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth and has seriously got me contemplating a pirated copy: I don&apos;t pirate &quot;arrrrrr&quot; as I have a job, so I purchase all my games. But this experience made me feel that pirating could be the way to go. Which is a shame, as there is a shining jewel of a game beneath this stool water that is the always on DRM.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2995951">Expand</a></span>

<br>1) Autosaving of cities are unclear  you do not know when your creations are saved. Crashing to desktop is almost a death sentence as your cities literally disappear or got rolled back to empty wilderness when you log back on. 2) Unable to join servers and therefore unable to play a product you payed for  unacceptable especially when no ETA on fixes are given. 3) If you idle in the join game selection lobby for abit (less than 1hr), after a while you cannot join/load.create any game  you get a failed loading message. It&apos;s as if they disconnected you from their servers without telling you. Other minor bugs are present but do not impact the game too much. Except traffic pathing AI perhaps.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: Even if you can tolerate the online DRM, the potential loss of your  friends&apos; creations upon disconnect/crash is enough to make you give up after 2-3 fresh retries. Don&apos;t buy this game until they work out this major problem (on saving cities and crash/disconnect recovery)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2991947">Expand</a></span>

<br>Shame on EA, shame on Origin, and i don&apos;t give maxis a pass either...they hooked up with these people..they made the choices to destroy a game franchise that stood on top of all others.. I actually did get to play for 45 minutes last nite...the experience is uncompelling and the how anybody thought the tiny areas to build your city was a good thing beggars belief...
<br>
<br>its a shame.. basically i just spent $60 to reinstall Sim City4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2994829">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Played at a friends house and this game is definitely worse than Sim City 4 and tries to be a Societies advanced. So if you are a player with low standards and happen to be a member of the facebook generation you might enjoy this mediocre game, if you are a gamer with standards, you stay clear and tell EA with your wallet that they should finally handle games as games and not as products with limitations, because they think the players have not enough intellect to grasp a more complex gameplay. This mindset of the big publishers sickens me.
<br>
<br>Next gameseries down the drain, just like Dead Space 3. EA has lost their touch, and the developers have to suffer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2989109">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sadly your company has again pushed me away from the right path. I realize after a friend has told me that Sim City 5 was released. First thing I thought was its EA..I don&apos;t want to support you but the second thought came into my mind was, its Maxis. A company who was created by a brilliant programmer Will Wright (which to be honest I look up to and hope to one day achieve something great like him.) However after downloading the game and unable to play after 8 or so hours after I paid $80 (in support to Maxis) I am still unable to create one single city. Its either server are down, unable to login to server please login again, and unable to claim city (this was earlier in the day.) This is a horrendous experience for any customer.
<br>
<br>How does a large company such as yourself able to pour so much money into marketing a game yet unable to provide the support or infrastructure it needs for it to work? Its like Lamborghini made a new car and once they give you the key you can&apos;t drive it anywhere. How worthless is that to the buyer?
<br>
<br>Anyways, to go on with what I want to say, you have my $80.00 keep it for your unemployment checks once people are finally fed up with your B.S. I hope every single one of your executives that have had any say in pushing this product out, loose their job, loose their wealth, and have to go live in a homeless shelter. Maybe then that they would learn how to earn a respectable living before falsifying a product and shamelessly using a dearly beloved brand name to fill their pockets first.
<br>
<br>Also I&apos;m probably no longer going to wait for EA to fix this crap. I&apos;ll wait for one of the hacker groups out there who are only a team of 10 or so or less able to throw in some codes to make it work offline. Seriously a group of hackers can make this game offline and a GIANT Fing company can&apos;t make a mode for offline gaming.
<br>
<br>P.S. If there was an offline gaming, there wouldn&apos;t be this rant, SimCity was an offline game. You want online fine, make it an option not a NECCESSARY!
<br>
<br>P.S.S. Comments on hackers, I really hope EA reads it and learn that hackers are going to be this brand savior instead of the opposite. We(consumers) buy legitimate games that we can&apos;t play(because of the company foolishness) but if they(pirates) get it illegitimately they will be able to play it...that is one @SS backward way to sell your games! All I can say is I root for the pirates this time all the way!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2999569">Expand</a></span>

I am not bashing the game it self, I am bashing the launch, and the fact that they didnt offer any sort of offline mode to play this game alone if you wanted to. Truly disappointing that they have made this DRM stuff so ridiculous to the point that it has crippled the game itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3002473">Expand</a></span>

Check the ratings, the prime demographic has spoken, but as usual EA is too stupid to listen to their customer base. Ignore the hired spokesmen, which includes the media, this game is crap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2987493">Expand</a></span>

They introduced the glassbox engine to make a realistic city simulation, yet what it simulates is totally unnecessary and meant that the maps were stupidly small. The way it simulates resource distribution and  things like using &quot;agents&quot; for everything is silly as it could be done in a less intensive way. Similarly, simulating every single person, while a cool idea on paper, is actually kind of pointless in a city builder and is more akin to a Sims expansion pack. So what you get is an overly complex simulation to create realism, yet the irony that square little cities with only one road connection to the outside world and surrounded by green wasteland, is totally unrealistic. How can you immerse yourself in the game when you know that you&apos;re playing a city building game where it&apos;s not possible to build a city?
<br>
<br>Thinking about the amazing regions I created on SC4, this is such a huge step backwards, and for what? 3D graphics and tiny maps. Other gripes include;
<br>
<br>-City tile size means you need efficiency, making the introduction of curvy roads a damp squib.
<br>-Always online; I live in a village with poor internet, thanks for thinking about us EA.
<br>-Lack of mixed zoning.
<br>-Density now decided by road type, and not seeing the full plot area when zoning.
<br>-Can no longer save cities.
<br>-No adjacent tiles which made SC4 a truly epic game in scale. -Graphics are ok, but given the massive trade-off with the tiny tiles you&apos;d think they&apos;d be better than &quot;ok&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2990614">Expand</a></span>

<br>Your cities are at the mercy of EA&apos;s benevolence and server stability, neither of which they possess. If their servers go down, your cities do not save and you receive a large roll-back; that&apos;s if you can log back in to begin with. Launch day has been very bad, despite EA&apos;s numerous assurances they would be able to handle the load. They refused to let players pre-launch the game, for no explicable reason, so many customers have not even downloaded the product due yet. The cities spaces are very small. It forces you to use multiple regions by yourself, or play with others in order to have an efficient metropolis. You cannot modify the terrain in any way. You cannot un-do, quick-save or quick-load.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2987393">Expand</a></span>

I should also mention that I installed it on two different systems, both running MANY other games successfully. Without any response (at all) from EA, I can only conclude they released it prematurely. Too bad too, since I&apos;m a long time SimCity fan.</span>

The cities were tiny, there were limited transporation options, no terraforming  you all know this by not. But, maybe it&apos;ll pick up soon, I thought. So I continued. Then the servers went down (or maybe a slight hickup on my end), and I got kicked out of the game. Due to an internet issue. In a single player game. Fine, whatever. Relaunched the game, more queues. Got pretty frustrated now, but wanted to eat least get to the meat of the game. I wanted through yet another queue, only to log in and find my city was corrupted. It was saved on their servers. Why the hell was it corrupted?
<br>
<br>So I uninstalled and asked for a refund. Giving the game 1 star instead of 0 because I actually got one. Thanks for ruining another franchise, EA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2993955">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re expecting this game to be better or even similar to SCR4 or SC2000 you are in for a serious surprise.  EA has turned the Sim City franchise into a watered down Sims clone.  Instead of focusing on bigger macro city building, EA&apos;s main concern is making sure each sim has a name and where they are 24 hrs a day!!! Wow who cares.  The space you get to build your city is so small you feel like you never can fully max out your city.  And don&apos;t get me started on the DRM included in this game.  This game honestly feels like it should have been a free to play game on Facebook instead of something we pay $60 for.  You know any improvements that should have been included in the launch will be offered as a extra buy-able item.  My suggestion is to save you money for a better game or wait until you find this thing on the discount rack.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2989327">Expand</a></span>

Poor little guy doesn&apos;t understand corporate greed yet.  I explained to him there once was a time where PC Gamers could purchase a game once, and enjoy it forever (Remember SimCity 4?).  Now it looks like we&apos;ve merely paid $60 to rent the opportunity to play in EA&apos;s sandbox the way they want us too.  I made an effort to avoid those kids on the playground.  I was excited about purchasing 3 copies so my sons and I could all play together.  Now we&apos;ve all decided to just share the one copy.  Oh yeah, all you readers.  There is even a clause right on the game CD case that states EA only needs to provide 30 days notice and then can shut down the servers for the game... until EA states otherwise, this is essentially telling you the game will be useless after that time!!!  The ultra tiny maps just were the icing on the cake lol...  Sorry EA.  Big, Fat, Giant Fail.  Since it&apos;s not possible for me to get a refund I&apos;ll just have to count on mine and the thousands (if not millions) of unhappy consumers who&apos;ve taken to the blogosphere to and now you need to answer to everyone.  Hopefully EA can make right.  Remove the DRM (online only) play. Give us the larger maps,  Let us save our games locally, let us play single player locally and let us enjoy the game for as long as we damn well please.  We PAID for it!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2997256">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it&apos;s more user friendly than the old versions of SimCity, but what does that matter whenever their servers that you HAVE to use are down?  You can&apos;t play if that&apos;s the case and, surprise surprise, that&apos;s the case this morning on the -first- day of launch.  Hopefully this deplorable score will wake up EA to finally get their act together.</span>

Many people, even reviewers, were unable to access their games or load old saves because this. As a consumer, we should have a zero-tolerance for this sort of practice and boycott any game which is essentially an $80 rental. As to the content of the game, the city plots are abysmal in size, deals with neighboring cities is done automatically, connections with other cities (highways and rails) is done automatically, and much content like subway stations have been cut. The overall nature of the game is so limited that it when taken into context with it&apos;s social gaming aspects, you have to conclude that would be better fit for a facebook or iphone game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2983512">Expand</a></span>

<br>CitiesXL is a MUCH MUCH (x1000) better game, doesn&apos;t require an internet connection for single player games, and will happily let you play 10 years from now.</span>

<br>And what about 5 years down the road...what then EA when your servers close down and I&apos;m left with a plastic disk shaped corpse of a game??? I can play simcity2000 50 years from now...can I play this game then??

Their sell scheme is a bizarre combination of licenses, cut content from the game, and day one DLC. The game itself  punishes you for playing alone, due to the fact that you are extremely limited to expand anything, giving the fact that you only get 2km x 2km to build at, while other Sim city games in the past had 10 times as much space.
<br>
<br>Because of this bizarre turn of event you are forced to build other cities connected to your city forms of transportation and design each and every city in a theme, in order to supply all sectors with water, jobs, transportation etc. Your town only regenerates income or resources when you load the city, you are being punished for playing alone, because your other cities connected to your prime city wont generate anything. You solve this issue by forcing your friends to purchase a license to the game and let them take control over your other districts, hence generating resources needed to run you main city. You know by now that the forced Online DRM will kick you if your internet stops working for a second, you will lose progress, money and buildings when the game kicks you and shuts the game down when your internet goes down.
<br>
<br>Full EA servers that forces you to wait hours to play is also bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2987692">Expand</a></span>

<br>Efforts like this MUST fail or it is all we will get in the future.  I remember the days when I would call in sick to work to play an awesome newly-released game.  I&apos;d spend hours playing and I wouldn&apos;t regret playing hooky at all.  Now you try to do it only to discover that you spend the day in a que waiting to play a single-player game you already paid for.  Thank god I tried it at a friend&apos;s house.  Once it actually logged him on (an hour later), and four interruptions and two hours later, and we felt like we were basically done.  Couldn&apos;t expand any further.
<br>
<br>This isn&apos;t the rebirth of SimCity and this isn&apos;t the way games should be made and marketed.  Protest with your wallet.

In summary, this version of SimCity equates to a dumbed-down Facebook game. The always-online-DRM is pretty much a dealbreaker, but I might have still considered buying it if it weren&apos;t for the restrictions this system places on you. So as the term suggests, always-online-DRM means there is NO offline single player for this game. Want to play a single player world? Cool, you can do that, just sign into our servers first. Don&apos;t have internet? Need to pass the time on an airplane? Just play SimCity- oh wait, you can&apos;t.  Ok, surely it can&apos;t be THAT big a deal, right? Wrong, not when you learn that you can&apos;t even save your worlds to your own hard drive. Everything you do has to be stored in EA&apos;s collection of poorly sustained servers. This also removes some of the magic of the old SimCity games, since it restricts you from destroying a city and reloading from an old save. This DRM system is restricting pretty basic freedoms of gaming. So there&apos;s the DRM system, which is a dealbreaker in itself, but what about the gameplay? Good news, that&apos;s a dealbreaker too. The cities are extremely small, you have no control over regional transport, there are no subways, and there is no terraforming. This game is completely misleading. This version of SimCity does not qualify as a full fledged video game. It qualifies as a Facebook game, at best. Don&apos;t waste your money on EA&apos;s little trap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2989520">Expand</a></span>

<br>Really, the DRM and premium content would be entirely justifiable if they transitioned to a Free To Play model.  Nobody could argue then.
<br>I&apos;ll be damned if I&apos;m going to fork over &#xA3;45 up front for the privilege of being exploited though.

As i cannot play the game that i purchased it is of no function or value, it is not worth the money i payed for it. If i wanted to play this game after the launch date i would have waited and bought it when it goes on sale. This always on  must end, DO NOT BUY. DOES NOT WORK.</span>
