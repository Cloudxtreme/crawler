Game is a lot of better than Sniper Ghost Warrior 1. Developers doesn&apos;t have budget like Call of Duty or Battlefield, but game is cheaper. Easy, linear, but entertaining. For me 7+/10.</span>

<br>
<br>Pros--
<br>-Great Visuals (CryEngine 3 baby)
<br>-Fixed AI (Ignore GhostsofWar he must just really suck... They are smarter with their attacks, they dont see you after you shoot from 500m away with a silenced rifle, They dont detect you when you are hiding pretty close with a ghillie suit, they dont have aimbots, etc.)
<br>-Plays a lot smoother than 1st/less clunky gameplay
<br>-Smooth and clean menu
<br>-Way more sniping knowledge needed. aka less hand holding
<br>
<br>Cons--
<br>-Minor bugs, but it is only 10 hours from launch at time of writing. Patches will come.
<br>-Multiplayer is very fun, but that is the most bugged. Very rarely connects to lobbies, 1 game mode, 2 maps. But when you do get in -and that&apos;s what I&apos;m judging on- its awesome. And like I said before  10 hours in... Patches will come...
<br>
<br>Would give 85/100 so rounded to 9/10. Giving 10/10 to counter GhostsofWar&apos;s clearly uninformed review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3026318">Expand</a></span>

There are minor bugs, graphics could be better, and campaign is quite linear, but usually there is more than 1 path to choose. Besides, imho linear is not bad if provides sufficient amount of fun. Movies are linear and yet everyone watches them.  Anyway, the game is worth a shot if you&apos;re looking for some solid sniping experience. Anything left to hope for is some DLC to expand the multiplayer part (which is still not bad atm). I&apos;d give the game 7,5-8/10 but I&apos;m giving 10 to counter those &apos;0&apos; haters.

<br>The singleplayer mode was entertaining, but very linear, scripted and overall short. It barely offered any space for choices, and if so, then only &quot;If you fail A, then do B&quot;-styled choices. Overall, the game got very repetitive over time, but this is probably the case with every sniper-themed game.
<br>
<br>What I did not like was your lack of choice when it comes to rifles. I personally love the SVD Dragunow (and own one myself) and would have done every mission with it, but I start with my default army rifle every time. It&apos;s slightly frustrating.
<br>
<br>I have played through singleplayer twice and encountered several minor bugs (mission markers not disappearing, white flashes of distant textures, etc.), but nothing gamebreaking. These should not keep you from buying it.
<br>
<br>What bothered me was the lacking stealth aspect. Explosions and dead people everywhere and the AI doesn&apos;t notice. Your partner gets shot in the head while talking on the phone to him? No reason to alarm the others.
<br>
<br>Compared to Sniper Elite V2, it is an actual sniper game this time, even though I personally preferred SEV2&apos;s bullet physics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3177301">Expand</a></span>

A number of movie clips tell the story between the acts and scenes but the video quality is somewhere between poor and passable. At the end of each scene is a summary of your headshots and accuracy. It&apos;s linear and in many instances you face invisible walls, although this doesn&apos;t detract from the overall experience too much.
<br>
<br>I got this one on a Steam special and played the single player through in 7 hours (according to Steam) but that includes an hour or two of it being paused, so it&apos;s quite short. I didn&apos;t try the multi-player.
<br>
<br>On the whole, I enjoyed this game. There were moments of frustration because some checkpoints are quite far apart and dying means replaying up to 15 minutes, often several times.
<br>
<br>Combat is mostly through sniping, but you have a silenced pistol and knife for performing stealth kills. Controls are standard for FPS games. Missing a shot will often change your objective from not being detected to fight your way through, although you usually end up dead when this happens. There were one or two instances where the story forces you to fight your way through by blowing your cover deliberately.
<br>
<br>Act III was particularly fun to play, the best part of the game. Enemy AI varies between stupid and good, a mixed bag.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a casual (but short) distraction and can live with the checkpoint frustration, I recommend this game to FPS fans. Grab it when it&apos;s on special.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3297576">Expand</a></span>

I enjoy the headshots. The graphic is decent and the gameplay engaging as well. The DLC Siberian Strike give you more freedom in terms of making your own decision how to kill or where to go. Overall a stunning experience and the next DLC is higly aprreciated!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3083247">Expand</a></span>

<br>Though it uses the Crye engine the graphics aren&apos;t exactly the best that the engine can produce, a fault that I would imagine is caused by the fact that in addition to being developed for the PC the dev team had to accommodate the vastly lower technical abilities of previous-generation consoles. This also produces my main complaint about the main game - it&apos;s incredibly linear, almost to the point of being an on-rails shooter.
<br>
<br>The Siberian Strike DLC freed things up considerably and while it&apos;s no FarCry 3, the DLC gives the player a much more diverse number of approaches to any given situation and far less hand-holding than the vanilla game and is a much more enjoyable experience for it.
<br>
<br>Overall Ghost Warrior is one of the better portrayals of a military special ops sniper role for the PC and for that reason alone is an interesting game to play. Finally, I can&apos;t really comment on the multi-player aspects of the game as the few servers that I could get the game to connect to were empty. By now the game is entirely forgotten on line.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4665542">Expand</a></span>

It fit my expectations perfectly fine and well. I also don&apos;t believe my expectations to be too low. This game took in great use of the new Cry Engine 3, it was a beautiful game. It really challenged the player at various points. Of course I had it on the hardest difficulty but, I found it fun, and well irritating when i got stuck but, whats a game without that. You dont get that feel of success without any work. Sure there were bugs around but, please tell me a game that has no bugs. I&apos;m not sure I really noticed anything &quot;oh so severe&quot; throughout the whole game. I loved the game and hope to play through it again. I really have not been challenged like this since Deus Ex on the hardest difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3849764">Expand</a></span>

It does what a sequel should do and improves on the 1st game in all departments. Graphically nice, good sound through a headset and can be quite immersive  if you let it. Of course if you want to race through it you can but you will miss some of the atmosphere. Not the best game in the world but far from the worst, likewise not the cheapest but not a premium release either. I was niether blown away nor disapointed, sometimes you just get exactly what you pay for. Take it for what it is, deep breath and squeeze the trigger. I prefer this to V2 (which I also like) so goes to show it takes all sorts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3038658">Expand</a></span>

<br>The new add-on for this game (Siberian whatever) is very good. I like it better than than the main game. It will cost you $9 and change for this add-on is the only drawback, but really that&apos;s not too bad because the main game was $29 and change. So, if you think about all the 50-60 dollar games coming out, you have only spent about $40 on this one. I really don&apos;t see why people want to trash this game with negative reviews, because this game isn&apos;t for everyone anyway. It&apos;s a good game if you like stealth and have patience. This game &quot;Is Not&quot; as bad as all these &quot;0&quot; reviews say. It looks like some kind of conspiracy to rag out this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3070745">Expand</a></span>

The new sniper 2 game is fantastic fun. Is it extremely innovative? No, but that&apos;s not how games should be judged, but only on quality of gaming experience. The graphics of the lush foliage environments are splendidly accomplished and the gameplay is super fun taking out russian, filipinos, and ukranians from long range. This game is meant to be played on hard if you want a true sniping experience without all the help. I really enjoyed protecting the seal teams from afar. I actually hated the first sniper game but very much have enjoyed my experience with this game. If there is one thing we&apos;ve learned, don&apos;t trust reviewers (ahem Diablo 3 and Mass Effect 3, etc.). They are biased, paid off, or way too enamored with innovation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3034835">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t know why you are comparing this game with sniper elite v2 but let me join in: SGW2 has by mails a better SP campaign,sniping in both games is excellent,I did not try the MP so i won&apos;t judge it yet.  don&apos;t see the point in comparing SGW2 and SE2.This game is definitely a major improvement from the first game which i cannot say for SE2 (except  the bullet-cam +the mp was nice and the epic SENZA expansion).The game is 8/10 but it&apos;s getting a straight 10  to counter those &apos;0&apos; haters. Can someone explain the COD comparison (perhaps I don&apos;t get it because I only played 1. COD but how in the name of your god is this a COD clone?).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3032959">Expand</a></span>

I am quite content with the performance and their ability to listen to the community with the additon of hardcore and a few more Multiplayer maps! The new Campaign now makes the game feel complete and a very well done campaign mission! So for the 40 bucks, which is under the cost of most triple A titles you get two missions in single player, 4 multiplayer maps and easy and hardcore modes&#x2026; that is a game worth playing.. although dedicated servers would also be a big PLUS!! Obviously &#x201C;Management&#x201D; failed with the early release.. this team is &#x201C;very&#x201D; capable of making a good game and great looking scenarios! Now if they would only offer the &#x201C;dismemberment&#x201D; as DLC to areas capable of using it&#x2026; sigh.. Thanks for the continued support CI&#x2026; hope to see it continue!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3064215">Expand</a></span>

Not good but not bad or at least not too bad either. Graphics are OK but well under expectations after the use of the Cry engine.Textures are mediocre too but the game is looking well enough. The main problem with this game is not graphics but that the game was designed by devs as a COD clone from the very beginning instead of being something new or different and as a clone it lacks in many fields. It is a very bad COD clone that even if released 10 years ago would have scored mediocre reviews. The game is so heavily scripted and linear that if you do something slightly different from what the devs programmed the result is usually always a CTD. At least in my case It CTD about 10 times during the whole SP not to mention many Graphical glitches and far too many bugs that even in one case forced me to repeat a whole chapter. The game looks like a beta and is not sufficiently debugged even after being released with one year delay. The story is completely COD- esque and void of any sense, characters are bad with low resolution textures and poor polygons and their rogdoll movements very poor, stiff and unnatural even for a 10 years old game. I liked very much the shooting physics that feel realistic enough and obviously the game is much better than the first one but not enough. what I hate the most is that the game is telling you not to be creative, not to think by your own, only do whatever the devs wanted you to do in the first place.

The most unrealistic sniper gameplay, I mean, I&apos;m not an official sniper but these guys don&apos;t sneak up and kill with their knives. This is like playing a stealthy mission of CoD franchise which I always disliked!</span>

<br>The game was short, but the MP maps are well made. There were a few glitches and bugs throughout the campaign but I liked the game.</span>

I don&apos;t really care much for whatever the campaign story is bringing me, doesn&apos;t really feel put together. It&apos;s graphics are very well polished and the environments are so beautiful, that&apos;s also something to enjoy.</span>

The story is pretty basic in the campaign but the play is a lot of fun.  I know some will complain A LOT about having to follow your spotter&apos;s directions but that is what they are there for.  In a couple of places I took the shots in a different order and all the spotter said was  &quot;I see you have your own plan.  Good luck&quot; and I would get out of it okay.  The campaign is SHORT, only about 7 hours and unlike the original it only has the single mission at launch.  I am very appreciative of the fact that they have kept it pure to intel functions and removed the odd run and gun moments of the first.  Considering I got the first game and this for $30 you can&apos;t really go wrong.  I have yet to play the multi-player but will try that next so as to avoid the influx of hackers that will most likely take away the fun of that.  Not a fantastic game but worth your time if you like sniper games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3027217">Expand</a></span>

It does have some bugs but the well-programmed engine, the well-written story and the improved shooting experience have already covered all the cons. Compared to I, Ghost Warrior II is totally batter in every aspects. So i give this game a 9 out of 10.</span>

<br>The game itself is enjoyable. I recommend playing on the highest difficulty- then you can feel like a real sniper. I like the bullet cam and sniping from the distance. The plot isn&apos;t important for me in games like this, but I must admit it is a run of the mill. The sound also isn&apos;t impressing. Nevertheless Sniper 2 is much better than the first one and it isn&apos;t so buggy. For me, it&apos;s a great value for money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3035824">Expand</a></span>

<br>But let&#xB4;s focus on Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2. Personally, I think this game is a bit underrated. People claiming it&#xB4;s COD etc. But it&#xB4;s not that bad. Sure, there are some minor bugs, which aren&#xB4;t game breaking, but annoying. The gameplay however feels kinda linear. On the one hand, they made the levels like tunnels and the game tells you EXACTLY what to do...like a babysitter. On the other hand, you are allowed to do what you want to. You can play it like Metal Gear Solid and be super silent or you can make it COD style, running and shooting everything you see.
<br>Generally, it offers realistic elements of sniping, like bullet drop, the time the bullet takes to reach the target, wind and VERY bad visibility. It&#xB4;s really hard to spot enemies that are far away, unless you use the heat-vision, which makes it a little bit too easy in my opinion. The AI isn&#xB4;t bad either.
<br>Nonetheless, this game delivers some solid sniping experience, a storyline and, if you like the game, fun.
<br>
<br>Seriously, I&#xB4;m speaking to the developers right now: Please give us bigger levels, these feel so cramped...and more options, without telling us every second what to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3038200">Expand</a></span>

The graphics can sometimes be a little outdated with some bad textureing in some places but overall there are many stunning things to look at, especially the mission in Tibet at a monastery was really stunning. This being ported to PC does result in the developer having used the same fake shadows around most edges as we saw in Far Cry 3 but that does result in some pretty good performance and I was able get about 60+ fps completely maxed out on my gtx 580 and i5 2500k. It took me about 4+ hours to complete the game on medium difficulty and when you think about it call of duty cost 60 dollars and has a 8 hour campaign so this even if its only half the lenght of the cod campaign it also costs half (And frankly the this is a much better game to with a lot better graphics than cod so you cant really compare the time it takes to complete them).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3036305">Expand</a></span>

What</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I really did not expect to see such a low rating for this one. The game is looking great, feels great and you have to understand that you cannot go loose trigger. You must obey your spotter and follow the eye in the sky. Yes, after a reload you can go ahead of the voice on the radio and make it look bad, but this is not live feedback from a real comand center, this is a scripted game. What i really dont like and has to be patched is the slow motion effect you get between bullets firing. It slows down and when its almost ready it speeds back up. Such change of sensitivity affects aim and causes frustration at start, but you get used to it after a while. The campaign is absolutely delightful to play, being undetected, crawling past enemies, finishing the missions with flawless performace. If you make one mistake, you are dead. The multiplayer is absolutely worth playing. Compared to awp maps in Counter Strike, this is 50 times better. You can hide well, you can try going across, and it feels good once you spot the hidden enemy. In time you learn how to look into the impossible angles and its more and more enjoyable. Compared to sniping experience in Battlefield 3, this is by far better. (one shot, one kill)   Unlike other shooters, in this one there are moments that are testing your patience. You cannot just hug a corner and kill 1000 incoming enemies. In my opinion this game deserves 90 points, but i will give it 100 to make up for those that did not understand this genre and were probably expecting a game where they can bunnyhop with a caliber50 and quickscope fast the enemies and maybe get a killstreak bonus. This is definately the best sniper game i have played so far. Cry Engine 3 is doing a perfect job for it. It is like a modern Delta Force game.
<br>I suggest ignoring all the zero ratings. That is just gamer&apos;s rage that has nothing to do with the game but with their own problem of not being able to feel satisfaction anymore, no matter what.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3043625">Expand</a></span>

I dropped the game at some place where an invisible sniper kills you no matter what you do. At least that&apos;s what I thought, and I had no motivation to continue at that point. There is a gun-shooting range in the game&apos;s main menu  it&apos;s as fun as the rest of the game.

                                        <span>Awful use of Cry Engine 3. On max difficulty the game lasted less than 5 hours, and multiplayer contains only 2 maps. Ballistics and gameplay are mediocre, AI behaviour is terrible and unrealistic. Bullet cam is nice, but you will see it very rarely. Death animations are the most terrible I have ever seen. Missions are straightforward and linear. Ghost Warrior looks like a bad joke.</span>

<br>Bad textures, bad story,bad environment, glitches, bad, bad, bad...Graphics in crysis one look better than this, if you are into candy stuff? I can not recall anything  that would at least make the score one or two for me.The game is cheaper than other new titles but steel hurts to find out that you just financed someones bailout in this year worst attempt in making games. Someone said that this one looksbetter than the first one, i wonder how bad that is because i didnt play it. Simply said if you are desperate for some sniper shooting, didn&apos;t play any shooter in past ten years and you are willing to throw 30$, you are on the right path and should enjoy this title.
<br>I was attracted by the engine and ended with the short stick, so if that title &quot;cry engine&quot; make you doubt  don&apos;t!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3030830">Expand</a></span>

Game is bugged, the AI is not improved at all. Save your money, get Sniper Elite V2 instead.</span>

<br>
<br>Taking distance and wind direction into consideration adds to the thrill... come to think of it, without this feature the game would probably just be another cheap sniper game worth avoiding. Getting the direction and elevation correct can be quite a challenge.
<br>Many of the missions rely on this mechanism since you are often up to a kilometre away picking off bad guys, success or failure depends on your accuracy.
<br>
<br>Atmosphere wise, this game does have a few memorable moments.
<br>Slowly drifting through shallow waters, taking out bad guys one by one from a downed aircraft near a village built aside a forest lake...
<br>Taking out bad guys from a bell tower high up while protecting your team below from enemy advances.
<br>Taking out enemies that have a team mate under hostage a kilometre away.
<br>
<br>The game is heavily scripted and linear, not much exploration or choice at all.
<br>But for this kind of game a linear scripted layout is kind of expected.

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>I&apos;ts a great sniper game. No doubt.
<br>It still have a great multiplayer mode.
<br>If you liked the first game, then you might want to try this out.
<br>Great graphics.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Nothing really new.
<br>Does not feel as good as the first game in someway.
<br>Feels more linear than the first game.
<br>Idiot AI
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>I see no reason why you should buy this game when the previous was much better.

<br>
<br>I think Anderson was a character that could have had a lot more depth to him, but as I said before this is the first game in the sniper series I&apos;ve played and more could have been revealed in earlier installments. When going through the stealth parts of the game, I did get a bit of a rush when an enemy would walk past me and stop to check if he was being watched.
<br>
<br>The HUD was nicely laid out and had a lot of detail on it, although I didn&apos;t seem to get a tutorial in how to read the wind direction and distance. This meant that much to my shame, I did rely fairly heavily on the aim assist red dot. However there was the odd occasion when the red dot hadn&apos;t come up yet and I had to take a shot myself, which was extremely satisfying.
<br>
<br>This game mixes stealth with action and patience and is pretty well balance, I think it is a good game considering it has a short story and I couldn&apos;t get the multiplayer to work!
<br>
<br>Overall I give this game 6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3189796">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The most infuriating moment has to be the mission in the swamp area, where anderson follows some guy on a stealth mission a la cpt price in cod. He will ask you to plant a c4 on a wooden house for distraction, then follow him for a short while and he will ask you to detonate the c4. I follow everything he says, and die. because the genius lead us into a bunch of enemies, and  the blast somehow reveal our location. Tried about 10 times again, still die. After that, I did it by going against his orders (if he says don&apos;t kill, just shoot anyways), and basically eliminate everyone b4 detonating the c4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3950851">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unfortunately, S:GW2 is an &quot;execution&quot; game : most of the time you follow a predefined path in the maps, and you&apos;re told which targets to kill, in what ordre. So you don&apos;t really have to worry about recon, strategy or tactic that much. It&apos;s very different from Sniper Elite where you have a lot of agency in that matter. On top of that, the game is pretty short and the storyline not that exciting.
<br>
<br>So, in solo play, it&apos;s more a &quot;filler&quot; in between more consistent games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6674630">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Presentation and writing are mediocre and clich&#xE9;d, but I was already expecting this. Otherwise, the story is not bad, and slightly more down-to-earth than most Call of Duty games of late. Levels are very linear and heavily scripted. You are guided by your spotter who stays at your side most of the time. This provides good immersion and manages to convey the sense of working as a team, but his AI is a bit unreliable when in open combat.
<br>
<br>The scripting is fairly basic and lacks some polish. There were various issues, like dialogue getting cut off, or checkpoints not reloading correctly. A few times my character would confirm over radio that I had the target in my crosshair, but the target was no where to be seen on my screen. The checkpoint save system has the usual irritations associated with such a system. It is also a pity the difficulty settings offer no more options beyond &#x201C;easy, medium, hard&#x201D; - I wanted to play &#x201C;medium&#x201D;, but without the &#x201C;red dot&#x201D; aim assist that ruins the sniping challenge. Also, once you have started, there is no option to change the difficulty later. I had a few crashes to desktop. All these issues were very annoying, but did not ruin the experience.
<br>
<br>The graphics are decent (as you would expect from the CryEngine) but do not quite have the same visual quality as the Crysis games. Some areas look really nice, but others less so. The standard quality setting are poorly optimised. I achieved much better fps after careful tweaking (tip: put &#x201C;object detail&#x201D; on low for massive fps boost and next to no quality loss).
<br>
<br>Controls are ok, but feel a bit clunky and are unresponsive in some contexts. Fortunately there is no mouse lag or acceleration. Weapon handling and ballistics are ok, but not simulator grade. The game lacks a detailed tutorial and you cannot &#x201C;zero&#x201D; the sights to various ranges like you can in ARMA and Red Orchestra 2. The simulation of wind on bullets feels artificial because the wind speed is not effectively reflected in the environment - vegetation does not respond accordingly and there are no other indicators like the sound of wind or moving dust etc. The displayed distances seem to be fake - an ingame distance of 400m is actually closer to 200m (a sin many mainstream games commit one way or another to be more accessible to console peasants). Compared to Far Cry 3, this game was clearly made on a smaller budget, with less content, freedom and polish, but in the end I still liked the single player campaign more here. It is more cohesive and serious, while Far Cry 3 was a theme park of absurd sensationalist violence.
<br>
<br>Overall this is a decent second-rate game I mildly enjoyed. I had very modest expectations, and it satisfied them. Get it when on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5818815">Expand</a></span>

<br>AI is on good level, not too stupid, but also not too smart :D
<br>Game is a little bit short, but we have a DLC, that adds next hours of gameplay. :D In the Siberia! This one is really great!

<br>
<br>For a game about sniping having technical glitches with your sniper rifle isn&apos;t a good look. Aiming at times does not work as advertised with the scope jumping wildly about for no obvious reason. Even going from standing to prone often did not resolve the issue. Another concern was the tricky &quot;if it feels like appearing&quot; red dot that is supposedly designed to help guide your shots.Would have been nice if it appeared more often even when fully on target. Lastly a big problem was on target shots  having no effect on opponents. This is especially noticeable during the scene where you face off against Marinov&apos;s snipers and soldiers. Some soldiers are almost impossible to kill.
<br>
<br>A big question all this raises is one of quality assurance. Did this game get checked and tested before release? I have to wonder.
<br>
<br>Thankfully I picked this title up for very little off EBAY as a Steam game. Nonetheless, if you are asked to pay for something, you have a reasonable expectation that is work as advertised. In my experience that was not the case with this game and as a result I can not recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7204042">Expand</a></span>

Atmosphere is very good an i had feeling that i am in that jungle , Sarajevo and Tibet. Level design is very good, and almost every screen shot is gorgeous.
<br>I  generally had very pleasant afternoon with this game.
<br>But this game lack something big.
<br>It is all way long like some kind of tutorial. Like missions in modern warfare, where you are guided by Captain Price or Soap...but in this case, all the game is in that fashion. Kill now sentry up, enemy at one o clock and all game long.
<br>So , game left  me absolutely nothing to improvise....totally scripted and linear.
<br>You can not pick fallen enemies weapons, only one rifle and pistol, that is kind of lame.
<br>Sniping is on the other hand satisfying, and kill cam is wonderful.
<br>I wish to this developers all the best , because they definitely have potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4290739">Expand</a></span>
