You have to get knocked down to really know what is important. Living on the streets for awhile gives you a real clue. Now I stop and smell the roses. I play Cultures so I won&apos;t have another nervous breakdown. CULTURES is GREAT! It helps me keep my sanity.

It is an old game, the graphics look a little silly now and some of the interface is confusing/nonfunctional (eg can&apos;t turn the game&apos;s sound off). Look past this, though, and you have a totally unique game that never got the (in my opinion, massive and unrelenting) recognition it deserved. The game is a sort of cross between the sims and age of empires; each person in the town you control has a name, a residence, a profession that they must work at to improve, and can grow up to have a husband/wife and have children. They need things like food, so you have to build networks of farms, mills, and bakeries throughout your expanding community while training ever more farmers, millers, and bakers to work at them. Improve their efficiency by gathering stone and building roads, using leather generated from cattle farms to give them shoes, or have the local potter open his supply of crockery to the public. This is not micromanagement, this is fun. With an ever expanding base of operations you will eventually be able to reach higher-tech production levels. Ships, breweries, alchemists, and, eventually, massive, raging troops of vikings set free to burn and pillage the towns of your enemies. Or just towns that happen to be close by. Not for the unimaginative.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/northland/user-reviews?user_review_id=743730">Expand</a></span>
