Asherons Call was and I think still is the best RPG game ever made.
<br>
<br>The entire game was a free roaming world of exploration. Sure at level 1 rabbits could kill you, but with enough cunning and care you could actually traverse the forests between towns by tip toeing around the edges of banderling camps! I remember the excitement and fear of edging past, hoping I wouldn&apos;t alert the nasty creature 30 levels higher than me.
<br>
<br>You could play your character in entirely your own way. You weren&apos;t restricted to pre-conceived classes like mordern RPGs  if you wanted to be a dagger wielding melee mage relying on magical shielding to help you last you could do just that. Every kill would give you xp  and skill points. No waiting to level to spend your meager advancement. Your character scaled as you played  real time. Finish a kill? Spend a point on melee defence for a few more dodges.
<br>
<br>I remember the first day creating a character and portalling into Holtburg. The community was buzzing, warm, open and friendly. Nothing like the level rushing, item hoarding online games of today. Many hours were spent just sitting in town chatting.
<br>
<br>If you didn&apos;t want to be part of a guild or community that was fine too. You could explore, survive and live in the wilderness all on your own. Finding swirling pink portals to dangerous dungeons filled with creative and interesting tunnels to explore. Some of the dungeons were so deep and dangerous that you were suddenly reminded; I ran 35 minutes to find this place. I am in the middle of nowhere. And I am alone.... If I die, I will reappear back at the damn lifestone I linked to in town.
<br>
<br>There were also the popular dungeons, crammed with other players. Backs to the wall to make full use of the shielding mechanics as the Lugians would pile in around you, blocking all escape. Better hope you don&apos;t fail on your first aid skill as wave after wave of carnage comes barreling in. Some fool unknowingly taunts a whole room and runs for his life past your corner of solace bringing in a whole new wave of death. How terrible was it to die, leaving a treasured item on your corpse deep deep within a dungeon. Would you risk travelling all the way back inside to retrieve it.... if you die, you might lose another item!
<br>
<br>Months spent hunting golems to collect pyreal motes  questing to a volcanic forge to finally craft them into a legendary atlan weapon. Then spending more months questing for the elemental stones to empower your atlan even further... Not to mention shadow armor, mattecor coats or finally completing my mages armor set! :)
<br>
<br>I only have positives to say about this game. It will forever be in my memory as the most exciting and ground breaking rpg of it&apos;s day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/asherons-call/user-reviews?user_review_id=3124194">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unlike most MMOs today, which force you into a handful of predefined factions, you log into AC as your own man and it&apos;s up to you to join a player created guild from where you will draw support, but also contribute to its success.
<br>
<br>Towns offer certain strategic advantages that make them more desirable than others. Any guild can take it over by simply making a presence and repelling any guild that does not belong from even coming in. In time other guilds know who the town belongs to and they will respect your claim or fight just because you are there. There are no perpetually spawning guards that will interfere with the game play.
<br>
<br>Death has consequences, both by a temporary ability penalty and by the loss of some of your most valuable object.
<br>
<br>The world is huge and getting from point A to point B sometimes will feel like a epic trip. Distances make organizing a raid a major strategic endeavor, and distance provide protection from your enemies.
<br>
<br>PVP skill counts. Unlike other MMOs where the character ability attributes are so steep that you can&apos;t fight another character 4 or 5 levels above you, no matter your skill, back when I played AC a level 30 could defeat a level 50 based on skill alone.
<br>
<br>The game is raw PVP. There are few restrictions placed by game mechanics.
<br>
<br>I always wonder why more people never got into it. Maybe the experience curve got to far ahead to welcome new players. Maybe most people prefer PVE and just like to collect their pretty armor and not risk anything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/asherons-call/user-reviews?user_review_id=3766355">Expand</a></span>

So I suppose this review doesn&apos;t help much. I just want to make sure that Metacritic is aware that AC was once an incredible, incredible game.</span>

If you can get by the fact that it is a retro MMO (not as massive as it once was, but has a closer community), then you might end up falling in love with AC and dereth. Some of it&apos;s additions are a bit forced, but it has monthly (sometimes more) updates and content. Bottom line it is still great fun.</span>
