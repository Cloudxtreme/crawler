I think the missions in the campaigns are boring and they needs too much time to solve, though you can save at some points. But playing in Multiplayer is big fun. You have clever opponents and you can also use power-ups to speed up your aircraft or add some firepower. It&apos;s more a 3D-Shooter than a simulation, so it&apos;s superb fun, as well if you don&apos;t have much time for playing it. my conclusion: + very nice in Multiplayer mode + good graphic and sound + Instant-Action mode + you don&apos;t need a modern pc + you don&apos;t need much time to (learn to) fly Disadvantage: you have... - ...no realism - it&apos;s poor in Singleplayer</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wings-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=376502">Expand</a></span>

Did someone ever wonder why computer games are &apos;played&apos; ? In this game is an answer ! This game is just there for you to enjoy yourselves! Nice planes to fly with. Easy to fligh. Nice heavy guns. Everything is just &apos;hop in and go&apos;. &apos;Wings of war&apos; is a very cute game. You fly the WW-one planes trying to shoot other planes, bomb ground targets (and even fire rockets, bit too much historical freedom in my opinion). Flying is not difficult here. If you try to understand the physics of flying you can play the game better. But you dont need to. This is a very &apos;pure&apos; game. A nice flight of fancy. Dont expect a &apos;greatest gaming experience&apos;. That was not intended by the makers. It is just here for you to enjoy it. And that is what I do :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wings-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=376268">Expand</a></span>
