<br>In harsh contrast to almost any shmup out there, Jamestown offers numerous bonus features at a price that is also well below almost any shmup out there.
<br>So lacking online multiplayer or not, considering the huge amount of content (while also not looking amateurish) one gets for that ridiculous price, it deserves no less than a perfect rating!
<br>And for uneducated gamers who complain about it only having a couple of levels: take a look at games like DoDonPachi Dai Ou Jou that were released as full price games for consoles or newer arcade PCBs that cost multiple hundreds of dollars!! If you&apos;re not into the genre in general and don&apos;t see a point in score hunting on the same couple of levels over and over again, that&apos;s fine - but don&apos;t act like this is expensive when nothing could be farther from the truth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724435">Expand</a></span>

I love this game, and so do my siblings who play it with me on my computer.  I love that it supports single-computer play, but I wish they&apos;d add LAN support as well.  Charming game.</span>

I heard good things about this game, but still i never liked bullet-hell shooters. So even when on sale, I kinda pushed myself to buy it. Mostly from curiosity. I was sure that it cant be so good, it&apos;s just hype. I was wrong. It is DAMN good.  Jamestown is made perfectly. Visuals, music, story... Marvelous. You&apos;ve got 4 ships to choose from. Every one requires different strategy, it&apos;s fun to master them and pick your favorite. Gameplay? Specially for less experienced players - it constantly pushes you to play higher difficulty levels.  It&apos;s necessary if You want to unlock all the chapters.  At first you can&apos;t beat a level on &quot;Normal&quot;, after an hour you&apos;re making a perfect run on &quot;Difficult&quot;. After a couple of hours it&apos;s time for &quot;Legendary&quot; and &quot;Divine&quot;. I&apos;ve got to say, I love the idea of such a &quot;shmup school&quot;. It really makes you master the game perfectly.  There&apos;s only 5 levels, but you need to re-play most of them on higher difficulties if you want to clear the game. That&apos;s not all - what about 20 challenges? Unlockable Judgement difficulty level? Unlockable Hardcore Mode? Gauntlet Mode? Lot&apos;s of fun! Hours of gameplay!  Jamestown is my game of the year. Really, screw up all the high-budget productions. All you need is talented indie developers... Such as these responsible for Jamestown. Hail to them!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=1773811">Expand</a></span>

On top of the five stages (with five difficulty levels), there are many bonus &apos;challenge levels&apos; which test your skills in various ways.  The difficulty of the game is dialed up throughout, but it&apos;s done impressively; it never seems unfair.  Some have put this game into the &apos;bullet hell&apos; sub-genre, but I don&apos;t agree with that designation at all.

The controls are tight, the visuals are well done, and the pacing is excellent.  I was never a big shoot-em-up gamer, but I can never resist the opportunity to get a cheap, independent game soaked with a thick liquor of irony.

Since many of the people writing a review for this game have evidently never played a bullet hell before, they are known for being both hard and, compared to other types of games, short.  Now that we&apos;re passed the introduction to the genre, here&apos;s what sets Jamestown apart: a whole slew of challenge levels, a unique style of combos (vaunt), and above all else, the sheer LACK of pointless BS. Really, though, the challenge levels introduce you to various aspects of the point system in a controlled setting (a point system that you don&apos;t even care about if you don&apos;t like Bullet hellz), the vaunt system makes for incredibly engaging multiplayer if you and your friends learn to protect each other, and there isn&apos;t a single out of place narrator trying to shove complicated mechanics down your gullet.  I rate very few games as highly as I rate Jamestown, but if you like Tohou or Exceed, you really have to pick this game up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=3424307">Expand</a></span>

Sadly, the game is just way too short with not much replay value. Once you beat the game, there are some challenge levels and modes, but honestly these become very frustrating more than challenging. Warning: the mouse is horrible for this game; only use a gamepad! Regardless, for a couple bucks Jamestown is a good experience. You&apos;ll remember your time with it, half because of the crazy setting (that totally works!) and half because of the crazy frustration at the mandatory higher difficulty levels. Did I mention the music is phenomenal? The world-class soundtrack alone makes the game worth buying. Overall a solid 7.5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=2026281">Expand</a></span>

There are five campaign levels that must be beaten in Legendary difficulty in order for the player to advance. This difficulty level is appropriate for the first four levels, but on the fifth and final level, this design choice becomes a problem and a hindrance. The last level is so difficult, I consider it to be poorly designed and most importantly, inadequate. It is as if the designers realized they did not have much of a game in their hands, and decided to make the final fifth level nearly unbeatable, in order to excuse the amount of time necessary to complete the campaign. Sure, there are bonus modes/levels to be unlocked, but they are merely side distractions, that do not provide the player with additional entertainment or value. Jamestown is simply too short, in addition to one of its five levels being extremely poor. To add to this insult, the developers have released an expensive DLC for an already overpriced base game, that adds very little. The limited amount of continues is also another bad design choice because of the terrible last level. In the end, the player is left with a clear understanding that the developers resorted to a cheap and unimaginative means of prolonging Jamestown&apos;s lifespan by making it artificially and unusually difficult in the last level. Through this, it is very quick to realize that this game does not involve much, and the developers should be ashamed of themselves for charging so much for so little content. There are innumerable amounts of games of this same genre that are incomparably better, and most are more than 20 years older. Jamestown is a prime example of independent developers taking advantage of the scene and overcharging consumers for content that is extremely scarce, poorly implemented, and quite limited. There is very little to do, very little to experience, and very little to enjoy. Jamestown can be beaten in less than one hour, and there are many other games that have a much better value than this. What a waste.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=2156913">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t remember why, but I&apos;m sorry I did, and I thank Steam&apos;s christmas objectives for making me get it, because it&apos;s an amazing little game. The originality of it&apos;s premise (Sir Walter Raleigh and company ON MARS!) it&apos;s lovingly hand-drawn art and sprites, challenging gameplay and amazing soundtrack combine to create a truly excellent experience. In a time where so few games are even deserving to be called such rather then pointless wastes of time, boring grindfests or immersions in human aggression and stupidity, Jamestown invites you away from all that and takes you back on a wondrous, if brief journey to the golden age of gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=6508014">Expand</a></span>

The Bonuses feature of the game illustrates this incredibly<br><br>Speaking of features, this game gives you as much variety as it can in how to play it.  First, there&apos;s 5 difficulty levels.  Next, there&apos;s 5 separate levels of the game to conquer.  You can opt to play the game gauntlet style, where as you finish levels you just keep flying right into the next one; or you can play it chapter by chapter.  You earn points and money to buy new guns, ships, and even to unlock new gameplay.<br><br>Graphics:<br><br>This game proves, like so many other indie titles, that flashy graphics aren&apos;t important.  The art style of the game, while very 32-bit in nature, is compelling nonetheless.  However, if you have poor vision, it might be tricky at first discerning interactive foreground from the background (the color scheme for some stages makes this non-obvious at first, but once you get through the levels you&apos;ll learn).<br><br>Overall:<br><br>Excellent casual and competitive game!  This will be one indie title players buy this year that are worth it&apos;s weight in gold.  Gameplay is fun and simple, yet has competitive depth.  There&apos;s no losers when you buy this game.  It&apos;s definitely a must-own.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=1701009">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty is set below Touhou&apos;s brutality, but the hardest difficulties will still challenge the experienced vertical shooter enthusiast. You, and up to 3 other friends, can all play on screen as any of 4 different ships with their own special abilities through 5 story levels and numerous challenge levels.<br><br>The atmosphere of Jamestown is superb and the only thing holding it back is its lack of ONLINE multiplayer. Unfortunately, it only supports local multiplayer, meaning you need to have some gamepads and other input devices if you want to play with all your friends.<br><br>Don&apos;t let this stop you from enjoying this worthwhile arcade shooter throwback.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=1693822">Expand</a></span>

The price tag of $10 USD on Steam is well worth the many hours of co-op fun with friends that you will have.<br><br>The only complaint I can make is that to progress further into the game you must play the game at harder and harder difficulty settings. This makes the game challenging and sometimes frustrating to the point where some levels feel like they simply cannot be beaten without a co-op partner, or two. See while all players share the same continue pool, so long as one player stays alive until the others revive from the dead, no continue is used. At very late stages in the game this mechanic is vital to the successful completion of missions with partners.<br><br>The other complaint is that the final level contains such an abundance of instant death walls and traps it feels like poor level design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765263">Expand</a></span>

I got it on sale for 5 bucks so I&apos;m not too disappointed. The game play is solid, the level are fun, colorful and hectic, the story has a sort of bizarre charm to it, but there are a couple of key components that really turn me off. The game requires you replay missions on higher difficulties just to unlock missions 4 and 5 (which are the last two levels). And even though I made it to the end, the last mission is so difficult, it isn&apos;t very fun. That would be completely forgivable if the store feature was actually worth the trouble. Basically you earn money that is used to pay for things like extra ships and bonus challenges. A great idea in concept, but the last two ships you unlock are pure crap! I don&apos;t mind the short length of the game and I actually enjoyed the challenge (the final mission excluded) so it makes me want to hit my fist against my desk when a game with so much potential falls short. With a few minor fixes this game is a 9/10. None the less, the ship I did use was great fun and the levels are hard core, so if you don&apos;t think the above mentioned negatives will bother you, buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=1731552">Expand</a></span>

The story seemed like a tacky add on but I thought it was a nice level transition and gave the game a purpose. I was happy with it up until it started requiring that I beat all the prior levels on a harder difficulty in order to move on. Having kept a decent pace and feeling pleased with having beat the previous levels I was annoyed that I would have to replay them on a more difficult setting. I felt it was something that should have been initially clear so that I was repeating levels unnecessarily. After trying levels repeatedly due to a stupid error on my part it became clear to me why games like this no longer exist. They are exciting to an extent but get redundant quickly. Sure there are new environments but as the foes are principally the same I felt there was really no variety. I enjoyed the game but the difficulty locking seemed a lackluster way to implement more difficult bosses. Now that I&apos;ve beat it I probably will not play it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=2687252">Expand</a></span>

<br>but the game jamestown is a killer in it&apos;s genre. absolutely cool soundtrack. nice graphics in a cool setting (1619 and youre fighting marsians...thats cool!). totally challenging gameplay in a fair way. also the kinda short story is very nice and alternate mode is there to be unlocked.
<br>
<br>there are to few levels maybe, but challenges and gauntlet mode plus the obligatory achievements will keep one playing a lot of hours.
<br>
<br>lack of online coop sucks a lot, but would maybe be frustrating due to lags.
<br>when having enough space around your pc the cooperative mode is extremely cool and the social aspect of gaming with your nerdy friends in one room is great.
<br>
<br>all in all its one great game, especially for the price. and the hard diffilcultys will make you shout angry words towards the monitor</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=3996238">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What people don&apos;t realise is probably the amount of work that this small team has put into its challenge modes and the absolutely amazing choreography of the enemy ships, and uniquely painted terrain of each level. The music was also nothing short of fantastic and fitting for the game.
<br>
<br>The controls feels just right, and the visual response (when bullets hit an ally or enemy) are spot-on, if you were to compare this game to most shooters out there, there&apos;s sometimes the lack of &quot;oomph&quot; in this area. Clearly the creators put a lot of thought and tested a lot of things to get the details right.
<br>
<br>Lastly, the game mechanics are simple yet fun. A casual danmaku fan like myself had no difficulty or complaints with it, and heck I introduced this game to all my colleagues (who have rarely or never played shmups before) and all of them loved it. For what it&apos;s worth, you won&apos;t be disappointed with this game, if you&apos;re looking for hours of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=4016484">Expand</a></span>

Not only because it&apos;s a lot of fun with pretty 2D pixel art graphics, it&apos;s also the well balance difficulty that give a great replay value. The others popular Shmups are usually insanely-killthefunofit-hard. Jamestown is just right.</span>

It also has a strong sense of accomplishment, presenting what looks like an impossible challenge but making all the threats very clear and obvious. Despite its status as a bullet hell shooter, the visual design is very clean and smooth, keeping things from getting too washed out and unclear. Only on the rare occasion do you feel like you were hit by something you couldn&apos;t possibly have seen, instead usually feeling like you screwed up and can do better. It&apos;s one of the best local coop games on Steam currently, both nostalgic while new, smooth, and slick. Definitely worth giving a go if you have a few someones hanging around you can strap down for long enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jamestown-legend-of-the-lost-colony/user-reviews?user_review_id=5666008">Expand</a></span>
