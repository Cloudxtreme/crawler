It is beautiful (awesome females characters!). And you can level up to three character classes at the same time. The PvP option alone is going to be epic, at least once the game has some veterans (it has just launched, and I think most people are still focusing on their low level characters. lol.). One very nice thing about this game is that you can play it very easily, at first, but you can also become super skilled if you try to control each of three characters individually using strategy and all the stances and skills at your command. And I don&apos;t know if anyone mentioned this in their reviews yet but you can try this game totally for FREE. That is how I heard about it, cause I love free games. I have never seen anything this awesome that you can try for free. If you love MMORPGs and you are tired of the same old fantasy ones with trolls and you want to have a variety of gameplay options with so many characters, then check this out. Do yourself a big favor, though, and go to the website (I think it is just the name of the game and then .com) and get into the forums and read. You will want to talk to other people so you can learn how to play and why this is a real 10. Sleeper hit of the summer, people. Do not miss out!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-new-world-granado-espada/user-reviews?user_review_id=399644">Expand</a></span>

UPCs add a new flavor to the game, without being game breakingly powerful. But, try the game for yourself, before listing to anyone&apos;s opinion. K2 offers a F2P version, where you can get to level 20 before you stop getting experience and drops.

The art is fantastic, and the multi character control can lead to tactical movement which could keep this game interesting for a long time; however the world falls short in it&apos;s quests. The quests are so bland and generic. (95% of the quests I have seen thus far have all been of the &quot;Go kill this many of this&quot; variety.) Simply writing in interesting quests would perk this game up so much. The other problem is the enemy re-spawn rate. The enemies respawn so fast that most tactical maneuvers will result in you getting flanked of ambushed by monsters you killed mere seconds ago. The character costume options present a nice variety, but there are no options in physical features. I feel like I MUST own a hat to hide the fact that my hair looks exactly the same as every other character of the same class. This game has so very much potential, and all of it&apos;s issues could be fixed in a simple patch, I&apos;m ready to give it a 10 in a moment&apos;s notice. It&apos;s so frustrating when a game comes this close to being great.

SoundTeMP is great at what he/she/it does. Graphics - 8/10, Beautiful graphics, good weapon effects. Controls - 8/10, Good controls, but the Scout frequently doesn&apos;t want to listen when you tell him what to do. The fact that you control three characters means that it takes a longer amount of time than one would want in order to get them into a position that would be considered strategic, which isn&apos;t a good thing when you&apos;re PvPing. Gameplay - 5/10, Typical grind. The afk leveling system makes it so that people who put in hard work don&apos;t get rewarded. The game basically plays itself in that regard. The gameplay&apos;s only saving grace is that you can control 3 characters, but that might be a curse for some people. Itemization - 4/10, Items on an &quot;every 4 levels&quot; basis. Not good. Complete lack of variety, extremely low amount of uniques and elites. Abysmal drop rates in most areas. Basically, the game is good, until mid level when you really start to feel the grind. One would hope they would see the light and do away with the AFK leveling system and turn down the grind instead, or add an offline exp system a-la EVE Online, but alas, this doesn&apos;t seem to be the case.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-new-world-granado-espada/user-reviews?user_review_id=400100">Expand</a></span>

You need to understand that the game is going to take lots of time to level. However unliked most games that have a major grind, the combat system in SOTNW(sword of the new world) is intense. In a normal game where a dungeon would have 5 monsters in a room, sotnw will have 50 - 60 on 30 second timers. Leading to rather crazy moments of desperation when entering a new dungeon thats a bit higher level than you. SOTNW also have an open pvp system. As you level your characters contribute points to your family level, like exp. Once you reach family level 6 your able to attack other players who are family level 6. You will most likely be in your 60&apos;s or 70&apos;s though by this time, so it gives new comers plenty of time to adjust to the game and its mechanics. Duels are available and ranked. There are self made arenas that can support 1 v 1 up to 16 v 16 and any combination in between. Clans can take colonys and fight over them, and there are clan wars where clans can openly attack each other untill a truce is signed. This gives TONS of pvp options for everyone from the soloist to the zerger. However what makes SOTNW really shine is the Multi Character Control System or MCC. In most MMO&apos;s you control one toon, in SOTNW you control 3. (You also can still only use 1 or 2 toons, but your success will be limited). There are 5 starting characters that you can make, and as you do quests for NPC&apos;s occasionally one will give you his or her card and ask you to call them if you need help. You then can create them as one of your characters. These cards are called Unique Player Characters, and there are somewhere around 25 - 30 of them in the game. Each of these UPC&apos;s are different than the starting 5. some have more different skills, and some have combinations. All have their strengths and weaknesses and unlike other MMO&apos;s were there is a cookie cutter spec or group... in SOTNW its rather open as all are extremely effective. I would strongly recommend giving this game a shot, its Free to Play till level 20 giving you a rough idea of the game, and then can be converted to Pay to Play for only 9 dollars and that covers your first month subscription, witch is only 9 bucks a month. Almost half of the current mmo&apos;s pricing. See you in the new world!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-new-world-granado-espada/user-reviews?user_review_id=400075">Expand</a></span>

Can you say repetitive over and over again? That&apos;s killing things that keep respawning right in front of you over and over. One another thing reminds me of Evercamp (tm). They claim they ban BOTs users, but there must be plenty of them playing this sort of game. This is the kind of game you can go to sleep and wake up and your guys are still there grinding like there&apos;s no tomorrow! Slow grind you bet! Play this only if you&apos;re a boring person who enjoys boring games. Graphics don&apos;t make a game. A good story, gameplay variety and choices. About choices, you only have about 4 different toons faces (male/female) for the 4 classes. That&apos;s it. Utterly boring. The only upside is that you can play 3 toons at once instead of the usual solo toon, your alter ego. Those who gives it a higher score than what I give are truly desperate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-new-world-granado-espada/user-reviews?user_review_id=401695">Expand</a></span>

And the music sounds like it cant possibly be coming from an online game. The ability to use 3 characters, all of which have loads of skills, adds a large amount of strategy to game.</span>

Gameplay is rather straightforward, multi-character control or no, and despite a glowing beginning to this game, the game eventually degenerates into the level grind typical of most Korean MMOs. Some of the most annoying things about this game include a cumbersome chat interface and a decreased need for other people to party with since you have the three members of your family to control, this game is more for the power-leveler rather than the social RPer. Also (as of this comment at least), the horrible translations. I play the North American version, and in it, most of the higher level NPCs have some of the most annoying Chingrish I have ever seen in an MMO.

Not a bad game in some respects, but suffers because it will be judged relative to the competition:very limited character customization, but what few options you have are very nice looking (unless you want a heterosexual, masculine-looking hero, in which case look elsewhere); gameplay: a terrible grind, but if you are accustomed to such, or enjoy it, then that&apos;s not a problem. Gameplay at low levels is almost autopilot, but it does get more complex later on. The multi-character control system is neat, but the characters themselves lack distinction and it&apos;s not very easy to manage multiple characters. Storyline hints at greatness but falls flat all too often, and some quests are enigmatic and poorly localized. Music is purely awesome one minute and the worst Asian pop music the next. Overall, this is not a bad game by any stretch, it just looks worse in comparison to other titles. Worth checking out for an idea of what Diablo would be like with multi-character MMO play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-new-world-granado-espada/user-reviews?user_review_id=401713">Expand</a></span>
