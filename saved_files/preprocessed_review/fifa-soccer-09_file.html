FIFA 08 was just a crappy ass brush up of FIFA 07(great game), but it was made worse. It was really laggy and with choppy gameplay. Like I said at first it looked like FIFA 09 was the same, because it only utilizes one core of my Core 2 Duo Cpu, I dont know why. But then I decided I would give it a go and it growed on me. The new mouse and keyboard controls are absolutely awesome! They give very nice control and precision like never before. The close-up visuals are also very nicely done and looks great. I hope they can fix the problem with the game only running on one core, because that would make it run a lot smoother!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-09/user-reviews?user_review_id=417928">Expand</a></span>

It finally has a &quot;next-gen&quot; graphics engine--which makes a huge difference. The new EA Live feature is finally a system that updates player stats in relation to their real-life form--something that should have been implemented easily in all sports titles 3 years ago. That being said, there are plenty of bugs to make the gameplay clunky at times. The keeper is still super vulnerable at the close post and godly at the back post, there is still plenty of randomness involved in many aspects of field play, and (possibly worst of all) the game shipped without full support for almost ANY game pad controller. Everyone will have to go into the game files themselves and edit some of the code to force the game to use your gamepad/joystick correctly (see the fifa forums for the complicated instructions on how to do this). That being said, the game is very good and probably the best soccer title to date. You will just have to look at its good side, fix the support for your controllers, and get over the rest of the smaller bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-09/user-reviews?user_review_id=418450">Expand</a></span>
