<br>You dont play a single character, you play a branch in your family tree. You will begin with an almost useless character and quickly find out that evil castles can be deadly. But hopefully you got the chance to gather some gold for your dear descendants, because they will continue the quest.
<br>
<br>And thats basically the game. You gather gold, upgrade your family castle in order to improve your fighters and crafting items, die, die again, die some more, gather gold and die.
<br>
<br>The game itself feels fresh, interesting and is initially very addictive, but it actually gets old pretty quickly. The lack of story that makes it me wonder why im still entering evil castles generation after generation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3249255">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In RL, you&apos;re effectively grinding the game to get gear, stats, and abilities for the &quot;over-game&quot;  which is the point in which you actually have a shot in Hell of getting through to the final area. There are a few glitches here and there, usually which&apos;ll kill you by, for example, having a character apparently undecided if he&apos;s on or off a ledge, so he can&apos;t jump  but dying is fun.
<br>
<br>RL adds quite a bit of fun easter egg type content throughout the castles to ensure things are always fresh, and that you always want to explore. The best part about this content is that it&apos;s very rare. You can die 50 times and never see more than a small handful of the &quot;fun&quot; rooms, so the freshness of these unique rooms doesn&apos;t wear off quickly like if you were seeing repeats so often, they become &quot;normal.&quot;
<br>
<br>I would say, if you like games similar to Binding of Isaac or Nethack, you&apos;ll appreciate the intentional imbalance in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3253568">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What I found instead was a very poorly deigned fighting game with atrocious platforming. The jump controls are awful, and it all feels so floaty and poorly done.
<br>
<br>The combat. Well, you have a few spells that are either not that useful or just taken straight from Castlevania. The actual sword combat is crap too.  Only a few characters can block, and that takes up MP, so that makes it mostly useless.  Enemy attacks are very hard to avoid thanks to the floaty jumps and the fact that you often have several coming at you at once, making them unavoidable. Thankfully the stunlock has a good invincibility length, so that somewhat lowers the frustration. A major problem seems to be fighting anyone or anything that is slightly above or below you.  jump attacks are dodgy, at best, and more often than not just result in you getting hit. The combat never fells like you are actually physically hitting things, and this, what should have been the main thing in a fighting game, just feels very amateur.
<br>
<br>The difficulty just feels too artificial as well. It&apos;s not a game made hard by good design to make it challenging but not frustrating. It&apos;s just hard because they throw loads of enemies at you and give you crap ways to fight them
<br>
<br>Now, we have the major selling point of the game. The hero legacy, where when your character dies and his or her heirs take up the fight, but with new and improved bonuses that your previous generations have unlocked.  An epic time line of heroes fighting to overcome the evil castle, getting stronger and stronger. Shame it&apos;s crap as well. there is ZERO sense of connection to the previous characters.  This in no way feels like a line of heroes fighting, just some random characters kicked out of some random number generator. It is, in essence, a very crap levelling system. You go in with a terribly underpowered character, get some gold, and when you die (Which will be soon) you spend some money on upgrades so you can repeat this seemingly endless progress.  There is no sense of progress, it&apos;s just grinding done poorly. Even upgrading the manor is taken from a cool idea into a levelling up menu.
<br>Even the randomness of the castle doesn&apos;t help the grinding feel of the game. It changes a lot each time, but seeing as you do pretty much the exact same thing and each room in an area looks exactly the same regardless of shape, it never feels like I am exploring a whole new level each time. Just one where they&apos;ve muddled stuff around so it doesn&apos;t flow together well.
<br>
<br>The end result is a game that just isn&apos;t all that fun and has a very poor feel to it. Bad controls, bad combat, bad levelling system disguised as another feature it isn&apos;t.
<br>The graphics are nice, the sounds are good and I give it a bonus point for it&apos;s portrayal of homosexuality. In fact, I may say it&apos;s one of the best I&apos;ve seen in a game. I take that point back again after it uses disability&apos;s as a joke for it&apos;s traits. &quot;We wanted to show anyone can be a hero&quot; You don&apos;t do that by making fun of serious conditions for a few laughs
<br>Overall, a title with great promise let down by very sloppy execution</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3251557">Expand</a></span>

Good idea to have new character each game. You can choose clones of your previous character. It will be nice a seems to be promising idea, which allows you to make different after each death.
<br>But game play is like incorrectly finish student work. Terrible jumping, for simple tasks you need multiple keys what ruins character control. enemies can shoot during walls, jump everywhere, fly everywhere. There is missing any way how to improve game difficulty. It&apos;s like last level of game with hard difficulty after first door. Is useless to buy new weapons, as they can do only small damage and you have to be close to enemy.
<br>Enemies are not colliding with you, you are transparent for them. If you hit them with weapon, they just blink and continue in movement to target - YOU. In reality you have only 1 hit to kill them, otherwise they will start killing you. Because your body is transparent, you have to jump away. And again you have to hit them once and jump away. And here is another black point - character control.
<br>There are sometimes only terrible platforms which is possible to activate only when you jump, release space, press down key and click left mouse button. I think is really hard to make control more complicated....
<br>And this is where I finished. I don&apos;t want to play game, where I have to fight with control. At this moment I can only say, very good idea was killed with terrible character control and wrong level/creature design. I&apos;m going to play mark of ninja, limbo, trine 2, prehistoric 2, titus the fox. These game is no match for them.
<br>I want to have delete game from library button on Steam !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3971374">Expand</a></span>

<br>Rogue Legacy is an addictive rogue-like game, but its lack of variety makes it boring quickly. The controls aren&apos;t extremely reactive and the gameplay isn&apos;t enough deep. Could have been better, but if you love the extremely hard games, you&apos;ll appreciate it. VIRTUALINN.IT</span>

<br>
<br>what i personally do not like is the art-style; but maybe i am just tired of the &quot;wanne-be-nostalgic-retro-look&quot; which  just too often feels like they were too lazy or uninspired to make it better looking.  the 8 bit or is it 16 bit look does not do much to the game play other than being a reminder of games from another era. (yes, i know that was probably the intention)
<br>
<br>in terms of game play, i wished there was more attachment to my char. it is just a &quot;bit&quot; too short lived. i did not care for any of my chars  like at all. and while it is an aspect of the game to go through heirs like nothing  a little bit more attachment would have done nicely  and with that in mind  maybe a bit more longevity.
<br>
<br>also the balance between the classes and characteristics are not well enough.  some are worthless, some are really just a joke. there was a feature wasted imo  an AI that would evaluate the progression of what the player picks and determines a sort of evolution due to &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;  along with a lot more characteristics.
<br>
<br>but in the end  after a while, you start to wonder why you seem to grind as if it was an old school mmo. there is little to explore or be surprised about and it becomes a bit repetitive.
<br>but every game has flaws, every game can be better  but for me, RL is but an average plat-former with very good ideas that are not fully realized.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3507914">Expand</a></span>

This game is not what a true rl game should be. Now I&apos;ll expand on that thought.
<br>
<br>First requirement for the rl game is a permadeath. Well this game doesn&apos;t have it. Instead it &quot;fakes&quot; death in order to reroll some of the stats in a way that usually doesn&apos;t change a single thing. Character doesn&apos;t loose progress, as this game&apos;s only progressing parts are upgrades. He simply gets reborn as a farting balding female...
<br>
<br>However the one thing that gets lost is money, which makes the game all the more frustrating. As frankly you will die well over a hundred times w/o having a chance to upgrade anything, often being 1 or 2 gold short of the damned n k gold upgrades. Even more times you will have more than enough money to buy all the equipment you have already bought several times over, wishing you found a new blueprint or rune during the last run.
<br>
<br>Deaths may have been less often if the controls were actually precise or at least semi-accurate. Yet again, there is a huge &quot;NO&quot; painted all over the screen. You will bump into monsters, fall on the spikes, miss your aerial drop-hits and &quot;enjoy&quot; deathscreens again and again. Game doesn&apos;t challenge you with monsters hard to fight, it challenges you with controls that make monsters hard to fight.
<br>
<br>To make it worse, after dying you let your heir wander the castle. Going through exactly the same places, just in the different order. And again. And again. And again. And again. Quite fun isn&apos;t it? And again. And again. Getting slightly boring? Nah... And again. And again. And again. RAAAGE. Thats what the game feels like after a few hours of playing. Very soon player gets the idea that there is NO exploration at all. Maya at the top forest to the right, dungeon below. Now just wander through around 100 similar rooms  bam! game ended, there is the King slayer. Unless you enjoy heavy-duty grinding most likely you will have to quit for a bit, maybe look out of the window to make sure world outside is actually diverse.
<br>
<br>But thats not all there is. Classes are the same. Absolutely. Ninja/Archmage/Paladin  who cares? You will not get to use different play-styles. Its all the same jump-hack-spell routine. And there is only a little handful of overall useless spells. The ones that actually matter cost a lot of mana and make you burn through your bar in mere moments.
<br>
<br>Boss fights. You will be hit. It is impossible to kill bosses without being hit. So if your gear is low you won&apos;t be able to outskill them. It is simply not possible. So in order to kill them you have to have a gear of at least level n, where n was set by devs. And yeah, it won&apos;t work trying to go up from start, or left, or down for that matter. You MUST level to win. And to level you need gold... and so on, etc., etc.
<br>
<br>Overall I severely disliked the game. While I was waiting for an interesting roguelike sidecrawler, I got an  annoying boring meatgrinder with terrible controls, somewhat nice graphics and almost impossible to notice music.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3294282">Expand</a></span>

The graphics suck, and this is coming from someone who loves retro styled graphics, but Rogue Legacy&apos;s character and level designs just suck. If you like getting cheapshotted by traps and the endless amounts of flying enemies, then this game is perfect for you. The difficulty is punishing with absolutely no rewards for the player. Also, the price of this game is ridiculous. I got it at 66% off on Steam, and it was still $15, so you&apos;re not really getting value for money. You probably won&apos;t want to play this game for hours on end, it&apos;s really only playable in ten to twenty minutes bursts, which makes it a crappy non-portable game. I am seriously getting tired of developers choosing to make games punishingly difficult with no reward in it for the player and/or not adding more difficulty levels. I would have given this game a 7 if they had added difficulty levels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3577042">Expand</a></span>

With each death accumulated (money) progress is lost so the game basically wastes your time by denying any progress. You might die 20-30 times before you luck-out and get enough money to get an upgrade. Don&apos;t waste your time with this garbage.</span>

Yes, the designers were going for a retro pixel art look, but frankly they just didn&apos;t do a very good job. Animations are clunky, character designs are silly, and foregrounds and backgrounds are utilitarian at best. I hate to say it, but this looks like a game that was put together by a team of programmers doing double duty as artists. It&apos;s passable, but barely.
<br>
<br>Visuals aside, the game fares better in the gameplay department. The controls (using a 360 controller) are fluid and responsive, exploration is rewarding, combat is well balanced and the boss fights are well done. This is a challenging game, but the developers did a great job walking the tightrope between frustration and enjoyment. This is what gives the game its initial appeal and keeps you playing for at least a few hours. Each time you die you&apos;ll keep saying &quot;just one more try,&quot; looking to gather more money and upgrade your character.
<br>
<br>In the end though the game just isn&apos;t that fun. It really turns into a huge grind. The more difficult bosses are pretty much impossible unless you&apos;ve purchased a ton of upgrades, so that means countless runs through pretty much the same areas over and over and over again. Yes, the world is randomly generated each time you play (unless you lock it down), but it&apos;s always the same general layout and is always built from the same drab components. Boredom kicks in very quickly as you realize there&apos;s nothing much to see and hardly any plot to carry things forward. The gimmicky &quot;traits&quot; that affect your chosen character don&apos;t do much and can often be annoying. Who wants to play with the screen inverted? Nobody. You&apos;ll try it once for a minute and then never ever pick a character with that trait again.
<br>
<br>The random nature of character selection can be frustrating as well, because you&apos;ll mostly want to pick a character class that fits with the upgrades you&apos;ve been buying. Rolling three mages after pouring all your points into fighting skills is a huge pain. Yes, you can unlock a skill that allows you to reroll the character select screen once, but you&apos;re not going to get that until later on, if at all. Even then, your reroll might not be any good.
<br>
<br>In closing I&apos;d say Rogue Legacy is worth picking up just to experience the fluid gameplay and kill a few hours. Wait for it to go on sale though. I think the price is steep in light of the many flaws in the game and its variable quality level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3268940">Expand</a></span>

A veritable grind-fest, the game is super difficult in a very, very bad way. Instead of ramping up the difficulty using clever level design and interesting enemies the devs decided that more enemies (boring enemies) is the only way to go. Everything has pretty much been said by other reviewers, so I will just quickly reiterate some of the key issues: difficulty through bad design, useless traits that are just gimmicks that become tedious after just one play, insanely grindy to the point of being savagely boring unless you are a grind fan, random level design promising endless hours of fun is indeed random, but the original boring design makes randomness also boring, floatiness and response times make keyboard useless and some controllers needlessly hard to use (my Rumblepad 2 for example, good for pretty much any other game) and there is more but I am getting bored, just like with the game after 5 hours of playing. Good music, nice graphics, some clever ideas, but overall only for grind fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3283558">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Rogue Legacy is what I have come to expect from recent indie garbage: a repetitive, over-randomized, bullet-hell spamfest with shoehorned &quot;rogue-like&quot; elements and hideous graphics that has no redeeming values apart from being a FOTM for streamers &amp; Youtube &quot;celebrities&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833852">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is far from easy, designed to be a &quot;Rogue-Like&quot; game where upon each death, you have to start over and delve once again into the randomly generated castle.
<br>
<br>However, Cellar Door Games have lightened this hardcore feature in a creative and intelligent way through their Lineage System, allowing a sense of advancement and progression in a game fundamentally about perma-death and skill runs.
<br>
<br>Upon each death, you are asked to choose an heir to your legacy. Your heir inherits the gold collected on your previous runs and can use it to upgrade Castle Components for new classes and permanent benefits, Forge New Weapons and Armor with statistical upgrades and powers and Enchant Runes that slot into each piece of equipment which grant you important skills to customize your character to your play style. All these upgrades carry forward to each heir in succession, slowly growing your legacy and power and allowing you to more quickly dispatch enemies and make more and more progress.
<br>
<br>Humorous randomly assigned Traits (some cosmetic, some debilitating, some extremely beneficial) keep things fresh and endearingly hilarious on each run. This allows you to stay invested until your skills are good enough that the challenge of the level matches your understanding of the system and you to begin to use strategy to plan our your next assault  choosing the hero with the class, traits or spells that would best suit your next run&apos;s goals.
<br>
<br>Secret Areas, Chests and Skill Based Challenges make each new room of the castle an intriguing surprise as you hope for another armor blueprint, magic rune, or pile of gold that will allow you to purchase more upgrades and finally defeat that next ridiculous boss that has haunted you for generations.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s nostalgia value, smooth, simple controls and delightful humor draw you in, and it&apos;s upgrade and advancement system keeps you eagerly playing. The game overall is an impressive, innovative and rewarding title and aside from the difficulty, there is little not to like about this incredible indie game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3251447">Expand</a></span>

It really caught my interest when I saw it initially because I&apos;m a huge fan of the castlevania games (both old and new style) and thought this would be something like that. It&apos;s a shame the developers spent so much time on all the features of the game without making the core gameplay fun. The character physics feel a bit too floaty and could really benefit from some heft to the movement and jumping. Additionally the whole game is tuned way too sensitively so even small movements will send you further than you&apos;d like and you&apos;ll end up bumping you against enemies (which makes you take damage by the way) as you jump for attacks.
<br>
<br>Additionally the whole lineage system is gimmicky and poorly thought out. Instead of actually giving you interesting gameplay choices, most of the characters have cosmetic, annoying attributes instead. I find myself avoiding traits like color blind and near-sightedness because its stupid to play a game with a filter that obstructs your vision. These guys needed to really nail down the core of the game before they started adding superficial BS to the game that makes it even worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3261883">Expand</a></span>

The hero and his long line of decedents are on the quest to track down and kill Johannes; the immortal traitor who escaped into a shape shifting castle and cannot escape. Seems strange to go after him, but the family-line seems too vengeful to care. But story doesn&#x2019;t matter much here, it&#x2019;s all about gameplay! Let&#x2019;s see how this fish flops.
<br>In the grand tradition of rogue-likes you have one life. However, this one life is not meant to last you the game. Instead it&#x2019;s a money-bag. Your goal is to loot the castle for as much money and upgrades as you stuff in a suit of armor. Instead of attempting to beat the game on one life, you are expected to die until you amassed enough gold to purchase the best equipment available and smite everything in yawn-inducing short fashion. However, gold cannot be horded as Charon, the castle guardian, demands that you fork over all your hard earned coin as an entrance fee. This means ill-fated runs that fail to produce a new upgrade mean nothing. In a game where you are expected to increase in power steadily, multiple &quot;empty&quot; runs can be particularly disheartening.
<br>But wait! It wouldn&#x2019;t be rouge-like without something random, right? Characters are randomly generated before each play through and have 0-2 traits and a class. Traits may be anything from P.A.D, which disables traps, to Baldness, which changes a few in game texts, to vertigo, which renders the game nearly unplayable. Classes have a few advantage and disadvantages to mold to an archetype like &#x201C;mage&#x201D; or &#x201C;barbarian&#x201D;. Mages have good magic attack but crummy physical stats. Barbarians can take more damage, but don&#x2019;t have poor magic stats.
<br>Despite the &quot;randomly generated&quot; dungeons, the room-types are in short supply. It feels more like the rooms are shuffled rather than generating a whole new set of challenges. Within an hour of play, I came across all the rooms available in the first stage. In addition, the game gives the illusion that you can choose different routes to play different states in whatever order you like a la Megaman. The reality is that it is best to go in a set pattern as enemies can evaporate the hero in a single hit if not upgraded properly.
<br>Enemies are rather dull and fall into two types- laughably easy melee beefcakes or projectile spamming cannons. As the game progresses you fight the same enemies with more beef and more projectile. Patterns are simple, which isn&apos;t bad, but most enemies have little thought in placement and are punching bags riding on player error in order to sneak a sword swing or a projectile in.
<br>Bosses are as exciting as the enemies and simply regurgitate large heavy-hitting projectiles and enemies in easily avoidable patterns. Like the enemies, they bank on human error rather than having the player learn a set of patterns or have gamepad dexterity and reaction. The final Boss is an exception and does prove to be moderately fun.
<br>In the end, the game is not challenging but punishing. The game punishes a player for not having &#x201C;stats X&#x201D; or dieing too early. The game can be summed as one giant grindfest where the bosses are gear checks and little skill is needed on the player&#x2019;s part once enough upgrades and equipment have been acquired. This game is for those who enjoy grinding for hours to work up to point where a player can easily smash through the game in a laughable fashion. For me, not only is this magic play though too little in entertainment value, but asks for too much time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3282956">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m sure i would be dazzled by the amazing and expansive upgrade system if i could get enough gold to upgrade. now i am determined to get good with these horrible controls and do better. this game is addictive but i don&apos;t see myself ever beating all the bosses just because i don&apos;t have the patience to sit through hours of the same  and dying over and over. i like difficulty but i like it when i am challenged by things other than controls movement and money  things that are supposed to help you in games   so maybe... just maybe if i get better with the controls i will start to enjoy this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3267921">Expand</a></span>

If you die, you can only spend the gold that you have, otherwise you&apos;ll lose it at the point you enter the castle. Long story short: you grind. If you&apos;d invest the time in a MMO-RPG you&apos;d be more successful with your character there. The only positive thing about that game is that it&apos;s not pay to win.
<br>
<br>How can you give a game like that perfect score? Rogue Legacy is the worst try to bind someone on his PC for a long time. While the artstyle is really nice to see and the people creating the sound really did a great work, neither the game mechanics nor the gameplay are innovative or &quot;new&quot; as some people here mention. Briefly, at a certain point the game you realize that all you do is grinding around senselessly, hit things with your weapon and wait for the gold to drop because that&apos;s the only thing this game is about. Getting the gold together to buy new weapons  problem: you lose the gold as you enter a new run through the castle. Actually the only positive thing I can say about this game ist that it&apos;s not pay to win and 4 of 10 points is really well-meant. If you want a challenge, go play Super Ghouls &apos;n Ghosts instead..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3269580">Expand</a></span>

I will play it for an hour or two, then give up, feeling sick of it, only to come back after an hour for another round.  It&apos;s hard, but it&apos;s fair, and once you learn what does and does not work for you, it gets much better.  You learn how to play each class, which classes you prefer, what equipment loadouts work best for you with each class, and when you should avoid certain rooms and when you should go for it.
<br>
<br>The random traits can be fun, and you also learn which ones are good, which ones are minor annoyances, and which ones you have to avoid.  And the best part about that those three will vary from player to player.  I personally can&apos;t handle the Colorblind trait, but some of my best playthroughs have come with the Vertigo trait, because it forced me to slow down and think.
<br>
<br>For all the randomness, though, it&apos;s got little touches that keep it from getting out of hand.  The castle&apos;s floor plan can be locked in, the areas are almost always located in the same general orientation (though I&apos;ve had 2 runs where they were not correct), and there are little touches that prevent you from getting blindsided by damage, if you pay attention.
<br>
<br>Only two real problems occur: there are a couple traits and runes that are far better then others (lots of areas only accesible by those with dwarfism, P.A.D. can make challenging rooms a joke, O.C.D. is always good, while siphon and vampirism runes will be your go to runes) and there are still some minor bugs (&apos;Invulnerable&apos; enemies die without seeming to take damage).
<br>
<br>Overall, a very fun Metroidvania game.  Don&apos;t be scared away by the roguelite aspect; the game handles it in a way that changes it from source of annoyance to fun way to break up tedium.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3256852">Expand</a></span>

A few minor tweaks and bug fixes (having to restart your exe gets a bit old) and this game could of been really good, however you have to run through the weakest area every-time you enter unless you want to lock-down which reduces your income, it gets boring very fast and locking down every time when attempting a boss again is time-consuming, and when you just want a specific character and you don&apos;t have the Randomize upgrade (which is conveniently placed behind a class upgrade for some reason), it&apos;s not really fun. Another flaw is that bosses are either incredibly irritating and tedious, or incredibly easy if you know the trick. I encountered a bug several times where I actually didn&apos;t take damage or knockback when being hit. Haggle is also pretty useless early on, yet it&apos;s not far up the tree and it&apos;s pretty expensive for what it does at that stage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3267805">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now the rest: What could be a very fun game is ultimately doomed by its own rogue-like nature. You&apos;re stuck fighting the same 5 or 6 enemies. Rooms are randomized, but quickly start to all look the same. There&apos;s zero &quot;legacy&quot; from one hero to the next outside of the gold you inherit. Your character class choices for each new attempt are completely random. You could spend all your gold upgrading your favorite class and then not even see it as an option for the next few runs. Even after hours of playing, venturing into new areas or boss rooms leads a swift and unavoidable death. The real difficulty comes not from learning to recognize and adapt to enemy attacks, but from floaty controls and cheap hits. The cost of upgrades scales so sharply that you&apos;ll soon find that unless you have a series of simply amazing runs, you&apos;re unable to make any progress at all. It&apos;s a fun diversion for a night, but without the ability to steadily progress, it&apos;s hard to see myself coming back to it again and again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3878843">Expand</a></span>

In Rogue Legacy, the central premise is that your character is the descendant of the previous character you were playing as, and you inherit their equipment, though you may not use the same fighting style or know the same class. Every time you die is a new opportunity to upgrade the next generation, and over the course of numerous deaths, you slowly unlock the entire castle and every ability and piece of equipment in the game. While the underlying idea of your character dying and your descendants carrying on in your place is an interesting one, the game itself is not good enough to make it interesting. Early on, it is too hard, and later on, it is too repetitive, making the overall experience bland.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3839835">Expand</a></span>

I would assume that this game would be pretty fantastic with a proper controller, however the default controls that come with it are some of the most ridiculous rubbish I&apos;ve ever played with in my life. Common sense and my history of gaming make me wonder if the creator even played his own game before releasing it.
<br>
<br>So, with that tidbit out of the way, I will admit that I really WANT to like this game. It has a good premise for an indie game and the concept is solid. However the control scheme makes me tend to quit after about 2 playthroughs due to the sheer stupidity of it. Basically, this game is a side-scrolling Metroid-esque game with hack&apos;n&apos;slash features. What you see is what you get really. It has quite a lot of replay value as long as you have some alternate method of control or you enjoy being defeated due to poor control schemes (looking at you Resident Evil, can&apos;t run while shooting. Makes sense in a zombie game...)
<br>
<br>Basically you start out as some sort of &apos;knight&apos; that has no real background or story and the main goal of the game is to wrack up as much gold as possible. The gold is used for progression AFTER dying. Yeah, you heard me, Not going to use that gold while you&apos;re alive. The only way to access the &apos;store&apos; (dubbed &apos;The Manor&apos;) in which to spend all your hard (read: VERY HARD) earned gold is to perish. Once you perish, you get to pick one of three &apos;descendants&apos; that have varying abilities and skills (called traits).
<br>
<br>There is a wide array of these traits that keep it fresh and replayability high and subsequence playthroughs amusing. After perishing you are brought back to &apos;The Manor&apos;, a series of unlockable options, such as a blacksmithy, more health or mana, additional abilities, etc. They build off one another, with the player unlocking one making it so that three more are able to be looked at and purchased.
<br>
<br>The monsters are pretty standard fare, hailing from NES and SNES times with predictable patterns and bullet-hell firing paths that are usually dodgable sans the terrible controls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4257135">Expand</a></span>

It starts off impossible and gets easier over time. That is the opposite of how a game should be. They should start fairly easy and get harder once you beat the easier levels.</span>

<br>Yeah, it&apos;s pretty much awesome.  Think Castlevania Symphony of the Night  Dark Souls  Randomization in the form of a hardcore side-scrolling action platformer.  I really don&apos;t get where the criticism of the controls is coming from.  Maybe it&apos;s the controller?  I used a Dualshock 3 with MotionInJoy and the XInput option to emulate the 360 controller.  The D-Pad on it worked perfectly for me.  If not, I really suggest people just play it a little bit more.  The controls are -perfect- once you get used to them.  Otherwise, you&apos;d never get through the later areas....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3255664">Expand</a></span>

Where this game shines, however, is in the unique blend of influences from the rogue-like genre. Featuring permanent death, when a character dies, you begin playing as that character&apos;s child, inheriting the family lineage. Each new character is highly unique, however, and there are plenty of classes/specialization options. Characters have some sort of quirk-- if he is dyslexic, for instance, wrods iwll appaer scarmbeld; if she is colorblind, you will be enjoying the game in black-and-white (until she meets her unfortunate end, leaving her empire to her highly-flatulent dwarf son...etc etc). This highly innovative mechanic gives each playthrough a unique feel, aside from the typical rogue-like standards of character customization and world randomization.

                                        <span>The most fun i had with a game in a long while. Its hard. Especially at the beginning. Even if its a rogue like game it has some retention of priror runs in form of money, equipment, enchantments etc. This is how you progress and are able to tackle harder enemies.
<br>
<br>Its procedurally generated. Gives flashbacks to Castlevania and Ghost and goblins. Very addictive and fun! (Just one more run...)</span>

<br>
<br>metroidvania fans should be drooling all over this RIGHT NOW!
<br>
<br>as the title of the game says, this is a roguelike game... permadeath...
<br>BUT
<br>you have an HEIR system... if you die, u can choose an heir who will be next to enter the castle... each heir has some different TRAIT like myopia, flatulence, etc...its mainly to keep the game fresh, though the traits are limited in number... each heir may or may not be of a different class.. the castle layout will be different when you enter each time...
<br>
<br>the upgrade system is pretty good.. using ingame gold, you can unlock new classes, a blacksmith who sells you weapons, armor and stuff IF you can find the missing blueprints...similarly the  enchantress for runes, which give you special abilities like hover, dash etc... play around with the runes to find your ideal combination..
<br>the architect is an important npc who will fix the layout of the castle so that you can replay the same layout.. this especially helps with boss fights and challenges...
<br>
<br>the enemies lack in variety, but this isnt an issue..
<br>
<br>overall this an excellent game which everyone should play, especially metroidvania and retro fans.
<br>solid game! go get it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3248324">Expand</a></span>

You jump, attack and dodge around the enemies and their attacks. There is one randomly generated dungeon with a few different types of areas in it. There are a couple dozen different types of enemies and the same boss fights each time. The controls are solid and it plays well with a gamepad.  The gameplay is not complicated, but the game itself is challenging. You will probably die a lot, but at least it will be your fault. Victory is not an eventuality, so if you get frustrated easily you may wind up not enjoying yourself. (I can pretty much guarantee the people who gave this game negative reviews got frustrated and quit.) Every time you die, you will start over as one of three new randomly generated characters of randomized classes, but you get to spend the gold you&apos;ve earned on the previous run on upgrades. By default all of the gold you do not spend will be taken from you when you re-enter the dungeon, so if you perform poorly you may not be able to upgrade anything but if you put together a good run you will be able to buy numerous upgrades. It can be a bit of a grind to accumulate enough upgrades and/or increase your skills enough to defeat the game, especially if you aren&apos;t very good at these types of games. Beating this game won&apos;t get you anything fancy but it feels like an accomplishment.  For the price it is a good value and has long-term re-playability. It would be perfect as a portable but is still good on a PC. It could benefit from more enemy variety and customizable options, but overall a good play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3255554">Expand</a></span>

The game takes it&apos;s mechanics and even puts a nice back story on why each subsequent character you make in a lineage matters. You grind through generations of a family until finally one offspring can have the skills and equipment needed to best the castle, and by the time you finally win you&apos;ll feel it is much deserved. That said, this game is a great title for spending 15 minutes to an hour here and there, grinding and learning, until you (randomly) get a castle you can actually beat. I&apos;d rank the game higher, but the controls are not as tight as I&apos;d like, especially for a game that demands immense precision sometimes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3290855">Expand</a></span>

The bosses are a bit easy in face they&apos;re easier than the normal monsters after completing the game for the first time. Nevertheless I had fun with the game and enjoyed jumping and killing and the different variations of the game.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ I really liked the RPG aspects of this game. Upgrading your castle to upgrade your character and to do so in other ways as well was what kept me going for 20h+, which for me was money&apos;s worth for this game.
<br>+ I liked the music, background and the nice events the dungeon had to offer. In addition the character traits were a fun addition.
<br>+ Changing the class was fun way to play the game in different ways and there were even class-specific challenges for rewards throughout the castle.
<br>+ This game didn&apos;t need a story and neither did it really have one. It was fun to play.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- I felt that the scaling of your character is really bad since monsters do scale with levels. Your character doesn&apos;t and you&apos;ll pretty much get 1-2 shotted at the point of game where I am by some of the monsters. Also most classes become useless later on taking some of the fun away.
<br>- The animation of the sword (arc of the slash and length of the sword) don&apos;t match the actual hitbox of the sword which I found frustrating at times.
<br>- In my taste it should have had more zones, bosses and events.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3296003">Expand</a></span>

Rogue Legacy&apos;s tight controls, engaging gameplay, challenging (randomly generated) dungeons, and extensive skill tree roped me in, and it is not likely to let go anytime soon. I find myself returning at an alarmingly high frequency to sit down for half hour sessions to relax and get a small amount of progress, or sit in for longer sessions trying to plow my way through my 2nd new game  (the challenge increases with every NG+).
<br>
<br>Little needs to be said about this game, for it succeeds on so many levels. With that being said, I&apos;ve found some issues with hitboxes, glitches, and general jankiness (enemies turning invisible, how terrible the &quot;Vertigo&quot; trait is, etc) so this is not quite a perfect score from me.
<br>
<br>Pick up this game, though. It is completely worth it.

<br>first off peopole who love it need to go play castlevania or ninja gaiden then come back to this
<br>second off the games difficulty is the major problem i have no problem with hard games i love broforce castlevania ninja gaiden yggdra union and there hard as balls but this game instead of using challenging and good level design decides to instead just throw a crap storm at you in order to get by as a chalenging game the platforming is mediocre to say the least its realy floaty and controls like crap the combat is also a major feature along with platforming and its just as bad you have 1 spell and you can swing your sword thats it nothing else also the spells are all stolen straight from castlevania except for the sword wall wich is useless
<br>however it does have some good features the graphics are very nice and building a legacy is interesting
<br>however the legacy is nothing more then upgrades and another major part building your manor is just a upgrade screen the classes are useless except the shinobi get the shinobi the only way to beat this game is with the shinobi the bosses are horrendus to there just bigger versions of normal enemies litteraly all of the bosses are upscaled versions of first off the visionarys second off the flaming skulls and so on and so forth the final is un original to with it just being a knight the story seems interesting at first but its a cop out and it should go burn along with this game over all the game just isnt good and by that is one of the worst its not bubsy 3d bad but its close</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4334857">Expand</a></span>

Never played anything that Cellar Door previously put out (And they break the 4th wall in this and talk rather cruelly and sarcastically about their previous games) but regardless of whatever past mistakes they&apos;ve released as an indie developer, they have a surefire hit on this one. There is a reason this game topped Steam&apos;s Top Seller list for a week, and it probably would still be on there if not for the new sales, and that reason is you can&apos;t get more a more fun, addictive Action RPG game than this for $15, worth every cent, and I gladly would have paid more.

If you loved any of those series you should pick up this game. Its a challenging game and extremely addicting. I just wish there were more traits and the progression wasn&apos;t so grind gold heavy. I cheated for extra gold and the game was much much more fun (I can&apos;t stand grinding for gold and its pretty easy to just use a HEX editor and get you the gold).
<br>
<br>The randomized levels really gives this game its staying power and makes every play through interesting and fun.
<br>
<br>The only thing this game is missing is multiplayer and maybe a few more traits, enemy classes, and areas to explore. Overall it just does so much right. A must have for 2013.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3265873">Expand</a></span>

Every life, you have to pick between 3 children, and each child has different classes and traits, so you&apos;re forced to learn the nuances of game as opposed to just learning 1 small subset, which is refreshing.</span>

I generally do not play games like RL, but decided to give it a try nonetheless.  I have played seven hours so far, and I have to say that I won&apos;t be beating the game any time soon.  To me this is a strength of the game.  The fact that I can play seven hours of a game and feel like there is much left for me to discover and find is truly a rarity in gaming these days.  With the runes found in rooms that are difficult to complete, and the blacksmith blueprints, and even the skill tree, there is a lot to explore here.  One of the best parts of Rogue Legacy is the randomly generated castle.  There are multiple sections, and in order to win the game one must beat the four bosses from all the areas and then a final boss (if I&apos;m not mistaken).  So far, I haven&apos;t beaten one boss yet, but I feel as though I will soon be able to.  The classes are another strength of the game.  They are quite varied, with Shinobi having low health but dealing damage, the paladin being the well rounded class, and around five other classes (so far) that are available when you choose your heir.  Overall, I recommend giving this game a shot regardless of what anyone may regularly play.  The game is certainly funny, challenging, and deceivingly simple--in short, it&apos;s a blast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3480187">Expand</a></span>

<br>Let&#x2019;s go back in time nearly thirty years ago. The year was 1985. A hot new game from Capcom hit the arcades that September called &#x2018;Ghouls &#x2018;n Goblins&#x2019;. You pop a quarter in the machine and your quest begins as Arthur, a knight in shining armor who must battle armies of the evil undead to rescue the fair Princess and bring about peace to the entire kingdom. It becomes quickly apparent that this game is tough! You hack and slash your way through the 2D side-scrolling level until you meet your inevitable demise. Up to this point, Rogue Legacy is strikingly similar to Ghouls &#x2018;n Goblins in many ways but it&#x2019;s also where the similarities end and Rogue Legacy&#x2019;s unique hook gets the spotlight.
<br>
<br>Once your character dies, you choose from one a few possible next-of-kin to continue on the quest. With a new generation, comes a huge variety of different classes, abilities, and traits. One moment you may get a female dwarf-barbarian with light feet that won&#x2019;t trigger floor spike traps, another time, a giant male mage with color-blindness that turns your screen black and white. You also inherit all of the gold acquired in the previous run which can be used to level your character up with increased attributes or new weapons and armor. New abilities also empower your characters just as much as leveling does. A room filled with spike traps is made all the safer with double jumps and mid-air dashes. Enemies gradually become more difficult as you level up and the various area bosses are challenging but gratifying when you defeat them. The layout of the castle you explore is procedurally generated, so it resets with each new generation unless you&#x2019;re willing to give up some gold to lock down the most recent layout.
<br>
<br>Fans of the 16-bit era will feel right at home with the look and feel of this game. This game has full controller support on Steam and like pretty much every platformer, it&#x2019;s best played with one. The controls feel great, the game looks great and the gameplay is super addictive. Playing Rogue Legacy was one of those rare experiences for me where time just fly&#x2019;s by while you&#x2019;re in a deep gaming trance. I really like this game. A lot. One of the best games I&#x2019;ve played all year.

You can have a dwarf trait and be extremely small or gigantism and  be very big. There are too many traits to list, some are funny and don&apos;t do anything.

I was totally hooked for the first eight hours of play maybe... but the flaws of the design started to become apparent as I was preparing for the second boss.  There is not enough content to keep the player entertained between frustrating deaths... this should be the highlight of the rogue-like, weird diverse content that keeps you surprised.  Not a lot of surprises here.  The character classes are bland, some of them entirely worthless.  Gear progression is predictable and dull.  Still deserves a high rating given the slick production, originality, and true thrill that the first third or so of the games presents.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3515479">Expand</a></span>

<br>Seriously with all the negatives out of the way, I just found myself playing it, and losing track of time. It is frustrating and hard, but you get better at it and instead of clearing the first 3 rooms, soon you start clearing huge areas on each run.
<br>Addictive 2d platform game that makes the other platform games you&apos;ve played recently look to be frank. Bad. This game using a simple interface that works and is fun. It isn&apos;t overly complicated, with several different spells you can use and only one sword attack, yet it works and it works well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3391327">Expand</a></span>

<br>My only complaint is that you need to grind a bit in the beggining to get some progress, and dying frequently can be frustrating for non-dedicated gamers

Secondly this game is ridiculously hard to just pick up and be good at. Now that those are out of the way here&apos;s some more in depth information, good and bad. The Best thing is infinite replayability to an extent, you can continue beating the game and upping the difficulty to your hearts content but you will eventually hit a wall because you reach a point where you can&apos;t grow your character in a readily available way because you max out the skill progression system. I&apos;m also counting the difficulty as a plus because to be honest most games are made for everyone and present very minimal challenge to more hardcore gamers. The randomization of character from playthrough to playthrough is also refreshing in that the game makes it so you have to learn to play different styles and deal with different obstacles since you will most likely never get the exact same class and trait combination twice in a row. If you like 2d action platform games that are challenging this is a game you should consider. But now for the bad side. The randomization can mean that you get a character selection set that sucks and you have no option but to play one and die to get a better one. The only other really bad thing is just general bugginess, enemies spawning inside walls, enemies dropping gold inside walls, attacks hitting you when you&apos;re clearly out of range, random indestructible enemies exploding for no reason(floating spike balls), etc.
<br>Overall, great game with a few caveats.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3505508">Expand</a></span>

(side complaints: it has some very minor stupid things, but they are very rare and  compared to other games of the genre it&apos;s almost irrelevant: I found myself dead due to unavoidable spike balls upon entering a room from above, floating wizards that can&apos;t decide wether their projectiles pass through walls or don&apos;t, and a somewhat arbirtary relation between dashing lancers and slopes. also the vampire equipment set needs tweaking)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3291335">Expand</a></span>

If I&apos;m comparing it against Binding of Isaac, they are somewhat similar in that they loosely follow some old-school well known games (in BoS it was Zelda, here in RL it is castlevania).
<br>
<br>My first complaint and complement are intertwined  and it has to do with the character selection screen.  You get a choice between 3 different characters, each of which has different &quot;traits&quot; (can be positive things like larger knockback, or negative things like hallucinating enemies that aren&apos;t really there), and each of which is a different class (if you&apos;ve unlocked them).  What I like about that: different traits.  This is a cool concept.  What I don&apos;t like about it  why can&apos;t I just choose which class I want to play?  If you&apos;ve unlocked a class, it shouldn&apos;t be random whether or not you get to  play them.  This game would be infinitely more fun if I could do successive playthroughs getting better with one class at a time.  The classes are so vastly different in how they&apos;re played that it makes it TONS more difficult than it needs to be to ramp up in skill, because you&apos;re constantly having to switch between classes that have completely different skill sets.
<br>
<br>My next complaint would be the controls.  They are not atrocious but they are not great.  The downward slash move is very inconsistent and random in both when it wants to hit and how high it&apos;s going to fling you after hitting.  I&apos;m fine with it being a hard move to pull off, but the difficulty of it should not be in the awful control of it, and that&apos;s what it currently is.
<br>
<br>On each playthrough you earn coins that you basically use to purchase &quot;upgrades&quot; and unlock new things such as classes, weapons, and powerups for your characters.  You can also &quot;lock&quot; down a dungeon for the price of 75% of all gold you make, which is a cool feature.  You lose all the gold you don&apos;t spend once you re-enter the dungeon on each playthrough.  There is an expensive upgrade you can get which lessens how much you pay to enter the dungeon, but it is an absolute joke of an upgrade and in all honestly even fully upgraded you&apos;d still be paying all your money back essentially.
<br>
<br>So this sort of leads in to my main qualm with this game.  It&apos;s not really a &quot;rogue-like&quot; to me.  The only rogue-like aspect of the game is that when you die, you&apos;re dead, and that the levels are randomly generated.  One would think that&apos;s all it takes to be a rogue-like, but playing this game made me realize that&apos;s just not what makes a rogue-like a rogue-like.  Rogue Legacy is a game that you basically have no chance of beating on your first play through.  This is because you have no upgrades to handle anything past the first 2 &quot;stages&quot; of the game.  You&apos;ll get to areas where enemies just 1-hit you, only because you didn&apos;t get the &quot;stats&quot; required to do that area.
<br>
<br>This to me is not a quality of a rogue-like.  You basically have to play the game over and over and over again, until your stats get to a point where everything is just easy to you.  Along with that, the bosses are not random, and once you kill them (there are only 4, 1 for each &quot;stage&quot;, then some final post-game bosses) they are dead for good, and you never face them again on the &quot;stage&quot; on subsequent playthroughs.  That is just  who thought that was a good idea?  The bosses aren&apos;t that great either, compared to the bosses in Binding of Isaac it&apos;s night and day in terms of how well they are designed.  The bosses are a very &quot;low&quot; point for rogue legacy.
<br>
<br>Also as you advance in stages, every enemy is just a rehash of a previous one, so variety is not a strong suit of the game either.
<br>
<br>All in all, rogue legacy is a game that you probably won&apos;t regret purchasing, you&apos;ll get many hours of fun/frustration out of it and it is solid for the most part.  It&apos;s no binding of isaac but in terms of side scroller &quot;rogue-likes&quot; (I use the term loosely) it&apos;s probably your best option at this point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3382940">Expand</a></span>

Some of the upgrades are ridiculously expensive for what you get. The game is hard, and it&apos;s a time sink, you don&apos;t have to commit more than 15 minutes to it or you can play all day if you want. It&apos;s good in between playing some of my multiplayer games.</span>

I have become proficient in every class, and I know how all the traits and spells interact. So, do I feel like I got enough value from Rogue Legacy?
<br>
<br>Yes, of course! The initial exploration and the detailed character progression provides a lot of fun times. The first few runs, you will struggle to survive. But you will find that exciting and fun since knowing each death is one step closer to victory. Once you start to struggle less, you it gets really good. You start to figure out how to clear rooms not easily, but handily with some skill involved. And each character plays a bit differently, shifting your tactics. Even long into the game, you&apos;re still exploring to find new items, unlock better stats, and defeat new deadlier versions of enemies.
<br>
<br>But it&apos;s not all sunshine. The game begins to drag around when you start New Game +2. At this point, the new enemies are not so much different as they are positively annoying. Many rooms will see you wading through impossible bullet hells as each enemy fires off ridiculous amounts of shots. Most of these shots go through walls, so you have literally nowhere to hide for a reprieve. A couple of powerful abilities can counter this, like time freeze and mist form, but it&apos;s quite a shame that many characters essentially become obsolete later in the game due to poor balancing.
<br>
<br>The controls are a mixed bag. They are generally tight and responsive. Both the keyboard and the Xbox controller I used worked well, though the controller is a bit more comfortable for me in these types of games. There are several annoying decisions Cellar Games made with character control though. For one, your character doesn&apos;t turn left-to-right (and vice versa) as you would expect. They actually step backwards a bit, as if wheeling around, which can lead to the character being slightly out of position from where you think he/she should be. Plus, you can&apos;t turn around at all while attacking. This can lead to times when you&apos;ll be furiously attacking in the wrong direction despite mashing the correct direction.
<br>
<br>One final control problem I&apos;ve encountered is the lack of mid-air recovery from hits. It doesn&apos;t matter how many air jumps or how much flight you have left. When you get hit, you fall aaaaall the way to the bottom of the room. This presents an extra challenge to certain rooms, but with later level design being all but unfair, it turns every single hit into a frustrating ordeal.
<br>
<br>At this point, I have no more desire to play the game. I&apos;ve gotten many hours of enjoyment from it, but it does not persist like a true rogue-like such as The Binding of Isaac. The latter has its own balance and control issues (though far less game-breaking), but it sticks around due to the amazing amount of interesting and game-changing items to be found in every playthrough. Rogue Legacy by comparison only has a handful of classes (some become obsolete), spells (some are not very useful), and traits (many are pointless or even to be avoided).
<br>
<br>If Rogue Legacy want to remain relevant, Cellar Door Games needs to update it with:
<br>1. Redesigned late-game enemies and new enemies for more variety.
<br>2. More interesting spells, traits, abilities, and in-game pick-ups. A *lot* more.
<br>3. New-Game+ feature should unlock more upgrades/equipment/runes to buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3385411">Expand</a></span>

Family legacy based, each character you play has traits some beneficial and some negative, sometimes none at all.  When you die you get a choice of children heirs to take your place each with different traits and class types.  Almost everything is upgradable.  Riches and upgrades follow you as you progress building a family tree of characters that tried to defeat the castle.  Every time you start you get to spend your money and whatever you don&apos;t spend you have to pay to death to enter the castle.  Very fun game.  Very well built.  Boss fights are extremely challenging as they should be.  Any negative reviews are mostly because the player sucks at games in general.  Understand that dying is part of this game.  Its intended to not be won in a single character.  Each time you die you get to upgrade your characters by upgrading your castle or buying new weapons you acquired during your last characters travels.  Magic enhancements like double jump or dash can be added and if you like you can lock the castle to the last version you entered for a percentage of your earned income this attempt through the castle.  Good replay ability with randomly generated dungeons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3520906">Expand</a></span>

It does have its annoyances though, but if you are willing to take the time to immerse yourself into this game you&apos;ll rise above them.
<br>
<br>The game is very simple in terms of combat and goals. Although there is a loose story around the game and an end boss, the initial goal will be to unlock upgrades, armor, and runes to ultimately help you achieve a full clear. Basically it boils down to this, pick a character out of a choice of three with the most favorable set of traits you prefer, enter the castle, clear rooms and collect enough money before you die to purchase the next upgrade. Of course as you get more upgrades, the enemies get tougher too so expect to die.... a lot!
<br>
<br>Because the castle is randomly generated, this means that you can&apos;t memories the levels and enemy placement. This forces you to actually learn the patterns and behavior of your foes, and adds a strategic element for planning out your attack order in a room filled with baddies. If you just run in and blindly start attacking the first thing you see, you may find yourself trapped in a crossfire of steel and magic that will quickly end your life.
<br>
<br>Some people may hate how challenging this can make the game. At times it can be downright frustrating, but unlike true rogue-like games this one actually has a sort of character progression. Even though the enemies will get tougher, as you gain levels you&apos;ll have more margin for error. Combine that with mastering the enemy behavior, and soon you&apos;ll find the game easy enough to clear most rooms, but still challenging enough to keep you on your toes.
<br>
<br>My only major complaints with the game is that it really only has four areas to explore. Although it is randomly generated, the limited themes and music grow tired before long. It&apos;s easy to overlook though if you enjoy the gameplay, and it has a huge amount of upgrades to obtain. If you are the type of person that like to unlock stuff, that should be enough to keep you coming back to this game for quite awhile.
<br>
<br>Fifteen dollars may seem like a steep price when most games of similar budget and quality are in the five to ten dollar range, but this one has enough replay value to make it worth the money. If you&apos;re looking for a game that actually has gameplay, and not cutscenes and quicktime events every couple of minutes, give this one a try. Its oldschool arcade feeling goodness at its best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3375717">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay is simple to learn, but hard to master as it has you fighting numerous enemies while dodging projectiles and booby traps. The controls are, unfortunately clunky and awkward if a keyboard is used  I used one) and it takes longer than it should to be able to learn the basics. Mainly because up is not jump and I am used to that in side scroller games.
<br>All enemies in the game are challenging and different strategies have to be used to defeat each one. But the lack of variety of goons is overwhelming. Even the bosses are variations of the weaker enemies you fight through out the castle (eg: eye that fires one projectile, eye that fires 6 projectiles and (boss) eye that fires projectiles in a circumference) and the stronger variations are punishingly harder than their counterpart making ignoring them and pass by them the best strategy even if you are strong.
<br>The level design and platforming part of this game are genius and very entertaining and adding some very interesting sections like the fairy chests that can only be unlocked by  reaching it in 5 seconds or not taking any damage (between many)  although these can be ludicrously difficult for what they give.
<br>The re-playability is huge, there is a lot to unlock  buy and improve. From the beginning you are presented with your manor, a place where you improve stats, unlock classes and level them. It is here where you will be spending most of your money earned in your previous run. There is also a blacksmith, an enchantress and an architect which respectively sell you armor, runes  they improve stats and give the ability to dash and double jump) and offer you the chance to keep the castle from randomly generating for one attempt for 70% of the gold you receive that attempt.
<br>Now, the legacy part of the game. Everytime you die you are presented with a screen showing how well your characters have done by nicknames, from Useless to Legendary. Next you will have to choose your heir from a &quot;roster&quot; of three, each having it&apos;s own name, traits and spells falling into classes that you have unlocked. It is great and some of the traits are hilarious and funny but, there is one slight problem.
<br>Quoting UnclearImage  you upgrade certain types of charas (knights, mages, or barbarians) and the game still won&apos;t let you specifically pick that type. So you die and get a knave (nothing at all) a bard and a mage, but you&apos;ve been leveling knights.... Basically you&apos;re gonna just spawn, run into castle and die because playing that class is pointless.&quot;. Because there are only 3 children to choose from, not all classes can be choosed and that leads to unneeded frustration and killing off characters.
<br>Rogue Legacy has an average, but very well delivered story that helps you become more determined to finish. Journals of the man who first entered the castle can be found randomly throughout your  runs. These give a purpose to what you are doing and have tips if you are having trouble finding out what to do.
<br>This game is fun, but hard, sometimes too hard. It is the kind of game that is fun but you should never play more than 30 min  1 h to avoid raging.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3286337">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First off, I wanted to state how excited I was in learning that the Rogue Legacy development team also created the classic text-controlled flash game &quot;Don&apos;t  Your Pants&quot;! If you haven&apos;t played it, google it, and prepare for.. Well, the title says it all. Share it with your friends and watch them play for the first time. This made me cry with laughter!
<br>
<br>Ok, down to the positives!
<br>
<br>1. Rogue Legacy has the feel of ye olde Super Nintendo titles. If you&apos;re looking for some 80s/90s nostalgia with the additional complex elements which we expect from game releases nowadays, you&apos;ll find them here!
<br>
<br>2. A glorious &apos;skill tree&apos; and upgrade system. With every death comes more gold, which buys you new classes, improved stats, armor, weaponry, or magical runes! The rune system is an awesome idea, granting you faster base speed, health-stealing upon kills (recommended!), flight, or extra jumps, to name a few. These stack, meaning that with the proper runes, you could jump up to ~5 times before hitting the ground. Great system, with fun and cool unlocks as you journey through the generations!
<br>
<br>3. Challenging, but not ultra-frustrating. While the enemies are challenging, this makes defeating them even more fulfilling. You are expected to die, and very frequently, in Rogue Legacy. However, with every death also comes more opportunity for upgrades. You slowly make your way through the castle at first, but the gameplay doesn&apos;t stale. Your power grows with every new heir, and the castle is different every time you enter. I have rarely felt any &apos;deja vu&apos; based on past castle explorations, and that displays to me that their game is well-constructed.
<br>
<br>4. It&apos;s humorous! You pick from 3 heirs every time you die, with most of them having some hilarious physical/mental health issues. These rarely hinder you in moving forward. As a matter of fact, they can help too. Your heirs may suffer from near-sighted/far-sighted/tunnel vision, ADHD, OCD, Dwarfism, Dyslexia, Insanity, or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. They may even be balding, homosexual, or hold an unhealthy fear of chickens. I love what this element adds to the adventure. Each disorder must be recognized for its pros or cons. You usually decide your heir based upon which of the three has traits of the least evil! You will learn to recognize how all of them affect your playtime, and how they help or hinder your progress within the castle walls. TIP: Sometimes you just have to pick the heir that seems the most messed up. Wondrous results: inevitable.
<br>
<br>Conclusions: It&apos;s worth your money and time. There is only one reason why I gave Rogue Legacy a 9 instead of a 10. I was slightly behind the storyline (told through journal entries) towards the end of the game. The monsters level with you, and from what I&apos;ve gathered, each main character death connotes a level. This being my first play-through, I ended up accruing many horridly short lives. Basically, I was told the story before I had completed the objectives I supposedly should have already finished based on these entries. I was probably ~10-15 lives behind at all times.
<br>
<br>All-in-all, a lovely experience though! I have one suggestion for new players: Play through 10, maybe 15 lives, learn the mechanics and how to properly defeat each monster, then clear your save data via the game menu and start from scratch. It will save you the heart-ache of deleting a fairly worthless level 50 or 60 character, as I&apos;m about to do  I can&apos;t say it&apos;s not totally worth it!!
<br>
<br>Thanks for a great game, Cellar Door. Here&apos;s wishing you long existence. You built a world that brought me back to my younger years. I haven&apos;t felt such nostalgia since I last played Final Fantasy 4! I never expected I&apos;d find such a diamond in the rough, but here it is! I&apos;m very excited to see what your hard work brings next!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3547338">Expand</a></span>

<br>7/10 it is  if one of the next updates/patches changes the drop-rates and/or makes building your hero a bit more affordable, I&apos;d have to revise my rating to a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3271568">Expand</a></span>

But what really captured my attention was the tons of equipment and upgrades. The game is difficult, but as you progress, and learn the controls and actions of the mobs, it becomes fast paced, fluid, and most of all: intense.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been playing it for hours and hours, and I feel like you just can&apos;t stop playing. It&apos;s so exciting and fast paced. It&apos;s very, very rewarding when you get loot, and come back knowing you&apos;re able to upgrade your castle(stat upgrades), and buy equipment.
<br>
<br>Great game.

<br>Buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3271226">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I first played this game a few months ago and didn&apos;t like it at all, but only because I suck at platformers. Later I was convinced to give it another try, and woah if it blew my mind. Rogue Legacy is the Dark Souls of platformers: once you get used to its dying and rebirth routine you&apos;ll spend hours with it and love the sense of progression. A fantastic game.</span>

If you are an expert at platformers and have the fast-twitch reflexes of a teenager in his/her prime, you may be able to advance through the game, but for the rest of us, you will probably never end up more than 6-12 rooms deep into any dungeon.

<br>The gamplay is not bad, but sadly the graphic/sound departments are pretty weak and that brings down my score. Rogue Legacy is not bad, but could have been better. I&apos;m looking forward for the next title.</span>

However, every run through the shifting castle dungeon gets you a little further- any gold you earn can be used by your next character to purchase upgrades and gear. The game has a sort of heritage system, in each run you choose a child of your previous character, who can be one of several classes and may have any number of beneficial, harmful or completely benign medical conditions, another element of randomization atop the expected ones: randomized dungeon layout and loot. Character customization is extensive, with various gear setups of weapons and armor, and skill runes that add things like extra jumps or air dashes. I died many, many times over the course of my playthrough, especially during the very difficult (perhaps even cheap) boss fights, but unlike some roguelikes the game never really punishes you for that. You&apos;re even able to &quot;lock&quot; the castle and reenter the same layout as your next character, expediting your progress to say, a boss room. I found myself addicted to the game, wanting to go on &quot;just one more run&quot; to get another upgrade before moving on to something else. The game has decent music and a charming art style as well, which clashes nicely with its rather grim lore. The game delivered strongly on that &quot;what&apos;s in the next room?!&quot; factor that I love about these sorts of games, including action roguelikes like Diablo and its derivatives. Rogue Legacy was persistently entertaining throughout and I can recommend it to most, even those who would normally shy away from a roguelike.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507850">Expand</a></span>

<br>A little too hard for a everyday player. I took an hour to learn its secrets and wound up with dying every few rooms. Some rooms are generated in a way that makes you die instantly. Not fun. Items are too expensive and the drop rates so low, that you can spend 15 minutes earning absolutely nothing. Awkward fighting controls means is more of a puzzle game to hit the enemies instead of a entertaining platformer. Repetitive design that owes to everlasting respawning made me abandon it too early. What a shame. A few changes and this would be an instant classic.
<br>
<br>New review after spending 20+ hours with the game:
<br>The game is very hard at first. The more you play it and the more you learn it, it becomes much much easier. Tight controls help much. It really deserves the high scores others are giving it. You just have to have a patience and a bit of skill with platformers to really enjoy it. One of the best games of 2013.

Cellar Door Games have made a very entertaining popurri of the best RPG concepts in the industry. Rogue legacy is essentially a 2D patformer in the tradition of Symphony of the Night, you control a warrior that must investigate a really contrived castle full of enemies.
<br>
<br>You have many classes to choose from: knight, barbarian, mage, rogue, ninja, lich, etc. Core game mechanics are very simmilar among them: you have 1 button to sword attack, another one to jump, and another one to use a spell; however, each class gets a special action assigned to a fourth button, and it may not sound like much, but believe me, it makes a huge difference in how you use each character. Each one also has specific stats, specializing each job for certain tactics. Eventually new layers come into play like runes, advanced classes and blacksmithing.
<br>
<br>The leveling scheme is pretty original, since you don&apos;t level a single character but more like your &quot;bloodline&quot;. sequence goes like this: you take your warrior into the castle, advancing and looting as much gold as you can; your char will eventually die, it&apos;s inevitable, and he will be gone forever, but you retain the gold; 3 new &quot;succesors&quot; are displayed, allowing you to choose who will carry the mantle; using the gold you earned you start upgrading your &quot;family&quot;, buying healt/damage upgrades, new classes, the blacksmith, runes, etc, etc, making your next adventure more manageable than the previous; you take your new warrior into the castle again, the whole castle is randomized and your remaining money is taken, effectivelly returning you to point 0; new warrior will eventually die, repeating the previous process.
<br>
<br>Overall an amazing game, It actually reminds me of the Souls series a lot, specially in it&apos;s unforgiving nature, in it&apos;s aproach to death (death is part of the experience after all), and in it&apos;s approach to currency as a way of leveling up (and loosing it all with each new try). This is nostalgia done right!!! a true homage to the SNES era in a new franchise, with bold and interesting mechanics; instead of predating old franchises into mediocre games to get a quick buck (I&apos;m looking at you Double Dragon). Highly recommended!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3831716">Expand</a></span>
