The mysterious story kept me playing and the puzzles are - mostly - well implemented. For sure it is not an adventure that sacrifices Gameplay for the sake of the story. If you love traditional adventure games you&apos;ll probably not complain about that - if not you probably will. Completing this game will likely take around 6 hours, maybe 7 or so if you take your time.
<br>
<br>There is a lot of dialog here, which is not uncommon for adventure games. Rushing it won&apos;t do you good. The more you listen the more you get drawn into this world. But keep in mind that this is only the first game. There will be sequels continuing this story. At the end you will learn a lot about the protagonist which from my point of view will probably give you at least some sort of accomplishment but it will lead to much bigger questions. No idea yet when the next game will be out but I&apos;m looking forward to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-synchronicity-tomorrow-comes-today/user-reviews?user_review_id=5185700">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Dead Synchonicity shows a hard and brutal truth, a possibility, how the world could be if everyone&apos;s looking out for himself. There are many games with similar topics in games, but Dead Synchro somehow manages it to get the player&apos;s attention immediately and conveys a exciting and fascinating plot which will make your pulse go faster! Fictiorama succeeded in making a super classic point and click adventure.

<br>Abysmal voice acting, lazy animations are among the low points though. Puzzles are a bit above casual level but well integrated into the world for the most part and do not take you out of the context of the story (as happens with surprisingly many puzzle elements in good stories)
<br>
<br>All in all - i like that game ... had it been given a visual overhaul and especially better voice acting - it could have made it to my top choices for classic adventures. Since the primary concern of a good adventure is the story and the immersion of the player into the story - it is still clearly a good choice though.
<br>
<br>postscript:
<br>I am aware that much of the visual design is just that - a design choice. but i found the very nice backgrounds contrasting with the paper-cut-out design of the characters. Personally, i would have rather gone with a design similar to that of Flashback/Another World (flatshade vector models) - with fluid but low detail animation - instead of the more detailed and barely animated design adopted - but that is a matter of taste i think.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-synchronicity-tomorrow-comes-today/user-reviews?user_review_id=7412517">Expand</a></span>
