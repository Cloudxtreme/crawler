All other planes and helos don&apos;t even try to do anything. Planes simply circle around a combat zone size of a city block, helicopters hover over the same spot and stay there until the end of the mission unless you take control. Physics is almost non-existent too. I understand that&apos;s an arcade game, but at least they could have implemented speed increase when the plane is descending. Some missions are buggy and sometimes you will try to run the same mission again and again until you restart the game and it will get itself together. And these things made me mad. Yet the game succeeded to capture my attention for a whole day. Despite all the bugs fighting was enjoyable and the atmosphere of the Vietnamese War feels quite well in the game, thanks to the choice of music. So, if you are interested in this particular period of history, you can find the game fun even with its poor realization.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/air-conflicts-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=3612307">Expand</a></span>
