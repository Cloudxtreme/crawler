Battles are fast paced, but can (and should) be paused anytime though. Game mechanics are very well thought true, though each play through depends heavily on luck - as in any given rogue-like I guess.</span>

<br>This game sucked me in extremely fast. I didn&apos;t buy it until a friend started playing it, and after watching him, I had to try it myself. The game has a very high replay value, but that might be due to the game&apos;s quite short playthrough.
<br>
<br>To start, the game is brutal and unforgiving. Making mistakes will quickly lead to a game over, and sometimes the RNG plays dirty by giving you time and time again the negative side of every random event. The enemies scale quickly, so you&apos;ll need to find a way to keep the pace. The first 10, maybe even 20 times you&apos;re going to lose. On easy.
<br>
<br>However, once you&apos;ve got an understanding of how the game works, it&apos;s not as random and luck based as people make it out to be. Being tactical about your movements and not taking needless risks will take you consistently to the end of the game. Using resource management for your ship can save you tons of cash that you can use to upgrade other things or purchase more weapons at stores. Playing smart will almost always win, except for the very worst generated maps.
<br>
<br>No matter what type of gamer you are, I highly recommend this game. For $10, it&apos;s well worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2629961">Expand</a></span>

My expectations were low - but when I got into it I was surprised to find myself really engaged and enjoying the experience. The visuals aren&apos;t that flash but the gameplay fires the imagination such that the visuals remain functional and incidental to the core experience. Different scenarios are presented to you as you warp into each new sector and you are required to make choices that influence where the game goes; a lot of these choices result in combat but it&apos;s refreshing to see that some do not. A lot of sci-fi games focus too much on combat but the whole star trek experience is just as much about  managing crew and making decisions as it is firing the phasers. FTL is perhaps leaning toward too much combat, but it does make significant efforts to give you other things to do as well - and to good effect. The soundtrack is delightful and the sense that you are in command is palpable. On my last game it was me and Jean Luc (you can name crew members) and we made it alone to stage 4 (of 5) and had some amazing scraps and adventures along the way. We started we 3 crew members (you can recruit more along the way) but Beverly died after we were boarded and the oxygen levels in sick bay dropped to the point where she suffocated. We were really cut up about that but pressed on. It&apos;s a great little game - could perhaps have benefited from just a little more depth but as is it&apos;s heaps of fun and for the price... you can&apos;t lose. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2623671">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, it&apos;s a rogue like- and yes, rogue likes- are heavily dependent on randomness but FTL takes it to the extreme.  I lost and lost and lost (and losing sees a restart from scratch - only the hardcore need apply); it&apos;s not even that there isn&apos;t a component of skill.  One does need to be skilled: managing your crew, sub-systems and power takes a lot of effort whilst also pinpointing attacks on the enemy.
<br>
<br>But chance and the increasing difficulty curve as you venture further across the universe outweigh the skill component solidly.
<br>
<br>Rather save money, get a dice, roll it till a six; then declare yourself a winner.  It&apos;ll be far less aggravating all &apos;round.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2817331">Expand</a></span>

FTL seems fun when you first start out, but as you repeat the game over and over and over and over and over and over again you realize the entire game is rubbish because your chances of winning a particular run are controlled very minimally by you. All you do is steer the ship and click on parts of enemy ships. I had a run where I had nothing but the starter guns all the way up to the 7th sector, I explored many beacons and found nothing. The game is rogue like but fails to provide even a reasonably fair amount of random chance. Other times the game will reward you with something amazing that you can&apos;t use at the most inopportune time - one run I was given what was claimed by the game to be an amazing laser - but I had no means at all to operate this gun on my ship as I found it in the 1st sector. On another run I did great, but could not find a weapon like that laser to save my life - and was shafted by random chance. This SOUNDS like it could be fun sometimes, but after you play the game over and over you get real sick of &quot;oh look, no weapons, oh look no new crew members&quot; and you end up eventually running out of fuel and scrap and dying helplessly or you somehow get far then are ill-equipped for the higher powered enemy ships and die extremely quickly. The game has terrible pacing and while the mechanics operate fine, some things like the AI leave a LOT to be desired. I don&apos;t know why people feel like they must love indie games no matter how good or bad they are - if you give them false praise you&apos;re only hurting them. The game could be improved with patching, but somehow I sincerely doubt the odds the game will ever see an update - the developers got our money and have so far shown no real interest in doing much else with the game based on statements they&apos;ve publicly made. For a half-working title like this I would not pay the price it&apos;s going for, $10 is too steep for a broken indie game and as gamers we should demand better quality from indie studios if we ever want them to replace corporate studios that just create more franchise games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2638691">Expand</a></span>

My rating is 2, and it&apos;s OBVIOUS that this game would deserve more. So, why do I give it only two? Well, there are a couple of reasons. A bit more actually. As someone else pointed out, this game is interesting and provides a strong &quot;sci-fi experience&quot;. This is for the bright side. I&apos;ve backed this game on Kickstarter, and I&apos;ve had the chance to play it before its release. According to steam, more than 18 hours. To be honest, I must have spent the first 15 hours almost in a row, right after downloading it. The rest corresponds to a few tries I gave it from this moment until now; to see if the flaws were corrected yet. In fact, once a wave of enthusiasm has passed, the game becomes really boring : its main problem is re-playability. The experience which feels great at start becomes repetitive really rapidly. Each play-through is really not different. And the game is quite difficult, you find yourself dying all the time (this is relative to the genre, I think), which doesn&apos;t help at all about that. Indeed, the difficulty lacks a normal mode : the easy mode is damn easy, and the so called &quot;normal&quot; mode is kinda hard. The second complaint I have is : things are WAY too random. The fact that you flee before an entire fleet means that you don&apos;t have the leisure to explore your surroundings. As a consequence, you either are lucky enough to find some weapons, a new crew member or some good stuff; or you have bad luck and your only outcome is usually to start a new game. I could throw dice instead, I would have pretty much the same feeling. And because of the &quot;balance&quot; of the game, you often don&apos;t have the choice but to upgrade your shields ASAP, and pray to find good weapons soon enough. So the &quot;freedom&quot; upon upgrade choices isn&apos;t really there, at least if you want to survive. Your skills are very rarely involved, it&apos;s only gambling. To such extent, that after a hundred of games or so, the only new things you have are a bunch of unlocked ships which don&apos;t modify game experience that much. Same goes for the music : it&apos;s really entertaining at first, pleasing and so. And after some time, you find yourself muting it, and listening to Internet radio or so. So, even if this game is made from good ideas and obviously a lot of work, it lacks a lot of polish to reach the intended replayability. I was hoping something really different and way more satisfying. I really hope I will have to rewrite this review because the developers corrected these mistakes. Until then, that&apos;s not worth buying, really.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2626257">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s pretty hardcore for a game that seems like such a peaceful quaint little game until you experience your first jump next to an active sun, or get boarded by a bunch of aliens that disable your oxygen and overpower any crewmembers you try to send in to fix it. It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, and even then you&apos;ll have a hard time just safely reaching the final sector.

<br>The soundtrack is great. Combat is interesting. There isn&apos;t a plot, really, but the narrative that you can create for yourself is incredibly. You&apos;ll grow attached to your characters... and get sad when they die of Oxygen asphyxiation. The ship customization, and details, give this game a huge amount of replay value. Any sci fi fan should try their hand at this game  it&apos;s awesome.
<br>
<br>The only downside to speak of is the tediousness of unlocking certain ships. You have to be extremely lucky to get certain ships, no two ways about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3136818">Expand</a></span>

You always strive for better results than the last time. It&apos;s really cool when you get new ships, and it makes me want to see how I fare with those. I have played about 15 time, and I&apos;ve only beat it three times on easy. On normal I haven&apos;t even made it to the final boss.</span>

<br>Truly, this is a game that has never been done before.  It blends strategic/tactical starship combat, time management, RTS, role-playing, and an interactive novel together in a roguelike experience.
<br>
<br>The game is bleepin&apos; hard!  And that&apos;s the point.  Expect to lose about 20 times for every 1 time you (almost...!) win.
<br>
<br>&gt;;D
<br>
<br>ROGUELIKE, baby!!!
<br>
<br>In all seriousness, the game&apos;s mechanics blend together masterfully to offer the player complete control over what is very often a hopeless scenario.  The whole point of a roguelike is to offer the player about the same chance of winning the game as being hit by lightning.  (Granted, FTL&apos;s &quot;Easy&quot; mode is really that, and most games set to Easy can at least be played into the final stages...once you know what you&apos;re doing.)
<br>
<br>What I cannot praise enough is the level of gameplay you get even if you do lose.  Many roguelikes can put you in a bad spot within 10 minutes of beginning a new character.  And a &quot;bad spot&quot; in a roguelike usually means instant death by laceration, impalement, incineration, bludgeoning, infection, curse, malfunction, hallucination, insanity, implosion...or a pleasant mixture of them all.  FTL allows for a level of player skill that actually affects your ability to succeed.  It&apos;s not all, or even mostly, up to the RNG.  Players will actually begin to get the idea of what they need to survive and can pursue it.  In worst-case scenarios, I know I&apos;m dead long before my ship actually blows.
<br>
<br>Controls, interface, and graphics are simple, clear, and I would not alter them in any way.  Text scenarios are quick, interesting, and the number of variables that may appear based on your ship&apos;s systems, crew, weapons, etc. keep them from becoming old-hat on subsequent playthroughs.  Ship designs are widely varied with many strengths and weaknesses, and the only game I can think of that matches the options you are given, moment-to-moment, during combat is Starfleet Command: Orion Pirates.
<br>
<br>Does the game have it&apos;s flaws?  Yes.
<br>
<br>Is it occasionally very cheap in its reward/punishment randomization?  Yes.
<br>
<br>Is the last mission an exercise in frustration with virtually no chance of success?  Yes.
<br>
<br>That...is it&apos;s magic.  Expect to lose.  I&apos;ll put it this way: I didn&apos;t jump up out of my chair, raise two fists above my head, and proceed to do the butt dance when I beat Skyrim.  (Oddly enough, my girlfriend didn&apos;t stare at me concernedly for two days after I beat Skyrim, either.)
<br>
<br>Play.  This.  Game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=5072309">Expand</a></span>

<br>For an inexpensive indie game with such a small team the design is nearly perfect. Aside from having not quite enough different random encounters (expect to play through the same encounters over and over again) I don&apos;t think I have any complaints for this title. I hope a AAA studio decides to make something like FTL, or picks up these guys and makes FTL2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2624305">Expand</a></span>

Its basically a casino game where you get lucky and get the items you need or you simply dont and there isnt a thing you can do about it. For example, i had a run where I did not find a single weapon (aside from starter weapons) anywhere and died in the 4th system... not fun. In another quickie run, the very 1st fight had me go up against a shielded missile shooting ship and as you might have guessed, I missed my 1st 4 salvos and he hit me every time, disabled my weapons, started fires and I simply couldnt do anything and lost on the 1st encounter (lol). In another run, i got to the end boss, but the only weapons I had were very slow (vulcan, starter stuff, and beams), somehow I reached the 3rd stage only to get get slammed on every surge with laser attacks that... as you might have guessed, took out my guns every time. Again, nothing I can do, it lasted 5 minutes but I could never peal his shield and he just whittled me down with his cheap surge (albeit I took out all the landing parties).
<br>
<br>Its just a rng based game... ive won several time (its easy if you get the items you need) but its just pure luck. There is little to no skill needed aside from timing firing salvos (something a 1st grader can figure out).
<br>
<br>The game is overhyped. It reminds me a lot of gem quest many years ago (around 10 years ago). It was all luck too and was the talk of the town but now no one even remembers that game. The same will happen here. It needs more depth and more strategy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=5155962">Expand</a></span>

All that the game is missing is variety which I&apos;m hoping will be addressed in the future. Still well worth a 9 even though it is missing content, but what it does, it does well and that is the basic definition of a rogue-like(but with space elements as you pilot your starship). I look forward to moding this game when that&apos;s possible, I would like to add more ship designs, weapons, environmental hazards, and quests.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2630988">Expand</a></span>

<br>Crew and ship management which are the main parts of the game are very well designed and satisfying. The various encounters and quests are varied and well-written adding surprising level of immersion to the game.
<br>It&apos;s rouge-like nature can be a flaw sometimes. Sometimes even if you are a very good player you lose no matter what, for example you spec your ship into drones, and you find only 1 combat drone through entire campaign failing miserably. Sometimes it also can be too easy, it really depends more on luck than skill.
<br>The graphics are kinda cartoonish but this is okay in an indie game, though better graphics would make this game way more amazing.
<br>The music is epic, I listened to it outside of the game more than I played it I think, really immersive, you can find in on youtube and see if it suits your style.
<br>During the game you unlock new ships and new ships layouts which gives it a lot of replay ability. Single campaign will take you only a couple hours to complete, but it&apos;s not a problem thanks to it&apos;s rouge-like nature.
<br>What else...technically it&apos;s almost perfect as I did not encounter any major glitches or crashes.
<br>Also it&apos;s modable. There are a lot of good mods out there, mostly adding new ships but also total overhauls worth checking out.
<br>
<br>For it&apos;s very low price I can&apos;t give it any less than 8/10. It&apos;s one of the best indie games out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3840589">Expand</a></span>

While the game is extremely well polished in terms of controls and music, the game gets lost in sometimes terrible RNG and overcomplicated micromanagement that could&apos;ve been simplified by rethinking the &quot;crew&quot; feature. Oh and by the way, each time you enter a zone, you have a fleet of elite rebels chasing you every step of the way, so you constantly feel like you&apos;re in a rush to move on to the next zone, which only gets progressively more difficult.

My advice? If you feel that repetition wave coming on, go play something else for awhile. Guarantee you&apos;ll be biting at the bit wanting to play one more game though, which is why breaks help especially after a long play session.</span>

Until 22nd of July it&apos;s 5 bucks on steam, and I would suggest you try it out if you haven&apos;t. But I will say, i&apos;m glad I did not pay more for it. FTL is simply to random and way too frustrating for the average player. And that&apos;s a shame, because the game has the potential to be very entertaining and enjoyable. But it seems the game designers, out of some misfit idea of game design or general stubborness, on purpose have made it so. A shame because most books on game design written by the professionals, will tell you to avoid exactly these frustration points, if you don&apos;t want to trow away customers. That&apos;s why I can only give it a 4.
<br>
<br>FTL forces you to abandon all progress you have made in a game, if you die. Be that by mistake on your own or random chance. And the game is way to random. Here&apos;s an example: On one try I entered a fight in the 2nd sector in my basic Engi ship. Then 3 rockmen beams on board, while a solar flare is erupting in the background. I have only 1 human and 2 engi (all worse than rockmen) to fight, so they loose almost by default, and in the meantime the solar flares are setting most of my ship on fire that the rockmen isn&apos;t destroying. Not really much of a chance. 10-15 min of gameplay... complete waste due to random chance. And this happens ALOT in FTL.
<br>
<br>The bad things about this game could have been fixed in a rather simple way. Introduce saving when out of combat for example, maybe just on easy mode but not on normal (or make a hard without it). But taking away the choice completely is not clever. Reduce/remove certain ship/encounter combinations on easy mode, corresponding to your chosen ship layout (I.e. the above example would be OK in the mantis ship, but not on a Engi ship).  Oh, and introduce higher resolutions, this isn&apos;t 1990 anymore.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s too bad, cause as it is, FTL only makes me annoyed when playing. Succeeding 1 times out of 5 mostly because of bad luck is not good game design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3293953">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story is pretty straightforward, you&apos;re captain of a federation ship and there are rebels trying to overthrow the federation. Your job is to make sure it doesn&apos;t happen. Along your jorney, many random events occur: pirates attack, you run into asteroid belts, aliens make contact, you encounter merchants... the list is giant.
<br>Music is simply good; it&apos;s pleasant even trough hours of playing and it fits the atmosphere, not much to talk about.
<br>Gameplay is simple enough, you micromanage your ship in combat and go around systems. The thing is, scrutinizing possibilities is essential. You have to decide wether it&apos;s worth exploring the system you&apos;re in, or it&apos;s better just to find a merchant and move on. Many times, you&apos;re given choices, and deciding what&apos;s best, wich risks are worth taking is at the same time a difficult and gratifying experience.
<br>What really appeals to me in this game is the overall feeling you get playing. That raw sense of discovery, encountering new alien races, ships, weapons, random events, it&apos;s all about exploration. And well, yeah, you&apos;ll die a lot. Like, Dark Souls a lot. And game over means a game over for real. But every gameplay is new, every gameplay is more discovery, it just shows how failure is not necessarely something bad, it teaches you a lot, and opens space for new experiences.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3888618">Expand</a></span>

<br>Battles are always the same: target weapons, disable them. Then shields. Accept surrender, proceed.
<br>
<br>The difficulty curve is non existent: it&apos;s not a curve, it&apos;s a series of grades you are forced to climb.
<br>First level, ok getting the gist of this.
<br>Second level: well this is getting heavy.
<br>Third level: &quot;holy  where did THAT come from?&quot;.
<br>Fourth level: &quot;oh COME ON, how am i even supposed to fight that? Time to run away&quot;

If you are a PC gamer that does not enjoy watching hours of your time go down the toilet because of RNG, do not play this game.  It is just a glorified slot machine with a GUI, not a game.  You can be the most seasoned veteran of strategy games, and still suck at it, simply because everything in the game is randomized and has a built in  chance of success/failure.  The &quot;quests&quot; you get can easily be broken on each random map, sending you to planets you can&apos;t get to because of the &quot;rebel creep&quot; mechanic, you can be destroyed by a much lesser ship just because they landed 2 lucky shots with OP missiles, etc.  Is it fun?  Sure, kinda.  Will it be enormously frustrating?  Absolutely.

I guess the &quot;running the spaceship&quot; and &quot;saving the galaxy&quot; part got me confused. Or perhaps the &quot;strategy&quot; and &quot;simulation&quot; categories made me think that the actual gameplay would involve either of these. I must admit, that I missed the &quot;rogue-like&quot; part mentioned in passing on the steam store page. (BTW &quot;saving the galaxy&quot; part is   the galaxy is never in peril throughout the game. It&apos;s there in all its randomness, and it&apos;s feeling just fine.)
<br>
<br>So please, if you do not have a deep love for the rogue-like genre, do NOT pick up this game. Being at the mercy of the random-number god for scraps (literally) will not be fun for you as it was not fun for me. The game goes out of its way to make running your starship feel static and lifeless. The scenery never changes: there&apos;s your ship on the left, there&apos;s a smaller enemy ship on the right. You wait for some bars to fill, and occasionally pause to ponder where to shoot next. The interface follows the &quot;hover over icon if you want to understand this&quot; principle. (Except when it doesn&apos;t, in case you want to know the systems or weapons of an enemy ship, you have to look for a similar icon on *your* ship. In case of weapons, just forget it.)
<br>
<br>The soundtrack starts feeling repetitive about 10 minutes in and is basically the same two tunes over and over. Ugh.
<br>
<br>Gameplay 2/10 (ymmv, more if you enjoy a Random Events Plot)
<br>Sound: 5/10 (decent quality, but very repetitive and gets boring quickly)
<br>Design: 3/10 (see above)
<br>Visuals: 3/20 (very 90&apos;s)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3592483">Expand</a></span>

Enemy boards in your oxygen room, dead. Spend resources upgrading the wrong thing, dead. Don&apos;t find a store, dead. Don&apos;t upgrade enough, dead. Don&apos;t save enough, dead.
<br>
<br>And take note: there is NO SAVE FEATURE. You can play for two hours, feeling like FINALLY you might win EASY MODE, and then you equip the wrong weapons for the final battle and you&apos;re dead, no retry, just start the entire game over.
<br>
<br>A lot of random encounters waste your resources and give you nothing back. You can&apos;t upgrade your actual weapons (just hope you find more), there&apos;s very little way to repair your ship, and there&apos;s absolutely no way to stop some enemy weapons.
<br>
<br>The thing is, this could be really fun if they&apos;d make it more about skill than dumb luck. (Crew members gain abilities, multiple battle strategies, each play is a little different, and there are no time sinks at all.) And I&apos;m sure we all get tired of games that force us to memorize what enemies are where and how to beat them. But they make it just too stupid and frustrating. if you want a game that is winnable based on clever or crafty playing, don&apos;t even waste $5 on this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3281045">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s important to understand that &quot;spaceship simulation roguelike-like&quot; means there&apos;s no saves or checkpoints, whatever time you invest can be easily wiped and you need to start from scratch simply because of bad luck.
<br>
<br>Pros include an enjoyable ambient sound track, an intuitive interface, a varied experience due to the random nature of the game and plenty of unlockables with achievements.
<br>
<br>Cons include a poor method of enhancing longevity by introducing an artificial roadblock in terms of checkpoints which really aren&#x2019;t necessary what with all the unlockables and achievements the game provides.
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;d probably rate this game considerably but the minority of diehard fans that troll anyone who innocently asks on forums how to save has soured my experience of the game and thus I&#x2019;ve advised my friends to avoid it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3407880">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay seems simple yet  its fun and addictive, loved the music and really liked the customization of your ship.</span>

<br>It is a very difficult game, and since there is a large randomization factor with, well, every system and every encounter, it can feel at times that winning or losing (mostly losing) can be a matter of luck, but so much strategy goes into building your ship and dealing with combat that you wind up feeling like every choice you make must be a contemplated one.

<br>This is a wonderful creation. Go give them your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3095715">Expand</a></span>

Its only $9.99 (got it on Steam sale for about $4.99) and I spent about 100 hours total playing it. Wow. Its now available on iPad and as soon as the come out with it on Android, I&apos;m buying it for my Android devices (all of them). Ship to ship combat never felt so cool until FTL.</span>

But after 3 weeks of games I found that it&apos;s a game based mostly on LUCK, not on skill. I made it to the last boss 9 times. All lost because I didn&apos;t have enough firepower, enough shields or enemy shots hit me all in the right rooms while mine missed 3-4 times in a row. Well, I suggest you of restarting game each time you reach 4-5 zone and you don&apos;t have the right equipment. Another font of disappointment is the random  encounters. Some are matched to your strenght. Others are IMPOSSIBLE to kill. At least 4 times in a row I found 3 enemy ships with 4 (FOUR) shields. After third my missiles were gone, so the fourth killed me without any hope. Well, It&apos;s a nice game, but sometimes it seem only a loss of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2881970">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Okay if you like games of skill and being able to not die to sheer randomness then avoid this game. It starts off fun enough, the graphics are functional enough and easy to see what is going on, the sound is decent enough too. A brief summary of the game&apos;s plot is you&apos;re a ship from the Federation outrunning the evil Rebels and you must reach a set stage and confront and kill the Rebel&apos;s flagship. It has a nice sci-fi space opera feel to it but where it goes wrong, very wrong is that more or less your chance of success or failure is based on pure luck and even then when you get the Rebel&apos;s ship on it&apos;s last legs it&apos;s clear the programmers are messing  with you as it suddenly fires off a load of lasers. The only way to win is pretty much get a right combination of weapons and ship upgrades that are very much luck dependent, not on your skill as a player. This sours the overall experience and yes so what if they claim it to be rogue like but really if all you want to do is die to the end boss again and again and the other stages seems pretty much repetitive after a while. At first I thought the game was fun but it became very clear it&apos;s just designed to kill you off and then becomes just repetitive. Nice ideas, sloppy end game, once beaten no real inclination to go back and play it again. Some hope for the games redemption is with mods but as the games stands on it&apos;s own merits, it is far too random to be fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2868584">Expand</a></span>

Unlocking new ships is mostly an exercise of hoping for 3 random events to happen in succession or you finally get that one good run where your ship stays more advanced than your enemies.  Then, when you beat the boss and get an advanced ship that is 10% better, then enemies get 25% harder making a negative progression.  At first, the main game is hard to the point of frustration, but not too hard to discourage you.  Spending a half hour running around in space only to have some elite ship come out of nowhere and kill you in 3 volleys of shots is infuriating.  It wouldn&#x2019;t be so bad if you could spend your &#x201C;score&#x201D; on permanent upgrades or be able to customize your ships with the load out you want.  Score is meaningful in a skill based game but has no place here other than a consolation price when the difficulty doubles for a particular battle.  If you are like me, you&#x2019;ll stick with it to beat the boss by which time you&#x2019;ll have seen 90% of all mission content.  I thought that I&#x2019;d finally have a 4/10 chance at having a good run rather than a 2/10 chance after unlocking the ship you get for killing the boss.  But now, the chances seem to go down to 1/10.  And then, you&#x2019;d just be killing the boss again unless you are lucky enough to unlock some other ship.  I suppose that&#x2019;s why they made it harder (lack of a second quest). My time is valuable and I expect at least something to improve if I pour my time into it.  You&#x2019;ll learn what missions have a higher success rate and can make better decisions, but mostly failed missions gain you nothing.  Overall you&#x2019;ll feel mostly frustrated, a little helpless, and then have a few moments of triumph.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2934297">Expand</a></span>

Units and doors often do not respond, or the unit/door next to where you clicked responds instead of what you clicked on. The randomization routine really needs an overhaul. Just about every play through you will be shorted at least one crucial type of needed item.</span>

If you liked the board game you&apos;ll probably like this as well even though it can be equally frustrating. The graphics are a matter of taste, personally I like them. The music is nice as well but gets a bit repetitive after a while. The UI and controls are well done. Game mechanics are simple and easy to learn but allow for varied strategies and challenging fights. Unfortunately it&apos;s too random and you&apos;re too dependent on simply being lucky and getting enough resources or good events. There will be encounters where you simply have no chance of survival. Also it has very limited content so after only a few times playing you will have seen everything. Could have used a possibility for constructing your own ships or maybe coop-multiplayer (It&apos;d be perfect for this).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2625381">Expand</a></span>

This is not Dark Souls or Ninja Gaiden, where the difficulty comes from the intense challenge to learn how to play the game right. Here the difficulty comes from the programmers laughing at you while they slap unfair situations in your face. Almost every situation is decided by pure luck, especially when you have learned to multi-task. Avoid this game at all costs, it is frustrating and pointless since the good premise and slick production conceals a game that is not fun, entertaining, rewarding or actually challenging (having good luck is not a challenge) in any way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2819073">Expand</a></span>

I hadn&apos;t heard of FTL before this point, but I&apos;m glad I bought it. The game is basically Nethack in space, although while I find nethack frustrating to the point of wanting to throw my computer out the window, FTL, while still being hard as nails doesn&apos;t frustrate in the same way. Yes it&apos;s going to take you a while to have a game where you make it to the final sector. Yes it&apos;s going to take you even longer to beat the game, but each and every journey you find yourself telling the stories of your crew, living through their little pixelated lives and it really tears at your heart to lose your captain to a pack of killer spiders, or that engi slave you freed to a pirate boarding party. Deep under all the repetitive scenarios and mechanics there is this tiny little random heart beating life into the game in a way that even big-name titles seem to fall short of, and if you&apos;re a perfectionist, or a completionist there are some difficult unlockables to catch but even though I&apos;ve basically seen all the game has to offer I keep going back, because it&apos;s easy to get into and hard as hell to master.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2643670">Expand</a></span>

Honestly I love this game, I haven&apos; played anything this good and interesting in a years and I&apos;ve been playing games as far back as  20 years ago, this one stands up with such classics like Civ and Master of Orion.  It&apos;s awesome how you get control your own little space ship and micromanage the systems and crew, putting out fires by unlocking the airlocks, sending boarding parties, and trying to knock out the other ships shields, all the while employing different strategies.  Should I use drones, or invest in weapons? Shields or faster engine speed to dodge enemy attacks? A cloak shield or teleporter? Which system on the opponent ship should I bring down first? So many decisions and no game is quite the same.  The graphics are simple but you soon forget about as you get lost in your own little world, you quickly get attached to your ship and your crew. Some people will knock the repetitive nature or replayability of this game (you can finish a game in 2 hours or less), but you have a lot of different strategies to employ and you can get new ship designs to better optimize those strategies, plus the encounters and weapon drops are random so you never have the same experience each game.  As with any game you will get bored eventually, it&apos;s just a fact, but for the past week since I&apos;ve been playing this I&apos;m still eager to play more as I just got new ship designs and for the fact that I only paid 9 bucks for it, the investment has been returned 2 fold.  The only reason it&apos;s not a 10 is because there isn&apos;t a longer campaign mode or just a bit more diversity in events to reduce the repetitiveness, but I doubt the developer will rest on his laurels and I&apos;m sure more gameplay  and features are planned.  Playing this game has been a revelation and I will not hesitate to recommend this to anyone who likes sci-fi strategy games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2632520">Expand</a></span>

This game shines brightly in the indie genre, a truly unique game. You take control of 1 of 8 ships and you have to micro mange every system of the ship including shields, engines, weapons even sensors and oxygen. Replayability is a whole new level. You also have to escape from the rebels which are hot on your tail all the time so when you approach a new galaxy you have to decide on a route and stick to it. Every galaxy you cross is different each with there own unique situations. Whether its a distress call that you go and investigate or just get across the galaxy as quick as possible every time it&apos;s different. This game has great suspense with every move you make, for example when approaching a distress call it could be an innocent mining colony being attacked by pirates or it could be pirates setting a trap. Each decision has a consequence that could be the difference between life and death. Each ship has 2 layouts which vary so that you can decide what you prefer, so altogether there is 16 different ship combinations. There is also an upgrade system in which you buy parts using the currency of scrap. You find scrap by destroying enemy ships or helping out the innocent. You have to manage every minor detail include power distribution, whether you want more power to the engines for evasive movement or more power to the guns for better offense. Lots of different things can happen for example if they hit the engines with a missile then the engine room will explode and the ship will catch fire. You can tackle this in multiple ways, for example you can send one of your crew into the room with a fire extinguisher to put it out however there is a risk to this because your crew members will get hurt and can, in the worse case, die whilst putting it out leaving you a crew member down. Or you can open up exterior doors to drain the oxygen to put the fires out however if the ships door system is also damaged during the fight then this is not possible. So there are multiple ways to deal with every situation its what you decide is best at the time. Altogether this is a fantastic little game that every one should have a go at and really see what indie developers are capable of.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2633775">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I expect it&apos;ll soon start to get less interesting, but the random even factors always keep you on your toes and you never know from the beginning which direction the game is going to go in. It&apos;s impressively hard, and I would imagine some people would be really frustrated by this, but in my opinion this makes a good game, because you can make it far into the game, start to lose, and see where one mistake or piece of equipment you foolishly passed up an hour before is the only reason you are dying.
<br>
<br>The game is incredibly simple to learn and play, yet the more I play it the more I&apos;m seeing its complexities. According to Steam I&apos;ve played 10 hours in the past three days.... So either I&apos;ll get tired of it, or uninstall it so I don&apos;t completely ruing my body with lack of sleep.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2897469">Expand</a></span>

After many, many attempts, I finally beat the final boss, and boy was it satisfying. If you just want a casual experience, then do not buy this game. If you are the type of person that wants a challenge, then you need to buy this game. Especially fun to play with friends, even though it is a single player game. In conclusion, there is nothing much bad with this game. The only problem I have with it is the learning and difficulty curve, but you get the hang of it very quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2974414">Expand</a></span>

FTL takes random number generation to a whole new level, oftentimes deciding the fate of an entire playthrough based on some luck of the draw. More than a little unfair, this game is downright infuriating. There&apos;s no way around it. But despite this, FTL is not actually  &quot;difficult&quot;. In fact, it&apos;s very straightforward and simple to play, but there is such a disconnect between player action and successful execution of those actions that more often than not you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;re doing nothing at all.
<br>
<br>A prime example of this is weapon hit registration. On more than one occasion I have simply stared at FTL while my crew and ship tried valiantly to hit their opponent, sometimes elongating battles that should have taken a less than a minute into three or four minutes of doing nothing while all of my lasers and missiles flash a cheerful &quot;miss&quot; over and over. And over. And over.
<br>
<br>And over again.
<br>
<br>This terrible &quot;enemy favored&quot; randomness plagues literally every aspect of this game.
<br>
<br>Aside from this basic fundamental flaw, the game is lacking in almost every other area as well. There is a generic, half hearted &quot;goal&quot; that actually takes more out of the game than it puts into it. The ships, races, and weapons are all bland copy/paste sci fi with no real aesthetic customization options. I managed to beat it once and it was a wholly unsatisfying experience, both because of the general lack of story and the fact that you&apos;re rushed from system to system because of an entirely unneeded &quot;you&apos;re being chased constantly&quot; mechanic. You&apos;re forced through the game at a pace that doesn&apos;t allow you to explore even half of what is available to explore, oftentimes being pushed out of a system entirely unprepared and low on supplies.
<br>
<br>I could ramble on and on about FTL, but here&apos;s the bottom line:
<br>
<br>The designers here just didn&apos;t know how to make a good game. I think the few things done well in FTL are really just a blind squirrel&apos;s nut.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3149027">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gameplay - WIN. Even though there really isn&apos;t much of a variety of gameplay, It is always fun, very repeatable and VERY hard. it will take you a long time to win the game just once, then so much more to unlock all the content available

I beat the game on easy!
<br>That is something that you won&apos;t hear that often, hardly ever for that matter, when it comes to most video games. This game is difficult and takes time to master the intricacies of what will work in certain situations. While the game randomly generates each play-through, you will from time to time get events that are similar, but with how unforgiving the game can be at times, that is a good thing. You learn from mistakes and adapt, though you usually have to adapt more than once with each play-through.
<br>
<br>It is a wonderful top down spaceship command game, and with what games have come out in the past decade, FTL feels pleasantly fresh to me, but with a retro feel. The sound track is awesome; it&apos;s typical sci-fi fair but it definitely sounds original and also retro with the computerized sounding notes. The graphics have the same retro feel, like I&apos;m playing a game that could have come out 15 years ago by the look. That is also a good thing, since it gives me something different to look at compared to the top of the line graphics oriented games. Not everything in gaming is about having the best graphics, and frankly, graphics rank low on the list about what is important in making a great game.
<br>
<br>Game play is a big factor in great games and FTL has just that. While the encounters can get repetitive at times, each encounter can change from that to different within seconds. On well placed hit by an enemy can have you sending your crew running to repair a hull breach or a heavily damaged life support system. It can get hectic at times, but the game does allow you to pause mid-combat to analyze  the situation act out your best plan accordingly.
<br>
<br>Besides the music I mention before, the sound effects are great as well. The sound of missiles exploding as they hit their mark, varying &quot;pew pew&quot; style laser sounds from laser batteries, and the crackling of an ion cannon shot that has disabled a system on the enemy ship(though more likely yours). There is also is the ability to cloak your ship if it came with a cloak or if you bought one along your journey. If you want to teleport people, you can do that too if your ship has one or you get one. Teleport some of your crew to reek havoc on the enemy vessel.
<br>
<br>As I said the game is very unforgiving and permanent death is something that makes the game twice as nail biting since there is no save function that allows you to start at the last good place if you die. But since the game doesn&apos;t take that long to get to the end(play-throughs usually last no more that 2 hours), the permanent death is not a problem. Though it can tug at your heart strings, if you have named your faithful ship and crew, which the game lets you do. Oh, poor Engineer Gork, your effort in putting out the  fire in the engine room was greatly appreciated, but sadly you perished from the lack of oxygen before you could get to safety in the nearby corridor.
<br>
<br>The game is quite amazing in every way. Though if you don&apos;t like a challenge, then I guess it isn&apos;t for you. As for me, I love it and all its quirks, so that is why I give it a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2643884">Expand</a></span>

Desperately wanting to play the game which I saw with my mind&apos;s eye, I applied cheats and save game editors. No matter what I tried, I was not able to find a way to have fun playing this game, hence my score.  Still, if you can get a free demo, I would encourage you to try it.

This is definitely a tough game, as any roguelike should be, but it doesn&apos;t seem unfair, every failure has been my own fault and it feels good to learn from mistakes and do that little bit better next time. Not that it&apos;s a huge difference, but I&apos;m enjoying the space setting, it&apos;s nice to take a break from the high fantasy settings that you typically find. The controls are simple, but the combat is deceptively deep, as is the customization of your ship. Loot abounds as you progress, so there&apos;s always something to look forward to, my ship and/or crew rarely stays the same. There&apos;s the ability to unlock different starting crews, ships, and ship layouts, though I have yet to unlock any of these yet, I&apos;m interested to see how it affects game play when you start with a different type of ship. I also must mention the soundtrack, it&apos;s awesome, I almost wish I had purchased the version that comes with the soundtrack. If you&apos;re a fan of roguelikes this is a must buy. If you&apos;re not a fan, this may be the game to get you there, as it does have both a normal and easy mode, perfect for a new player to roguelikes. Buy, then die!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2624490">Expand</a></span>

That is what you get with FTL. FTL is a little space strategy game of space combat. Leading your ship and your crew through different space sectors. Manage ship and crew, optimize crew abilities like piloting, engineering, shield operations, fighting. Develop your ship with new weapons, drones, missile launcher, support gear and so on. Have friendly and hostile encounters, battle your way back to your home fleet to fight the enemy mother ship and protect your home base.
<br>
<br>If you like these sort of (indie) games 10 EUR/DOLLAR won&#xB4;t be wasted.
<br>
<br>While graphics are appropriate, game play and handling is great.
<br>
<br>I wonder what be will see next. There is a very high potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2624020">Expand</a></span>

Sure, it may get annoying starting over the game from the beginning, but the maps are randomly generated leaving you to all new explorations each play through and with ships to unlock, you can explore the galaxy differently each time.  You also have control of pretty much everything on the ship, from doors to crew members, to the weapons and power usage of each of your ships systems.  Overall, it is a great strategy/star ship simulator that is worth the $10 price tag as the experience is almost always different each play through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2624375">Expand</a></span>

It feels a bit &apos;flat&apos; art-wise, and with all the talent on the net that&apos;s just disappointing. Its very obvious they needed 1 more art guy, and you&apos;d think with all that kickstarter money they would have been able to hire someone. If i had pledged money via kickstarter i&apos;d be pissed off, there&apos;s really no excuse and its obvious they pocketed the money instead of spending it on dev.

With a little help from various tips on the web, I can get through five sectors before getting summarily clobbered by an enemy ship. Once I space-jumped into two consecutive suns (which shut down some systems and start fires) and got destroyed by the enemy (which seemed less affected). One time my oxygen room got hit by enemy fire and I couldn&apos;t repair it for some unknown reason, so all my crew died and the game ended. Every time I&apos;m doing just fine, rolling along, then a ship more powerful than mine in some way shows up and crushes me. Easy mode should be easier than this; I should at least be able to get to the final (8th) sector before I get wasted. Also, the game offers no help or tips and you can&apos;t save it as you go. That&apos;s right, when your ship dies you have to start all over again. I, for one, have had enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2950994">Expand</a></span>

Imagine fetch missions, a la WoW, set in the Space Quest universe, and lacking the tongue-in-cheek humor of that universe.  This game tries to appeal to our nostalgia, but it fails on a visceral and basic level.  Should you choose to waste your money, take this very basic primer on &quot;advanced&quot; tactics:  buy a second tier weapon ASAP, target weapons first, then shields--often this is enough.  In case of boarders, move your little 8 pixel crew around into a secure room, pretend that one of the pixels is Mal, and vent your 2D Firefly class ship into space.
<br>
<br>See?  I summarized a &quot;tactically challenging&quot; and &quot;textually deep&quot; game in about 100 words, and saved you $10 to find that out.  There is no challenge and no replay value.  There are better games on Facebook, and you don&apos;t have to pay for them.  Save your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3018413">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is quite challenging - even on easy - so be prepared.  People who complain about the fact that you can&apos;t save/reload progress may be missing the point of this game and why permadeath is important to the fun and replayability.  This is not the type of game where you play through it once and put it away - the whole appeal of this game is to try again.  Also, for the people who complain about how the game is just grinding to improve stats, I think you may not understand the appeal of RPG games, especially in the classic style.
<br>
<br>Flame wars aside, it is a massively good deal for $10 (I got it on sale for $9) and you will get your money&apos;s worth.  I haven&apos;t been this addicted to a game in a long time, so be ready!  Oh, and the music is AWESOME!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2624579">Expand</a></span>

<br>Can&apos;t complain about the graphics or the limited resources like music but you can&apos;t win on this game and there&apos;s no fun about that.Your first and probably only ship that you will play is pure garbage.And that  couldn&apos;t be too much upgraded because game money and bonuses are as scarce as the chances to survive at least to achieve a new one.Whatever the case I unlocked another better than the stock and still surviving is very improbable for long periods of time.And to unlock another ships it&apos;s very odd as to like this game more than 3 days!If at least some upgrades where left on your inventory, to have more chances of surviving no matter how long to get them but no.Only ships very unreachable at very impossible chances to accomplish.I put all my effort to &quot;enjoy&quot; the game but I came after 2 half days that this game is a complete waste of time.Maybe 15 years ago this could be a huge success but today can only be enjoyed with alcohol or some drug!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2659210">Expand</a></span>

The objective of the game is to lead your single ship across eight sectors and defeat the boss before the enemy fleet catches up to you. The core part of the gameplay is the ship battles, which is quite variable when it comes to the encounters and strategies to win. Do you want to knock down the shields and rip them apart with every laser and missile you&apos;ve got? Maybe you will take it steady by constantly disabling their weapons, giving them a slow but efficient death. You could disable their oxygen supply and set the medical room on fire so they can slowly burn or suffocate to death, leaving you to salvage a ship still in condition. The variable is vast and the fights are an enjoyable factor of the game that keep you on your toes to make sure your crew comes out unscratched. Outside of the combat the gameplay becomes a little lacking. You try manage scraps to buy new items or  upgrade your own ship and try to complete quests or special events for a nice reward. It may come out a bit meager compared to the combat gameplay but it helps provide a little stress relief for the big haul you have to make.
<br>
<br>When it comes to the game&apos;s design, the pleasant colors and pixels mesh into a simple but endearing style. The music plays off with pleasant and groovy electro tunes that only moderately pick up in tensity when a battle occurs. The game&apos;s interface is organized and well-sized, not relying on menu navigation while going through your options.
<br>
<br>Being a roguelike, it&apos;s to be expected that the game is going to be difficult. And it is. Even trying the Easy difficulty doesn&apos;t show me any differences except that I will get more scraps from accomplishing things. The game is more luck than skill. Running into a solar flare that wipes out  your crew or having your weapons constantly disabled in a firefight can quickly stop your adventure  despite it having just started five minutes ago. This game can become very generous in one session and quite brutal in another. Losing is not just a possibility, it&apos;s to be expected. But with a successful run being around 45-60 minutes, it doesn&apos;t feel as upsetting when you can quickly get back on your feet for another round. In the chance that you do defeat the end boss and complete the game, there isn&apos;t much to go by replay value except unlocking new ships and doing game achievements. Faster Than Light is an enjoyable game that&apos;s very easy to learn but very tough to master. The gameplay&apos;s simplicity and short length gives it the lethally addictive formula that gives you the desperation to try another attempt at reaching the end. The reward of finally winning completely renews your spirit It&apos;s a fun game but a very harsh one. Game price: $10. Worth: Every penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2642432">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately it is not quite finished, and extremely unbalanced towards the end. (spoiler alert). The endgame consists of 3 battles with the enemy mothership, however the second encounter is impossible to finish. For some reason the enemy ship will board endless times, and also extremely often, so you cannot defeat the first one before the second comes on. Also the enemies are unable to suffocate via the doors for some reason  And as if that weren&apos;t enough for some reason the ship loses it&apos;s shields every 10 seconds or so, and it&apos;s impossible to stop this from happening. When developers fix this bug, I will raise score to 8. It&apos;s really annoying, because when you&apos;re defeated at the second endgame boss encounter, you realize you&apos;ve wasted 10 hours of your life because of this bug. Hope this will be fixed soon. -Ursa</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3423397">Expand</a></span>

And remember people the fights are just as hard on &quot;easy&quot; you just get a bit more money. When I was very young about 24 years ago there was a turn based Mech Warrior RPG.......I loved that then. And I love this now. They seem very similar.</span>

From here you control your crew to man stations, you fire weapons, repair systems, manage power output, defend against boarding parties, and can even have boarding parties of your own.
<br>If you like games where the majority of the events are determine by the RNG, you&apos;ll love FTL.
<br>Resources, rewards, events, maps, enemy encounters, shop location, shop items for sale are all determined by the RNG. After playing for 34 hours I have determined that very little is left up to player control.
<br>You may have a run where you get tons of resources and upgrades gifted to you, or where you&apos;re left a pauper scrounging for scrap to repair your ship. Standard fair if you&apos;ve played Binding of Isaac.
<br>The biggest issue I have with this game is that it takes control away from the player.
<br>Binding of Isaac you took direct control of Isaac and had to aim your shot manually.
<br>Combat in FTL is largely turn-based where you sit around waiting for your weapons to charge.
<br>After that you target a system on the enemy ship and fire. It&apos;s up the RNG whether your shot will hit or miss. If you have transporters you can get guarenteed shots by porting crewman into their cockpit to attack their pilot so there is a way to mitigate this.
<br>But the word is &quot;IF&quot;
<br>If you had the scrap, if you found the shop, if the item in question was for sale.
<br>That is the one thing that every &quot;strategy guide&quot; fails to mention is that all encounters, loot, etc is determined by the game.
<br>Many [strike]fanboys[/strike] fans of the game will argue it&apos;s skill based rather than luck.
<br>Please don&apos;t be fooled.
<br>Every strategy I&apos;ve seen on FTL fails to mention that pulling it off is contingent on HAVING the right gear for it. If the game doesn&apos;t give it to you during an encounter or for sale in a shop, you can&apos;t do it.
<br>Other useful &quot;protips&quot; include not repairing your ship to full health, juggling power between systems rather than spending money to upgrade your reactor to save money for future upgrades.
<br>Both those &quot;strategies&quot; are going under the assumption that you will run across a mission that will result in free hull repairs, or free system upgrades. (Which can happen)
<br>CAN happen doesn&apos;t mean it will. If you happen to run into an enemy ship that gets a few lucky shots it could kill you. What they&apos;re doing is playing the odds, but a card-counter can still lose.
<br>
<br>FTL&apos;s most impressive accomplishment is the psychology based around it.
<br>The gameplay is tedious and repetive, but addictive. This is accomplished by rewarding the player at random intervals with scrap, weapons, new crewman.  Sometimes just for jumping into a system.
<br>By bestowing these rewards upon the player, it encourages the player to continue pumping in hours of their life into the game. If you&apos;re having a good run you&apos;re motivated by greed and a sense of empowerment. &quot;I want more weapons more scrap, give me MOAR!! I am invincible! HAHAHA!&quot;
<br>If you&apos;re having a bad run you&apos;re motivated by hope and desperation. &quot;Just have to make it to a shop to repair. I can do it. Maybe this system...no...maybe the next system.&quot;
<br>The point being to get the player to get sooo close to victory or even die based on bad luck so you&#x2019;ll run it back.
<br>Regardless of whether you&apos;re having the most amazing run ever, the final boss can still curb-stomp you into the dirt with just a few well placed shots.
<br>I had one fight where the Rebel Flagship couldn&apos;t hit the broad side of a barn and every shot that did connect would hit systemless rooms.
<br>On the other hand I had encounters where I couldn&apos;t hit the Rebel Flagship to save my life and everyone of their shots seemed to hit just the right system at just the right moment.
<br>There are intances where the boss fight will rage on and it feels like you&apos;re both on equal ground, or somethings his first volley will cripple every system you have and you&apos;ll die in mere minutes.
<br>FTL is a game where you can do everything right and still lose.
<br>That&apos;s not a game. Not a good game anyway.
<br>In FTL you win or lose based on the randomness of the enemy AI and everything that followed before that.
<br>It&apos;s not skill when you defeat an opponent who spent the entire fight teleporting bombs into systemless rooms.
<br>And it&apos;s not a lack of skill if you lost because you all your shots missed thanks to the RNG.
<br>It&apos;s luck, plain and simple.
<br>If this review keeps one person from buying this travesty I&apos;ve done my job.
<br>FTL is more roulette than space simulator. Avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4270360">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The problems are there&apos;s just a lack of content for random encounters.  After a few replays you start to see patterns in encounters and know what path to pick even before you read the whole thing.  Some encounters just seem predetermined for you to fail or lack any substantial rewards to risk your crew and ship over.  It just gets a tad old.
<br>
<br>Another problem is un-lockable ships aren&apos;t the easiest to unlock and it&apos;d be nice for the developers to include maybe an extra ship or two at the beginning to allow new people for more flexible game play initially.  If you&apos;ve got $10 and enjoy tactical game play with some luck involved, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2665711">Expand</a></span>

It offers so many things that the industry seems to be completely devoid of these days. First off, there&apos;s an actual learning curve. You have to learn by doing in FTL, and it usually results in a few miserable failures before you have any chance of success. There is no hand-holding, no quicksaving- you&apos;re simply expected to go down with the ship and then give it another go. But when you do, you&apos;re prepared for more contingencies. What was your flaw? Did you get boarded and defeated because you lacked a strong crew? Did you over-invest in weapons while neglecting defensive subsystems like shields, engines, and cloaking? And if so, which subsystems should you have invested in? The gameplay is about preparing for contingencies, and there are only so many. Once you learn all of them you can adequately spec your ship to be able to counter all of them. However, the game makes it VERY difficult to cover all of your bases, mostly due to a simple lack of resources and time. Not a single player, no matter how experienced, enters the final boss fight with every contingency covered. And as a result, the final battle is always rewarding no matter how prepared you are.
<br>
<br>On top of all that, there are unique random events that can happen in the game that can really change your experience for the better- or the worse. I will always remember an event where my female human pilot was killed trying to save an alien crewmember from a civilian ship- there&apos;s no cutscene, no fanfair, just a dialog saying that your pilot is dead and the crewmember survived. That alien crewmember became my new pilot and led us to victory. Sometimes it&apos;s more harsh and less dramatic. Find an alien artifact in space? Be careful approaching it. It might cause one of your crew to rapidly age in reverse until they disappear.
<br>
<br>There are lots of achievements, which I&apos;m not usually fond of, but in this case I think they complement the game well. Everyone&apos;s going to make multiple attempts at the game, so why not make certain starting options unlockables? I really don&apos;t mind achievements when they&apos;re not half-ass. Either the entire game should be based around them or they shouldn&apos;t be there. The designers of FTL seem to feel the same way.
<br>
<br>Most importantly, the game offers challenge. The &quot;Easy&quot; gamemode is almost inevitably what everyone will start out with, and everyone will likely die several times on it. The difficulty is what made me nostalgic more than any of the excellent retro music and graphics- what happened to side-scrolling action games without a save option, where the last level was legitimately SCARY just because you were afraid of losing your progress? I haven&apos;t felt that way about the final battle in a video game in a long time. In almost every game today, you die at the hands of the final boss- and then you&apos;re instantly resurrected in the fight again. For example, I remember in Batman- Arkham Asylum where the best strategy was to die in the second phase of the boss fight, because it would instantly resurrect you during that specific phase with full health. Ridiculous. NONE of that bs in FTL.
<br>
<br>FTL is a game about feeling a sense of learning and accomplishment. Victory is only earned through experience and endurance. In your first &quot;winning&quot; game, there will almost assuredly be times when, in any other game, you would have reloaded. A crew member dies to your own negligence; you run out of fuel and have to wait for help; you realize too late that you would&apos;ve specced differently if you had known better. In any other game you restart. In this game, you keep going. You make it work. After all, it&apos;s just a game. Remember when games were like that?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=2649138">Expand</a></span>
