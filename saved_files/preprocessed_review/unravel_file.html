<br>? The &quot;story&quot; is very specific and personal, but it also lacks the critical details needed to invest me in it -- in the end, a more explicit story or none at all might have been preferable.
<br>- The levels of this game feel like they were designed by artists and not actual level designers -- the puzzles are all over the place in difficulty and quality, and all of the challenge in the game comes from unintuitive interactions or the fact that the physics is too precise for its own good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unravel/user-reviews?user_review_id=6959572">Expand</a></span>

The levels of video games are mostly designed from critical thinking but over here in Unravel it is designed from heart and emotion . Unravel is not only a game rather a journey which teaches us that at the end of the day our most valuable asset is the sweet memories that we come across throughout our lives with loved ones and in this game this journey is experienced by holding the hands of the cute protagonist Yerny . The graphics and aesthetics are incredulously beautiful and well crafted . The environmental puzzles are so intricately designed that sometimes I  had to check let&apos;s play videos to get pass some of them . Finally I would like to say that Unravel is a journey that you cannot afford to miss .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unravel/user-reviews?user_review_id=6738565">Expand</a></span>

Deal with horrid physics, difficult jumps, dying a lot. Personally, I only enjoyed the introductory level. Everything else was incoherent mess. Most game reviews I read on this were stupidly inaccurate.</span>

<br>In unravel you play as yarny, I&#x2019;m not sure what yarny is but he&#x2019;s made out of yarn, and that&#x2019;s all that matter because this is important
<br>the entire game is using this yarn to overcome every obstacle that comes your way.
<br>You can use your yarn to swing across gaps, you can use it to create bridges, pull items, and to tie items together,
<br>These few simple principles are what make up the entirety of yarnys journey
<br>Unravel is not a difficult game, but it is challenging
<br>I never had to look up a solution to a puzzle, but it did stump me numerous times, making me feel like a genius  when I finally figure out the simple solution that&#x2019;s been staring me in the face for 5 minutes
<br>The puzzle aspect of this game is great, but I feel like there is just a little too much emphasis on it
<br>The levels in Unravel are gorgeous and so full of life, really putting you into the perspective of this character..
<br>You never feel like you&#x2019;re in a generic themed level&#x2026;
<br>Each level feels like this is a place from someone&#x2019;s memory
<br>And they are, as you complete each level, a scrap book if filled in to give more insight into the story going on..
<br>A story just as beautiful as the levels
<br>You could stop almost anywhere during the game and be amazed at what&#x2019;s going on in the breathing world around you
<br>Only problem is you have to actively do this, Unravel is almost constantly testing your brain,
<br>There are a few action sequences sprinkled in, but far less than there should be..
<br>It would be nice if there were more slow down moments in the game&#x2026;
<br>And by slow down I mean for your brain, not the gameplay
<br>A little more emphasis on some linear platforming here and there rather than just puzzle platforming stacked on top of each other
<br>While I say this though, I never felt overwhelmed while playing unravel which is common for me when I play this type of game
<br>I actually couldn&#x2019;t put the controller down..which is even more of a surprise considering each level took me anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes to play through organically&#x2026;
<br>I just feel like so much work, care and love went into crafting these levels, and there&#x2019;s never an opportunity to truly enjoy them&#x2026;. To stop and soak them in...
<br>All of your focus and brain power is going right into the task at hand that the backdrop can sometimes become a blur&#x2026;
<br>Unravel is fun, beautiful, it made me cry... in a good way&#x2026;
<br>I give unravel
<br>An 8.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unravel/user-reviews?user_review_id=6081879">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The main protagonist is literally an adorable little doll made out of yarn and yet he/it still manages to convey human emotions throughout the whole game.
<br>
<br>The music is lovely but not properly implemented and it feels as if though it plays separately from the game on a constant loop and basically ignoring the atmosphere and the pace of the game. I found the whole experience much more enjoyable after I turned off the music completely and could really listen to every bit of ambient sound (leaves rustling, wind, rain drops) which really helped immersion.
<br>
<br>Puzzles are simple and kinda repetitive, but the game is so gorgeous that every puzzle is a joy to do. Plus, the new and innovative approach to solving puzzles by &quot;unraveling&quot; yarn from yourself and tying knots doesn&apos;t get old quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unravel/user-reviews?user_review_id=7401469">Expand</a></span>

<br>Music is incredibly repetitive to the point where I would mute the game after a while... this is not a good thing, as I am one of those people who appreciates game music to the point of comparing it with film music (yes, even indie game music - Journey and Ori are great examples). Imagine being stuck in a level for twenty minutes - and you will - while having to listen to the same overtly, misplaced emotional string track.... on repeat.....
<br>
<br>The story, if there even is one, is garbage. Heck, even The Unfinished Swan had a better story than this, and that was a total bummer at the end.
<br>
<br>Buy this game, on sale if possible, if only to see the possibilities of what can be done with beautiful graphics and hard(ish) work, from yet another indie developer (Coldwood Interactive). But also for proof of why AAA games are starting to lack creativity with their rehashed, overly-hyped-does-not-deliver formulas, adopting microtransaction schemes on top of base prices, while games like this one and others can wow you for hours (if you enjoy them) for anywhere between $15-$40.
<br>
<br>In short... this game is wonderful visually - looks better than many games out there (even now in 2017) - but everything else needed a lot more work. Feels like an idea that was never actually... uhh... knitted properly, and the seams are too visible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unravel/user-reviews?user_review_id=7633800">Expand</a></span>
