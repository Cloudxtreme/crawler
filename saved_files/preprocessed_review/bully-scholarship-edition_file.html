And so you&apos;ll have to earn the respect from every &quot;gang&quot; one by one thanks to a large variety of tasks, some of them pretty useless (delivery jobs and so) could have been cut out of the game but some of them are also very imaginative and somehow epic. But overall the main story is very fun, thanks to excellent writing and cinematics providing original and memorable characters.
<br>
<br>As most of the Rockstar games, Bully is set in an open world, and even if it&apos;s quite small compared to their other games it offers quite a lot of side activities (mainly collectibles, but also optional tasks, shops, a funfair, etc.) and of course classes you can attend to and pass if you&apos;re successful during the minigames. The game will keep you occupy approximately 30 hours if you want it all (15, if you just wanna do the main story) which is very acceptable for this genre without being outstanding.
<br>
<br>Finally let&apos;s talk about the main issues of the game, all related to its porting to PC, the graphics didn&apos;t improved at all and makes the game look pretty bad for a 2008 release, but most of all the controls aren&apos;t user friendly at all and will take a few hours to master (even then it will not be natural). It&apos;s a shame.
<br>
<br>Despite this I still love the game, mainly for its originality I will cherish my memories of it and welcome with open-arms a sequel (College edition ?) and it&apos;s definitely a good game that will provide good entertainment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5580600">Expand</a></span>

<br>it really is a shame  if this game would have better controlls and tweakable graphics, it would be one of rockstars very best games!
<br>
<br>but the bad port quite ruins it, I&apos;ll have to admit that.
<br>
<br>- controls: clunky and overall bad.
<br>without an original pre-mapped xbox 360 controller, this game is literally UNPLAYABLE  and I don&apos;t mean &quot;too hard to learn&quot;, I mean literally unplayable!
<br>
<br>- graphics: ugly textures that looked bad on consoles and haven&apos;t been changed.
<br>also it looks (and FEELS!) like it is locked at 30 FPS.
<br>
<br>I would say this game were a solid 8 or even a 9, if it weren&apos;t for these two very negative points!
<br>
<br>apart from lousy graphics and a sub-par port, I enjoyed this game a lot.
<br>
<br>lessons are annoying mini-games, which isn&apos;t as bad as it sounds and gym-class is funny all the way.
<br>characters are caricatures all seen millions of times, but these clichees are what made this game so charming for me, I really enjoyed it  kind of like a &quot;Ferris Bueler(?)/Parker Lewis&quot; simulator.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3293883">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game has to be the most underrated games of all time after Just cause 2. The PC version might be a little bit badly ported but the game has that F#CK SCHOOL atmosphere and i just love it! The map is not Extremely big but it still has a lot of things to explore. if your interested in GTA you will love this game. Definitely try this one out.</span>

It has a terrible control scheme and has no graphical upgrade to speak of, hell it even looks worse. The game retains the tongue in cheek story and excellent...well everything but is hampered yet again by poor keyboard &amp; mouse support and awful visuals.</span>

This game is a pretty bad console port with tons of issues that i wont be able to bring up. Most noticeable would be the 30 fps-cap, and the annoying controls. Add to that frequent crashes, unskippable cutscenes, no autosaves and  fixed save points and you get a formula for a bad time. And as it happens i am not entirely  in love with the general gameplay either. The combat is easy, boring and unsatisfying. The stealth missions are just plain horrible. The bikes arent all that fun to use making the getting from point A too point B quite boring. Failure often forces you to replay needless bits and there are some silly reasons for failure in this game that can get a bit annoying. There is also a lot of quite boring missions in this game that centers around the same boring mechanic over and over again which makes the game a bit repetitive. Now the campaign took me around 14 hours to complete and you might wonder why i bothered completing it since i havent done anything else than whine so far. Well the reason is that the game is quite charming. I really like the setting and the story,  characters and character interactions are quite charming. And i found myself getting quite immersed in the game-world from time to time despite all my problems with the game. These times are however too few and too short for me to recommend this game. The most common emotion this game managed to generate from me is pure frustration and that is never a good sign. So i do not recommend this game despite its charm. Its simply too rough around the edges for me to do that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3072598">Expand</a></span>

I better enjoy the writing, stereotypes, and caricatures in Bully more now than when I first played it.</span>

It has an intersiting plot, a decent combat system, the main character is very nice, it has awesome main quests. I realy advise you to try this game, it is one of the most underrated of the Xbox/PS2 generation!</span>

<br>
<br>Anyway, this game is great, and is up there in terms of Rockstar Games&apos; quality. The setting is so creative - it&apos;s not just GTA with a facelift and a young protagonist - you feel like you&apos;re part of the school. Going to class is actually fun (except Shop cos for some reason the game thinks I&apos;m NOT turn LS counter-clockwise....arghh), and while I was truant a lot, it was never a chore to abandon missions to go to class.
<br>
<br>Characters - great, I liked the character of Jimmy, as well as the faction leaders; Johnny and Earnest mainly. Jimmy himself is a dick, but he knows it, and he doesn&apos;t ever act so maturely that his age doesn&apos;t make sense. Gary...well. you don&apos;t really see him much, but he is an interesting douchebag when you do.
<br>The missions were probably the highlight of the game: doing GTA-like things like drive-bys, punchups, and fetch quests with a kid-like twist. Gameplay was always solid, and I liked being able to bust out the skateboard to go somewhere instead of worrying about cars. Most of these missions have parts that are a nod to adults, especially Mr Burton&apos;s and that lunchlady&apos;s missions (people who have played it know what I mean).

<br>Finally, the environment of Bullworth and its surrounding towns was surprisingly rich. I found myself wondering if they scaled down the town because without a car, you wouldn&apos;t travel around it so fast. This is probably why they squeezed in more detail...and when I found myself on a moped, my suspicions were confirmed. Didn&apos;t really feel the urge to explore it outside of missions, though.
<br>
<br>Yeah, so, Bully&apos;s a great game if you want to feel nostalgic over your New England school days, as well as beat up some preppies and nerds, GTA-style. I&apos;d give it 8.5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4210590">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t kno and I don&apos;t care and math class it&apos;s practically useless it just gives you clothes I expected better than that, an graphic textures is a bit low(for the PC) anyways the control may be sometimes a pain because of the combat that lacks depth, and an anoying camera it&apos;s still fun</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=83829">Expand</a></span>

These days you can often find it on sale for a mere 3 or 5 dollars and it really is worth the few bucks, if you are not one of the mainstream ADD shoot and explosion type gamers. Fun, different and at times a bit nostalgic (you play a kid in highschool, after all)- check it out!</span>

To making a game about a high school kid who moves to a school for child delinquents and socially  challenged kids, but in a lot of ways Bully is like a GTA. For example Bully is a giant open world with stuff to collect, bike races to do, arcade games to play, and much more to just kind of find.The mission structure is very similar to GTA, you do a bunch of work for one of the factions;like the jocks or the nerds, and the more the more you do work for one faction it can effect your standing with others. Which in turn can effect the way some of the people treat you at school. The combat is very similar but instead of machine guns and rocket launches. Your playing with slingshots and stink bombs. There are also a lot of things that are different about Bully that really makes it feel like your in high school it feel very structured, but that&apos;s not a bad thing at all. Like you have classes two times a day everyday until you pass the highest level of that class, and of you don&apos;t go the prefects or any adult of authority. All the classes have there own perks like one of the classes shows you where all the collectibles, and unlike the protagonists in GTA jimmy is 15 and needs his sleep so if your out past 2 you just pass out on the spot which can make some night missions feel a little too time restrictive.<br>The story starts you out in a car ride with you and your mom and what seems to be your new stepdad. They then drop you off in the front of Bullyworth academy where you meet the principle and some of the teacher, but the fun starts to come in when you go to your dorm room and meet your new  friend Gary, who is a sociopath, i don&apos;t know how else to put it.You soon start to become manipulated by him, and you two soon go your separate ways and you start to see less and less of him. You then start to do work for the other factions of the school. Playing Bully it kind of puts you back and makes you think about your time in high school, I know the archetypes aren&apos;t as plain and simple as they are in Bully but it does a great job of boiling a lot of the high school experience down to a 20 hour game.<br>Then there are a few technical issues with bully I didn&apos;t really have too many other then the game crash on me a couple of times, and that just sucks after that happened for the first time a started saving much more frequently. I can&apos;t really say definitely how the game will turn out for you, but it didn&apos;t seem to bad. From my experience with it. Over all the game is well made but parts of it just seem kind of repetitive and broken;overall though I think it&apos;s a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2267821">Expand</a></span>

<br>Buy this game, if you have a controller for your PC.</span>

It isn&apos;t on the levels of Dark Souls&apos; port or Resident Evil 4&apos;s port but there are quite a few issues that has made me more focused on them rather than the actual game and it&apos;s content. Here are the problems that rouble the PC port of bully and I&apos;m gonna do something a bit similar to what I did with my Dark Souls review. I will upload a review of the console version of bully on metacritic but here on steam, I&apos;m gonna focus on the pc&apos;s issues. I will put in the metacritic link here when I get it written: For now here are the issues on the PC version:
<br>
<br>PROBLEM 1: Poor mouse and keyboard support. I know that Bully has rebindable keys, but even if u rebind them, the controls will still be a mess. Running around will be awkward and you will find yourself running into walls and run into something when running around a corner. Controls are the worst when you&apos;re on a bike. Bike controls are similar to that of GTA SA&apos;s bike controls but add in the bad controls of the gameplay when you&apos;re on foot but imagine you&apos;re on an ice rink. When you make a turn, your bike will turn and possibly knock into something because the camera&apos;s hard to control and it will also veer into another direction and crash into something else.
<br>
<br>PROBLEM 2: Frame rate dips. Bully&apos;s frame rate ended up dippping into the 10&apos;s and sometimes into the single digits when I was performing certain actions and they did this throughout the whole game and they dipped alot when I wa indoors especially.
<br>
<br>PROBLEM 3: Missing environmental textures. Some textures throughout the environment (especially in the alley areas) are either missing nd have a white bloch in it&apos;s place, have an incorrect colour tint to it or are poorly textured and make it look like the developers snotted on the camera.
<br>
<br>PROBLEM 4: Frame rate locked. The frame rate was locked t 30 fps, a common problem that I&apos;ve seen popping up repeatedly when I talk about bad porting. I have had a few friends say that they were able to get the game to 40 fps, but they needed to go into the game&apos;s files and delete all of the environment&apos;s shadows in it&apos;s file in order for it to get 40 and that still isn&apos;t a much better frame rate. Even after doing this, my friends still said they had repeated dips in frame rate into the single digits, even with the shadows deleted.
<br>
<br>Bully is a very good game on all of the other systems other than the PC. Bully isn&apos;t the worst port in history but it still isn&apos;t a good port.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6502626">Expand</a></span>

It is one of the first, if not the first game where Rockstar implements the XBox360 controller alongside keyboard controls, and it shows when trying to play with the keyboard. But apart from that, is a gaming experience not to be missed. The world doesn&apos;t feel as big and complex as it&apos;s contemporary GTA games (San Andreas), but there&apos;s a lot to do in it, even with the lackluster number of vehicles (a few types of pedal-bikes, a kart and wheelboard). The weapons in other games here became improvised &quot;tools&quot; like marbles, rotten eggs, fire-crackers and spud-guns, and the campus is just part of the game, with a (small) city waiting for Jimmy to evade into.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2216633">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The storyline is mildly entertaining, only look at it from an adolecent perspective, and dont expect any fludity throughout the game&apos;s story, Rather;look at each mission as it&apos;s own seperate story, with a few chaining together.
<br>
<br>Overall its a goofy game with some serious porting issues, but once you hack and type through those issues, Bully:scholarship edition is an okay-game to pass the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2319232">Expand</a></span>

But with this game we had no real performance or stability issues. The key is: Reviewers who played the game on another platform remember the controls, how natural it feels to control the game. But when you see a PC port, everything is different. You have to aim, you have new controls and more. It isn&apos;t bad. Except for some mouse gesture like controls (lockpicking) the controls can feel natural for a PC Gamer. The story, the mood is nice, but sadly something is missing. While you have classes, you don&apos;t have radio. And while it is easy to play music in backgrund, you won&apos;t have talk shows, commercials, etc. and in a GTA like game we just love commercials. We recognize how American companies advertise, we hear a similar add and laugh. This is how we feel the world of GTA as our World. Bully isn&apos;t only smaller, but it isn&apos;t as detailed as most GTA titles, and this feels. It is a more than decent game. The issues aren&apos;t serious. But from Rockstar you would expect a bit more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2415777">Expand</a></span>

Not to much, this game is a hands down classic in every sense of the word, and still will be.
<br>Story:7/10
<br>The reason I&apos;m giving the story a seven, is because there is not to much detail about Jimmy, and why he is going to bullworth, all we have is that he has a mean step dad and he is a trouble maker, we don&apos;t know WHAT he did
<br>
<br>Characters:10/10
<br>Why am i giving this a high rating you ask? Because all the characters are unique in their own way. Lets take Russel for example, he is a thug [Spoilers ahead] who in the end, turns out to be a loving person.
<br>
<br>Missions:9/10
<br>The reason i am giving this a nine is only because of the seasons. I never did like the idea of seasons in video games, but i absolutely HATED the winter season. From the tagging mission to the drunk Santa, the missions are also qwerky and replayabe
<br>
<br>Graphics:10/10
<br>[Nothing to say here]
<br>
<br>Ending:8/10
<br>In the end, you confront the bully Garry, who insults you as you chase him,
<br>Garry has a plan to take over bullworth, while Jimmy thinks other,
<br>Russel helps you, and a expelled student comes back.
<br>Garry gets expelled, and the principle is no longer on jimmy tail about anything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3115133">Expand</a></span>

This game is the most unusual game Rockstar has ever developed in the most hilariously amazing ways! The game consists of five chapters where you try to gain influence in each of the town&apos;s groupies in order for you to gain control of the school. This makes for some HYSTERICAL missions that exaggerate highschool stereotypes. You will do odd jobs for greasers, preps, nerds, jocks and townies. The game world consists of three islands and school campus. While the map is not the most lively open world game we have seen in gaming it offers a lot of fun cruising on a mo-ped or your stylish BMX bike. My favourite part of Bully is definitely the combat and the silly writing. You learn new combos from a hobo near your school by bringing him what he asks. The combat is very similar to that of The Warriors, only smaller in scale and less brutal(you will not be killing anyone).
<br>I could go on for such a long time with reasons why I love Bully&apos;s charm but I will just implore that you play it for yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6871640">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game itself feels like a watered down non violent GTA, but theres still enjoyment to be had even if youre a hardcore GTA player. Playing out all the nasty stuff you dreamed about during school but never had the guts to do, or simply play out the stereotypes from american pop culture school movies is very fun. The plot itself isnt anything special, i didnt felt attached to any of its characters. Open world you play in is fairly small, and if you could jack cars it would feel microscopic compared to even GTA III&apos;s Liberty City. Its also very restrictive on where you can go and not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bully-scholarship-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6788134">Expand</a></span>
