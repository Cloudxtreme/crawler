Things will happen that will shock you especially if you&apos;ve grown attached to this group of survivors. My only real complaint is about really choppy frame-rate at times, but that bug haunts all games of this series.</span>

<br>It seems as if the purpose of this episode is to teach to never to like anything or anyone in a video game. It&apos;s like as if happy things don&apos;t exist in zombie games. Everyone just has to **** die. Emotionally attached to Carley? **** that, let her kiss you on the cheek and hint you at being a love interest AND THEN get shot in the face by Lilly! Yay!
<br>Emotionally attached to Duck after he acts so awesome by being your helper as a detective? Who needs him, infect him and kill him! Woo!
<br>Started to feel compassion for Katjaa? **** that, let her kill herself for no apparent reason (okay, I know, your son died, but you still have your husband goddammit).
<br>Jesus. Dark and gruesome zombie games don&apos;t have these many liked characters die.
<br>And what&apos;s most important is that some of your choices have no impact in the long term.
<br>If you save Carley or Doug, both of them die either way. If you side with Kenny or Lilly, there&apos;s nobody to be friends with by the end of Episode 3.
<br>If you decide to do as much as possible for characters to like you, all that&apos;s gonna happen is they&apos;re gonna die.
<br>That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s a bad game, though. It&apos;s &apos;fun&apos; (when you&apos;re not smashing your table out of frustration or crying until your room is filled with salt water) and aesthetically rich. It has an environment to explore and interesting characters (except for Kenny, **** that guy).
<br>I think I gave the previous episodes a 9 (no 10 for having some parts of the game have terribly ugly textures that would look horrible when zoomed into during cutscenes).
<br>This episode gets a 8.. Remarkable job, TellTale. I like this game, but if your excuse for killing so many characters is &apos;it&apos;s because it&apos;s a zombie game&apos;, I **** hate zombie games from now on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-3---long-road-ahead/user-reviews?user_review_id=2597565">Expand</a></span>

For that alone it deserves an excellent rating.   Regardless of whether this is a movie or a game it&apos;s a damn good one.</span>

And I say that because in this episode they took away your options to choose, and change stuff. I had two totally different play-through and at the end of this episode there were almost no difference between them. No matter what you do, you can&apos;t save Carley/Doug who dies in a stupid and pointless way, nor Katja and Duck. This episode want to break our mind and heart and doing this by ruining the premise of the game, that your choices matters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-3---long-road-ahead/user-reviews?user_review_id=2597551">Expand</a></span>

I loved the style of the games and how they really made you think about what you were about to do or say. Unfortunately, Episode 3 is a mess. You end up finding that many of the choices you made have very little impact on the outcomes - the same major events end up happening whether you tried to stop them or not. Characters interact with you the exact same despite how you treated them. The game starts to feel less interactive, and more like a movie at times. Despite my criticisms, the action sequences are still good and the presentation still excellent, and the overall interaction with other characters is still interesting, if a little confused. Everything just feels less organic than previous episodes, and I hope they can rectify that for the remaining episodes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-3---long-road-ahead/user-reviews?user_review_id=2597978">Expand</a></span>

I think it&apos;s because you are moving from Macon to Savannah, so there isn&apos;t a lot to explore. I don&apos;t really like the way they kill off Doug/Carly. I can see why they did, otherwise they would need to continue writing two scripts. The group is torn apart in this episode and some new faces arise. I would like to see a little more choices and character reactions in the next episodes. It still deserves an 8, where episode one was a 9, and episode two a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-3---long-road-ahead/user-reviews?user_review_id=2609166">Expand</a></span>

Your hard earned progress is likely to be wiped by a faulty save system when you try to resume playing. And guess what? YOU CAN&apos;T SKIP DIALOGUE OR CUTSCENES. Unbearable.

Telltale games has completely dropped the ball on this episode, and every episode after. After an exhilarating and amazing first and second episode, Episode 3 is just a boring, scripted and linear shooting gallery and button-mashing game. Forget about making choices, nothing you do will make a difference. Chose to reveal that you are a convicted killer? Absolutely no consequences or effects. Try to calm whatshername when she goes insane? Absolutely no effect on the outcome. Want to help Kenny by doing the deed yourself? Absolutely no effects or consequences. Nothing you do can change anything that happens in this episode, or the fourth or fifth. There is no decision you have to make that matters, no amazing scenes or events, no added depth to the story, nothing.

The decision to kill half the crew is cheap in my opinion especially Carly, it&apos;s as if they thought it would be too hard to carry on with all the choices and they decided to just get rid of 4 people, plus it gets really depressing now, after Carly&apos;s death I just didn&apos;t really want to play it anymore, II think they should have gave you an option to stop Lily or let her kill someone else instead, oh well I&apos;m not really hyped up for the next episode, will probably play it but I won&apos;t be looking forward to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-3---long-road-ahead/user-reviews?user_review_id=2610610">Expand</a></span>

She made a different choice in pretty much every single decision, and by the middle of chapter 3 we ended up with exactly the same outcome. As it turns out, our choices dont matter at all. So, this is not a graphic adventure, since the puzzles are way too easy (hell, everybody around tells you exactly what you have to do next, even your own character does), and this is not an interactive story either, since even if a few non important conversations play a little different in each playthrough, the major outcome will always be the same. Considering all this game had was the &quot;make your own choices and get your own scenario&quot; thing, chapter 3 feels as lazy as it can get. I give it a 5 because the story is still worth watching, but thats all there is: A story that demands you to click around to unfold. What you choose to click does not matter at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-3---long-road-ahead/user-reviews?user_review_id=2643699">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed this episode as much as the other 4 (I just completed episode 5, the last episode of season 1) and it stands up well on its own.  Another chapter of a brilliantly well done video game.  Recommended.</span>

It&apos;s frustrating to see the main character forced to act other then you would do/seems sane, and it breaks the immersion on the most important moments. The zombies are a joke and unbelievable (extremely slow and stupid, very easy to distract), but then again, most zombies are.</span>

<br>I have a low re-play score on this game because when you re-play the game (which there is a strong desire to re-play this game to try other choices) the new different choices you make either 1) don&apos;t make much difference and/or 2) the way the main character and other characters act/re-act for non-mainstream choices is highly unrealistic. I really loved this game and would of given it a 9 for my over-all score, but the re-play that I was anxious to try was a real dud and took away from my original experience; thus giving the game an over-all score of 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-3---long-road-ahead/user-reviews?user_review_id=3948959">Expand</a></span>
