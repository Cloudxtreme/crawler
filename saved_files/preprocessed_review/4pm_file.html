But, I like &quot;artistic&quot; games; I&apos;ve enjoyed such works as 9.03m so I decided to try it. My total play time, from beginning to end, was a half hour. Plot aside (there is one, but it&apos;s not very well fleshed out), the execution of this game fails on every level. Optimization is poor, response is sluggish, interactive items only work when it&apos;s time in the &quot;story&quot; for them to work, character models look at least ten years old, voice acting is mediocre, and even the subtitles are poor (for example, &quot;lose&quot; is misspelled as &quot;loose&quot;...twice). One &quot;stealth&quot; section of the game is laughably (and worse, frustratingly) bad, and all of these things get in the way of what should have been an interesting and meaningful experience about alcoholism and depression.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s hard to believe this is a 2014 release. &quot;4PM is a high production value, cinematic experience aimed at people interested in interactive story-telling,&quot; the game&apos;s press release reads. Yes, all those things would be true --if it were 2004. It&apos;s not, and this game is far too many years too late to be worth the effort of muddling through it. What a shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/4pm/user-reviews?user_review_id=4950730">Expand</a></span>
