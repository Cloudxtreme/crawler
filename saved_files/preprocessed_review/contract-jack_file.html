Bad guys just run at you shooting wildly. Some points become literal duck shoots. bad guy runs across walkway, you shoot, repeat. A lesson in shooting into crowds. Horribly disappointing game.</span>

No cool gadgets like NOLF (although, they have left a couple of the horrendously difficult to control vehicles in... oh great... yay...) No real variety in the missions.

I&apos;m totally at a loss as to what they were trying to achieve with this bilge, other than cashing in on a well respected franchise.
