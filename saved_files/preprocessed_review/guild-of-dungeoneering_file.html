<br>The game has a certain charm you can hardly deny - and the general battle mechanics are well-thought. But the game lacks just a little bit in regards to long-term motivation and replayability.
<br>
<br>It really bothers me for example that i can not re-do already done dungeons. The worst thing: At the time i finished the game there were still three class building unbuilt - means i couldn&apos;t play three classes. But since you can&apos;t re-do done dungeons i would need to grind all the early parts of the game again to test the classes i couldn&apos;t test last time. Of course i expect add-ons - especially because the game hardly took 20 hours to complete - but that doesn&apos;t really make up for it.
<br>
<br>The game feels a little bit content-starved. The basics are there: For example that some dungeons are a lot easier with certain heroes and item-build-pathes. But to make this one a really good game there needs to be tons of additional content, like a slight character advancement and generally bigger pools of items.
<br>
<br>After about 10 hours of playing you sadly know every item in the game. And if you realize what is really strong, you won&apos;t really use other items any more. So every dungeon gets to be repetitive - slaying weaker monsters until you have your items, then go and kill the boss.
<br>
<br>I think this game has the potential to go up to 7, 8 or 9 points - but in its release version, i sadly can&apos;t give more than 5 points, although i certainly hope it will see lots of improvement with the upcoming add-ons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-of-dungeoneering/user-reviews?user_review_id=5401075">Expand</a></span>

<br>So, without all above mentioned, what&apos;s the fun in this game? To me it&apos;s more like a board game with simple but innovative rules, you build your routes in dungeons and choose wisely for your loots depending on the monsters you fight or the heroes you pick, because you obtain combat skills based on the traits of these loots (aggressive/defensive, magic/physical) which you have to rely on for completing the dungeon run.
<br>There are a lot of fun trying to build combo or counter the monsters you fight, it&apos;s highly dependent on luck but with no progressive character build you can just laugh away a bad luck and start a new run immediately. It&apos;s not roguelike, it&apos;s simple and light.
<br>The art style is charming, the music and ballads are amazing, and every dungeon run is challenging, fun, and with no stress on your shoulders.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-of-dungeoneering/user-reviews?user_review_id=5398488">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Conclusion:I thought there is more stretegy involved, instead there is shallow gameplay with cute things on the surface.The cute things will be not so cute after youve seen them for the 20th time.Thats not enough to receommend this game.There are many good games out there on sale, theyll give you more game for your dollar/euro.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-of-dungeoneering/user-reviews?user_review_id=5380480">Expand</a></span>

The major thing that got me down was that the character level resets after every dungeon. Not my thing unless the gameplay was just so fantastic to make up for lack of true progression in anything other than the storyline, but the gameplay is slow and boring. Really the only gameplay here is picking a card to place on the map and then clicking an ability card. There&apos;s really not much thinking or strategy involved. The game also plays very slow because of the animations that happen with every card shuffle for every turn. I feel like I could play the game 4 times faster than it lets me play and it&apos;s aggravating.
<br>i guess if you really love roguelikes, go for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-of-dungeoneering/user-reviews?user_review_id=5380015">Expand</a></span>

Really silly design there.
<br>
<br>I do not recommend the game unless you like childish crap like that. It was advertised as a dungeon game not a lesson in puzzle solving. It should be under the category of puzzles on Steam as that is what it turned out to be and not a role playing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-of-dungeoneering/user-reviews?user_review_id=5651120">Expand</a></span>

<br>What</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">My rating for this is going to be a rather harsh ZERO because that&apos;s about how much enjoyment I got out of it. Okay, I won&apos;t lie, I did enjoy the game for a few minutes. But there is no actual character progression or incentive to do quests other than upgrading your hideout by adding a bunch of poorly drawn square tiles onto the sides that will spawn more types of adventurers.
<br>
<br>What really irked me about this game is after I spent the max amount of time in a dungeon killing every enemy I could and leveling up my adventurer, he lost all his levels and extra cards that I had acquired for him, starting over at level 1 at the beginning of the next dungeon. What&apos;s the point of leveling up if their level resets every dungeon and they lose all their cards?
<br>
<br>If this game would have had more persistent characters that kept their levels after completing dungeons I feel it would have went a lot farther. The dialogue and music aren&apos;t bad, there are plenty of cheesy puns. The game play is shallow though, without real character progression and an infinite number of stand-ins lined up for when one of your adventurers dies. Death has no meaning, there are no real spoils of victory, and your characters won&apos;t get any stronger. It misses the mark completely when it comes to being a tabletop RPG simulator.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-of-dungeoneering/user-reviews?user_review_id=5658478">Expand</a></span>

However, I quickly realized that this game is unforgiving with its rising difficulty.  There are only a handful of stages that your initial and Tier 1 classes can complete before you get stuck having to grind 500 gold for Tier 2 classes.  When your worst case scenario on a stage is 2 gold and your best is in the 30 range, this quickly turns this game from fun to aggravating.
<br>
<br>As there is no stage replaying in the game, once  you are done, you are done and there is no reason to pick the game back up again.  Best to skip the game in the first place and pick up something that will last longer in the long run.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-of-dungeoneering/user-reviews?user_review_id=5403859">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Perhaps this is because I&apos;m playing with two expansion packs, a couple of years after release (patches, etc.).
<br>
<br>I&apos;d recommend this to people who enjoy/enjoyed Darkest Dungeon, Monster Slayers, Dungeon of the Endless, Hand of Fate and Spectromancer.
<br>
<br>...or just enjoys turn-based, fantasy-themed and/or card-based strategy games.</span>
