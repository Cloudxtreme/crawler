<br>
<br>There is not much to say about the graphics and the sound, they are not extraordinaire but they do their job.
<br>
<br>The part that isn&apos;t fun is the lack of loot and choice in weaponry, for a roguelike and such a broad universe there is very little in the sense of loot  currency, 5 common items and about 10 equipment items  some secret ones  I only found one) and no character progression what-so-ever. And in the end you will find that only a few items, which are clearly more beneficial, make sense taking along.

<br>This game requires more content for it to feel complete, it&apos;s nice ...but it had more potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eldritch/user-reviews?user_review_id=3663093">Expand</a></span>

<br>Eldritch is the debut game from Minor Key Studios, made possible by Steam Greenlight.
<br>
<br>What seems like another innocuous ride on the, &#x201C;retro-but-stylized,&#x201D; gravy train becomes an immersive adventure through randomized dungeons based on the lore of H.P Lovecraft&apos;s Cthulu novels.
<br>
<br>Trading leveling up and skill points for items and action, as you delve deeper and deeper into the various dungeons of the game, you find ways to increase your overall health and buy items from a fishy (literally) shopkeeper who keeps stocked with the best convenient gear for a soon-to-be corpse.
<br>
<br>It allows for both mouse/keyboard or a controller, and plays well with both. Controlling your character feels intuitive, and I found myself doing borderline parkour. Holding jump button allows one to grab on to a ledge and pull yourself up, and while sprinting, pressing the crouch button allows you to do a slide. It may sound like a small feature, but it adds a very nice flavor to the environment. I&apos;m not just a random character  I actually feel like an adventurer.
<br>
<br>The game has a well implemented sneaking feature which allows players one of two options  run and gun your way through dungeons while dodging mage fireballs and leaping monstrous insects, or taking it slow, sneaking around each corner, using the peek feature (which allows players to peek around the corner to see what&apos;s ahead without compromising their position to enemies) to carefully plot out their path through the scary depths of a very special Lovecraftian vision of hell.
<br>
<br>Looting corpses can be exciting, as your ammo, keys, and other resources are limited. &#x201C;Artifacts,&#x201D; found in the game serve as both your currency and magic points. Praying to a Elder God statue nets you a fancy new magical power, ranging from teleports, the ability to spawn blocks Minecraft style to let you reach new heights or block enemy paths, cloaking for stealth nuts, and many more. Spam your magic too much, and you&apos;re left gearless. Buy too much gear, and you put yourself in a sticky situation when that one spell would have saved your hide.
<br>
<br>The sound, though repetitive after a while, serves as a terrifying reminder than anything can be around any corner, keeping you on your toes. The far-away moans, footsteps and crawling sounds make you think twice about blazing through each floor.
<br>
<br>The roguelike elements of the game add a nice twist, allowing your character to store Artifacts each time you revisit the mysterious Library (where you spawn) and all items are lost upon death. Each time you play, the floors are randomly generated and populated with enemies and random item spawns. Opening locked doors can be risky business  sometimes you find a treasure trove, sometimes nothing.
<br>
<br>The game is a wonderful package, overall. However...
<br>
<br>The sound, though lending itself to the creepy world around you, does get repetitive. Problem being, you need the sound to know when and where threats lie.
<br>
<br>The randomly generated dungeons are an amazing touch and really take this game over the top, but I found myself slogging through a random, but eerily similar dungeon as the one before, especially when descending deeper.
<br>
<br>Enemies also seem very few and far between. Killing an enemy gives it a chance to spawn somewhere else in the dungeon  you never completely clear out a floor, which makes re-exploration dangerous. Sometimes I found myself running into six or seven enemies on a floor, and sometimes none.
<br>
<br>That said, Eldritch brings something new to the table. A 3D roguelike, with fun, stylized graphics, random dungeons, and, at times, rewarding difficulty.
<br>
<br>This makes an incredible edition to any Steam Library, and I suggest picking it up pre-Steam sale. Yes, it&apos;s that good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eldritch/user-reviews?user_review_id=3659423">Expand</a></span>

In fact there&apos;s not much to say about it. You&apos;re dropped in to a very strange library and after you read a magic book you&apos;re in a very strange dungeon. I get the game was trying to be unique, and it certainly is, but it&apos;s almost over done to the point where you won&apos;t compliment the game but rather scream what the  And after a while it becomes clear that&apos;s what the game wants you to say, it wants you to be confused and a little unnerved. The next thing you&apos;ll probably notice is that all the story is in text form. So you&apos;d figure with a game that to me has no story the gameplay must be the focus and Eldritch plays a bit like Dishonored&apos;s younger stupider brother. Fighting enemies by just running in and killing them isn&apos;t fun or satisfying, so I tried stealth but that&apos;s not very fun either. The most fun you can have is just running past enemies and seeing how fast you can get through the dungeon. And one thing I really enjoyed about the dungeons was that they were randomly generated but sometimes with out dynamite you can&apos;t even progress because they can randomly generate to be a big circle. Another giant flaw is the horrible inventory system. For whatever reason you can only carry one object that&apos;s the same shape as another, you can&apos;t hold two objects that are a circle i.e you can&apos;t hold your essential compass with you essential soul thing. Also they give the option to store your artifacts which acts as currency if you go through a dungeon and return, but that&apos;s all you can put back. You can&apos;t fill youur giant chest with weapons, keys, or ammunition and if you die you lose all of that which made for painful restarts. If I gave it props for one thing besides the unique style and admittedly fun exploring, it&apos;s the powers you get while playing at statues, jumping higher, hypnotizing enemies and creating magic barriers, these powers enhanced and changed up gameplay. But with no immediate indication of what power I get if I pray and no option to stop if I pray I can go from a good power to a bad one in half a second.  All in all, the game suffers from trying to hard to be unique and forgetting they have to make a fun game, if there&apos;s a sequel I&apos;ll pick it up but I&apos;ll gladly put this down to play with it&apos;s big brother Dishonored.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eldritch/user-reviews?user_review_id=3678356">Expand</a></span>

The soul for the first world opens another book/world. Thr game is mistly easy but there is a HUGE difficulty spike in the second level. The game is very low on content, and i wish to see more, but until now, Eldritch is enough yo satisfy my indie rougelike needs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eldritch/user-reviews?user_review_id=3798314">Expand</a></span>

<br>I love Lovecraft, and while I think Minecraft is somewhat overrated, I have enjoyed that as well...so for me, this game was right up my alley. It was also relatively cheap compared to Minecraft, and while some MC mods might offer a similar narrative, Eldritch focuses on it entirely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eldritch/user-reviews?user_review_id=3877215">Expand</a></span>

Whilst the graphics are deliberately basic in a Mine-craft type way, the lighting is very nice and the game is polished. The game starts off in a library which is fixed, most of the levels are randomly generated and regenerate if you die, but you still have banked money and unlocks when you re-spawn back at the library, I managed to only die a couple of times, you can cheat by backing up the files. There are tactics for dealing with the harder enemies.
<br>
<br>Having said that, I would have liked to see a bit more rpg to it and a bit more story, it is a short game. Only buy it on sale, the full price is not reasonable. Available at steam and humble bundle stores.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eldritch/user-reviews?user_review_id=4828945">Expand</a></span>
