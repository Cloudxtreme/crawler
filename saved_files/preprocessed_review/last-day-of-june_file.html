<br>A Beautiful Story
<br>Last Day of June is a narrative focused adventure game where you play as multiple charcters in a town on the same day
<br>After spending the day on the lake with your wife
<br>on  your way home a child who goes to retrieve his ball from the road causes you to swerve and crash
<br>This puts you in a wheelchair and your wife is now dead.
<br>So you go through paintings to go back in time to stop this
<br>first playing as the boy&#x2026;
<br>The goal of the game is to know the outcome and trigger events to stop it from happening
<br>so youll be running around the world trying to stop this boy from going into the road for example at first..
<br>But preventing this will cause another problem for you to go back and fix.. causing a bit of a butterfly effect so youll be playing as 4 characters in this town on the same day trying to make sure everyones day goes perfect, that nothing could possibly go wrong so that you can get your wife home safe&#x2026;
<br>The game in turn is one giant puzzle, it will have you unlocking paths with characters to have to fail on purpose to only go back in time as the other characters you&#x2019;ve already played as to now have a different fate so that other characters can use items that they needed
<br>until finally you have the perfect balance of outcomes..
<br>it&#x2019;s a really enjoyable game of problem solving with a beautiful story of a man willing to do whatever it takes to save his wife
<br>The gameplay isn&#x2019;t ground breaking, and frustratingly you cant skip scenes you&#x2019;ve already scene&#x2026;
<br>When you do go back to play as characters thankfully the game will start where you need to be to make a different choice and not force you to play through that characters entire day again&#x2026;
<br>but you have to watch how their day plays out over and over even if you know youre messing things up on purpose for the time being just to free an item for someone else
<br>This is really my only complaint with the entire game&#x2026;
<br>The rest of it I loved
<br>the story is told through mumbles,
<br>but will still touch your heart
<br>I give Last Day of June
<br>a 7.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/last-day-of-june/user-reviews?user_review_id=7488626">Expand</a></span>
