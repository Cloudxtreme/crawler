The first Dead Space introduced a limited number of well-designed encounters, with a few weapons to balance your progression. DS2 is a tougher game, but is also more modular, with greater variance in player agency in the campaign. Some of the most visceral reactions I had to this game were simply the empowerment one feels after upgrading a weapon (For me, the Javelin gun was hands-down the most powerful with the alt-fire) and feeling untouchable........I do have to bring up the misguided attempt at quick-time sequences/scripted sequences. At times, the game reminds me of Contra or Gradius, with rote memorization rearing its ugly head. This is one of my least favorite trends in narrative gaming at the moment...so, please Visceral, CEASE AND DESIST with any all encounters (Everyone who has played knows of the few I speak of) that are essentially a shooting gallery. Trust your sound design. Trust that we are unnerved by the anticipation of a fair fight by the fantastic lighting and signature noises emitted. (The raptors are a great example of a fair but still challenging/thrilling fight) And trust how unfun it is learn a certain monster closet and perfect it until the choreography is correct.......Games are not formulas, they are a combination of ingredients to be cooked with. Here&apos;s hoping Dead Space 3 is even more delicious.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2145769">Expand</a></span>

But Dead Space 2 can take you from awe to terror in just a few seconds. The necromorphs are grotesquely designed, and the action is perfectly choreographed. Sure, there are plenty of jump out of the closet scares, but I would NOT call this a survival horror game, simply because you&apos;re a walking gun cabinet. Necromorphs end up falling apart after a few credits are spent on upgrades. But for the most part, watching your enemies being torn to shreds compensates for those false claims. The hardest thing for me is to identify any faults. If I had to complain about anything, it would be the multiplayer. Although it looks good on paper, I found it to be very dry and uninteresting, as if Visceral missed a few key elements in designing it. All in all, the singleplayer alone is still worth the $60 I paid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1820443">Expand</a></span>

They did a great job with this game! The environments are awesome.  The story is predictable but very good. The voice acting and sound effects are excellent.  The mechanics worked great (i.e. the mouse without issue - hurray).  I really like that the movement of the main character is dampened - that way you cannot just run and gun.  You actually have to think, be careful, and it provides for the unpredictability or fear factor.  There where even times when a scene was going on I thought I was supposed to watch and ended up dying (ironic).  Overall I think Dead Space is one of the most enjoyable and fun franchises out there!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1951487">Expand</a></span>

The real unique aspect of the game is just how I felt that each enemy encounter genuinely felt like it was a fight for dear life. I never had the feeling of feeling over powerful, you will get into a ton of dirty knuckle situations. Easily one of my favorite games of 2011. So why not a 10/10, as I said earlier you will be left with wanting more.

The action feels great and there the combat feels good. The enemies are varied enough and there is enough weapons so that you wont get bored. The Sci-fi setting feels great and i really liked the environments not to mention the space sections that i really enjoyed. The story and the character interactions are good enough even though i personally wasn&apos;t a big fan of the story. Overall the game feels like a nicely put together shooter without any really serious flaws. The quicktime events are awful though. And i found myself getting a little bit bored of the combat in the later parts of the game since it gets a bit repetitive.  I should also mention that i rarely got frightened in the game despite being a bit of a coward so don&apos;t go into this game expecting anything like scary. This game is simply put a really well put together third person shooter that hold a high standard all the way through but never really blows you away. The games length should be a bit under 10 hours depending of what difficulty you chose.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3049290">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m anxiously awaiting dead space 3, probably the only thing I&apos;ll ask for my birthday next year.  Controls improved over previous dead space.  excellent pacing.  I thought a few times, oh **** if something jumps out now I&apos;m going to have a heart attack ... lol awesome.</span>

First off, I&apos;ll go over what it think they improved about the game.  One of the major things that they changed/modified was Isaac himself, I remember before the first game came out, the developers said that Isaac was an engineer but it did not seem like they followed through with it, he picked up weapons and started killing, it did not seem he was much of an engineer as the developers claimed, instead it seemed he was a guy just trying to survive. In Dead space 2 Isaac feels more like engineer, his first few weapons he builds himself, he now opens computer panels and hacks them to open up sealed doors. I found these addition a nice improvement to the characters background as an engineer. Giving Isaac a voice this time around, I am kind of divided on that choice, sometimes it helps the game other times it seems it was better when he did not talk. There is now more creatures and weapon variety which is a very nice improvement over the first. There is now more Zero G sections and with the addition of boosters on Isaacs suit(s) it makes them more enjoyable. At some point though I miss were a monster would be coming at you and you would quickly jump to the adjacent wall to get away from it then turn and shoot it as it came at you in Zero G. In addition, Monster pop up sections are not as obvious as the last game.  There are still vents where the monster will break out of but not as many are obvious as the first, so I feel that was a great improvement and keeping you on edge.
<br>Now comes the downsides of the game, first I would have to agree about Nicole aka Isaac&apos;s dead girlfriend tormenting him it ,gets old pretty fast. I wish there was more boss variety but the bosses that are there will do but still wish there was more. The biggest let down to me was the end boss, in the first game when it appeared my first thoughts were &quot;You got to be kidding me, how am i supposed to kill that thing, RUN Isaac, That thing will kill you no sweat&quot;. In the second dead space you fight the boss and go &quot;thats the boss? that&apos;s kind of dumb, there has to be another boss after this?&quot; which there is not which in turn is a pretty big disappointment if you played the first dead space. The baby monsters get really annoy as well. I bought this game for the story/single player so i have not touched the multiplayer yet because from what I have heard its unbalanced and I felt that when they announced they would have MP the game did not feel like it needed it but thats just my opinion. All in all this game is a great game even with its shortcomings. If you enjoyed the first Dead space I would recommend picking up Dead space 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1477162">Expand</a></span>

Dead Space 2 single player keeps you entertained long enough for you to play through it&apos;s 10 hour campaign. There&apos;s also a multiplayer mode which heavily reminds me of left 4 dead, which is a good distraction but nothing ground breaking. While Dead Space 2  doesn&apos;t have too impressive graphics, it&apos;s audio design is still fantastic.

Firstly the levels and environments are more varied and more interesting. Some places look really nice, unique, and atmospheric, and aren&apos;t just grey and dark like most places in the first game. Secondly we have more weapons, like the awesome Javelin Gun. Having more weapons gives more diversity in gameplay and playstyle options. Thirdly the control of the character feels a bit easier than in the first game. It&apos;s easier to run, shoot, and generally manoeuvre around. Fourthly, the game feels more engaging. We have more unique situations and different things happening, like when having to quickly get away from a powerful creature, or I can certainly never forget the fantastic train scene fairly early on in the game, or even the smaller things, such as interacting with creatures or having to quickly shut off a breach and stop everything being sucked into space. Fifthly, I found Dead Space 2 somewhat more intense and scarier than the first game. Sure, it&apos;s still not exactly deathly scary or anything, but a few moments are definitely bound to make you jump or feel cautious to carry on. I liked the customization of different armor suits as well. They actually all have different bonuses rather than simply being upgrades from the previous one, like in the first game. All in all I generally felt that Dead Space 2 was a step in the right direction for the series. Some parts still do need an improvement, like the puzzles are still nothing special, just as with the first game, but in every other regard DS2 did better. Even the story was somewhat more interesting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2515622">Expand</a></span>

In this case for instance, it can remind you of how much more compelling a relatively sleeper hit like the first Dead Space actually was.  It featured a unique, though not particularly original, eerie spaceship to explore, an excellent lighting engine and some pretty good monster designs, as well as a whole host of &quot;mining&quot; tools you could use to defend yourself from the ghastly things on board the Ishimura.  A lot of it seemed practical, barring the &quot;kinesis&quot; and &quot;stasis&quot; modules.  A lot of the weaponry seemed practical for a ship in space harvesting whole planets for rare metals and materials.  However, the chief focus of the original was what exactly?  It wasn&apos;t really scary, it wasn&apos;t really well written, featuring some pretty poor dialogue from all parties involved throughout the story line it would seem and aside from borrowed mechanics from other similar games, Dead Space didn&apos;t have a whole lot it could call its own.  It did have three things though, a story that didn&apos;t usually get in the way of very solid, satisfying gameplay, and a very good atmosphere accompanied by probably some of the best sound design in a science fiction horror game.  I really enjoyed the first game for primarily these reasons, but this is where the sequel slips up.  First off, the story is repugnant, its not interesting, its not fleshed out, I have no reason to care about Isaac anymore now than I did before, the characters are dull, the level design is much worse than the first games, and the sound design just doesn&apos;t have the charm of its predecessor.  Their is so much wrong with playing through the first twenty minutes of the game that I suddenly  remembered why I nearly quit playing on multiple occasions.  First off, our protagonist talks now, no explanation for it really.  He just talks now and unfortunately, he&apos;s had some pretty bad and utterly bizarre dialogue written for him as well.  Secondly, Ashley is now a psychotic ghost that can physically manifest itself to give Isaac empty threats, reminders of the &quot;past&quot; events, and to generally annoy him by causing infuriating quick time events and pausing the entire pacing of the game just to tell the player something to remind Isaac how bad he should feel for some reason.  I have a hard time understanding why, who, and for what reason this was placed into the game.  Seems to me theirs already plenty of conflict with rampaging aliens murdering everything in site, why on earth did the main character need to have this internal conflict with his very dead girlfriend?  Oh wait, that&apos;s right, because &quot;the marker.&quot;  The marker is boring guys, it was left vague and unexplained in the first game for a reason.  All of sudden all these games are about some totally ambiguous and uninteresting alien artifact that humans have reversed engineered somehow.  Who even cares?  I can&apos;t think of one reason why this had to be in the plot.  Could&apos;ve just been your standard fair, &quot;Everything is screwed up and we have to get out of here,&quot; plots, but I guess they&apos;ve done that one already.  Thirdly, love interest.  I get it, Isaac has to have some woman involved with him on every nightmarish space engineering adventure he goes on.  However, this ones pretty unnecessary and silly.  The first game accomplished a sense of isolation that permeated throughout your play through.  Sure Hammond and the &quot;traitorous wench&quot; were on board the Ishimura too, but you were always in different parts of the ship.  No one in Dead Space 1 meets face to face aside from two or three occasions.  This kinda added to the atmosphere.  Everyone else was gone, it was literally just the three of you alive on the ship.  In Dead Space 2, they attempt to do this with the involvement of someone who is obviously very crazy and a female interest named Ellie.  Theirs a fourth character involved, but is essentially only there to cause conflict for Isaac and his group.  The real problem is, every time I&apos;ve played through this game, I can&apos;t even really remember a single portion I enjoyed, it all just sort of blends together with really the only highlight being a brief section when you&apos;re back on board the Ishimura.  The cut scenes are numerous and kill the flow of the game, the Ashley subplot should&apos;ve been axed by someone in the writing department before they threw it haphazardly into the game and Isaac should never have been given a voice.  What little plot their even is, it doesn&apos;t feel like you&apos;re motivated by much of anything.  So much so that after the first hour it starts to feel like a slog from &quot;A-corridor to B corridor.&quot;  Their was a lot of potential here to make a longer, more atmospheric and more interesting game, but they took too many elements they &quot;thought&quot; people liked from the first one and focused on them and them only.  Dead Space 2 remains a solid, but ultimately very disappointing sequel at the end of the day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6765607">Expand</a></span>

The story in the first Dead Space was good, but Dead Space 2&apos;s story is much more emotional and stronger, plus you finally get to hear Isaac SPEAK!!! And if you haven&apos;t played the first (which I suggest you do) you would not know how cool it is to finally hear him speak. And i must say he is sometimes quite humorous, but this doesn&apos;t ruin the gruesome and horrorific mood of the story, so rest asure that it will still will be creepy and scary, so you will stay on toes on every step you take in the game. Another thing that improved is the Necromorphs (the monsters) which is bad news for the players. There are 7 new Necromorphs in the game that will have running for your mommy. And for players new to the game, he is alittle advice for your first fight with a Necromorph, aim for the limbs. And if you run out of your precious ammo, the start using objects in the enviroment using telekensis. And if all else fails start swinging and stomping. Conserving ammo is a big deal in this game if you wish to survive the hordes of Necromorphs and escape, unless you have alot of credits (in-game money) to buy ammo. Overall this game is a great game, and should not be missed out by &quot;survival / Horror&quot; genera gamers and Dead Space fans. This game will have clenching your controller and sitting on the edge of your seat through the whole game.    P.S. - It may be easier to use a Xbox 360 controller, than a mouse and keyboard for this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1699570">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>the interiors of the space station are insanely detailed and well constructed, the glass window views to space are breathtaking and combined with the super creepy sound effects you&apos;ll find yourself 100% in a space sci-fi universe in no time. the game play is constantly kept interesting by offering different game elements (3rd person shooter, puzzle solving, interactive cut scenes,...) and it tells a really great story (which is usually displayed in HUD / holographic video displays in front of the character - no in-game menus that kill the atmosphere!)
<br>
<br>the balancing is great, it always felt &quot;hard enough&quot; and never got boring or repetitive, which is kind of a hard thing to accomplish in these kind of games. the endgame was pretty hard, which perfectly fitted the story (hero struggling to survive), and - no spoilers - the final moments are quite a masterpiece of story-telling.

The controls were fixed and better than before, the game had way more weapons and customization abilities than the previous game had. The new multiplayer aspect in the game delivers, but it just seems a tad unbalanced at times.<br>I don&apos;t think you can protect yourself against the baby aliens in multiplayer that round around you endlessly while slapping you with their hands until you die. It&apos;s just horrible that EA didn&apos;t fix that yet, since players have no way to defend themselves against that.<br>As before, the story is great, and doesn&apos;t disappoint. The ending was also pretty funny (if you&apos;ve played DS1, that is, or else you won&apos;t understand the subtle joke).<br>It was also very nostalgic to visit the Ishimura for one more time. The areas where you get memories also got me as I said **** when the monster from DS1 grabs you and pummels you to the floor, and then you find out it was just a hallucination, a memory.<br>Get this game if you&apos;re a fan of FPS and TPS games. If you want it more for the story, I would say you should wait for a sale so the game gets cheaper, because it might disappoint you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1727392">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Dead Space 2 is a really good game, but doesn&apos;t outdo the first game. All the gameplay has been refined and freshened up, such as a new locator system, and a better interface. Dead Space 2 is not as scary as the first game, but has more action, more story, new weapons and even a multiplayer mode. This game is great, so fans like me will have a good time with this.</span>

I&apos;ve played almost every FPS/RPG game out there that have been released in the past 5 years. Most of them were like &quot;Meh...&quot; When i finished them. But when i got my copy of Dead Space 2, I was pretty sure it will be good as the previous game - Dead Space 1... I was wrong. It was a whole new experience! lets take a closer look at what we got in this title: GAMEPLAY: The gameplay in Dead Space 2 is much smoother than the previous Dead Space 1 game. Weapons variety and Upgrades improved a lot, and the game is much more PC friendly than Dead Space 1. You will experience  lots of &quot;heart attack&quot; due to psychedelic scenarios as you proceed with the game. The game is never boring, You will always try to guess the next ambush from the infected which are not &quot;stupid&quot;  and slow-moving like zombies, most of them, will sprint towards you like you awe them money! SOUND: Probably one of the best PROS in this game. As you play, you always hear &quot;something. somewhere&quot;, it can be quiet for couple moments and then all of the sudden roaring monster behind you. you will need to be alert all the time! GRAPHICS: This is a main CON of this game. Although GODFATHER Engine is improved, Dead Space 2 displays a decent graphic with but with lots of details though. vomit, monster-puke, and monster-body--part-tearing will be a common thing. Unlike many Zombie/Infected games, shooting the head NOT always helps. CONCLUSION: One of my top 5 of all times. A total king in his genre. You. Will. Be. Scared. I Promise you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2221316">Expand</a></span>

As a gamer I am immediately skeptical of any single player game- the AI are always lacking and replay is typically low. I gave Dead Space a chance and I fell in love with it immediately after earning the plasma cutter. This game reminds me a lot of titles from Valve - plot is readily available but most fulfilling to users who explore the game and collect and read items. The backstory is great, this series has a great horror plot that is easy to embrace and understand, while at the same time approaching horror with an equal sci-fi element.<br>Gameplay is fantastic. One of my biggest criticisms is how the weapons are not balanced - some weapons are meaningful the entire game and others are underpowered and never see a chance to shine. Graphics are great- lighting and shaders have been excellent on my PC (I do have a good PC). Audio is excellent, theres a lot of ambient sounds, zombie effects are diverse, and I love how the weapon effects scale up with how you upgrade them.<br>Comparing PC to 360... the controls on PC (mouse + keyboard) are a bit hard to get used to. I personally use the 360 controller on my PC and it plays wonderfully. Graphics on the PC are superior, and overall I enjoy it more. There is a bug with full screen graphics, but I was able to work around this by playing in windowed mode with my gameplay resolution maxed. I give this game a 10/10. The replay is great, the overall presentation is excellent. Multiplayer is actually worthwhile, (unusual for a single player game) and I just love this game. Personal opinions aside, this game could potentially receive a 9/10 from me but I love sci-fi and this game truly captures the spirit of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2278071">Expand</a></span>

I recommend always playing this series in the dark with headphones or a loud stereo if you can.  Nothing revolutionary in this installment but there are some fun variations, some new annoying enemies and a compelling story polished off with a little more humanizing of Isaac.  Admittedly there can be some tedium at times but I think it may be a result of what can be a stressful gaming experience and a sign that it&apos;s time to take a break.  Absolutely worth playing if you have limited gaming time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2861274">Expand</a></span>

The game feels slightly less survival horror like as there is a greater focus on combat and set pieces, however playing on higher difficulty&apos;s, ammo is still scarce and there are plenty of scary moments. The game overall feels a little less clunky and controls better and there&apos;s alot more variety in the creepy locations you visit. The game is a little shorter than the original but I had more fun with dead space 2 and it certainly has more Holy s*** moments. There is also t=some solid multiplayer that&apos;s nothing too special but fits in nicely with the game and dead space universe. Overall a fantastic game, probably my favorite horror game ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2935654">Expand</a></span>

As the developers stated in an interview, the first game was deemed &quot;too scary&quot; for mainstream audience, and they considered that the reason behind the mediocre sales of the masterpiece that is Dead Space 1. In other words, Dead Space 1 was too good to be successful.<br><br>Now, what made me love DS1 was exactly that, as a seasoned horror fan, it&apos;s very hard to find something to gave me real shivers, be it in movies or games. And DS1 delivered, as no movie or game in recent memory could do - maybe with the exception of Silent Hill 2.<br><br>Yes, there were recycled levels, and yes, they ripped off lots of stuff from other games. But, as Picasso reportedly said, the mediocre artist copies, the great artist steals. Critics called DS1 &quot;unoriginal&quot;, but that&apos;s missing the point completely. It was worthy not because the script, storytelling or game mechanics (despite dismemberment being original). It was worthy for achieving a overwhelmingly macabre feel that no one on cinema, lest gaming industry, today manage to achieve. Dead Space 2 is just not scary. I played it on the level above normal, got killed a lot of times. Still, I couldn&apos;t feel that impressing sensation of imminent danger that made DS1 into the game I loved. Some critics talked about the jump from Alien to Aliens, Ridley Scott to David Big Cheese Cameron. So, it&apos;s like having your favorite cult movie being re-shot in a generic commercial way by a Hollywood studio - or, more specifically, a Hollywood studio accidentally releasing a masterpiece and &quot;correcting&quot; it later.<br><br>Now, DS2 has its merits as a game. Combat is still very satisfying, the script is a lot less generic, with Isaac turning into a person with his own will, not a generic vessel of suffering. It deserves the 7 I&apos;m giving for those merits, and for that I&apos;m excluding my comparison with DS1. Fortunately, it&apos;s not easier than DS1, maybe harder. On the down side, it&apos;s too linear - I really don&apos;t see the point of critics in hailing that as an advantage. Worse still, one of the new monsters, the stalker, caught my attention as a symptom of dumbification - it&apos;s supposed to hide at corners to suprise-attack you, but it actually  sticks its head from the corners so you can peek it every time before it predictably charging head-on for you to cut his legs. The stalker actually playing peek-a-boo with you - I suppose that&apos;s adequate for the public they had in mind.<br><br>Maybe it&apos;s not the developers&apos; fault or executive meddling, maybe they set the bar too high, or it&apos;s just  impossible for one to get the same scare twice - see Silent Hill after 2. Still, I&apos;d wait for the price go down a little before acquiring it, not expecting it to be Dead Space, but just a competent monster shooter, a little soulless, but funny still.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1473264">Expand</a></span>

As for me I won&apos;t have to upgrade my computer anytime soon, and this game proves my point. The other thing I appreciate is that the wireless xbox360 controller works 100%, including full rumble effects for the game, and the controller buttons show within the game, so If you have one of those I would recommend it over a keyboard (but I don&apos;t know, if you&apos;re a hardcore PC gamer you may prefer the keyboard, its your choice anyway). I also recommend you hook up your PC to an HDTV using HDMI cable, I can because my ATI card has HDMI out...and with that wireless Xbox360 controller whoooha, you&apos;re in for a spin (I have a Samsung 55&apos;&apos; 1080p). The only thing I can say about the gameplay right now, since I just started the game is mention the part about the health and ammo...I am constantly running out of them, and therefore it is very difficult to get past certain parts without them, It is also difficult to find them ( especially health). Also the very slow reloading is bad, because when a swarm of necromorphs attack you and you try to reload, they kill you before you can reload. Thus you have to be running away from them while reloading, for them to give you time to  reload, this is bad with the faster necromorphs, and when they pop out of nowhere all of a sudden. It is a fun game, it&apos;s just kind of difficult, they should have added more health and ammo in certain places.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1477680">Expand</a></span>

One thing that really made the game for me where those interactive cutscene things, just amazingly well-made. The sounds and music are downright spectacular. Pretty much the same weapons and a few new ones, a talking Isaac and new armor also make this game more interesting that its predecessor. The animations are silky smooth and the voice acting is very convincing. It has some downright disturbing moments and plenty of very tense and hectic fighting. The enemies are... interesting in a way i guess. Most of them very disturbing and freaky, good variety too, you need different approaches for different enemies. Great game, not too different in terms of gameplay but it does the job of providing a new and very interesting successor of Dead Space 1. Thank you Visceral Games, roll on Dead Space 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1479882">Expand</a></span>

The first edition of Dead Space was the first game ever that actually gave me some cold chills. The game play has been improved in the new version. Isaac can float in his new suit. some new weapons and suits. I don&apos;t see many things that can still be improved in this game. I had about thirty hours of fun on the single player campaign before finishing it on the normal level (makes me wonder if Ransu&apos;s review is fact based....) My only less positive comment is that this game is in fact more of the first Dead Space game. But finetuned to a higher level. So maybe some more variation by adding more new elements, like the hacking, could have made me give it a ten. Great sound effects and music that get the adrenaline flowing. Great graphics and design (it was great that you actually revisit some parts of the first Dead Space.) You can really experience throughout this game that the designers put a lot of love and attention into the designs, music and script. 49 euro&apos;s well spent here. Tip: if you wish to enjoy the game, being a mediocre player like me, don&apos;t play it on casual difficulty but do it at least on the normal level, you will have a lot more fun that way.  I am not very much interested in the multiplayer features. But I will probably pick it up again in two or three years right before DS3 arrives....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1474589">Expand</a></span>

Everything about this game brims with creativity, from the lighting (inspired by the Old Masters such as Rembrandt), to the creatures Isaac encounters, everything in this game appears to have been crafted with love and thought. The user interface is so smoothly integrated with the gameplay itself that the shifting becomes seamless, making the experience even more immersive. Sound is also excellent, although music is limited and never finds a particularly important role. The weapon design is enjoyable and enormously unique, as the electrified javelin throwers attest to. Each weapon has two functions and is entirely upgradable, adding to the re-playability factor. I look forward very much to playing the &quot;New Game +&quot; (Chrono Trigger homage, anyone?) and trying out new weapons, different upgrades, and further exploration in Dead Space&apos;s dark world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1477342">Expand</a></span>

More enemies, more guns, more stories (Isaac becoming a character is a plus!), more hatred for the Unitologists- the only downside is that you don&apos;t actually get to fight the religious zealots themselves. This game is intense, gruesome, and overall incredible. It&apos;s got lots of replayability in trying out different weapons on higher difficulties.</span>

And on a decent computer (I just recently upgraded), the game looks no better than an Xbox port.<br><br>The multiplayer seems cool for a day then I realized there is no depth and it has no replayability. There is only one game type with very minimal maps, there are too many bottleneck points which make for unbalanced gameplay, and you get more points for kills, not completing objectives which makes for extremely slow leveling up if you&apos;re focusing on securing objectives.<br><br>Overall, the game is okay, I enjoyed playing it, but if there was a DS3 for next year, I&apos;d skip it or rent it. The way I feel about this game is comparable to Bioshock 2. Feels more like a forced sequel, more of the same, whoop dee doo I was already here before. I got tired of the &quot;No way, the door is locked, you&apos;ll have to open it somewhere else&quot; and &quot;the lights went out, watch out for the...&quot; Seriously, you can only pull off something like this once before it gets boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1475273">Expand</a></span>

They are absolutely fine once you&apos;ve turned v-sync off, vastly improved over DS1, mouse+kb work great. Now the game itself - What&apos;s GOOD: It is indeed a fantastic game. The environments and scenery are some of the best I&apos;ve seen in a game, the way you learn to interact with the environment, and in doing so solve an array of puzzles (none of which are too puzzling but feel rewarding none the less), is truly well thought through. The story is as good, if not better, than the first game and there&apos;s never a bit where you feel disinterested. It&apos;s the story that keeps you wanting to hear all of the audio and text logs as they leak little extra tid bits of information to you, none of which you need to read to progress but because they give you little extras as to how people on the station reacted to the outbreak, always adding to the story and keeping it flowing. Of course shooting the mutated crew-members is fun through-out and the variety that the game throws at you keeps it fresh. The bosses are also far more fun than in the first game and whilst still not as challenging as getting rushed by a mob of red necromorphs, provide fights which give a nice level of satisfaction. The new Spitter enemy as well as the raptors are enjoyable too - some of the best fights were against a pack of raptors as they peak around corners and dart between cover, before rushing head on at you - it really created some tense moments. The game isn&apos;t as &apos;scary&apos; as the first, although I didn&apos;t find the first game particularly scary - however I would say it&apos;s just as tense and creates some great atmospherical tension. I also like the fact they&apos;ve gone for less horror and more action, it shows and makes for a better game. The new anti-grav sections are really well made and are an improvement over the first. I also thought the game as a whole, including the characters script, was well written. What&apos;s BAD: Well, first of all I wish they would realise that enemies you can&apos;t kill aren&apos;t fun. Much like in the first game *SPOILER* towards the end there is one who just keeps regenerating and all you can do is stasis it and run away, until 15 minutes later where you finally escape it. I don&apos;t know if others enjoy this aspect, but I found it thoroughly irritating in both games and as soon as I saw it appear again in DS2, felt a little annoyed that I would have to go through the irritation of it again. It&apos;s not hard, just irritating. */SPOLIER* Another thing is when you get mobbed from all angles with little hope other than using several med-kits. A lot of the time when wave after wave is sent at you, it&apos;s exciting and with some skilled shooting you can make it out without a scratch. However, there are other times where you have no option other than to spam kits and shoot. Which brings me to my next criticism, being that life/death felt very much an all or nothing experience. You would either come out of something unscathed or with very little damage - or be reloading the game because you got instakilled from behind without even knowing anything was there. There seemed to be little inbetween. I mentioned that some of the new enemies were pretty cool additions, but some aren&apos;t. There are new baby necros which crawl along the walls and explode when you shoot the sack on their back. I don&apos;t know if they&apos;re meant to be creepy but they just look ridiculous and provide no challenge. The same goes for the child necros, they&apos;re pretty cool but one hit kills and provide no challenge. Quicktime events are an annoyance, pressing the same button and making it determine the outcome of a wrestling match isn&apos;t very enjoyable - perhaps if they made it so you had to press a sequence of buttons or something of the sort it would be better. The attempt at making the small cutscenes through-out the game with Isaacs girlfriend scary, fall flat on their face - and again feel like it&apos;s trying far too hard. My final criticism, which is small but frustrating when it happens, is that sometimes you will think you&apos;re in a cutscene only to realise too late that you have regained control of Isaac, and it results in having to reload from a checkpoint. Conclusion: It&apos;s a great game overall. You will find yourself getting agitated at certain times, but this usually amounts to the odd room which has been badly designed when it comes to spawning enemies on top of you and inevitably wasting a health pack or two. The variation of environments is excellent and the atmosphere through-out the game draws you in. As I said above, the story is well told and the characters believable. Towards the end i just felt it let itself down slightly with messy enemy spawns and it feeling like an old-skool &apos;spam health potions whilst blasting things&apos; RPG. Can&apos;t get MP to work either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1474847">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are smooth and game is really well optimized, which makes gameplay enjoyable without hiccups or long loading screens. Sound is perfect for a horror game, music cues for battles really pump up adrenaline and spooky ambient sounds while roaming around are keeping you at the edge of the seat. This game was one of the few released recently that didn&apos;t get boring after first few encounters with enemies, it&apos;s always fun obliterating monsters. RPG elements make it even more interesting. Ending was one of the best I&apos;ve seen and makes it a perfect conclusion for the series. A word of warning though - game is extremely violent (and not only to monsters), so if you are easily offended by the look of gore you shouldn&apos;t buy it without watching trailers or playing demo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1479464">Expand</a></span>

The thickly intense atmosphere is just dripping with desolation, feelings of seclusion, depair and the promise of terrifying creatures hidden within every shadow. Even when you know the scares are coming - they still manage to make you jump. Despite my hating this game for it&apos;s unavoidable scares, I love it twice as much for them(if that makes sense). The detail and design of the levels is truly extraordinary and time can be spent in-game simply shining the (fantastically implemented) flashlight around the decor admiring its minute details. Animations and voice work are also truly superb. There are no cheesy b-grade voice samples here, only pure quality. Cut scenes are well acted and choreographed and really assist in thickening the already soupy atmosphere. One thing noticed though, despite the texture work being 99% brilliant, there are still a few low-resolution textures around making me wonder if the work experience kid was honored with a few of his additions. Besides that, everything is candy. Sound effects are spot on... hard-hitting gunfire, flesh-rending impacts, cautious footsteps and distant moans and screams are all produced in spine-chillingly intricate detail. But most importantly the gameplay ties in perfectly, the controls are fluid and responsive and the menus and in-game interactive objects are a breeze to operate... helpful considering the game doesn&apos;t stop while you browse your inventory. Dismembering a slavering ghoul whilst micromanaging your stash is an oddly satisfying thing. The directional beacon which points your way to objectives, save-stations, workbenches etc is a treat and prevents you double-backing on yourself and always keeping you on track. Boss encounters are, for the most part, epic. The game avoids sterotypical FPS boss fights by scripting them into ever-changing sequences. One might have you frantically gunning a limb on a huge Necromorph as you dangle from a ceiling with your leg snared. Another may have you madly scrambling through debris, firing off potshots, as another huge demonic creature rips and roars his way behind you - at terrifying speed. There is never a moment this game lets you rest. I had to pause and take a big breath to shake some reality into myself after strings of teeth-grittingly intense firefights ... and to let my poor old ticker return to a remotely normal pace. In regards to the first iteration of this series, do not be fooled by other opinions that there is something lacking here. Dead Space 2 is a rock-solid, chrome polished game, that in my humble opinion, compliments first beautifully. I implore you to buy this game, play it in the dark with your headphones on full-ball and scream like a girl... hell.. I did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1483813">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay mechanics have been tweaked to perfection, and they don&apos;t just reuse the same scare tactics from the previous game.  The graphics are solid, though not on the same level as some of the recent PC titles.  The sound and ambiance provided by it are better in every way than the last one, and that&apos;s saying something.  Overall, I&apos;d say 9/10 for sure, possibly 10/10 if the multiplayer balances itself out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1472281">Expand</a></span>

There are very very few games that I believe are worth the $60 price tag that most have when they come out. This one is worth every last penny. Before it came out I was skeptical thinking it looked like a rehash of DS1 but it wasn&apos;t. Visceral delivered with the best horror game I&apos;ve played so far. Isaac&apos;s inner struggle is something that thorough the game you wonder is what I&apos;m seeing in his head or is it standing in front of me. The game keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very first moment until after the credits have finished and rewards you with an amazing after completion main screen. It is like playing a 20 hour movie with cut scenes that blend seamlessly with game play. I found myself just floating a few times realizing control of Clarke had been given back to me.<br><br>All of the last hour of the game your jaw will keep dropping more and more until it falls off when you enter the after credit cinematic. From DS1 they fixed or I should rather say improved the game play mechanics more than I could have hoped for. This is a game I think everyone should play and if this is what we start 2011 with then it is going to be an amazing year. I&apos;m holding my breath until DS3 is announced and will preorder it as soon as I can on STEAM.  I do not see how anyone can give this any less than a 10 or at least a 9. It has become one of the best games I&apos;ve played to date only thing I wish they had done is add tessellation and DX11 support. But I&apos;m sure DS3 will have that. So I say good luck and save you ammo and health you&apos;re in for one hell of a crawl through the Sprawl.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1483237">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are outstanding, the cutscenes thrilling, and the gameplay is pretty gripe-free. Definitely an improvement, and to my mind, was worth the purchase. I -was- hoping it&apos;d be more sandbox (what, with this city called &quot;The Sprawl&quot;), but can&apos;t have everything. Maybe DS3.</span>

We continue Isaac&apos;s story three years after the original game, This time instead of being set on a spaceship DS2 is set in a huge space colony / city called Sprawl on one of Saturn&apos;s moons, It&apos;s here where we catch up with Isaac as he wakes from a daydream to find himself bound in a straitjacket and suffering from nightmarish hallucinations of his dead girlfriend. The Original Dead Space wasn&apos;t hyped as much as this sequel, and as a result it almost slipped under the radar for a lot of gamers, but for those of us who played the first game it became a game to remember for many reasons but mainly because it was full of edge of the seat action and suspense that would scare the pants of you, even when you had that knowing feeling that something was going to happen you&apos;d still jump when it did, and the impressive highly detailed Zero-G sections that were unlike anything scene before and the unforgiving enemies, Dead Space 2 has all of this and more by the bucket load, with more zero g sections, a bigger necromorph invasion force, this time with added necromorph types that include hideous featureless childlike creatures with pointed limbs who attack you in packs, crawling baby like necromorphs who explode when they are near you, then there&apos;s the Puker&apos;s, who are similar to Left 4 Dead&apos;s Boomers (albeit a lot trimmer), but instead of spewing bile at you the Puker&apos;s spew acid from a distance accompanied with a blood-curdling scream. Isaac does have a bit more help this time round though in the form of new weapons which include a detonator gun that fires a tri-beamed laser which explodes when touched, and a Javelin Gun, a high-powered spear-gun like weapon that lets you fire bolts at enemies and impale them onto nearby crates or walls, and of course there&apos;s the old favorites from the original game such as the line-cutter, the ripper and the flamethrower, all of which can be upgraded along with your rig and stasis modules at workbenches throughout the game by using power nodes collected on your travels. There&apos;s no HUD as such in Dead Space 2, the screen is left quite clear while in combat, this is partly to allow you to have a clear view of your surroundings and partly so that anything remotely scary still has the full impact of scaring the crap out of you, add to this one of the best in-game atmospheres there is with its outstanding graphics that this time round see more of those superbly crafted zero-gravity sections where Isaac is free to float around with the aid of little rockets and the almost perfect sound effects that have you wondering if that was a bit of trash moving behind you or a necromorph creeping up on you, this all makes for a truly immersive experience and that keeps you on your toes at all times, so much so that you&apos;ll be grateful of those save points after a while so that you can take a breather (and turn the lights on if it&apos;s getting dark outside) Dead Space made great use of the Kinesis ability in Isaac&apos;s suit which allowed him to pick up objects and either move them out of the way or fire them at enemies and objects, this system has now been greatly improved and made more responsive, so much so that it will now become part of your combat technique, and as with the original game ammo is in short supply so you may find yourself having to use Kinesis to pick up a severed limb and fire it at an approaching enemy, you&apos;ll also use Kinesis and Stasis to manipulate objects to solve puzzles in order to progress through the game. Unlike it&apos;s predecessor Dead Space 2 has an eight player multiplayer mode in which 2 teams of four try to complete their objective, namely four human engineers try to achieve their goal while four necromorphs try to stop them (think of L4D but in space and you&apos;ve got the idea), As with most online games if you&apos;re in a party or lobby with a good bunch of players then the multiplayer can be a lot of fun. In Summary Dead Space 2 has been vastly improved over the original game, with everything from the environments and sounds being tweaked so that the game pulls you in and completely immerses you, almost every aspect of game play has improved, and when you combine that with an engrossing storyline then you&apos;re in for a good time, Well, unless you suffer from a nervous disposition, in which case I&apos;d recommend you don&apos;t play through while on your own</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1487938">Expand</a></span>

Excellent graphics, great sound that will make you feel fear, it&apos;s pretty much a good combination of other games like Bioshock, FEAR, MassEffect in my opinion, but a well done game.</span>

True, this might not be as scary, or as polished, or as hard as the first part, though I died more times to the &quot;environment&quot; or in cut-scenes.

Another very notable one would be its voiced protagonist in this game. The last game got so boring when you didn&apos;t hear anything for he longest time. Then, the downsides. The game attempts to scare you with meager attempts, i.e. bodies falling from the ceiling or catching a glimpse of something running down a hall. It seems Dead Space just isn&apos;t the horror type, but it does action quite well.<br>One more problem I had, the game is significantly shorter and the chapter names are no longer clever. Although the game wraps up nicely, there will no doubt be a Dead Space 3. And I hope if it again fails in horror, it manages to keep it&apos;s nice action style. Dark, creepy, yet full of explosions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1513201">Expand</a></span>

Aside from having completely engrossing plot and universe, the atmosphere and mechanics of the game were dead on.  My adrenaline was pumping almost constantly, and I&apos;m not the easily startled type.  Weapons and melee were fun and useful.  Monsters were frightening in appearance and behavior, and they don&apos;t mess around when trying to kill you.  The only negative is that towards the end, if you only used the same guns, it could get very repetitive.  But thats why there like 10 weapons, mix it up!  Overall, A+.  If you liked resident evil or silent hill, then you&apos;ll love this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1534027">Expand</a></span>

It is short, it can be done in the same of 6-7 hours without much exploration, but this is in no way a flaw. EA will role out more DLC and replayability can be done with it becoming painful. I loved the first game so i was pleased to see they had no taken away all of rail shooter type cinematic mini-boss levels. The look and presentation are flawless in its approach, fear seems to be built into the very game. One problem i have with this game is the lack of extensive customization. Part of me wanted this to play like a RPG game, but i guess the score of 9 comes down to what i expected from the game, not its based on its actually mertis (of which it could possibility a 10/10). If you like good atmosphere from a game as well as shooting zombie like things in the face with a assortment of weapons then this is your choice, but if you are no psychotic and need the thrill and suspenses of a genre defining game you have no reason not to buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1541026">Expand</a></span>

Still a great game that definitely stands out of the pack. Excellent atmosphere throughout the game. The graphics, sound and voice acting really come together well. Decent replay value as well, which I find is very rare in games these days.

I loved the action sequences that force you to think on your toes, as well as the variation in puzzles and zero gravity levels of the game. Voice acting and animations are fantastic, and the characterization of Isaac Clarke is very well done. Atmosphere is wonderful. definitely one to play on headphones with the lights out. If there is anything negative to be said about this game is that it&apos;s a little short - I think I finished it in six or seven hours on normal difficulty, and that if you&apos;ve played the first game, then scares are a little familiar - if you&apos;ve seen one Necromorph playing dead only to jump up at you when you walk nearby then you&apos;ve seen them all, though having said that; it still made me jump a bunch of times - the screaming children are f***ing terrifying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1706980">Expand</a></span>

The guns are cool for a bit, then lose their touch. The story is very straight forward. Not enough content to keep my interest over the full 10 hours.</span>

Once again it appears that Visceral tried way too hard. Dead Space 2 felt like it lacked the improvement that a sequel should have. Although the mouse movement system was improved that was about it. They still felt the need to turn off lights, have stuff pop out when you walk near, and use consistent loops of screaming that are way to frequent for &quot;scary&quot; ambiance. They once again tried way too hard to frighten the player that it got to the point that it once again became laughable after the first few attempts because they were still too predicable. Although i got the game at a discount on steam i still do not think it was worth it.  If they are going to pretend that these console/pc games are full sized then they need to start making decent sized areas. Also just like the Cortana visions in Halo 3 the visions in here were just as annoying. I am still hoping for a solid horror/ action game that does not feel the need to try frighten you every time you do something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115462">Expand</a></span>

I just uninstalled it, exclaiming, &quot;Oh for Christ&apos;s sake!&quot; Even with the patch, the controls are not fully implemented for PC, so Mouse 4 and Mouse 5 are unassignable for some actions.<br><br>This game is fond of removing camera control from the player to show set pieces and other animations. This is disorienting in third person (why is this third person?). The FOV is around 65 degrees, designed for a TV, and it can&apos;t be changed. This may make some people nauseated, especially with the weird revolutions of the third person camera. Movement itself is extremely clunky. There is no crouching or jumping. You cannot hop over a coffee table or low couch.<br><br>This is quite literally a shooter on rails--you can illuminate the paths to objectives, save stations (there is no traditional or quick saving), and &quot;stores&quot; where you buy guns. These are all on the exact same paths.<br><br>Most of the monsters and other NPCs do not actually inhabit the game world, but are triggered to spawn as you travel a pre-defined path through corridors. The monsters will spawn through otherwise inaccessible doors right behind you or from ceiling panels above. Since monsters do not inhabit the game world, tactical approaches are futile. Clearing a room, for instance, nets you nothing because monsters can spawn wherever they are scripted to appear. All the combat I saw was extremely close quarters, necessitating a bullet time system where you press a button and then shoot monsters in slow motion.<br><br>The environments were rendered well for the againg consoles it was designed for, but they do not evince any actual place. It feels more like you are thrust into an interminable series of gerbil tubes, albeit ones rigged with monster boxes.<br><br>All in all, this game gives you very little freedom to play how you want to play. It is kind of like Disneyland&apos;s Haunted House ride, where you are escorted along to see a show, but you aren&apos;t really a participant. You are an observer with the illusion of participation, but the illusion is weak.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2169345">Expand</a></span>

AGAIN!&quot; also, i should mention that i keep getting killed in what i think are cutscenes: what a ****load of **** bull****! why do so many things in this game look like cutscenes? why isn&apos;t there some sort of indication that what&apos;s going on is or not a cutscene? goddamn it this kind of things just piss me off so much it makes me wanna throw the game out the damn window! this kind of bull**** would have been nice in the 80s when game developers had to make hard games to make them last, but why in the name of god do you have to do thing like this in 2011??? jesus christ! i can finish contra on the nes without dieing too many times, but i keep dieing over and over again in this damn game! that&apos;s definitely not what i expected.<br><br>in conclusion: not a bad game, but holy **** is it hard! 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1473596">Expand</a></span>

Atm there are no dedicated server (not sure if there will be) so your ping/latency is also 1 out of 4 bars or, 150 ping/latency +. So really, laggy. Very, Very, Very unbalance, between alien and player, which is also very frustrating some times as you spit crap at them 20 times and they can keep using pills or what ever the hell it is to recover back to full health, making your attempt to kill one player is futile. Controls are unresponsive which adds more frustration and including the lag makes the whole multiplayer experience stupid and boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1545331">Expand</a></span>

There are times I was like, &quot;No, they didn&apos;t just do that!&quot; It is intense just like the first, but the weapons are much more fun. Weapons from the first also have different Alternate fire than the first game. The best part of this game is revisiting the Ishimura. While the game has improved on many features and graphics, I was really disappointed with the boss fights. They were fewer than the first game and the final boss fight was very anti-climactic. I would wait for this to drop in price to $40 before purchasing as I paid $60 and do not feel that it was worth it. It felt more like an expansion than a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1488279">Expand</a></span>

So I&apos;m going to keep mine a little shorter.<br>I think this game should be called Dead Space 1.2... It was a huge letdown with regards to innovation, creativity, and story-telling. I thoroughly enjoyed the improved gameplay mechanics, and some of the scares, but.. that&apos;s about it.<br>The rest of the game felt like a familiar ritual. At first I was fully expecting new twists and innovations, but that expectancy quickly gave way to an ever deepening sense of disappointment. Way too linear, some recycled environments, stupid puzzles, very few visual improvements, and worst of all for a survival horror; it was dreadfully predictable. I still enjoyed the game though, and will most likely purchase the next effort in the franchise, but I&apos;ll never again pre-purchase a Dead Space game, or purchase it at their full asking price... I&apos;ll simply wait for the Steam sales.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1492947">Expand</a></span>
