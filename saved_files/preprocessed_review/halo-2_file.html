BTW i see that CRYSIS has some very serious crashing and compatability issues with Vista so look out for a review on that in the near future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=63210">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Halo 2 is about the least reliable game I have encountered in recent years. I have been unable to get it to run for more than 2-3 minutes, and judging by all the comments I see on the various boards, I am not alone. This game was released too soon and is not solid at all. Right now, I feel that I have wasted my money.</span>

It was an xbox exclusive, a game that had originally been planned for PC release and was going to be a large open world game where as the masterchief you roamed the Halo hooking up with ragtag bands of marines and took the fight to covenant while trying to uncover the secrets of the halo, no 2 playthroughs would play the same if you made different decisions and they even hinted at allowing &quot;drop in&quot; co-op in the early interviews.
<br>
<br>What we got was fairly much that story but on rails and towards the third quarter of the game it was quite repetitive. Sure it had all the beauty we knew to expect from the early videos but the single player was just... ok. Co-op was great fun 2 plyayer on xbox and if not for that I probably never would have completed the game on the console.
<br>
<br>Then halo 2 arrived and it started off very cool, it let you play as the MasterChief to begin with fighting the covenant on earth in some very memorable battles. Then you got to play as the fallen Arbiter on the Covenant side which was also cool.
<br>
<br>**SPOILER AHEAD**
<br>
<br>Here the game took a turn for the worse, back in the master chiefs shoes you are transported to another halo like the first one... ugh. It was at this point in H2 on xbox that I stopped playing, recalling how horribly repetitive the areas in the later halo game had been. Being that I do not like the concept of paying my ISP and then paying for Xboxlive service I never took either game online.
<br>
<br>Since then Halo 1 came to PC and was since upgraded to Halo CE or the Halo Custom Edition which is a lot of fun, the fact that the CE allows custom maps and mods (theres even a halo 2 weapon mod and the community is still active with new maps) has kept it alive far past where I though it would exist and the Vs gameplay with vehicles is actually a lot of fun.
<br>
<br>Eventually Halo2 also appeared on PC but only for Vista users. I bought it a year or two back for about $10 in the clearance bin at JB Hifi alongside copies of Shadowrun (that other Vista only games for windows launch title) with the intent of seeing if the online community was any good for it. I installed it and sat down to play a little single player to tweak my settings and get a feel for the weapons.....
<br>
<br>OMFG the mouse even at speed 10 (Max) felt like I was trying to turn in a tub of concrete, keyboard was permenantly mapped and you couldnt edit it (not a big deal I guess if you like WASD standard settings) and general game performance was pretty lousy. I stopped playing the game but didnt uninstall it.
<br>
<br>Recently I was reading some gufff about the next Halo installment in passing &amp; one of the user comments was that Halo 2 is hard to surpass as the best of the series which I found surprising, more surprising were other comments by quite a few people who agreed that Halo 2 was the best of the series thus far. Hmm I thought, maybe I should give it another chance ? ugh but the controls were horrible and the game performance terrible.... well sort of.
<br>
<br>After a bunch of tweaking in nvidia control panel &amp; maxing out all my halo 2 graphics options the mouse is actually quite responsive and the gameplay not choppy. Turns out the game tries to limit itself to 30fps capped, if your system exceeds this (especially if you have vsynch off and are pre-rendering frames) then the game starts dropping frames which makes it look choppy and interferes with your mouse control. long story short I am 90% happy with how it feels now.
<br>
<br>So I played through the first Masterchief section &amp; the Arbiter section, and arrive back on the fourth Halo where I abandoned the game on xbox. Oh dear how wrong I was, after a slightly slow start to this section there are some extremely exciting shootouts and vehicle gameplay to enjoy. The environments look a little dated (low res textures by todays standards) but the player/creature/vehicle models were always incredibly detailed in the halo games &amp; got a lot of love to the point they still look exceptional IMHO.
<br>
<br>My recommendation, if you havent tried Halo 2 on PC and you can find it someplace cheap grab it. The Story and single player gameplay are well worth it (sadly no co-op in PC version), multiplayer seems dead with Halo CE being the far more active title for multiplayer (no doubt due to the modding options). That said the Ingle Player portion of Halo 2 is really good and worth a look for FPS fans, though I am not sure how available it is in 2012, a recent stroll through some local games retailers showed me they are still stocking Halo (probably because people need the game keys for Halo CE) for PC but no sign of Halo 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2670058">Expand</a></span>

There were a lot of things they could have done differently, and for starters, not making it Vista exclusive since it doesn&apos;t even require DX10 as was initially stated. I feel it&apos;s too little too late, as there are many better shooters out there to choose from. It sells on the Halo name alone imho.</span>

Yet, considering the plethora of fantastic PC FPS already availible, Halo 2 (and Halo 1 for that matter) fail to distinguish itself from the pack. From the singleplayer to the mutliplayer, the Halo series is the definition of the word &apos;over-rated&apos;.</span>

Halo 2 looks shocking low-res and enemy AI is plain stupid (don&apos;t confuse aggressive with smart). Graphics are way underwhelming and single player relatively bland and uninteresting. It&apos;s hard to understand why Vista is mandatory (no DX10, poor DX9).</span>

<br>
<br>On the plus side, the colors and textures were improved and even more lush than the original.  A couple new weapons, new aliens and truly beautiful level architecture helped redeem the game and keep the score in the &quot;good&quot; range. The cut scenes were interesting, but the disjointedness of the plot made those insufficient. Overall, well worth playing, but don&apos;t expect it to be particularly memorable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2499619">Expand</a></span>

It was, as console shooters go, among the best.  But compared to even average PC shooters, it&apos;s nothing to be proud of.  Now we&apos;ve got Halo 2 which is about half as long and its major feature was that you could shoot two guns at the same time!  Woohoo!  Oh wait, that&apos;s been around since the first shooter games, for instance Descent, which was a competitor to the original Doom from about 15 years ago!  Halo 2, to begin with, was average at best for a console shooter.  Then they &quot;port&quot; it without actually porting anything - they think you&apos;re actually going to push A and B on your keyboard for the menus!  Weapons are still designed to be shot in the general vicinity of the square kilometer where your enemy is located and yield a kill shot.  The sounds is average, the enemies look like something out of a kid&apos;s show, the controls are horrible, the physics are bad, and the graphics... oh let&apos;s not even touch that with a ten foot pole.  And they actually think you&apos;re going to not only pay full price for this disaster, but also upgrade to Vista for it?  Do you want one of my arms too, Microsoft?
<br>
<br>In conclusion, play through Half-Life 1 again.  Heck, play Unreal, Jedi Knight, FEAR, uh, Pac Man... you&apos;ll find more original ideas in any of the above than you&apos;ll find in Halo 2, and you might actually have fun instead of feeling like you wish you were at the dentist getting teeth pulled by a blind co-op student.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=63456">Expand</a></span>

I hated Halo 2 it ruined everything about Halo 1 - the weapons were horrid and too numerous, the weapons had lost their sheen and power and were now like toys, the graphics were small and ugly, the levels were diabolical - the first level is messy, dull, confusing and pointless. The clambouring over the big gun just sums up the ghastliness of it all. This was the only game I have pre-ordered. I got the special edition tin too. And from the first minute I thought it was ****. I am trying to replay it now but all the time I think &quot;I hate this&quot;. Everytime I play Halo? I think &quot;I LOVE THIS!&quot;. The second most over-rated game of all time second only to ... Gears of War which is total garbage. Bad mushy graphics, bad AI, bad weapons, no atmosphere, a pathetic non-story, no character and enemies that are the same as your colleagues.

The PC Version graphics were crisp and enjoyed the new gameplay which included jacking vehicles and exchanging weapons. The storyline and you playing the covenant at first Was a turn off but was interested in their side of the story. Not perfect controls but added enough to make it a great sequel.</span>

Improved graphics, decent but not as good as some of our 2006 and 07 previous ones. The exciting and epic storyline havent changed. New online features for live and map making are what really catches my eye. Summarizing this, Halo 2 vista is just an improved version of the best selling game, even though it lacks some of the graphics of our new ones. Get this game if you barely/never played it and still enjoys the game play formula. Do not get this game if you played it to death on xbox, and is a big stickler on graphic and new titles. -just telling you guys the new fps games realesed for 2007 are mediocre, there is only 2-3 out and the fps realeased in 2006 have similar graphics to halo2 and most games&apos; gameplay and online multiplayer wont match up with this bestseller.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=398274">Expand</a></span>

This would be true, if the game actually had the capability to play with xbox 360&apos;s.... If you want good graphics, go to a different game, the game is as lackluster and repetitive in the campaign mode as Halo 2 Xbox was (gee, seeing that this is a direct port, that shouldn&apos;t be surprising). Multiplayer is what makes halo. It always has, and always will. Rating it on its campaign is like saying you bought CS:S just to play against the bots, or Unreal expecting some sort of story line. I would also like to point out that it includes a map editor... which is quite powerful if you know how to use it. Bottom line, if you like halo 2 xbox, and have a gaming PC, its a definite buy. The control scheme is actually quite pleasant,. I personally was wondering what they would use for dual wield, and I think the &apos;q&apos; key is an excellent choice. The reviewers are also missing another feature... you can play it straight from your dvd drive, no installation is required.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=398404">Expand</a></span>

The single player is still one of the worst of any game ever made. The graphics and textures on the level design looks exceptionaly dated next to the much more detailed modles of the MC and the in game arcitecture is rather uninspiring. This is a very solid title held back by microsofts decision to make it vista only and to wait over 5 years to port to PC. This would have been a good title if only so much time hadn&apos;t passed that the game started to look and feel dated. Gameplay elements are very solid, quite possibly better than the original. To the user that stated he was getting lag and the user who was getting crashes, I had no such problems, but then again I have a brand new top of the line mechine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=399731">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>How does this game get an average score of 5.0? I had it for the xbox and i could not find an xbox review. It had a great campaign and a great multiplayer. Yes it did have a bad ending but it had a great story with the elites getting involved. Multiplayer was extremely fun with tons of maps and game modes. Maybe not as good as the first game but i give it a 9.1</span>

On the Xbox, this game had 20 Games of the Year awards. This port comes with all the features of the the Xbox version, plus achivements, exclusive multiplayer maps, a customization mode like an advanced form of Forge, the use of the Xbox 360 controller to play it, and currenlty the only way to play the Halo 2 multiplayer experience. Sure it doesn&apos;t meet current PC FPS standards, but it&apos;s not supposed to. It&apos;s for nostalgia sake and it&apos;s a little unfair to put one of the best selling games of all time to the standards it was not originally supposed to meet. The game is a classic game that deserves a little more respect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1378862">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Probably my favorite game in the series besides the first one.  Played it for PC and Xbox, and the PC version is much smoother and better.  The only thing it lacks is a multiplayer base since it&apos;s an older title.  If you can run at 120fps, it looks great even though the textures and engine are older.  Still overall a great game in the series.  Just wish the multiplayer had actual people in it :/</span>

The ability to control the Arbiter, who has a nifty cloak, is fun at first, but eventually it just becomes a drag to frequently switch between characters. I liked the levels where you are on earth fighting alongside the Marines against Covenant forces, but was fairly bored with those against Flood or Rebel forces. In the end, if you liked the other Halo games, this is probably worth playing, but it&apos;s more significant for what carried over into future games than for what it did itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2556137">Expand</a></span>
