<br>
<br>Otherwise, take Swery&apos;s distinct style and mash it together with a Tellale game and this is what you get. I thought some of the unconventional pieces of the game worked really well in shaking up the traditional adventure game format. Your character can switch between a past scenario and the present, meaning that for some of the optional side quests you will need to use objects found in the present to solve the mystery in the past. While navigating the world, you use up action points which are refilled by eating food. I thought this system worked well since it incentivizes exploration because you&apos;d want to find the food to be able to use more action points to be able to explore more.
<br>
<br>Tonally the game has some set themes that it likes to throw in the player&apos;s face at every opportunity. Hockey, food, anthropomorphism, and plane tech are regular themes that constantly appear throughout these two episodes. The eerie strangeness may be off-putting for many the way more surreal works can be.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, there is no real plot resolution and the second/last episode released ends on a cliffhanger at the height of the story&apos;s conflict so buyer beware if Swery does not get funding for a third+episodes. Nonetheless, I would recommend this for those who like Swery/telltale games even if the story never gets resolved since it does some interesting things on the way there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/d4-dark-dreams-dont-die/user-reviews?user_review_id=5347432">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are not so bad, but the thick black outline around the edges is really not helping it. The fight scenes and animations are great, the dialogues and minigames are just okay and the item collecting is just bad. The resource bars that limit the number of actions you can do is completely useless and just annoying, and the article clipping you collect are completely uninteresting. Combined with the fact that you can&apos;t choose resolutions over the preset ones, that the framerate is locked, it makes a poor game for this genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/d4-dark-dreams-dont-die/user-reviews?user_review_id=5326652">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I find the game interesting. It has a crazy story and characters, has humor. Graphics are nice, music is great. What I don&apos;t like is the fact its only 2 very short episodes even with the side cases and no I don&apos;t count a few min prologue. Come on no matter how you look at it its too little to be called season 1.</span>

Game play is very simple and it&apos;s not boring or annoying, but i think it&apos;s much more fun on kinekt than mouse. I like the challenge with Phillip Cheney&apos;s questions, some of it very easy and some o of it i didn&apos;t realize. Nice sound and music, especially that famous theme from DP when the situation is heating up or the character shows true himself, i guess it&apos;s a bit modified but not sure. Hope for the second season!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/d4-dark-dreams-dont-die/user-reviews?user_review_id=5535225">Expand</a></span>

Through his journey he meets some of the most eccentric characters imaginable and must interact with them to uncover clues.  The interface is point and click with various action sequences mixed in each of the 2 episodes.  The game can be played entirely with the mouse which is great because you need a free arm to constantly wail in the air as things get more and more bizarre.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Amazing and memorable characters.
<br>Interesting story and setting that kept me immersed.
<br>Action sequences have style and add well to the mix.
<br>Interface is stylish and simple.
<br>Music fits the mood and it&apos;s really good.
<br>Vision system to help uncover clues.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Only 2 episodes in Season 1, but they are both fantastic.
<br>If you&apos;re familiar with adventure games, you won&apos;t find a challenge here.
<br>It is a linear story.
<br>
<br>I was really surprised by this game, the story, setting, characters, mood, and style are all amazing.  I had far more fun with this game than the Tell Tale games.  I&apos;m strongly looking forward to a Season 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/d4-dark-dreams-dont-die/user-reviews?user_review_id=5956678">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Swery&apos;s humor and tastes projected in the content within the world of D4.
<br>- Nice art style, better cel shading than many other games with similar style combining also exaggerated clamped shaders. It works great on PC and XBO.
- Frame rate not locked ;)
- The phase and the clues from the plot keeps you interested. Some are not expected for such short duration. That was nice.

<br>- Mini games, collectibles, outfits, amazing BGM selection again all because of Suehiro San.
<br>- If you liked the little details and item descriptions from games like Shenmue (+QTE) or L.A. Noire (beign veeery different kids of games). If you like silly humor as mentioned like in the past Swery did with Deadly Premonition...this is a good game.
<br>- Many references to western culture and also Japanese culture even references to movies and series (yes, once again haha!).
<br>- The adaption to mice is good, confortable. Maybe with Kinect it was a very different experience I&apos;m curious... (don&apos;t ever EVER use a joystick).
<br>- You like cliffhangers? You like unanswered questions? weeeell!!... ;) AVAAAAAAANT-GAAAAARDEEEE!!
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- It looks great but the anti-aliasing could be better for PC. A lot better!
<br>- This is a game / interactive experience. So if you&apos;re not a fan of this &quot;genre&quot; think twice.
<br>- Can be a bit short for it&apos;s price. The length depends on how much completionist you are.
<br>- Not the best replayability if you don&apos;t miss some extras investigations (wich are nice).
<br>- The wait for Season 2 :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/d4-dark-dreams-dont-die/user-reviews?user_review_id=7089403">Expand</a></span>
