Secondly, to all those people that are trashing this game...have you even played the board game?  This is the most faithful board game-to-videogame that I know of.  It has the exact rules from the board game for better or worse.  The point is, they marketed this game as an exact translation from one medium to the next and STILL people are criticizing this game.  Before buying a game you should do some research.
<br>
<br>With that out of the way, the fans of the board game will be thrilled to know that this was created with complete love and devotion to Warhammer 40k and Space Hulk.  Some of you wish (like I have) that you could just find the real board game and play it again, only to find that the 3rd Edition board game now sells for anywhere between $100.00(used)  $400.00(brand new) on sites like Ebay or Amazon.  Now you CAN play the board game and experience the joy of seeing those models on the board come to life in a videogame.
<br>
<br>The environment within the game is the first thing you&apos;ll notice.  What with all the amazing attention to detail.  The little touches here and there, the lighting, all of it was created with love.  You can easily tell how big of fans the creators were of this game.  The Terminators are modeled perfectly and the voices are exactly what you would imagine space marines to sound like.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not going to go into the game mechanics because this game was made for fans and for tactical turned-based strategists.  So all of you who are those fans already know how this game plays out.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s go on to multiplayer.  Yes, you can play online with a friend.  One person plays as the Terminators and the other player plays as the Genestealers, just like when playing at home with the board game.  The only issue I have was that it did not launch with a co-op option in the menu.  Now I&apos;m only halfway through the game at the moment but I have not seen any achievements that allow you to unlock co-op mode, though it may be there somewhere.  That being said, I do remember seeing a developer interview with him stating that the game will have co-op.  He didn&apos;t say if it was at launch or if it would come in an update later so I will have to give this game a 9 out of 10 just for that.  I had the intent of playing this game together as a team with friends and sadly I can only play versus.  It&apos;s a simple and small complaint but it was kind of a downer to me.  Fighting hordes of genestealers racing towards you with a buddy was a dream I thought I would be able to fulfill.  I guess I&apos;ll have to wait to see if an update or an unlock will happen upon us in the future.
<br>
<br>So back to what I was saying earlier, don&apos;t let those few people distract you.  They obviously didn&apos;t know what kind of game they were getting into and probably ignored all of the blatant signs of this being a tactical turn-based game replica of a board game.  It&apos;s perfect in my opinion, in the fact that they said it would be the board game and guess what, it is.  I just want to play co-op.  Anyways, I&apos;ve got to go back to slaughtering genestealers.  Hope this helped!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3426367">Expand</a></span>

It is a 10 for me because it is exactly the game I wanted and expected. I love the board game, and I love this version of the board game.
<br>
<br>Anyone who expected something different has only themselves to blame. It was clear from the very start that this was a board game conversion. Adding any other video-gamey bells and whistles would have just detracted from the simple, tense, claustrophobic elegance of the board game mechanics. Persistent character development between missions? Weapon  load out customisation? Please! How would that even work? Each &quot;level&quot; in the game is designed and balanced to be tackled with the squad configuration they give you at the start. The pre-set squad load out, the spawn points and numbers of genestealers, the positioning of the objectives, they are all finely balanced for a tense barely-made-it experience. Buffing your marines and swapping load outs between missions would completely wreck the entire balance of the game! To compensate for that, the developers would need to develop and build in other systems, changing genestealer behaviour  abilities to react to your increasing marine stats. And pretty soon after that, you&apos;ve no longer got a board-game conversion, which is what this is meant to be.
<br>
<br>Seriously, complaining about a lack of RPG elements  character progression in this game is the same as complaining that the digital version of Carcassonne isn&apos;t more like Civilization!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3426668">Expand</a></span>

It is somewhat of an enigma and contradiction; a game that on one hand should have gone further to bring Space Hulk to a new audience, but at the same time has missed opportunities to capture the spirit of the original game.
<br>
<br>From the offset it is clear that this is an attempt to recreate the original board game as accurately as possible. From the missions being exact copies of those found in the board game, to the &quot;normal&quot; difficulty being described simply as &quot;Like the board game&quot;, no changes have been made to the core underlying rules. There is the option to play in Easy or Hard mode, although being able to individually set custom rules would have been a nice addition.
<br>
<br>The first major problem that arises in Space Hulk is the speed at which your Terminators move. They lumber very slowly from square to square and turn corners with the finesse of a dump truck. Granted, they may move like this &#x201C;realistically&#x201D; due to their bulky armour and the cramped rigid confines of the Space Hulk, but in gameplay terms the inability to skip or speed-up movement is unforgivable. In the beginning you put up with it, but as the game progresses and you play larger and longer maps, it becomes increasingly frustrating.
<br>
<br>The second thing that struck me is just how much you can abuse having Terminators on Overwatch. Overwatch allows your Terminators to attack any enemy in line of sight during the Genestealers turn. If you have two Terminators on Overwatch covering the same corridor, and you save some Action Points in reserve to counter your weapon jamming, there is practically no chance of Genestealers getting anywhere near your squad. Most missions can be broken down into finding a choke point and using this tactic, and it seems to be actively encouraged, if not the only available tactic to the Space Marine player.
<br>
<br>And while this is one mechanic that can be argued is abusable in the board game too, there is another that is related only to the digital game; the Undo button. Moving your Terminators can be quite a clumsy ordeal, so the Undo button is essential in this situation, and at times a game saver when you mess up accidentally. But unbelievably you can Undo your attacks on the enemy until you get the dice roll you require to kill them! While most gamers would avoid doing this, it&apos;s still something overlooked by the developers and demonstrates the overall unpolished nature of the game.
<br>
<br>The graphics are basic, uninspiring and at times very unclear; you often need to bring up the strategic map to keep track of your squad, and I often mistook a doorway for an open archway or vice-versa. While sub-par graphics can usually be forgiven in a turn based strategy game, Space Hulk suffers from quite severe slowdown when there are a lot of models on screen and surprisingly long load times, which doesn&apos;t make sense given the lacklustre graphics. The &quot;armour cam&quot; is a nice touch, that manages to capture the claustrophobic conditions of the Space Hulk and injects a dose of &quot;Aliens&quot; into proceedings, but has no gameplay benefit, including being of no help when trying to estimate line of sight, which can be troublesome. Animation is awful at times, to the point where I wish they had actually recreated the game fully, even down to unanimated miniatures and tokens.

<br>The sound is extremely repetitive, particularly when your Terminators plough through dozens of Genestealers while on Overwatch. There is no music in-game music, other than atmospherics. The only positive here is the fantastic mission briefing and sparse in-game voice over.
<br>
<br>As you become more efficient at finding Overwatch choke points, you will find more and more that your biggest nemesis won&apos;t be the Genestealer&apos;s tactics, but rather yourself! Forgetting to Overwatch, forgetting to use a Terminator or left over Action Points will become your biggest downfall. A simple way of checking if you have used all your points and keeping track of Terminators yet to move before you press End Turn would have been very welcomed.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for a truly faithful copy of the board game in digital form, you won&apos;t be disappointed. It suffers from poor graphics and audio, a painfully slow pace, and riddled with bugs and oversights. In all honesty, Space Hulk in any of it&apos;s forms is not a terribly deep strategy game. The board game is enjoyable for reasons beyond the gameplay mechanics that have been digitised so accurately, and unfortunately this digital recreation can&apos;t capture the feeling of sitting down with a friend, some beer, and a handful of dice!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3465746">Expand</a></span>

But the production values are a little low in some places. Some animations really could be better, and so on. Of course the biggest deciding factor for most will be the price point. At 30 dollars it&apos;s a bit steep if you are not a Space Hulk fan already. I find it a little difficult to recommend at that price. But do not believe those saying it&apos;s a buggy unplayable game or not worth getting at all. I have played it just fine for hours, and I believe it&apos;s worth it for SH fans an probably worth it on sale for anyone else that&apos;s likes turn based squad tactics games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3429525">Expand</a></span>

<br>- there are bugs and bugs and bugs and bugs sound bugs  graphics bugs, achievement bugs, ui bugs, crashes, menu bugs, poor spelling and grammar, mission bugs hell I once started a mission and found that I was playing as the genestealers as well as the marines! WTF??
<br>- maybe they will fix the bugs but they haven&#x2019;t even kept their own website up to date
<br>- there isn&#x2019;t really much content just about 12 campaign missions
<br>- the customisation options are tiny (basically it&#x2019;s just a banner you can change a bit), you can&#x2019;t even edit the loadouts of the individual marines or what guns they carry
<br>- there is no continuity between missions, nothing to make you attached to individual marines and therefore no sense of risk or loss (if a marine dies, the same guy will be in the next mission).
<br>
<br>In all the game is very cheap, feels rushed and incomplete, it doesn&#x2019;t work properly and doesn&#x2019;t offer much depth or content. It is quite fun however.
<br>
<br>Buuuut, the fact they have sold, what would be a decent little $10/&#xA3;5 title with scope for improvement, for &#xA3;23 as a full priced game release is nothing short of a disgrace. It makes sense now why there were no previews allowed, no let&#x2019;s plays or developer&#x2019;s diary. They knew what they were doing.
<br>
<br>I hope they continue to support and improve the game and that it becomes a really nice title over the next year or two but, like I said, they haven&#x2019;t updated their own website or bug tested their own game, so what are the chances of that?
<br>
<br>When you can pick up so many amazing games these days for around the &#xA3;10 mark it really is criminal that they&#x2019;ve done this. There just isn&apos;t really much there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3429355">Expand</a></span>

<br>Certainly not enough to explain the steep price. Badly optimised, graphics are so-so, AI is quite sound, gameplay is what you&apos;d expect from the boardgame and nothing more. Controls are a bit iffy, no option to speed up animations is a very odd choice. Cinematics, voiceovers and the game&apos;s atmosphere all seem bland. Overall has a very rushed, unfinished feel ...just  a wasted opportunity.
<br>
<br>Until they implement additional features, optimize the performance I&apos;ll call this a blantant money grab. Even after the glaring issues are fixed, making it just a decent game, there&apos;s still the heavily lacking atmosphere and missed art direction that probably can&apos;t be fixed.
<br>
<br>Ironically Games Workshop denied giving licence to Teardown software whose Alien Assault game (originally intended as a Space Hulk implementation) had basically the same gameplay, the right atmosphere, soundscape, additional features like character progression and all of that in easy to read 2D.
<br>
<br>Wasted. Opportunity. Do not buy until they patch it somewhat at least.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3429154">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What i&#xB4;m missing most is the lack of a good story (also the cut scenes... so far only one at the beginning, which is quite good and makes me want for more) as well as a customization option for your marines, most especially for their weapons.
<br>
<br>So it&#xB4;s just a series of missions, which are quite interesting and the multiplayer option.
<br>So, there is much done well, but also some things which leave quite a gap to improve.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427652">Expand</a></span>

However, if you want a strategic, board game styled game set in the Warhammer 40k universe than you may want to think about picking this one up.
<br>
<br>Pros: The game has a highly strategic element to it. Especially in the multiplayer games. Also, the multiplayer games are designed so that you can play your turn, leave the game and come back later once your opponent has moved; perfect if you have a laggy internet connection. The game is simple enough that even a new player to the Space Hulk series will be able to pick it up. The HUD is fairly straight forward and easy to understand and the tutorial is efficient and thorough.
<br>
<br>Cons: The $30 price tag is a bit much considering how little content is really in this game. A lot of the bells and whistles that have come from the 40k franchise in the past have spoiled a lot of us and thus this game seems rather lacking in the customization and personalization department. The campaign is short and there are still quite a few bugs.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: It may be best to wait until this game goes on sale or more content is added. However, if you are a hardcore fan of Space Hulk than you should definitely check this game out. The graphics are a bit on the low side but since this is from a smaller dev it isn&apos;t such a big deal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3429724">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are mediocre, the sound is just about passable, animations are plain bad and the overall experience is nowhere near where it should be. To top it all off, this is a game that costs the same as Borderlands 2... You do the math. A careful &quot;Avoid for now&quot; verdict, hope that somewhere along the line a serious overhaul will patch it up, optimize it and add some more game to it.

<br>Verdict:
<br>Solid turn based game in it&apos;s price range, that holds great potential to become a classic (10/10 points) if

<br>(a week after launch) it will most likely attract only WH40k fans and few strategy gamers.

<br>The Full Control guys released 3 patches in 2 days addressing all the important bugs and I&apos;m pretty sure (reading through FAQ) that they&apos;ll enrich the game with more content like missions, skins, editor, some of them for free... then it can easily be 10/10 for me

If you&apos;re not a fan of War 40k, then you might want to wait a bit, or take the risk of falling in love with War 40k. The game at the moment seems to be victim of the common &quot;released too early&quot; problem. However, the devs seem to be doing well with fixing the stuff and working well with the community. There are no game breaking problems--you can play the game well enough. There is a glaring issue with multiplayer though: When joining a pool you get put against offline opponents for some reason. The gameplay is pretty fun if you like turn-based games. Voice acting is good. Lots of little bugs, some possibly gameplay bugs that would be really lame in multiplayer. Really, this game should be charging $15 USD, but I think the Games Workshop licence (for War 40k) is what is really pumping up the price unjustly. I love War 40k games so I pre-ordered this, and I don&apos;t regret it, although the price did hurt a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3446843">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you were not a fan of the board game, you may not be 100% on board with the stripped-down feel, but it is all in the interests of keeping the action moving. I am hoping to see something along the lines of more campaign missions, hopefully with either an armor paint editor or with other chapters of space marines.

                                        <span>Space Hulk is a really intense tactical board game in a computer game form. Thus it is a slow turn based game, if you are expecting something else you will be disappointed! I think the game captures the warhammer 40k &quot;feel&quot; very well and during the missions the player has to make some hard decisions and the roll of the &quot;dice&quot; adds the element of suspension. All in all, good job Full Control!</span>

<br>For a guy like me, who only played the original Space Hulk (1st Edition), the small rule changes between the 1st and the 3rd are really easy to grasp, making the life of the Terminators a bit easier...
<br>
<br>Now add to that a look and feel like Xcom: Enemy unknown (seeing how it cost to go on the clicked spot, Close Camera on a kill, etc...) and add to that the claustrophobic feeling of corridors and you get a game that is quite a blast to play, even if you have the board game...
<br>
<br>Plus, they added nice touches, like when you reload you Assault Cannon second ammo clip, you see that it now have a red glow at the end of the barrel, making easy to see just by looking at the AC Terminator if you&apos;re using the first or second 10 ammo clip...
<br>
<br>Of course, nothing is perfect. I saw a bug in the menu (a display that don&apos;t want to go)... Also, it is sometimes difficult to figure how many tiles are between your Terminators and the Genestealers, especially when the corridor is really dark (A button that highlight all the tiles would be useful)...
<br>Nothing future patches couldn&apos;t handle, I bet...
<br>
<br>Also, I wish I could play the Genestealers versus an AI Terminators...
<br>
<br>So, Space Hulk is really the board game, as promised, with cool graphics only a computer can give and without the need to paint the units... </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3425914">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It was a hyperbolic sci-fi  action movie love letter born from a decade of: Western excess, steroids, cold war paranoia, Muscle and Fitness magazine, and nihilism.
<br>
<br>It was also the logical extension of the 40k milieu in light of the success of the movies: The Terminator 1984, Commando 1985, Aliens in 1986, and Predator in 1987.
<br>
<br>The WH40k universe is one of eternal war where the Emperor&apos;s finest are cloned from a refined Schwarzenegger  Stallone-esque genetic stock.
<br>
<br>These are men of few words of their own, preferring the recitation of rote memorized imperial aphorisms when the immediate extermination of  their foes is not demanded and even sometimes when it is...
<br>
<br>Humanity of the 41st century has perfected warfare.
<br>
<br>The calibers and rates of fire of 40k weaponry have long since passed the concept of ridiculous, but thankfully the weapons&apos; destructive capabilities are also equally absurd; so the frequent weapon jams brought about by the high rates of fire are typically mitigated by the devastation wrought by successful blasts.
<br>
<br>Space Hulk introduced the 40k universe to a new apex predator, replacing one&apos;s fellow man, in the form of the genestealers (themselves one of the lowest rungs of a larger predatory species) which have been discovered proliferating various abandoned agglomerations of the warp.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, these new creatures also prove capable of wreaking havoc on even the space marines&apos; rarefied terminator units.
<br>
<br>In spite of this fact, they are still humanity&apos;s best hope against these creatures.
<br>
<br>It is up to the terminators to both purge the evil from the claustraphobic confines of these hulks while also recovering lost imperial artifacts.
<br>
<br>So what does all of that have to do with this adaptation of the board game?
<br>
<br>Everything.
<br>
<br>The most common criticism I&apos;ve seen in these reviews has related to feeling frail while looking badass.
<br>
<br>Yes, terminator armor and weaponry is upper tier 40k gear.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, humanity&apos;s best weaponry is not yet prepared for the horrors of a Lovecraftian (genestealer populated) universe.
<br>
<br>I feel like Full Control have captured portions of the 40k grim/gothic visual aesthetic quite well, but even with the occasional ambient creaking noises, the surrounding atmosphere is disappointingly quiet.
<br>
<br>It would be nice to hear a hissing noise emanating from any of the multitudinous steam vents, or even a rattle or growl from a genestealer outside of their animated sequences.
<br>
<br>The animations themselves are both sparse and and loose. Units frequently blast toward nothing in particular while recording hits.
<br>
<br>While I commend FC for their adherence to the original board game&apos;s mechanics, this is not their first game, and that level of break in adaptation is inexcusable in a game asking $30.
<br>
<br>Games Workshop&apos;s intellectual property has traditionally demanded a premium price, but it does not excuse FC&apos;s neglect of polish given their asking price.
<br>
<br>Fortunately, I have hope that the 40k modding community can burnish this effort because the larger engine does seem solid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3428124">Expand</a></span>

The game is not perfect but it is my no means a 6.3 score as it is now. The developers have been fixing bugs since release and have now patched it 4(!!) times so there is good support and they are also planning more content which admittedly the game is currently a little light on.! This game deserves a chance if your a fan of WH40k or the space hulk boardgame. Im giving it a 10 because regardless of its flaws it deserves at least a 7.5 or 8 overall!
<br>Ignore the people talking about 2 hr campaigns etc they obviously havent actually played the game,or played it on easy which is pointless. And anyone who thinks the game isnt fun because it is basically the board game  why did u buy a game of a board game then? it says it in the description of the game
<br>
<br>&apos;The game is a 3D digital turn based strategy game that recreates the classic claustrophobic board game experience in both singleplayer and multiplayer.&apos;
<br>
<br>its like me buying animal crossing and complaining theres no FPS action!
<br>
<br>This game is seriously under-rated IMO!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3437466">Expand</a></span>

Seeing this on for sale I just had to get it for what I thought would just be purely sentimental value. However, the development team have really done a great job on the whole thing. Sticking true to a majority of the rules from the original and also adding new ones from other versions. They have been quick to fix bugs and glitches, and with the new campaign and another on the way I&apos;m excited to see where this game goes. I understand if you&apos;re new to Space Hulk then the fundamentals of this game are hard to grasp and may leave you feeling confused. It&apos;s tactics, it&apos;s randomness, it&apos;s taking risks and it&apos;s aliens in abandoned space ships. Been playing since launch and I&apos;m still excited. Made a few friends on the online mod so there&apos;s always some games to be played on my weekends or after work. If you want Warhammer 40k with an element of the tabletop or you want a game that you don&apos;t feel pressured to play then this is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3760797">Expand</a></span>

<br>Full Control Studios don&apos;t add anything to gameplay, and they fail miserably at coining the atmosphere of exploring a WH40 space hulk. Welcome to glossy coloured warhammer, where space marines spend their spare time polishing and waxing each others helmet, and the genestealers are polite enough not to leave any clawmarks or scratches anywhere, instead making sure to keep the dust from collecting in the hallways. No wonder they are attacking those humans, as their helmets obviously aren&apos;t clean enough and they have to chase them away to keep their beloved hallways dirt-free.
<br>They&apos;ve priced this at 30 euro, where 3 euro would be appropriate. Don&apos;t buy this game, FCS does not deserve your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427507">Expand</a></span>

<br>The sound bugs out constantly. and by constantly I mean all the friggin&apos; time. The atmosphere is good, but the weapon sounds and effects are so...underwhelming.
<br>
<br>Combat is super simplistic, roll lower you die, roll higher you don&apos;t. that&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>It is rather nice to have a classic board game made into a modern video game but it was just done so sloppily. Some things were done awesome like the first person camera in the corner and such. It&apos;s as if they had all these great ideas but couldn&apos;t execute it properly
<br>
<br>I&apos;m such a huge 40k fan, and it really breaks my heart to have to give this game a 4/10. I really wanted to love it, but it seems it needed more time and backing to really be something great. Looks like the dream WH40K/XCOM game I&apos;m waiting for will have to wait.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427128">Expand</a></span>

<br>It does not run smoothly in any sense, which there is no reason for. The graphics are ok, but not impressive, and the game is simple enough for any PC to handle. It shouldnt feel this clunky!
<br>
<br>The games does not give you the feeling of being a terminator marine. The units move so slowly, and are so unwieldy, that you feel like you are a 2 tons Elephant trying to stack eggs while rollerskating. Everything kills you with one hit, so why do you need the armour? I know this is a port of the board game, but the way the marines move should reflect that they are fine tuned killing machines. Not oversized cans of Soup staggering down a hallway.
<br>
<br>I actually like the gameplay, it&apos;s tactical and fun, but I can&apos;t take playing more the 10-20 minutes at a time, I just get too frustrated with the pace of the game. Your own units and the enemy move so slow, that everytime you push a button, time stops and years go by while you wait for one of your units to move 3 spaces.
<br>
<br>The AI needs to be improved aswell, the games is supposed to be really hard, but the AI keeps running directly at your guns even though there are alternative routes, that would make you spend valuable movement points on covering several flanks at once. But mostly the AI just picks the one closest to you and throws everything at you in an attempt to overwhelm you. If your unlucky the AI will succede, but a Little more cunning would spice up the gameplay.
<br>
<br>I also agree that eventhough the original board game didn&apos;t have RPG elements like character progression and loadout custimization, this game would benifit greatly from some of those elements.
<br>The core gameplay is fun, but there is alot that could be done to give an extra edge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3428560">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;d rate this a 6 out of 10 for now. Mostly because of  bugs that needs to be fixed and Full Control are already on it(Awesome much? Most companies would take a week before even trying a fix).
<br>
<br>Then the Level Editor and Co-Op mode will follow, and then I will re-evaluate my scoring.</span>

<br>They really need to improve the online matchmaking and game browser though. It&apos;s a pain in the ass to get matched with opponents that are online.</span>

Given how much PC&apos;s have moved on you would have expected something a little more polished than this, very disappointing, slow and clunky and considering the &#xA3;20 price tag expected much more! Made it through the first few missions but can&apos;t be bothered with it any more.</span>

It&apos;s not a 1:1 conversion as some things have been automated to ensure smoother pacing, but it&apos;s pretty damn close. Production value isn&apos;t AAA but for the budget price you get at the very MINIMUM 10 hours of glorious man vs alien battle just from the single player portion alone. And that&apos;s if you play like an android and never fail a mission, which is easier said than done. FullControl was the right developer to deliver this title, and deliver they did.

<br>With the upcoming map eidtor and cooperative player as free DLC this title is set to make a lasting presence in your games library.

<br>Every gamer can instantly think of a dozen ways to expand the gameplay with features like a character progression, model customization or a genestealer mode. The gameplay right now is just binary and feels like an animated version of minesweeper.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a die-hard fan of the board game, you&apos;ll probably like it. If not, i would strongly suggest playing X-Com instead  even the first two classic x-com games will give more entertainment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3426449">Expand</a></span>

Although not a bad looking game, the mechanics and movement of it are extremely clunky and slow. By that I mean with the marines so large and the hallways so narrow, it pretty much means place 1 marine (and you can only fit one marine per hallway) and just over watch the enemies as they stupidly run into your narrow hallway one by one. Although I love the tension and ambient dark feel of the game, first person camera view HUD, almost all of that is shot out the window based on poorly designed maps and bad AI, After killing the same umpteenth Genestealer and getting another zoom in, you&apos;ll begin to understand why all the blood brothers killed themselves out of boredom. I see the care put into this game graphically but also the laziness on the mechanics.

I can say without a doubt, that I am disappointed with this game. Keep in mind that, while I love the video games, I have never touched the board game, but Steam sells this as &apos;Indie Strategy&apos; not &apos;Converted Boardgame&apos;. The game isn&apos;t nearly as pretty as Space Marine (from 2011), is clunky with the controls (though to be fair, there is an &apos;undo&apos; option for when you walk a space too far, or facing the wrong direction) and the random number generator for hitting targets leaves a lot to be desired.
<br>
<br>The campaign is short enough that you can power through it in less than 4 hours, meaning unless you replay it, or wait on DLC, you&apos;re paying $7.50-$15 an hour for this game. It may just be my opinion, but a franchise as successful as Warhammer 40,000 ought to back better games than this. Marvel Comics isn&apos;t going to stamp their name on an indie game, nor would Star Wars, Warcraft, etc. I know Warhammer isn&apos;t quite as big as those giants, but if it continues producing games like this one, it never will be.
<br>
<br>I suppose, having read other reviews, if you are looking for a virtual copy of the boardgame, this is what you&apos;ve been waiting for, but having seen other similar projects in the works (such as the recently funded Kickstarter campaign for Warmachine: Tactics) and seeing what they are able to do with a tabletop-to-videogame conversion, it just disappoints me further that this game wasn&apos;t better than it is. This game is not worth $30 in my opinion. I feel like I overpaid by about $25. If this is a representation of the boardgame, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be playing the boardgame anytime soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427115">Expand</a></span>

<br>Presentation is shoddy, awful camera angles and animation. Terminators talk as if they were shooting things, even the melee ones. Notice how there are NO melee death animations for the Terminators, only some weird red lines across their chest.
<br>
<br>Although by far the worst aspect is the random nature of the game, invisible dice rolls that have you screaming in rage. Do everything right but you still fail missions because of the roll. Completing the later missions are simply try and retry until you get some lucky rolls.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t bother with this, do one of a few things if you want PC Space Hulk action:
<br>
<br>A) Install that Space Hulk DOW2 mod, or just play on the Judgment of Carrion in the Retri/CR campaigns and pretend.
<br>
<br>B) Get a willing friend and find/steal a copy of the board game and play with them IRL.
<br>
<br>C) Find the original PCgame with the Deathwing Dark Angels or the updated Blood Angels game (both are years old) and play those. Or just watch them on youtube.

Right now I don&apos;t think the game will have a lot of replayability, but that will come with DLC.  Challenging and an all around good time, perhaps it was $10 too high, I think it would have been a steal at $19.99.  </span>

This observation is mostly based on feedback from other players from various channels and through the description given by the developers, because I&apos;ve never played the original boardgame. This, however, does not detract from my overall enjoyment of the game, and because I was well aware of the above fact, that the game IS a boardgame recreation, I was able to temper expectations accordingly, which seems to be a rarity among quite a few of the naysayers I&apos;ve come across.
<br>
<br>The game itself presents a neat and clean interface, although some might find it simplistic. It fits the gameplay elements though, so there is really no need for flashy HUD, as no corresponding game element exists.
<br>The atmosphere is dark and gloomy, supported neatly by the clanks and clonks of the ancient hull as both Genestealers and Terminators traverse the narrow corridors. The sense of claustrophobia, in spite of the open ceiling, is intact and the shoulder-mounted cam is a great way to showcase this point. there are times, however, when playing with a time limit, that the cam feature gets sort of forgotten, as the need to move 10 terminators in 2 mins. takes quite a lot of attention. The sound is bare and appropriate for the setting, enhancing the experience of silent emptiness of a massive derelict spaceship. The voiceacting delivers what is needed, but no more than that, and could perhaps have used some variety.
<br>The graphics presented look good and the animation, while slow to some, is fluid and add to the flavor of the terminator persona, as a lumbering hulk of ammo and armour. Genestealers feel well made, without going over the top, and the skin packs(pre-ordered) adds variety from game to game. Kill animations could use some work, though, as both genestealer and terminator kills look on the cheap side.
<br>
<br>Having never played the boardgame, I actually find the gameplay quite engaging, and it often takes careful planning to position each terminator in order to maximize coverage and reduce the risk of a bolterjam being critical. The AI can be somewhat basic at times, but considering the rules were meant for pvp action, they&apos;ve done a decent job og simulation opposition. I&apos;ve enjoyed myself so far with the singleplayer campaign, and think the trend will continue.
<br>I have yet to tackle the multiplayer due to time restraints, but while reports indicate that the matching algorithm is a hard sale mainly due to asynchronous MP setup(Cross platform), MP games seems to deliver like the single player, only with a human opponent. Some tweak to the rules may need to be updated, as some balancing issues exists, but the rate by which the devs have responded to user feedback(3 patches has already gone live since release), I&apos;m confident thing will get ironed out quickly.
<br>This is an important point to observe, as many games run into issues on release and needs tweaking in order to function optimally. I personally see this as one of the defining strengths of PC-gaming, as the devs can react, if so willing, very fast. It is hard to replica the massive datafeedback of a release in production, no matter how much you try to break game mechanics. Additionally, minor tweaks can cause other issues to arise, and dev feedback suggest this was the case with some early issues with one of the missions being unsolvable. They fixed that within 12 hours, which bring me to the main point of the paragraph. Newly released PC games will have bugs, so it is ultimately how theses issues are handled afterwards, that determines how this should affect ratings.
<br>
<br>Pricing seems to be a major topic within most debates about the game. Ultimately, it comes down to how much you are willing to pay for X hours of entertainment. At present, som have posted varying degrees of playtime, I&apos;ve seen both 60+ hours and 2 hours. 30$ is roughly what it costs for 2 people to see a movie  concessions, which equates to about 1&#xBD; hours of entertainment. Compared to that, 30$ for what can amount to quite a lot of hours, seems rather negligible in my opinion. It is not unlikely, that the recent summer sale, plus the, in my mind, somewhat misplaced indie tag has given a inaccurate impression to a spoiled audience, but the Games Workshop brand is expensive to use, which has bumped the price considerable.
<br>
<br>In short, this a solid adaptation of a boardgame with great gameplay and atmosphere, developed and managed by a team that cares for the future of the game and the franchise. The game had a rough manifestation at launch but the patching speed has negated many of the first look drawbacks, and the promise of free updates with Co-op mode and a map editor has greatly enriched the current game and the future potential as well. Considering the current value of 30$, this game is well worth it&apos;s price, which is actually half the price of a AAA-game.
<br>I highly recommend getting this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3449352">Expand</a></span>

<br>Developers took Unity engine, balanced game system from SH, made about 5 ugly 3d models and textures and now want 30$ for it.
<br>The only selling point of this game is WH40k theme. Without it this game would be completely worthless, and literally nobody will buy it.
<br>So developers are just exploiting fellings of WH40k fans, selling crappy game for a damn high price.
<br>
<br>If you want to play a good copy of Space Hulk on your PC just play any free version of it, like SULK.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427308">Expand</a></span>

Compared to this, XCOM is a way better warhammer game, even though it has nothing to do with warhammer universe at all</span>

I was hoping this would recover some of the wildly exotic compelling feel of the board game with all its subtle tactical opportunity.  I have no got very far into it yet and may never do so. I like relative difficult strategy but this is just linear, limited and tedious.  So far each level seems more like some annoying chore to get through in the hope something better pops up. I keep telling myself &quot;surely, it cant be that crap&quot;.   This is what happens when middle aged men that are just doing the 9 to 5 make a game.  No innovation, lots of limitation and fk all imagination applied.  Hard to make something this bad out of Warhammer but somehow they have done that at least very well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3426278">Expand</a></span>

<br>The biggest problems with the game:
<br>- Performance is absolutely awful even on top of the line PC, and graphics quality absolutely doesn&apos;t justify it.
<br>- Movement animations are so slow it makes you want to scream and/or alt-F4 out of the game  and there&apos;s no way to speed them up or skip them.
<br>- Production value is very low, it&apos;s clearly a low budget indie game and it REALLY shows. This would be ok if price reflected it, but at $30, you can and should expect more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427933">Expand</a></span>

The nature of the game is that the terminators move slowly while their antagonists the genestealers move quickly. This leads to a very deliberate style of gameplay that emphasises strategy over tactics. Personally I love it. I also think that the developers made the right decision by sticking so faithfully to the original.

<br>
<br>There are a lot of negative reviews regarding this game and it&apos;s clear that it&apos;s a divisive game to play but I feel that it is truly a game many Space Hulk fans would enjoy as well as a game that many TBS players would enjoy, however there are some things worth mentioning.
<br>
<br>The game as it stands does lack a bit of polish, there are still the occasional bugs rearing their ugly heads even after the three bug fix patches released by the excellent people at Full Control studios. A number of animations could do with some tidying up such as the fact that gun fire seems to continue on endlessly, or that doors sometimes explode before a terminator has shot at it.
<br>
<br>Still the game itself is an enjoyable romp, in just the same way that the Board Game is, and it&apos;s made better if you play against a friend with VOIP so you can scream and shout at each other to your hearts content, it&apos;s great to finally be able to play with my friends who love the board game just as much as I do across the distances that prevent us from doing so regularly.
<br>
<br>Visually the game looks stunning, it really captures the tight corridors of the hulk with bulky terminators slowly advancing down the halls and endless hordes of agile genestealers chasing, circling and hunting those Space marines down. Some concern has been raised that the animations for the terminators make them too slow but I have never failed to complete my two minute turn thanks to the ability to move multiple models at once and their movement speed perfectly fits the feel of the game and reflects how Terminator armour should be.
<br>
<br>Length-wise the Singleplayer campaign would roughly take an experienced player a good 8 hours against the AI, but the true replayability comes from the Multiplayer which even if you&apos;re playing with a random person if you build up a chat with them then you can have great fun, with some missions taking up to two hours to complete in a multiplayer game.
<br>
<br>There are many options of expanding the replayability of the game in the future, we already know that a level editor is on it&apos;s way and many of the sound files in the briefings will demonstrate this. In addition a co-op campaign and more are on their way as well, but I&apos;d love to see some deviation from the Board game by adding new rules for players to enjoy.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t see how any fan of Space Hulk fan could not enjoy this, for TBS fans tread carefully go in knowing what to expect and you won&apos;t be dissapointed. For fans of 40k this is a great addition to your video game collection but know that you are purchasing a Digital board game.
<br>
<br>I look forward to hearing more about the further development of the game and with some more Polish I truly believe this game could be worthy of a 9.5 or even 10 score. Currently 15 hours played and many more to come!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447623">Expand</a></span>

<br>Like the original Civilisation II or Panzer General the game mechanics has a transparency that makes it a true, transparent, skill game despite the brainless alien enemies. Compared to the sublime remake of the original Classic XCOM the game naturally lacks in complexity and Graphics. However the game is also released at approximately half the price of similar games at release date showing true perspective. A level editor and sharing community and a single campaign is exactly what this game package should contain. A couple more cheap DLC campaigns will be a welcome addition that I will gladly buy.

I have never played the board game, however I played that Space Hulk that was on Amiga (in fact, I still have it somewhere, I&apos;d just need to fire up the emulator), and also played the Win95/98 version, which was called Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels (or something like that). So, I am familiar with the franchise (both W40K, by the way, and Space Hulk). You know what, I dare to say, I love it (still applies to the universe and these games).
<br>
<br>Now, what I wanted to say with that is I may be a bit biased when I state: this is a good game, however I can understand those who got a bit frustrated. Here&apos;s why:
<br>
<br>First, although the graphics are not bad, but not spectacular either  not even when you set it to &quot;Fantastic&quot;. Yep, that&apos;s actually how they named the maximum setting. I am not quite sure if it is a compliment or a complaint, but the only real difference between &quot;Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Fastest&quot; is the frame rate. Oh, yeah, the fires are a bit more &apos;thick&apos; on fastest, and there may be differences if you close the camera in enough, but guys, this is a tactical game, not the annual Space Marine Fashion Show. What? Spit it out already? Oh, yep, I suggest to set &quot;Fastest&quot;, because in fact the fires look more real (to me) on that setting.
<br>
<br>Oh, almost forgot. I mentioned frame rate. Well... I don&apos;t know how the developers managed, but the engine is slow. Not tragically, and in fact I have an old Pentium D, but I get 25-30 fps in Skyrim on almost maximum settings, but this game &apos;treats&apos; my eyes with 7-8 on &quot;Fantastic&quot; and 15-20 on &quot;Fastest&quot;. Pure luck it&apos;s not an action game.
<br>
<br>The sounds are cool and unimpressive at the same time. The voiceover is cool. The rattling of storm bolters is also cool. All the other sounds are forgettable. Not bad, but hey, we kill uber-aliens with uber alien-killing tools, so there should be something remarkable about how the whole thing sounds. The music is... Umm, is music even there? Really, I think there is, but should a genestealer threaten to detach my limbs from my torso if I don&apos;t hum something from it, I&apos;d be dead real quick. For comparison: I still have the music of the Amiga game on my MP3-player.
<br>
<br>But realy, who cares about the graphics and other externalities?   Okay, that was not a real question. But traditionally, strategic/tactical games are not required to be eye candies. Personally I&apos;m content with how this stuff looks. What really matter is how it plays, am I right, or am I right?
<br>
<br>It was said before, but for the records, here it is again: this is a board game on PC (and Mac I think). That means a lot of things. For example, don&apos;t expect X-Com style base and squad management. You fight with what you are given to. There is not even the slightest trace of RPG-style character development. There are no covers to use, and there are no hit points to lose. Your men get hit once, they die. It&apos;s an interesting question that in this case why did they bother to put on those massive armors, but since it&apos;s in the game, it&apos;s in the game. Oh, also even if they die that does not prevent any of them to show up and shuffle around in the next mission.
<br>
<br>That is one thing most of the negative reviewers complained about. Your Terminators move like snails. Okay, it&apos;s inside _my_ tolerance range, and I imagine these armors not to be designed for sprinting, but I admit, they should move (and turn) a bit faster. Other than this I think the pace of the game is okay, although sometimes it starts to think heavily _after_ it finished moving the genestealers around, which is interesting, but it does not happen too often.
<br>
<br>Finally let me tell you about the difficulty (I played on normal). Maybe it&apos;s just me, but the first mission was the most difficult for a long time. You have two terminators, but at least three corridors to cover, and one of them can be just too short. That&apos;s where you learn not to skulk around the corners, because you&apos;ll get chopped to pieces. That means, that basically the difficulty of a map  in my opinion  is based on how long the corridors go uninterrupted. Because if you stand two-three steps from an intersection from where an enemy comes, you are in the hands of your luck. Your men can miss (it&apos;s a board game, it depends entirely on dice rolls, and not even the slightest on range), their weapon can jam, and if there are not enough distance those pesky aliens have to cover before they reach you, you&apos;re dead meat. On the other hand, if there are at least 4-5 squares between you and the spot where your enemy enters your line of sight, and you reserved a few command points, _and_ you did not forget to set your men on Overwatch, you should be super-unlucky to not survive the attack of even a large horde. So, as a hint on the loading screens says: Overwatch! Overwatch! Overwatch!
<br>
<br>Final advice, study the weapons in the Librarium, because the game will explain some of them in the tutorial, but not all...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3469570">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, it would be nice to play as the Genestealers against AI Space Marines, and a few more options to edit the controls would really be welcome. Needing to scroll the camera with the mouse gets really frustrating at times. Aside from that, not a bad game if you can find it on the cheap. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s worth the full price, even being a huge 40K and Space Hulk fan, but it&apos;s pretty great at killing a few hours. Save the full price money for picking up a copy of the actual board game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=4354136">Expand</a></span>

The 1st Edition of Space Hulk was the first wargame I ever played, and remained one of my favourite casual pick-up games throughout my gaming history. I didn&apos;t get to play the 3rd edition rules, but having read a copy, it is obvious that the game is faithful to them. That means, I can multi-player with my distant friends, and barring the beer, inquisitive housecats and heavy metal soundtrack, it&apos;s just like the good ol&apos; days. That gets the game a 10/10 before I start picking away at the bad stuff.
<br>
<br>Criticising the game on the basis of random internet opponents taking too long, or the absence of features that weren&apos;t originally in the rules is fairly pointless, so I&apos;m going to concentrate on the other stuff.
<br>
<br>The game loses a point for the poor graphics up close  hinky animations, low frame rates etc that just aren&apos;t acceptable these days.There&apos;s also plenty of visual bugs, like Terminators shooting off at an angle to the target, or moving units temporarily popping into walls. I play with the kill-cam turned off, yet I still get the odd close-up! I had the audio bug early on, but 1.03 fixed that.
<br>
<br>As an aside, my version of X-com developed an instant-lose bug (ie: start the mission, get dumped straight to the failed mission screen) that killed my Classic Ironman campaign dead about 2/3 of the way through. Loading old saves didn&apos;t fix it, so I un-installed it in disgust. I guess even AAA games can have their off days.
<br>
<br>Minus another point for missed opportunities to improve the atmosphere. The &apos;did you know&apos; loading screens are far too casual; don&apos;t tell us about the history of the computer game, give us some of the wealth of background information that the WH40k universe is famous for. Although experience  unit progression has no part of this game, I&apos;d still like to see the Marine&apos;s names change as casualties are replaced, and for detailed statistics to be kept for each unit, battle honours awarded etc.
<br>
<br>Minus another point for the AI  I&apos;ve caught the AI doing absolutely STUPID things, like not turning a &apos;stealer to face _before_ breaking cover. That gives my Terminator a free overwatch shot, something no human player would ever do. The AI is also quite poor at using the different entry points to full advantage. A mission like &quot;Alarm Call&quot; would play quite differently against a human. Incidentally, that&apos;s the first mission I failed in the campaign, and it wasn&apos;t even due to bad luck, so it&apos;s not all bad.
<br>
<br>That leaves me personally with a pretty solid 7/10, which I think is fair. If you&apos;re playing Hotseat mode, and they haven&apos;t fixed the blip count issue yet, lose another point. If you think the game is overpriced, trim another point off  for me, the nostalgia value offsets the relatively high cost. So maybe a 5/10 overall. Certainly not the 0 point stinker that some people would have you believe.
<br>
<br>If the developers fix the issues and add some more (REASONABLY PRICED) content, this game could mature quite nicely. I for one would like to play through the Deathwing campaign again.
<br>
<br>For all its foibles, sometimes this game just gets it so right. When your Sergeant is fighting a rearguard action in &quot;Alarm Call&quot; and gets cut off from the rest of the squad, holds off 20+ Stealers with overwatch fire, takes down two more in close assault before finally falling  THAT is what Space Hulk is about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3446254">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>People who complain about how slow and cumbersome the turn-based movement is don&apos;t understand a thing about the original game. It is supposed to feel claustrophobic and unwieldy! The great bulky marine uniforms force the marines to plot their assault methodically and carefully in such a confined space. You learn to turn the narrow corridors from a liability into an asset by bottle-necking the genestealers at just the right distances with just the right units.
<br>
<br>I only have two complaints about The game: 1. It is a bit buggy, but it the issues seem to be being addressed and didn&apos;t ruin the game for me. 2. The first-person animated part of the graphics are terrible. I don&apos;t understand why they did such a dated looking sequence for recreating the live action. The top-down turn-based stuff looks fine and voice overs are great. It would almost be better to leave out the first-person sequences if they are left as they are.
<br>
<br>If you like turn based strategy or love the old board game, you will love this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3469239">Expand</a></span>

It is so much less than a direct port of the board game. every little part of this game is lazy. Play is slowed down to a crawl by the slow nature of the game. Rather than building atmosphere it just becomes infuriating. A typical example would be the need to manually go to every marine with spare action points and click overwatch when you are just camping, every single turn, for every marine. A simple check all button would fix this. The terrible production values are evident everywhere from the need to wait until the game is caught up for the end turn button to work, to the terrible and I mean Terrible graphics.
<br>An utter lack of any original thought into this game means no special modes such as playing the Genestealers in the campaign or even a map builder.
<br>This would be an ok release if it were a mere indie release for say &#xA3;5, but it costs the same as any other triple A game! Its like paying &#xA3;30 for candy crush, if candy crush was boring. Its an insult.
<br>Avoid paying for this game at all, even as a special offer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk/user-reviews?user_review_id=3633510">Expand</a></span>

The only thing I liked about it was the little shoulder cam which looked like a shoutout to the old Space Hulk game.
<br>I got bored very quickly after the first few missions. I think this game would be better on a mobile device.</span>
