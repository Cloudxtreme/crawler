This is the best baseball sim on the market.</span>

By GM&apos;ing a team in OOTP X, you gain a realistic insight into how a real life GM makes roster decisions and trades. It is that realistic. Since every detail is covered, you&apos;ll come to understand how arbitration works, the rule 5 draft, waivers, the 40-man roster, player development, drafting, scouting, etc. Definitely a must have if you are a baseball fan. With hundreds of online leagues, you&apos;ll be able to GM a team up against other people, and make trades with real human GM&apos;s.

Get as deep into your created baseball universe as you feel comfortable with.Sometimes I play out each game, sometimes just from the last couple of innings. Sometimes I will sim days or weeks if I think my team can cope without being micro managed. Excellent game....second to none.</span>

If you&apos;re a fan of baseball, and are interested in the idea of managing your own franchise on the greatest scale possible, there&apos;s no substitute for OOTP. Do yourself a favour and try OOTP today. They&apos;re so confident you&apos;ll like it that they&apos;re giving OOTP 8 away for free! That&apos;s a great game and I paid $40 for it 2 years ago! Overall I&apos;d say I&apos;ve put in at least 1000 hours of gameplay into OOTP over the last 6 years.
