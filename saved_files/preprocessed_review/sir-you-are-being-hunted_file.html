<br>
<br>Your entire game, if done with any chance or surviving will be played slowly, stealthily with lots of watching and cunning as you set traps. distractions and occasionally run and gun when it all goes horribly wrong, which in my case at least happens a lot, heh.
<br>
<br>It looks great, has great atmosphere and plenty to see. Gathering the loot is pretty much a survival thing not done for fun and a huge loot chest etc and there is satisfaction at getting one of the robots to step on a trap and beat him senseless whilst he throws threats at you and then loot his stuff.
<br>
<br>If you enjoy patient gaming, slow methodical stealth and those tense moments of hiding behind a bush whilst a 12 foot behemoth walks past you making blood curdling sounds, you may like this. If you enjoy shoot-em-ups, look elsewhere because whilst you can, to a point, play like that it isn&apos;t much fun and often ends in tears.
<br>
<br>The game is not shallow, it just is not aimed for everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sir-you-are-being-hunted/user-reviews?user_review_id=4192159">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game play itself is monotonous. Most of the game involves the player keeping up their &quot;vitality&quot; (hunger) up and searching for parts of the machine that have been scattered about the five islands, all while trying to avoiding detection by the mechanical hunters, who&apos;s origins and original purpose are rather vague.
<br>Robots scaring flocks of birds out of their roosts, attracting the hunters from the sounds of gunfire, or the smoke and light of a campfire when the player cooks game adds to the immersion value, but player interactivity in the game could have been better. Such as the player building a base of operations/safe area, or being able to hunt game instead of finding it inside container objects.
<br>Being able to hide inside objects would have been a nice touch too. (after all, if Solid Snake could hide in a cardboard box, why can&apos;t the player of this game hide inside a building, post office drop box, phone booth or even in a man hole cover until the danger passes?)
<br>The numerous buildings/homes around the islands are more like large containers, only searchable by accessing the doors and can not be actually entered which would have added to the exploration factor and immersion.
<br>Saving can only be done at &quot;The Circle Stones&quot; or at one of the boats that transport  the player between islands, providing more of an annoyance than a challenge.
<br>Overall a &quot;Sir You Are Being Hunted&quot; is worth at most playing through a few times, but replay value is ultimately low on the scale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sir-you-are-being-hunted/user-reviews?user_review_id=4186888">Expand</a></span>

Robot-Dogs, Robot-Horsemen, Robot Scarecrows and and and, you can pretty much tell this game is filled with Killing-Machines which are british, adding even more horror.
<br>
<br>That means that it would be smart to play a little bit - well - patient. You have to think about even think you do or you&apos;ll die in a few seconds. You can&apos;t rush in there and go full Rhambo, even if you find a weapon, which you won&apos;t find easily at your first try.
<br>
<br>The graphics aren&apos;t the fanciest, but it still has it&apos;s charm and a great atmosphere.
<br>
<br>And who doesnt want a british robot to step in your beartrap and then be able to beat him up with an axe?
<br>
<br>Probably my GOTY, but this game really isnt aimed for everyone.
<br>If you enjoy patient gaming, and those tense moments when there are 5 robots arround you while you are in a &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;ing bush with only 8 bullets in your revolver, then this game is 100% something for you.
<br>
<br>Probably a ten outta ten for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sir-you-are-being-hunted/user-reviews?user_review_id=4213012">Expand</a></span>

The concept is so awesome; you&apos;re on an unnamed archipelago being hunted by British steampunk robots. You have to hide, find the pieces of a mysterious device that can somehow save you, and of course, survive. The procedurally generated open-world environments are just icing on the cake.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, despite being full of great ideas, the execution is mediocre. The difficulty curve suffers from the open world and heavy randomization, resulting in a game that fluctuates between insultingly easy and unfairly difficult with very few satisfying challenges. Additionally, the repetitive nature of the gameplay makes much of the randomization essentially meaningless, and once you figure out how to use a handful of simple strategies it becomes disappointingly easy.  This, combined with an incredibly unsatisfying end, results in a game that feels extremely unpolished.
<br>
<br>There is one thing, however, that managed to impress me immensely: the atmosphere. I recommend playing with the music off, to fully appreciate the ambiance. The environments feel organic and believable, and the overall experience manages to be very immersive. Although it may not seem like much of a horror game at first, it can be terrifying at times.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth a look despite it&apos;s flaws. Don&apos;t get your hopes up too high, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sir-you-are-being-hunted/user-reviews?user_review_id=5082531">Expand</a></span>

<br>You are never safe in this game and you just can&apos;t camp in a place since you have to constantly scavenge for food and other stuff in the world.
<br>The good: It does really keep you in the edge, needing your stealth skills in order to survive and evade the robots, it requires strategy and follow your surrounding well.
<br>The bad: The shooting is ridiculous, it is really hard to sometimes hit the robots and they can sometimes be seriously overpowered being everywhere, if you don&apos;t have a gun you either get one or you quickly die.
<br>
<br>The game is honestly for those who like to experience suspense and who have good patience since you really have to hide a lot and you WILL die a lot too.

In the past I made it clear how disappointed I was with how the game was turning out, and now I&apos;d like to step back and review the game, the developers, and the history of both in their entirety.
<br>
<br>The game taken completely by itself, with no consideration of the developers or the Alpha development phase, I feel is a decent but flawed stealth shooter. There&apos;s some fun to be had in sneaking around in the tall grass, but nearly every other aspect of the game has something wrong with it.
<br>
<br>Exploring is flawed in that there are far too many &quot;dead zones&quot; with nothing interactive in them.
<br>
<br>Looting is flawed in that nearly all loot is gotten from largely non-interactive buildings, as enemies rarely have valuable things to offer when defeated. This is also a flaw of combat, since the lack of valuable items means there is very little reward for winning a gunfight.
<br>
<br>Combat is also not exceptionally fun because it doesn&apos;t have much gravity. Bleeding can be cured with a single button, health regenerates, and most enemies are weak and easily evaded or defeated.
<br>
<br>Music doesn&apos;t appear to play a large role in the game. I recall hearing an opening theme, which was interesting, but not memorable.
<br>
<br>Graphically, the game has a lot of heart, which I appreciate, but at the same time it&apos;s got a very dated, rushed look. Most objects have bland, flat textures and barely react graphically to light. Even the guns looks like they&apos;re made of matte plastic, not wood and steel.
<br>
<br>The rushed look is present in other elements of the game as well, such as the user interface, which lacks key features like a quick option to discard something (there&apos;s no discard button, there&apos;s no dragging the item off the inventory screen, there&apos;s no icon to drag over, just a context menu opened with M2) or the ability to stack similar items (bullets cannot be stacked once separated, be careful with your rifle ammo).
<br>
<br>Animations look sped up and choppy, though this may be on purpose for the robots. There are no reload animations, instead the character lowers his guns offscreen and reload sounds are played.
<br>
<br>And finally, the AI is not exceptionally good at tracking you. Even the searchlight, which can see you even when you&apos;re perfectly hidden, will forget where you are if you&apos;re near a building.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth a play if you could pick it up on sale, but it&apos;s certainly not worth $20, not for this level of roughness around the edges.
<br>
<br>Now, taking into consideration this game had an alpha stage in which quite a bit of money was raised for its complete development, and that there are multiple developers who have had years to fine-tune and polish the game, the overall image becomes considerably less positive. Instead of appearing to be due to time delays or personal problems, the lacking aspects appear to be due to developer inexperience or possibly even laziness.
<br>
<br>It has been made clear to me that the developers are a team of ten or so people with decent but not exceptional talent in making games. It has also been made clear that funding was a large concern for them during development. However, a similarly sized team with inconsistent funding and only two experienced game designers was responsible for the creation of GoldenEye 64, which was lauded as one of the greatest first-person shooter games of all time and maintains that status even now. If a team with similar resources and worse technology can make something so memorable, the only thing keeping the developers of SYABH from doing the same is the developers themselves.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s an unpleasant but well-known fact that game developers who are paid for their work ahead of time can be known to cut corners or even abandon projects at a whim. KickStarter and IndieGogo are rife with such half-finished and abandoned projects. This game, while at the very least playable and somewhat enjoyable, is certainly not finished, and definitely should not have been released from alpha in its current state.
<br>
<br>And this doesn&apos;t even take into account the fact that many of the lacking features were requested by the community, but outright ignored by the developers during the alpha phase. One of the most requested features was interactive buildings, even something as simple as a 3d door that opened when interacted with. All of these were labeled &quot;too difficult to implement&quot; by the developers and ignored.
<br>
<br>I bought this game when it was on sale during its alpha phase and followed the development for quite some time before it became apparent to me that these developers were not going to produce a finished game. It appears instead they&apos;ve opted to produce the bare minimum according to their own standards and not the community&apos;s. I&apos;ll say again, this game has heart, but it just doesn&apos;t have enough life in it currently for me to recommend it
<br>
<br>And unfortunately, it looks like it never will.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sir-you-are-being-hunted/user-reviews?user_review_id=3881499">Expand</a></span>

I love the unique story and theme too it. Though it gets repetitive after a couple hours of playing, with future updates it will surely be an even greater from what it is already.</span>

The robots are quite good and some  tweaking should be allowed to set the difficulty but apart from that it is a really nice game and I am curious what the final release will be like!</span>

AI is great in this game and the robots make &apos;&apos;funny jokes&apos;&apos; like when they see you they say &apos;&apos;Do you want something?&apos;&apos; and start shooting and laughing. (or something like that) Graphics are bad but it&apos;s ok. Also the fact that the robots get smarter and stronger when you collect fragments is really cool.</span>

<br>The graphics, sounds, premise, and idea behind SYABH are all top notch, but the gameplay itself is simply lacking in every way and makes the overall experience an exercise in frustration, tedium, and futility. It&apos;s a great looking concept that quickly proves itself a terrible game.
<br>
<br>First, the entire concept of procedurally generated survival stealth is backwards and counter-intuitive in SYABH because exploring bland and unpopulated random landscapes simply isn&apos;t interesting when there&apos;s nothing else to do. Movement is agonizingly slow. You can&apos;t build, you can&apos;t craft, you can&apos;t make a base, you can&apos;t carry many supplies, most supplies are worthless junk that serves no purpose, and as many others have mentioned the lack of &apos;save anywhere&apos; forces you to stick to the well-traveled path and not stray too far. Again, counter-intuitive for a game that claims to focus on ambience and exploration. The robots are not scary and they aren&apos;t even dangerous unless you mod the game to make it harder. Except for making a fire to cook the odd animal carcass I literally can&apos;t think of anything else to do in this game outside of the main &quot;collect objects and return them&quot; quest except avoid robots, ambush robots, or distract robots, and these things are interesting for exactly 10 minutes.
<br>
<br>After only 10 minutes I was excited with the atmosphere and the potential of the game. After only 30 minutes I was absolutely bored to tears and on the verge of uninstalling the game. After researching online and figuring out that, no, there really is nothing else to do in the game except run around and avoid the dumb-as-bricks random robots while mule-packing the stupid monument pieces from all over the map, I did uninstall.
<br>I can&apos;t believe any praise this game receives for it&apos;s gameplay -- it certainly did not come from gamers. It looks great in videos and screenshots, but looking at them is literally more fun than playing the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sir-you-are-being-hunted/user-reviews?user_review_id=6345301">Expand</a></span>

It does not deserve all these negative reviews. It creates an awesome, tense atmosphere (although the enemies themselves are not that scary), and is a good survival game as there is constant need for food, but it is only available in places that your hunters are likely to be. Also, cooking the food poses risks too, as it can attract them. On top of this, there are search balloons scanning the area, trying to find you. This means that you are always in a constant struggle to complete your objective and stay alive (and hidden?) doing so. You also have the choice of fighting, running or hiding, which lets you play differently depending on your inventory, health and position. In the latest update, you can choose to generate the world differently, potentially making the game easier or harder, depending on your taste. Overall, the game has great gameplay, and lots of replay value. So far, there are still updates every month or so. The British style is pretty unique and funny. Also, the robots get stronger and smarter as you progress, so they wont be as simple as they first appear once you have spent some time on a save.
<br>However, it is far from the &quot;perfect&quot; game. As overs have said, luck can drastically change the difficulty of the game, and generations of the environment and items do not seem very balanced. You could start off with a weapon and then on your next playthrough, a rock and some rags. However, you could argue that this just further increases replay value because you don&apos;t know what to expect.  It is definitely not everyone&apos;s &quot;cup of tea&quot;, but if you like survival games I would give it a try. I have only recently purchased it, but it definitely not as bad as the reviews from a few months ago (when it was an ALPHA!!) say it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sir-you-are-being-hunted/user-reviews?user_review_id=4233711">Expand</a></span>
