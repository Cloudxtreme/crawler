Sure the game design feels a bit outdating and the &quot;voice over&quot; as well (if u can call that voice) but i think there were no other intention from playtonic than create a game like banjo and it sure is like a 3rd game of banjo.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">If you loved banjo back in 1998 you&apos;ll love yooka laylee. its like a retro game with prettier graphics.

<br>
<br>the soundtrack from david wise, grant kirkhope and steve burk is top notch though.
<br>
<br>i love it.
<br>
<br>ps
<br>i&apos;d give a 9/10 but since there are idiots who can&apos;t give a realisitc view/ rating of the game i&apos;ll make it 10.
<br>
<br>ratings under 6 or even 5/10 are ridicoulus. i mean come on, did you even play the game?
<br>if so: what did you expect? it was clearly advertised as a spiritual sucessor to banjo first time they put their kickstarter site online</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7217267">Expand</a></span>

The camera is some what of a problem but I got used to it fast and it never prevented me from enjoying this game.

<br>
<br>If this sounds a bit strange: in summary the studio responsible edited their game and significantly altered it during development in order to convey the team&apos;s political views, according to an official statement made by the creators.  Yet the entire game, in the end, provides virtually no political commentary to speak of, and in fact just plays like an incredibly generic and boring platformer title devoid of any creativity.
<br>
<br>If the creators believed that customers were paying them to make political statements, which is really the only excuse for using a product to make political statements, then what exactly are they trying to sell here, if not a game about politics? I think there&apos;s a unanimous opinion that Yooka-Laylee has no political commentary or suggestions in the game AT ALL, in which case I would safely call this game a failure in every aspect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7217769">Expand</a></span>

The first 5 minutes were great, if you ignore the annoying voice acting... which thankfully can be skipped for the most part... and I wanted to keep playing. Three hours in and I think I&apos;m done. The hub world doesn&apos;t seem cohesive. The expanding of worlds seemed cool at first, and then you just realize it was to pad the content since you have to revisit places you&apos;ve already visited... just give me the whole world at once... maybe let me expand for secrets. Some of the mechanics aren&apos;t well explained. How am I supposed to know I need to click the left stick to aim? That made for some very frustrating puzzles before I learned that. The transformations are crap and you get nothing from doing them... wow a page... yay! It was totally worth walking at 1 ft a minute and losing all my abilities to get it. Rextro sucks, and the games are garbage... it shouldn&apos;t be required for a page. I played world one and got to the first boss... ended up skipping it and looking for world 2... get to world 2 and get to the second boss... end up skipping it. Putting the game down there. The two first bosses of this game are complete garbage... and that sums up the rest of the game. The entire time you&apos;re fighting with the camera. The world&apos;s are big and empty with copy pasted NPCs around to do some mini games... and it just has zero charm. It literally feels like I&apos;m playing a FAN game of banjo kazooie. I can&apos;t play this anymore and will refund it. I feel awful for anyone who backed it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7233599">Expand</a></span>

It looks and runs fantastic, but some small areas of design look a bit iffy.
<br>
<br>Though the aforementioned charm is there, the game still has its lackluster moments. And you can&apos;t help but feel there&apos;s a plethora of ambition and quality that goes unused - as if the game could have have way more going for it. It doesn&apos;t live up to the same &quot;family&quot; of classic Rare games like Banjo-Tooie or Conker&apos;s Bad Fur Day, but Yooka-Laylee is still worth every penny and will leave you burning hours of time. In a good way.
<br>
<br>If this game were to get a sequel, I hope all that unused potential will be spilled in said sequel. As the type of game it is can come off dull and outdated if not spruced up properly. Overall, very fun game. Good work, Playtonic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7226614">Expand</a></span>

Those are some of my favorite games, so much so that I didn&apos;t donate to the Kickstarter because I thought it had diverged from the source too much. Let me tell you that it hasn&apos;t at all. This feels like the game that would&apos;ve following Banjo Tooie on Xbox in 2004 if Rare had decided not to abandon it&apos;s sarcastic animal platformers. Everything feels like a Rare game from that era: the mysterious hubworld, grotesque yet narcissistic villain, teeth-clenching difficulty spikes, gritty industrial areas mixed in with Disney forests, fourth-wall breaking humor etc.
<br>
<br>The graphics definitely aren&apos;t AAA level, but for a 3D indie game, they are nice. There are parts here and there that look pretty low-quality though, effects and models that you would see in a Chinese knock off game. This also goes for the physics. sometimes it feels right and sometimes it feels like Playtonic was borrowing from the Unity asset library. The music is pretty disappointing for a Grant Kirkhope game.
<br>
<br>I think that if you liked or loved the Banjo games, you will enjoy this. This is the Banjo Threeie we will never get, If you don&apos;t like Banjo or any other platformers, then you&apos;ll probably hate this. This is N64 platforming nostalgia distilled, and I understand why not everyone enjoys collectathons. If this game came out following Rare&apos;s move to Xbox I think it would be looked at as grear, but today it looks like a game made at least 10 years ago and plays like a game from 20 years ago. Still, I feel that Yooka-Laylee needed to be made and that people will be playing it far into the future, as they do now with all the other Rare games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7221937">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The worlds are a little more expansive like Tooie but all the original stuff you loved is there. Everything down to the dialogue feels similar, if the game weren&apos;t a different IP completely it would be Banjo-Threey. I haven&apos;t had any camera issues myself, I mean will you have to fight it in a spot or two? Maybe, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve played a 3d platforming game where I didn&apos;t have to fight the camera once or twice, overall it&apos;s a nonissue completely. I can&apos;t even believe I&apos;m actually playing a platformer right now and devoting time to it, but that&apos;s how nostalgic this feels, and I like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7219743">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is a gem in a time where games have gotten worse and worse ad filled with microtransactions. If you like Banjo-Kazooie and games similar to it then you will adore this game. It doesn&apos;t improve the formula in any meaningfully large way but it knows what its strengths are and plays to them time and time again, and for 40 USD its is a must buy if you like the genre.
<br>
<br>The world: Bright and vibrant with modernized, retro style. Both the hub world and the actual levels themselves are jam packed with secrets and things to explore. It took me close to 3 hours before i moved from the first level to the second but I am still missing multiple pagies (the Yooka-Laylee version of puzzle pieces from Banjo) and some of the level powerups. This may sound weird that I didnt finish a level after 3 hours but when I left it the game truly made me want to go back and explore further once I get more of the main duos special abilities.
<br>
<br>The characters: All the characters in this game have a unique personality to them. Yooka is a level headed but smart and Laylee is a jokester and quick to make insults that almost always had me giving it an actual laugh. The only character that seems some work (granted I havent finished the game so this might change) but the main villian is just stale. In fact his main henchman was more charismatic and interesting than the villian himself. But overall the characters are great.
<br>
<br>Music: Grant Kirkhope... what more do I need to say? But seriously the music is incredible. Kirkhope brings his expertise to the game and sets the tone in every area of the map perfectly. For those who dont know, Kirkhope is the same composer that did the Banjo games, Donkey Kong 64, Viva Pinata and much much more.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: Yooka Laylee isnt free of issues (poor camera at times and long cutscenes where you cant speed up the talking) but it is a worthy successor to the Banjo-style games of old. I highly recommend it to everyone especially if you love the genre. Its a game where you can tell the devs actually cared and put alot of their heart and soul into it in a time when that seems Rare (heh)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7217695">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To save you the mind-numbing suspense-building, the short answer is: Yes. It does. But not in the way you might be inclined to assume.
<br>
<br>Yooka-Laylee is more than just a reminder of what is good and bad about 3D platforming, it&apos;s a re-IMAGINING of what it COULD still be, here in this new era of video-games and platforming.
<br>
<br>First, we should discuss what exactly led Yooka-Laylee to be received so negatively. And while the &quot;negative&quot; reviewers&apos; gripes with the game seem to contradict each other (Ie: One of the major negatives for a low-scoring reviewer is a major positive for another), I feel as though I can shed some more reliable light on the issue.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s probably most efficient to first let you know that Yooka-Laylee can be challenging. Frustratingly so. But this is the kind of frustration that exists in a game on purpose. YL has some of the most trustworthy and refined controls and intuitive movement in any 3D-Platformer to date. The game has no short-cuts to fall back on, and if you want to beat some of the trickiest challenges, you need to be swift. Precise. Masterful, to a degree. In many challenges, one quick slip can see you starting the challenge again from the beginning. And to many reviewers, this can easily be excused as &quot;poor game design&quot;. Akin to a 7-year old claiming the game is broken or &quot;cheating&quot;. After all, what high-ranked overwatch player, with 10,000 PS4 trophies and a pretentious Steam library wants to admit they were bested by a &quot;kids&quot; game? Few and far in between, I&apos;d imagine.
<br>
<br>Many more openly angry reviews have stemmed from the fact that their favourite YouTube man was removed from the game. I shouldn&apos;t even need to explain why people are upset about that, and while their discontent for that reason may be somewhat justified, some reviews can be difficult to see as any more of an attempted boycott of PlayTonic Games than anything else.
<br>
<br>With those gripes out of the way, I think I&apos;ll talk about what exactly makes Yooka-Laylee one of the best games of 2017 so far, and also an essential to the gaming scene today. A revival of a genre, in a way.
<br>
<br>It goes without saying, Grant Kirkhope is a musical genius. And while nobody has immunity from criticism, there is none to be given to him and his colleagues in his newest directorship on Yooka-Laylee. The musical approach in Yooka-Laylee takes a step away from the subtle catchiness of Granthope&apos;s past endeavors, and looks to understand a more profound and environmental complexion of a soundtrack. As in previous installments, evironments cause situational music changes (ie: underwater/in a cave/pause menu/in a challenge/etc) but more than that, the progressive nature of each music track is enormously satisfying. Unlike in previous games, Yooka-Laylee&apos;s music is more than a short loop on repeat. Each stage has it&apos;s own 2-5 minute song that subtly flips and switches as you progress. The music maintains it&apos;s catchiness and still feels as satisfiying.
<br>
<br>The art is nothing short of adorable. It captures it&apos;s own identty amidst a genre full of almost stereotypical stage and art designs in a fashion so adorable and so original that it&apos;s nearly impossible to discredit in any way whatsoever.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is what makes Yooka-Laylee a selling-point for this era of video-game....
<br>
<br>ahhhhh **** it, I&apos;m tired. Buy it. The game is amazing. 9/10  10/10 to level out some bias in the scores.

[Sans spoil] Tout</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Le premier mot qui vient &#xE0; l&apos;esprit d&#xE8;s les premi&#xE8;res secondes de jeu est &quot; Rafraichissant&apos;&apos;. Le jeu est beau, color&#xE9; un max et extr&#xEA;mement fluide.
<br>
<br>Vous contr&#xF4;lez donc Yooka, un petit cam&#xE9;l&#xE9;on vert qui ce nourri principalement de baies et de papillons tout mignons. Avec lui, son fid&#xE8;le ami Laylee, une petite chauve-souris qui vous aideront dans vos aventures.
<br>
<br>[Sans spoil] Tout commence une belle journ&#xE9;e d&apos;apr&#xE8;s-midi o&#xF9; nos deux amis se d&#xE9;tende au soleil quand tout &#xE0; coup, leur livre s&apos;envole et laisse deri&#xE8;re lui des pages dor&#xE9;s. Yooka veut donc retrouver le livre car pages dor&#xE9;es = grande valeur. Vous faites donc ici vos premiers pas dans Yooka-Laylee. Tout &#xE7;a vous porte jusqu&apos;une usine et le grand m&#xE9;chant vous d&#xE9;voile son plan machiav&#xE9;lique. Un peu plus tard vous &#xEA;tes d&#xE9;j&#xE0; emmen&#xE9; &#xE0; collecter une pagie (une page dor&#xE9;e) qui vous indique que vous devez trouver plusieurs pagies pour refaires le livre. Votre but sera donc de &quot; rentr&#xE9;e &quot; dans le livre, d&apos;aller collecter des pages, de revenirs pour agrandir le livre avec les pages collecter et retourner dans le livre jusqu&apos;&#xE0; temps d&apos;avoir tout compl&#xE9;t&#xE9; (&#xE0; la mani&#xE8;re d&apos;un bon vieux Spyro, d&apos;un Rayman 2, ou bien &#xE9;videmment &#xE0; un Banjo-Kazooie)
<br>
<br>Le c&#xF4;t&#xE9; plate-forme 3D est parfaitement bien r&#xE9;alis&#xE9; et niveau gameplay on peut dire que les d&#xE9;veloppeurs avaient de l&apos;id&#xE9;e ! Tout d&apos;abord vous serait probablement aussi surpris que moi de voir plusieurs personnages de jeu 2D qui vous donnera une qu&#xEA;te pour X raison (le chevalier de Shovel Knight qui vous demandent de trouver un tr&#xE9;sor pour lui car la 3D lui donne mal &#xE0; la t&#xEA;te par exemple) Niveaux dialogue c&apos;est pareil, vous allez parfois &#xEA;tre surpris de l&apos;humour des personnages, on s&apos;attache vraiment &#xE0; certains d&apos;entre eux pour leurs jeux de mots pourris ou encore leur r&#xE9;f&#xE9;rence vid&#xE9;oludique bien placer. Le jeu est r&#xE9;ellement REMPLIE d&apos;humour et &#xE7;a fait grave plaisir. La difficult&#xE9; est parfaitement bien jaug&#xE9;e (&#xE0; croire que Yooka-Laylee na aucun d&#xE9;faut...). Le niveau de difficult&#xE9; facile serait parfait pour un enfant alors que le mode normal s&apos;adapte absolument bien &#xE0; un joueur de plate-forme plus &quot; casual &quot;. Le mode difficile temps qu&apos;a lui risque d&apos;&#xEA;tre jou&#xE9; par les v&#xE9;t&#xE9;rans du genre.
<br>
<br>Au final qu&apos;est-ce qu&apos;il ne va pas avec ce jeu. Comme rien n&apos;est parfait je m&apos;efforce de r&#xE9;fl&#xE9;chir &#xE0; quelque chose d&apos;aga&#xE7;ant, mais je ne trouve rien. &#xC0; la limite je pourrais citer la cam&#xE9;ra qui parfois fait des siennes, mais en r&#xE9;alit&#xE9; j&apos;ai tellement eux peu de probl&#xE8;mes avec celle-ci que de le citer serait presque mal.
<br>
<br>Je vais finir en parlant de la diff&#xE9;rence entre l&apos;&#xE9;dition normale et deluxe. 44,99$ (CAD) pour l&apos;&#xE9;dition normale qui comporte seulement le jeu. 44,99$ + 11$ = 55,99$ (CAD) pour avoir la soundtrack et l&apos;art book digital... Est-ce que l&apos;&#xE9;dition deluxe vos la peine ? Pas pour moi non. La musique du jeu est excellente, mais je ne l&apos;&#xE9;couterais pas seulement pour le plaisir en dehors du jeu. L&apos;art book lui est plut&#xF4;t joli et sympa &#xE0; lire, mais sans plus. Prenez l&apos;&#xE9;dition normale ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7221425">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Yooka Laylee is a kickstarter game with the intention of taking us back to the glory days of N64  Rare 3D Platforming and it does just that. Game follows two partners, a chameleon named Yooka and a bat named Laylee. The story is fairly simple as they are just trying to get their book back from the antagonist named Capital B (A man out to use the pages from the books called pagies to rewrite the universe) BUT on the way they meet a variety of characters, learn various abilities, and tackle many quest.
<br>
<br>The Worlds.
<br>There is a total 5 worlds to explore and complete at your own pace. While the worlds are enjoyable, they lack some imagination Banjo Kazooie/Tooie had, such as Freezeezy Peak&apos;s Giant snowman,  Jolly Rogers Atlantis, Mad Monster Mansions giant piano room,Hailfire PeaksFire/ice concept, clickclock woods Season concept, etc.
<br>
<br>The characters.
<br>Yooka Laylee has a great main cast. Yooka,Laylee,Capital B, Kartos, Dr Puzz, Rextro, Vendi and Trowzer the snake are all great but the side characters is where it lacked.  The pigs, snowmen, and mexican slot machines felt lifeless and generic. With Banjo there was more variety with  monkeys, seals, polar bears, ants, stone soccer players,giant metal sharks,dragons,beavers etc. In Yooka Laylee these side characters either appear once or come back later in the game but even when they came back, they didnt feel connected to the world. Overall i just felt more/better side characters couldve been involved in each world to make it more alive.
<br>
<br>The Abilities.
<br>Nothing much to say here. You get a long list of abilities which help out along the way. I also like how these abilities offer different ways to beat certain things like the final boss. Ive seen people fight that boss way different than i did.
<br>
<br>The New.
<br>Not really sure if this is new to the 3D platforming genre but i dont recall seeing it. Yooka Laylee has a system called tonics where you can edit your gameplay by talking to vendi. By edit i mean things like hitting harder, breathing under water longer, stamina running out slower, no fall damage, etc. I thought it was a nice mechanic to give it some flare.
<br>
<br>The Music.
<br>Its by Grant Kirkhope, David Wise, and Steve Burke. Nuff said.
<br>
<br>Difficulty.
<br>The game be really easy and it can be really hard. Especially with those minecart levels. Its mostly up to the player as I&apos;ve seen many people struggle with the simplest challenges.
<br>
<br>Gameplay.
<br>The game plays really well aside from 2 things. The shooting is a bit meh but definitely a step up from Banjo Tooie. The game also had one camera view switch where it reverses the controls but thats a minor issue. It really didnt mess me up a lot.
<br>
<br>Summary;
<br>The game is a good comeback for the 3D Platforming Genre. My only issues with the game were the
<br>lack of memorable characters aside from the main cast and the lack of imagination in the levels. Other than that i believe the game is pretty solid and nothing less than a 7.
<br>These issues i had as a platformer fan can easily be fixed in a sequel. Which i have no doubt they&apos;ll do, they are setting a stage for new franchises to come with their &quot;playtonic universe&quot; idea.
<br>
<br>That being said, i give the game an 8/10. Cant wait for Twooka Laylee or Yooka Laylee Racing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7223964">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t expect the game to give me the same magical feeling of awe I got as a child playing BK. Nor did I expect it to scare the living sh1t out of me like BK did. I anticipated a spiritual successor to the BK and BT games that would effectively play off my nostalgia and Yooka Laylee has done that in spades. The music, the graphics, the characters, the worlds and the puzzles are all very much, to my mind, similar to what I played with in BK &amp; BT. And it feels really good to, in effective, relive those old memories.
<br>
<br>Could the game have raised the bar and been so much more? Perhaps with the right time and money it could have. I sincerely don&apos;t think it&apos;s really better than BK and BT as far as content goes, but it is definitely an improvement over the graphics, controls and camera. (Though the camera can still be rather derpy at times, I don&apos;t find it nearly as bad as it was in the originals). Honestly, it feels like a modernized emulation of the originals and I&apos;m okay with that. I enjoy it for what it is. I certainly would&apos;ve preferred more maps and I feel that the maps that are there could&apos;ve been more interesting.
<br>
<br>Now, that being said, I don&apos;t find it to be super exciting. There&apos;s some challenging mini games throughout. Some I&apos;ve found frustrating, others enjoyable. Which is the same experience I had in the originals. But overall, I just find it relaxing. There&apos;s a simple satisfaction to learning new moves, collecting various items and completing puzzles. I can&apos;t say that the puzzles are super hard. Some certainly make me think, but I haven&apos;t found myself getting crazy stuck on anything so far. And I&apos;m glad. Because I do not miss the days of being an 8 year old kid, burning my tiny insufficient brain to a crisp trying to figure out simple puzzles that to me seemed like trying to figure out rocket science.
<br>
<br>For me it&apos;s an awesome, satisfying game that&apos;s delivered on my expectations. But if you&apos;re looking for something innovative or particularly ground breaking in comparison to BK or BT I doubt you&apos;ll be very impressed with Yooka Laylee.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7233790">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Camera is everything in a 3D platformer, and this experience is simply marred with jitters, steering issues, sudden jerks and not looking at where the player is moving. Not to mention how weird the interactions are - you can stand on some inclines, but not others, some abilities will affect some enemies, but not others where you&apos;d expect they would.
<br>
<br>It feels like it might have been developed by people who never talked to one another or coordinated their efforts at all. And for a follow on for a game built on characters - as Banjo Kazooie was, the ones here have no personality beyond their basic concept drawings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7268919">Expand</a></span>

<br>But unlike my son, this game will not eventually hang itself in a gas station bathroom. The game was so simplistic and was on nostalgia life support, the placement of objects were as sloppy as possible. The numerous useless transformations in the game ruined me, like the helicopter noise not syncing with the speed of the blades haunts me like the screams of my son going through puberty beating his dog with a sock monkey in the basement and the characters are much like my ex wife who are ugly and do nothing but ruin my life. The sound effects were like a toilet where no matter what there&apos;s always garbage spewing out the front. Destroying this piece of garbage won&apos;t bring my son back but I&apos;m okay with that. This game is much like my autistic daughter where the more it tries the more it just spits on itself. The voice acting ( if you want to call it that) sounds like my grandfather with turrets dying words but at least in the end he passed on peacefully unlike yooka laylee that feels the need to go on without end... Unlike my son. In the end, this game was like Ash&apos;s stoutland and had nothing else to live for and will fade away into obscurity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7438684">Expand</a></span>

I was a huge Banjo-Kazooie fan as a child, and have played Yooka-Laylee for over 32 hours. I will try my very best to give my most unbiased opinion on Yooka-Laylee.
<br>
<br>Yooka-Laylee is a 3D Platformer collect-a-thon spiritual successor to the Banjo-Kazooie Franchise. It&apos;s developed by Playtonic Games, which consists of only 25 members, most of which are Rare Ltd. veterans.
<br>
<br>When other critics state that Yooka-Laylee is &quot;stuck in the past&quot;, they&apos;re not wrong, but I personally found this a good thing. Playtonic&apos;s main goal was to create a video game that would revive the 3D Platformer genre and the old feelings of the Banjo-Kazooie series. Did they revive the 3D platformer genre? Eh, debatable. However did they revive the old feeling of the Banjo-Kazooie series...? Absolutely.
<br>After playing the game after about 32 hours, 100 percenting the game in the process, I am thoroughly convinced that this is the game that fans have been waiting for the last 19 years. Everything about Yooka-Laylee is incredible identical to Banjo-Kazooie. The hilarious gibberish noises (Trowzer&apos;s my personal favorite), memorable characters, fun puzzles, incredible world exploration has all come back in this spiritual successor. This is the Banjo-Threeie that fans have been waiting for all this time!
<br>
<br>Yooka-Laylee is full of five giant expandable worlds that the player may explore and collect items called Pagies and Quills. No minimap here either! This is a game where you have to look in every nook and cranny to find everything. Backtracking can be tedious and annoying, but it feels incredibly rewarding once you&apos;ve found it (with no guides of course).
<br>
<br>However, there are small negative things I would have to address. The difficulty spike can completely shoot up at random points in the game. The hard as *GUH-HUH* minigames can be painful, and you want to just throw the controller on the floor sometimes. Even beating the highscore of the minigames end up bittersweet. I don&apos;t have much of a problem with the minecarts though. Other reviewers state that it&apos;s terrible and difficult, but I think they&apos;re not too much of a problem. One exception is World 4&apos;s Minecart level, which is the hardest of them all. However, there&apos;s something at the end of the minecart challenge of World 4 that redeems itself that I won&apos;t spoil.
<br>Another difficulty spike appears in World 2 in a cave called &quot;Gloomy Gem Grotto&quot;. Remember Rusty Bucket Bay&apos;s Engine Room from Banjo-Kazooie? This is Yooka-Laylee&apos;s &quot;Engine Room&quot;. It combines the difficults of so many things: slight-hard to control rolling ability (which depletes your energy overtime), vision (by eating a firefly, the duo start a time limit of about 20 seconds where they can see), and an obstacle course. If the duo run out of energy or out of time for the light, they can be considered dead. Not only that, but the course is unnecessarily long, and when you die, it&apos;s back to the very start!
<br>
<br>Technical issues are another setback. When you first boot up the game, you will IMMEDIATELY have to go to the options and adjust resolution and screen quality. Random FPS drops aren&apos;t common after the patch anymore, but they&apos;re still there.
<br>
<br>As for the worlds themselves, they&apos;re not empty at all. They&apos;re filled with so much content packed to the brim, and while it may take a while, it feels great once you know where everything is. Most people like World 3, but I have to say it&apos;s my least favorite world. World 3 is a maze that gives the player too much freedom, and you have no idea where to go. Yes, it&apos;s a maze, but after playing that level for hours, you would expect to have some sense of direction after some point. Even after beating World 3 completely, I would find myself still lost after returning back to do some wiki research.
<br>World 5 on the other hand redeems World 3&apos;s problematic errors. World 5 has to be my favorite, with Grant Kirkhope&apos;s epic soundtrack, and the brilliant world theme that goes with it! World 5 is very explorable and easy to navigate.
<br>
<br>Now should you buy the game? I&apos;d say the only reason not to purchase the game is if you&apos;re not interested in 3D platformers, and you&apos;re not curious. Otherwise, I&apos;d highly recommend purchasing the game and trying it out for yourself instead of listening to other critics and reviewers because everyone&apos;s opinion on this game is so spread out. Not worth waiting for a price drop, get it now!
<br>
<br>Yooka-Laylee definitely brought me back memories of Banjo-Kazooie, and the difficulty spikes and small technical issues were not enough to bring down my enjoyment of the game by a whole bunch. While some game design is questionable, he player can handle it.
<br>
<br>I give this game a 9/10 for giving me such a great time exploring every world and character, while reading some of the most hilarious in-game conversations!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7216974">Expand</a></span>

Correcting for the racially motivated voters gives an as-of-now user score of 8.3.  If you are sat there stewing because certain racist scum was not included you should know that you have statistically lower intelligence than people who agree that racist morons shouldn&apos;t be cast in the game.
<br>
<br>If you enjoyed Banjo Kazooie and want to be reminded of your youthful days you will likely enjoy this. The music is amazing. The graphics and &quot;feel&quot; are very close to what I hoped. It is running smoothly for me.  You remember all the bad publicity about loud sound effects in videos before release? Just to clarify if it isn&apos;t apparent; you can control the volume level of sound effects.
<br>
<br>Many people reviewed this game before it was even released citing bad performance. There was a day one patch that made this game run perfectly fine for me on both PC and PS4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7222508">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Yooka-Laylee doesn&apos;t hold your hand while forcing you along a linear path--instead, it trusts you to play the game at your own pace. This freedom not only provides a fantastic and epic adventure but also a great sense of accomplishment as you see your collectable list fill up with tokens marking your achievements.
<br>
<br>This game is a stunning creation by a very passionate team of developers and deserves a place in gamer&apos;s hearts.

<br>Yes, you. The one screaming, &quot;There&apos;s no Jontron!&quot; and &quot;Playtonic lied to us!&quot; and other slurs I dare not mention. Tread lightly.
<br>You are one. We are hundreds, thousands. Millions. You aren&apos;t just IN the minority; you ARE the minority.
<br>I don&apos;t feel awkward or anxious playing Yooka Laylee around others, and your words don&apos;t affect me. Many others, however, are coming out of their shells for the first time in their lives. This is the first time many are enjoying the beautiful world that has been crowdfunded by us - and it IS beautiful. Incredibly so. DON&apos;T ruin this for them. We Yooka- Laylee fans may have our differences, but we will not hesitate to come to the aid of our fellow platformers, especially against someone who so virulently slurs that which has brought us all together.
<br>Don&apos;t take this the wrong way. I don&apos;t hate you. I don&apos;t fear you. I pity you.
<br>I&apos;m sorry that you feel this way towards us. I&apos;m sorry that Yooka-Laylee is such a bane to your existence. And I&apos;m sorry that you are missing out on such a wonderful experience. Mostly, though, I&apos;m sorry that you feel the need to go around and publicly chastise and berate others. I&apos;m sorry that, to ensure your own validity, you need to make others feel invalid. I&apos;m sorry that your self-worth is so infinitesimally miniscule that you have to make others feel less-than-human, at least in your own denatured mind, just to feel whole. I am truly sorry that day-in and day-out you have to put up with your worthless, meaningless, Shakespearean tragedy of a life.
<br>I ask you politely to cease your unnecessary cries for attention, and instead invite you to join our ranks. Uninstall Overwatch, start up Yooka-Laylee, and breathe in the splendor and the amazement of your world, and then, maybe, just maybe, you&apos;ll see what you&apos;ve been so hopelessly searching for this whole time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7218051">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been playing it since it came out and I rarely keep playing a single game for more than 1 day, let alone finish them. It&apos;s very reminicent of the N64 Rare games including the dificulty, the music the beautifully crafted worlds and the humor. It&apos;s easy to ignore the dialog because the story is simple and the VO is just grunts and noises but the text has that classic Rare clever humor that puts a smile in my face. The graphics while cartoonish look beutiful in my opinion.
<br>
<br>The game currently has several glitches and some design issues which hopefully would be fix over time, however this doesn&apos;t prevent the game from being played or finished, there are only a few collectibles for obtaining the 100% that could be troublesome for some players until the game gets patched.
<br>
<br>A lot of people criticise it because it comes too close to the old games such as Banjo Kazooie which is a pretty silly complain because 1) people that backed the KS campaign got exactly what they wanted and 2) people who didn&apos;t back the KS campaign have trailers, videos and reviews to make a decision if they want to buy the game or not. My guess is that most of the people who are digging anything negative about this game do it more because they are upset that the developers removed the grunts of one of those youtube darlings, not because of the quality of the game itself.
<br>
<br>One more thing to consider is that while there are around 10 Call of Duty clones and probably more than 1000 retro 2D platformers for PC every year, since Psychonauts released more than 10 years ago I haven&apos;t seen a single classic 3D platformer for PC in this style that can be considered a decent game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7228422">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For full disclosure: I am a kickstarter backer, and I have 100% completed this game (Including all 35 achievements) on the PC version.
<br>
<br>This game is not perfect, just putting that out there now. It not the 10 I was hoping for, but it is by no means a 6. This game has a few problems that I couldn&apos;t really ignore, such as the rather lack-luster final battle, the infuriating rexo mini games, and the unfortunate lack of variety.
<br>
<br>Without going into details, the final battle did have a sense of ramping up, but it never got to that final point that I wanted it to. I was hoping it&apos;d be like the Banjo-Tooie final boss, which tested all of the abilities we learned in that game and the game prior. I would have settled for the Banjo-Kazooie kind of final boss, where we pull from many of our abilities, and use some sort of device (JInjos) to give the final kick to boss. We got neither, and that was sad, but the boss was engaging, difficult, and fun anyway.
<br>
<br>The mini games are terrible. Their only saving grace is that they will be no more than 30 minutes of your total 20 hour play time if you try to complete the game, and if you&apos;re not going to 100% complete the game, you can ignore them altogether. I guess I did like world 2&apos;s mini game a little.
<br>
<br>The lack of variety is down to how they handled the worlds. There are 5 worlds, they all start out about the size of a banjo-kazoie world, but can then be expanded to contain 2-3 times the content. The developers chose to do &quot;More of the same&quot; content, but it&apos;s still more content. Every world still has a diversity of challenges, and unique ideas of their own. The only things that are &quot;reused&apos; is some character models and Kartos&apos;s general mini game style. But that&apos;s ok, because Kartos&apos;s mini games are fun.
<br>
<br>The game looks beautiful. It feels polished. Lag issues only exist on the Xbox One console, and will hopefully be ironed out in the near future. It has everything it needs to be a good game for what it&apos;s trying to do. It is a game for fans, and as such: it has a lot of the flaws you&apos;d expect from the game it&apos;s emulating. I hope that after this, Tooka-Laylee will take what made this game &quot;Good&quot; and make it &quot;Great&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7226029">Expand</a></span>

Does it deserve the awful reviews that people are giving? Not at all. This game is a really fun call back to Banjo Kazooie. It&apos;s got the same style of grunting voices, very similar game play, and fun environments and puzzles to explore. Also the great king Kirkhope managed to make another bouncy and energetic score that I could listen to for hours. The controls are tight, the platforming is solid and creative. Finally the jokes are great. They have some amazing hidden/not so hidden adult jokes in the game so its fun for parents and kids to play. Buy this game people. Try it out. There hasn&apos;t been a 3d platforming game this solid in literal years. It scratches that itch.
<br>
<br>As for the negative I don&apos;t have much to say. This game isn&apos;t a ten because it isn&apos;t an original concept, and it is not much of an improvement on the collectathon genera. There isn&apos;t any true innovation going on here, but we knew that&apos;s what this game was going to be from the start. Maybe the innovation will come with  a possible sequel.  Also the worlds are large and fun. The issue is that in each world after you unlock more of that said world it&apos;s not much of a new experience. All of the things you experienced in the first half of that world are going to be there in the second half without many surprises. That&apos;s not to say the individual worlds are not vastly different, its just that the worlds could have had some more things in them to keep any repetition down. Also you cannot skip a lot of dialogue and cut scenes which is a minor annoyance. Overall I see a future for this polished gem of a call back, and it is a bright one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7228143">Expand</a></span>

This game has 4 large worlds, 25 pagies in each(puzzle piece equivalents). Some of them are very easy, while others are very difficult. Each world has much more collectives such as quills to unlock new abilities in each world. At the end of the day this game is best described as a collectable platformer. Bosses are actually challenging. Combat isn&apos;t the focus of this game at all. nearly every enemy dies in 1/2 hits, so don&apos;t expect an upgrade from Banzo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7226937">Expand</a></span>

The graphics look really nice, it is fun to explore the worlds and discover all the pagies. the controls are fine, the camera is a bit weird, but nothing that can stop me from enjoying this game. I don&apos;t know why so many try to hate it. I love it.</span>

<br>Visuals are an eyesore, a lot of the *slightly* different power-ups in the game just leave a void in my gut when I collect them, no real improvements on the old formula, and for the most important part:
<br>I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m getting old but the gameplay was a 5/10 at best. It all should add up to keep me wanting to move onward but I feel so impulsed to just quit at any moment.
<br>
<br>Polish, while in theory some bizarre abstract concept thrown around in the industry as some buzzword excuse of an argument, is really the core of what kept people going in Banjo &amp; Kazooie and Yooka-Laylee&apos;s other predecessors.
<br>
<br>But hey, at least the music is good. And the character designs are great. And I faced no frame-rate issues whatsoever AND I encountered no glitches whatsoever except for a few unavoidable camera ones (as a dev I&apos;m amazed from a small team)
<br>
<br>I feel really bad for the Yooka-Laylee developers reading ALL the day one reviews but I personally believe they tried to make a game that tried to meet the impossible expectations... and when faced to reality, didn&apos;t really meet those 10/10 GOTY requirements. Which really upset me because I was stoked to get the game.
<br>
<br>I really hope the team continues to make games in the future. Bigger, better ones, and even if they&apos;re all seasoned veterans, they should continue to learn as they work into the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7217554">Expand</a></span>

<br>There&apos;s black loading zones every two seconds in worlds, completely breaking the flow
<br>The graphics and textures look washed out generic Unity, making the N64 aesthetic feel a lot better, despite the ancient graphics.
<br>The controls are floaty in a lot of cases, making certain parts frustrating and not fun in the slightest
<br>The music is very all over the place in tone, some tracks are nice but others are far too overly bombastic for when they play.
<br>The game is poorly optimized right now, making it so certain areas run poorly for no reason along with glitches
<br>Overall it feels less like a spiritual successor and more a bootleg of the originals. And this is coming from a person who loved the N64 Banjos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7219720">Expand</a></span>

<br>I don&apos;t know how they messed it up so bad, I got half way and dont want to play anymore, I wish I could refund but the company doesnt like to give out refunds, and seems to be a bunch of asshats to their customers so they got what was coming I suppose.

<br>The camera hasn&apos;t give me as much problems as others it seems, or maybe I&apos;m just not too bothered by that. Either way, I&apos;ve been paying attention to detail for this game and I love how it allows me to explore a bunch of random areas. It really forces you to think. &quot;Can I get to that spot? Let me try. OH! I can! Awesome!&quot;

<br>what I won&apos;t let sllide is absolutely NO impetus to do anything in this game. the premise is next to non existent. there is no decent reason to do anything in this game, the only objective is to collect more pagies. I&apos;m sorry, but that is just not good enough. even super mario bros had more drive than that. yes, collecting coins was nice, but the objective was to rescue the princess. you had a REASON to continue going. In Yooka Laylee, the only drive for the main characters is get book, sell it for money. bigger questions might be, who will you sell it to? what will you spend the money on? the world has no other form of civilisation or even any hints of it. there is no depth to the characters, just &quot;we want profit&quot;. I have never seen such empty, lifeless, 1 dimensional  characters.
<br>I was willing to forgive a lot, but at the end of the day, I need some kind of motivation to play a game.  Yooka Laylee gives zero motivation and playing it I just felt completely and utterly depressed. My whole mindset was &quot;what is the point of this&quot;. Industry veterans can and should do better than this.  very poor show indeed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7251943">Expand</a></span>

<br>Obtaining the main collectible in the game,</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">While aiming in the right direction, Yooka-Laylee has ultimately missed the target when attempting to capture the &quot;magic&quot; of collect-a-thon platformers from decades past. Strange game design decisions mar a graphically impressive work from Playtonic Games; a studio with members from the Rare teams responsible for games such a &quot;Banjo-Kazooie.&quot;
<br>
<br>Obtaining the main collectible in the game, Pagies, feel more like a chore than an excercise in puzzle-solving and platforming. Most Pagie challenges hinge on obtaining abilities and simply using them to get a Pagie. One example would be the Reptile Roll move that allow you to bust through glass to get a handful of pagies.
<br>
<br>There is also the strange decision by Playtonic which forces you to pay pagies to unlock a second-half of a world. You use your pagies to unlock a world and can then come back and pay more pagies to unlock more challenges. It&apos;s just weird to force the player to re-vist a world they have already explored.
<br>
<br>Clocking in at about 10-15 hours the game wears out it&apos;s welcome within the first two worlds. Most of the promotional art you have seen for this game has been from the first (jungle type) world and the fourth (casino) world. There is also a snow world, a swamp world and a space world. None of the worlds even hold a candle to the entertainment of the first and even that one was questionable.
<br>
<br>Camera issues have been highly over-exaggerated in reviews. There is something wrong much deeper in this game than just the camera.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7246944">Expand</a></span>

The longer I played, the more annoyed I got.
<br>
<br>Some notes:
<br>- bad controls and camera
<br>- fun gameplay - at first but then it gets tedious
<br>- nice characters
<br>- frustrating elements (mostly minigames which are boring and overly hard but required to 100 %)
<br>- 5 worlds + hub (expandable) - pretty large - easy to get lost - each world may take even 8 hours to finish - it&apos;s simply too long - should&apos;ve made more varied levels
<br>- if you take your time, the game is actually very long
<br>- not optimized for PC (K/M) - Xbox buttons instead and the B doesn&apos;t even exist!!! - cannot even rebind!! - this means that if you are in a conversation with a Yes/No choice you have to reset and go back to HUB because you get lost in the never-ending loop of &quot;Yes choice&quot;
<br>- if not for the minigames and gigantic worlds, it would&apos;ve been a 9
<br>- no shadow when jumping most of the time! - leads to many unnecessary deaths
<br>- out of the 5 worlds I only enjoyed 2 (3rd+4th)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7261507">Expand</a></span>

I loved the music, gameplay and world design of this game and I would really recommend it to every fan of 3D platformers. The only problems I have with the game are the story, wich was pretty bland and uninteresting in my opinion, and most of the boss battles (3 of them were great, the others felt pretty rushed and simple). I would personaly give this game a 8.5/10 but im giving it a 10 because there are a lot of 0&apos;s of people Who are trying to lower the user score unfairly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7254274">Expand</a></span>

I love the Banjo games and I&apos;d be the first one to say that I wanted this game to be good, I wanted Banjo back.
<br>
<br>But perhaps my hopes, all our hopes, were misguided. See, what we wanted wasn&apos;t just Banjo Threeie. What we wanted was that same magic feeling that the Banjo games gave us, that same burst of charm and wonder, which this game sorrowfully lacks. And now that we&apos;ve grown up and had more gaming experiences, a game that so shamelessly feels like nothing but a pretty looking remaster of a game nearly two decades old feels rather dated. The evolution isn&apos;t there, the bar was raised, and Yooka Laylee has neither the ambition nor the talent to meet it.
<br>
<br>Sure the charming writing is there, but a lack of restraint really makes the fourth wall breaking less special. It&apos;s like as soon as the game starts it&apos;s saying &quot;Oh hey, you&apos;re playing a video game, do you know that? LOL I&apos;m so clever for making that observation haha!&quot; Unlike the originals, which saved the fourth wall jokes for times when it&apos;s actually funny or poignant. The characters are recycled between levels instead of having new ones show up which actually fit the levels they are in. The camera and the controls often feel like they would rather fight you instead of let you experience the world. The levels are disjointed and boxed in rather than sprawling and interconnected, and the fact that they need to be &quot;expanded&quot; by playing in them seems completely unnecessary: You waste time to exit and re-enter the level to get the full experience. Dumb restrictions and petty annoyances like the stamina meter or loud and obnoxious voice acting add up over time and continuously grade away at your patience until it&apos;s nothing but buyer&apos;s pity and your nostalgia driving you to complete the game.
<br>
<br>Its got its heart in the right place, but at the end of the day Yooka Laylee is pretty much just a mediocre 3D platformer with pretty visuals and a comedic tone. I wanted a true return to glory, and instead I am playing what feels more like a fan tribute of it&apos;s predecessor from 1998, but even then ends up just being worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7222894">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have never played Banjo Kazooie, even though I grew up in the N64 era, so I wasn&apos;t entirely sure what to expect upon purchasing this game.  However, I absolutely fell in love with the style, music, gameplay, and characters of Yooka Laylee.  The game is an exploration/collection game.  The worlds are vast and an absolute joy to wander around and solve puzzles in.  The collectibles &quot;pagies&quot; are the right mix of difficulty to be rewarding to collect, but without being too terribly frustrating either.
<br>
<br>The only thing stopping this game from receiving a 10 is that the boss battles are lack luster and the arcade minigames are disappointing.
<br>
<br>This game makes me want to go back and find an old copy of Banjo Kazooie to see if it lives up to the legend and offers the same great experience i found in Yooka Laylee.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7247111">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately the game suffers from the same flaws as Donkey Kong 64&apos;s level design, and with the Steam Price point of 39.99 (standard) I couldn&apos;t help but feel as I wasted that money and decided to refund it.</span>

There are just so many reasons not to get this game, just another early access game that turned to trash.  Oh sure they took your money upfront and that&apos;s exactly why they don&apos;t need to deliver at launch time.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s plenty of titles for less than $20 on steam that are better games than this.</span>

                                        <span>It&apos;s a nice throwback to the old Banjo Kazooie games but so far there have been two things I&apos;d consider being negative:
<br>
<br>- The water sometimes looks awful
<br>- The controls are not responsive enough
<br>- The camera has it&apos;s own stupid free will, making boss fights especially difficult
<br>- during cutscenes the game doesn&apos;t stop which sometimes results in you being thrown off a cliff during it</span>

The guys at Playtonic did a great job with this game and they will only get better if we continue to back their efforts.  I gave this game a 9/10 (really a 8.5/10) as there are a couple of things I feel they could have done better (such as some camera flaws here and there (which they are fixing)), but overall it&apos;s a solid performance, especially from a company that just started up from the ashes of what was Rare.
<br>
<br>I hope they make a sequel (Twoka-Laylee or Tooka-Laylee) and I hope that one day they will either get the rights from Microsoft to continue making Banjo-Kazooie games, or Nintendo will give them rights to say, idk, make another Diddy Kong Racing or something they used to work on as Rare.  I am a proud baker and can&apos;t wait to see what they do next!  :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7321285">Expand</a></span>

<br>From Great to disappointing
<br>3D platformers were all the rage in the late 90s all the way through the PlayStation 2 era and then they faded away...
<br>Of course everyone misses the good ole days, so some veterans from the banjo kazooie team brought it back with yooka laylee, a game with potential that never delivers&#x2026;
<br>In yooka laylee you play as yooka the iguana and laylee the bat, you set off on an adventure to get all of the pagies and stop capital b and dr quack from snatching all of the worlds books.
<br>You start out in a hub, with 5 levels inside... to get to each of the 5 levels you need new powers... so to get these powers you enter the levels 1 at a time to explore these sandboxes, complete all of the tasks around the world for the initially charming characters in return for a pagie, and collect the quills to purchase new super moves from the trowzer snake
<br>or trowzer the snake..
<br>Yeah... idk, the humor is questionable in this game... I&#x2019;m not sure who this game was really made for&#x2026;
<br>The first world is the best world in the game&#x2026;
<br>There&#x2019;s heart here, nostalgia, humor, character&#x2026;
<br>A sense of adventure&#x2026;
<br>ghost creatures hidden in the world to collect... items to find for characters&#x2026;
<br>fun platforming sections, a race&#x2026;
<br>And then the game just falls apart&#x2026;
<br>Collecting pagies is important to unlocking new levels, and the quills are important for unlocking moves to complete the tasks here&#x2026;
<br>But pagies can also be used to extend the levels...
<br>These extended versions of the levels add new missions, characters and a boss battles to help you on your journey to collecting 100 pagies needed to get to the games end&#x2026;
<br>And that journey to 100 pagies, is an uninteresting and frustrating grind&#x2026;
<br>Sadly the levels literally get worse as you go..
<br>characters are recycled&#x2026;
<br>missions are recycled&#x2026;
<br>the levels feel like little to no effort were put into them
<br>the game starts to feel lazy&#x2026;
<br>it introduces new moves in every world but nothing cool is ever done with these abilities&#x2026;
<br>It&#x2019;s just becomes a joke by the games end&#x2026;
<br>The 2nd to last level is just a bunch of time your slam right slot machine games&#x2026;
<br>And the final level had a space theme
<br>fitting because of how empty it felt.
<br>Yooka Laylee has good bits to it...
<br>The hub world is great&#x2026;
<br>forcing you to unlock new moves and the idea that these moves will keep you coming back to past levels is great&#x2026;
<br>there&#x2019;s arcade games in here to play with friends for high scores
<br>The first level is great and exactly what I want out of a 3d platformer&#x2026;
<br>But beyond level 1, the hub world, and the hook of bringing your new moves back to past levels&#x2026;

The levels are beautiful until you bump into several blocks or chunks of ice that all look like they&apos;re made of plastic. Everything is massive and open-ended, yet not designed to be conducive to navigation. Controls feel tight, until you try to do precision platforming while rolling at 40 MPH through an ice level above a bottomless pit with a time limit. Transformations are lopsided as ever, but either horrible to play as or under-utilized. There are minecart levels that try to recapture the glory and frustration of the DKC levels but have really cumbersome overcomplicated mechanics. I can count on one hand the number of different enemies, who are simply recycled level after level, and most of which have pointless invulnerability phases. The camera controls waver between being awkward and outright antagonistic. The story, basic as Rare&apos;s stories have ever been, isn&apos;t told well and the villain doesn&apos;t seem particularly invested in his role. Keyboard controls literally lack a binding for the &quot;B&quot; button equivalent and can&apos;t be edited, rendering the game unplayable without a controller. The only things in this game that don&apos;t spend a majority of their time rubbing me the wrong way are the visuals, and the music, the latter of which really does its best to make me feel like I&apos;m in a Banjo game again, and would succeed were it not for everything else.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a disaster. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s something you should turn your nose up at. It just fails to do any single thing any better than Rare has already done in the past, and constantly struggles to even maintain parity. To steal a summary from the eloquent Videogamedunkey, &quot;too afraid to embrace the confident simplicity of Banjo-Kazooie, and not inventive enough to be mistaken for Banjo-Tooie&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7237282">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Yooka-Laylee is an all-new open-world platformer from key creative talent behind the Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country games!
<br>Explore huge, beautiful worlds, meet (and beat) an unforgettable cast of characters and horde a vault-load of shiny collectibles as buddy-duo Yooka (the green one) and Laylee (the wisecracking bat with the big nose) embark on an epic adventure to thwart corporate creep Capital B and his devious scheme to absorb all the world&#x2019;s books&#x2026; and convert them into pure profit!
<br>Using their arsenal of special moves, our heroes will tackle a huge variety of puzzles and platforming challenges in their search for Pagies, the golden bounty used to unlock &#x2014; and expand &#x2014; stunning new worlds, each jammed to the gills with oddball characters, hulking bosses, mine cart challenges, arcade games, quiz shows, multiplayer games&#x2026; and much more!
<br>Yooka-Laylee was funded on Kickstarter June 2015, raising an incredible &#xA3;2.1 million from more than 80,000 backers.Yooka-Laylee remains the most funded UK games Kickstarter ever.
<br>Okay let&apos;s start my review
<br>
<br>Graphics
<br>
<br>Graphics are crisp, clean and very colourful i do like the graphics in this game but i do think that the colour is over saturated a bit other then that it&apos;s a great looking game.
<br>
<br>Voice and sound
<br>
<br>I think the music is great bring memory&apos;s from when i used to play Banjo-Kazooie on my  Nintendo 64 but what annoyed after a while was the way the character talked i know when did because it was in Banjo-Kazooie but as them game are years apart i think they just made them talk normally
<br>
<br>Cinematics
<br>
<br>The cinematics are good just can be annoying at times because the camera seems go somewhere else and Can fall down or get attacked and die.
<br>
<br>Story
<br>
<br>Yooka and Laylee must collect &#x2018;Pagies&#x2019; from their book, which has been stolen by the evil Capital B, who&#x2019;s trying to please his shady CEOs. After your book is taken and its 145 Pagies scattered across the land, you&#x2019;re free to explore and find them.
<br>
<br>Controls
<br>
<br>Controls are good but the camera seems to have a mind of it own sometimes which is very annoying at times
<br>
<br>Game-play
<br>
<br>Game-play is next up it is super you have lots of different moves in this game there so much to do in each world. There is lots of humour in the game like i will give a explain where you get your moves from is a snake called Trowers which means trouser snake. What i don&apos;t like about the game play is the pagies are hard to find in this game also the bosses are not very interesting i think they could be a lot better and the sections of vehicles are awful.
<br>
<br>The pros and cons
<br>
<br>Pros.
<br>&#x27A1;&#xFE0F;Exploration is great fun
<br>&#x27A1;&#xFE0F;Variety of worlds to explore
<br>&#x27A1;&#xFE0F;Lots of humour in this game
<br>Cons
<br>&#x27A1;&#xFE0F;Pagies are hard to find
<br>&#x27A1;&#xFE0F;Bosses are awful
<br>&#x27A1;&#xFE0F;Vehicle section is terrible
<br>

<br>I say this and I never even played Banjo-Kazooie (I was more of a PSX child).
<br>
<br>I have no idea what has happened to the gaming community as of late, it feels like people like to complain for the sake of it. I have seen games get away with worse than this game&apos;s sins, and even at its very worst the game only reaches about the same frustration level as N64-era games. It is no wonder mainstream developers are falling onto making their games a generic &quot;Everygame&quot;, as they have more than likely realised that you cannot please everyone even when you give people what they ask for. We are the only ones to blame for the dumbing down of gaming today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7305289">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Second, of all, a lot of people also complain about the camera, but I never had any issues with it ( mind you I play on an Xbox One controller on the PC ). All I noticed was that the camera was moving way too slow, so I put the sensitivity on max.
<br>
<br>---
<br>Let&apos;s start off with the gameplay
<br>
<br>The gameplay is smooth, simplistic, and fun! Not really anything new compared to B-K / B-T except for Tonics. Tonics are specialities that you can unlock and choose to have one active at a time - though it would have been better to have at least up to 3 considering there&apos;s 16 of them!
<br>You also buy moves in this game, learning them along the way in each world, and they can be used in previous worlds to accomplish something you couldn&apos;t before. So there are is a reason for backtracking here.
<br>You also have arcade games which you also unlock in every new world which feature minigames that you can play and get a high score in. If you want to, of course.
<br>And now we come to the collectibles, which are perfect. There aren&apos;t too few nor too many, it feels like the perfect amount when you first enter the world and when you expand the world, and all of them feel meaningful. You also don&apos;t collect for just the collecting part because you are unlocking something.
<br>
<br>---
<br>Let&apos;s move on to the levels
<br>
<br>There are &quot;only&quot; five levels, yes, but you can EXPAND them to become even BIGGER. When you play through it the first time it will feel like a B-K-sized level, and when you expand them they will feel more like a B-T-sized level. So you do have a reason to replay all 5 levels if you want to, or not.
<br>However, I do agree that 5 levels can be a bit too few, and I would love at least 7-8. Let&apos;s hope the DLC for this game will have newer levels and/or story.
<br>Furthermore, the level design may not be as good as in B-K / B-T, but they are definitely aesthetically pleasing - and not as much fun to traverse - than its spiritual prequels. Though it is way better than DK64. I would definitely say that World 4 is the so-called dark horse in this game and many might agree with me.
<br>
<br>---
<br>Let&apos;s end off with the story
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a 3D platformer, the story isn&apos;t that important. You have a villain you have to defeat, an evil corporate bee who seeks all of the world&apos;s literature, along with his assistant Dr. Quack. You enter his domain, Hivory Towers, collect the Pagies to unlock Grand Tomes (Worlds) all the way until you reach his HQ.
<br>
<br>---
<br>In retrospect
<br>
<br>Like I said; if you&apos;ve played B-K / B-T this is a game for you, especially if you miss 3D platformers. If you don&apos;t, then this isn&apos;t for you.
<br>
<br>My score: 7 /10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yooka-laylee/user-reviews?user_review_id=7230853">Expand</a></span>
