I&apos;ve played a lot of games made on small budgets but this is just something else.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is infuriating.  Puzzles range from too easy to too hard. Players will find themselves going back and forth between locations and completing repetitive tasks. There are just so many menial tasks that need to be completed for minimal progression. For example, in order to get someone to talk, you have to offer them three different types of food that you get from three different places in different locations. While this certainly lengthens gameplay, it&apos;s doing it in the wrong way, and makes the pace unbearable. This is not to mention half the time players are struggling with simply how to interact with the world.
<br>
<br>The narrative is uninspired and unengaging. I&apos;m 90% through the episode and I still don&apos;t care about any of the cliche characters or the victims of any of the crimes. The story is also incredible, and not in the good way. The game starts off with the detective being willing to subject herself to torture, and pulling a gun on her partner who tries to stop her, all because she wants to save her brother. Seriously? Oh, and by the way, the game is unplayable without a walkthrough - you&apos;ll be left wondering &quot;what now?&quot; so many times you might as well just watch someone play through the entire thing on youtube.
<br>
<br>I purchased this game because I&apos;ve always been a fan of point and click adventures, but beware that you&apos;re in for an extremely frustrating experience that won&apos;t give you a fraction of the enjoyment as games from Telltale. Seriously, I don&apos;t even know if this game deserves a 1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller-episode-1---the-hangman/user-reviews?user_review_id=4283224">Expand</a></span>

After buying all 4 episodes and having just finished the first, and it&apos;s everything I hoped for, and more. In short: try the demo on steam and know that the game builds and expands on that, especially on the &quot;puzzler&quot; side.
<br>
<br>You play as Erica Reed, FBI detective in this puzzle, murder investigation thriller, point and click adventure game. The game has very immersive atmosphere supported by nice art and beautiful music, ranging appropriately from relaxed and melancholic to foreboding and tense. Additionally, the voice acting is superb across the board, giving life to the characters and supporting a very good story, gripping and often emotional as well. While you&apos;re putting your puzzles together, you&apos;re not just figuring out gimmicky, weird puzzle mechanics, you&apos;re actually using clues and information you uncover on your investigations in a quite logical manner. Furthermore, and not to spoil anything, Erica&apos;s special &quot;intuition&quot; talent is cool tool for finding clues that is very well realized and interesting to watch. So, you&apos;ll actually feel that you&apos;re unravelling the mysteries and learning more and more about the story. Making progress provided me with a lot of &quot;oh!&quot; moments, when I felt that rush after you just realized something new that happened in the story, and made me feel gripped by it.
<br>
<br>There are very good scenes to be had, especially one close to the end, where the voice acting, the writing, the art and the music all came together in a magical, memorable way. There&apos;s even some tense &quot;action puzzle&quot; scenes, which were very interesting as well, I wasn&apos;t expecting to be so engaged and tense by a point and click puzzler.
<br>
<br>I only stumbled very occasionally on a puzzle here and there, and I found out that it was my fault in missing some info or other. If you&apos;re stuck, you can text your dad, a former police investigator, and he will give you hints on things you&apos;ve missed that point you in the right direction without giving it away. A very cool system, I thought, hitting the balance between preventing real frustration while making you &quot;do the work&quot; without straight giving you the solution. With all this, I found the puzzles overall to be interesting, logical instead of randomly contrived and virtually non-frustrating.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s only a few cons to these game, in my opinion. There are occasional bugs involving the characters&apos; placement and movement on the screen, but they &quot;fix themselves&quot; straight away without disturbing the game. The other &quot;problem&quot; is that the game is sometimes a little slow, not only the overall pacing of the story but (and more importantly, I think), while you&apos;re clicking and waiting for the characters to do their animations. Still, one can argue that the slowish pacing enhances the immersion and enjoyment of the game by exposing you more to the very good atmosphere overall.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not often that a game surprises me so. If you are ready to put some quiet time aside for this, you&apos;ll be rewarded with a good mystery story, with some sparks of beauty, that will make you feel the more engaged the more you progress through the puzzles, and even has some interesting and tense &quot;action puzzles&quot;. Again, you can&apos;t go wrong in trying the demo for yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller-episode-1---the-hangman/user-reviews?user_review_id=4213583">Expand</a></span>

You will be taken back to a time in gaming where immersion was attained simply through your own curiosity.

If you experience a severe lust for nice ambients, or greatly miss cell-shaded comic stylised games, pick it up. If you&apos;re a sucker for pleasant nicely written dialogs - it may be your game. If you love how nice ideas get mediocre execution and don&apos;t like being surprised by the way the story develops - go and play it right now.  If you hate interesting puzzles that make you use your head for something more than leaving the loctation where the search for solution sounds most logical - don&apos;t you dare miss it. If you just can&apos;t wait to watch how the immersion wanes kicked out by the annoying silly actions incompatible with the real life logic, then try it imme... actually, go to your room. Now. I hope there&apos;re enough people in the world who hates you.
<br>
<br>In a nutshell - dialogs, graphics, music, voice acting, sierra references and the core idea are good. The story and the most puzzles are as fresh as the desire to be a pirate and as imaginative and fun as interviews with David Cage. So there. Hope it wasn&apos;t really hard to gather it&apos;s a bit DISAPPOINTING.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller-episode-1---the-hangman/user-reviews?user_review_id=2810302">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t worry, the story will surprise you a few times. Especially the first two episodes are very enjoyable and worth playing. The story is like the mixture of two famous film thrillers: Seven and Silence of the Lambs.
<br>Advantages:
<br>+An interesting plot and characters
<br>+Story twists
<br>+Nicely written dialogues
<br>+Mechanics: typical adventure with some puzzles and action elements
<br>+Music
<br>+Voice acting
<br>+2D graphics (great comic stylised drawings )
<br>Disadvantages:
<br>-Initially great story slows down at the end
<br>-Towards the end of the game the characters&apos; choices become unreasonable and ridiculous
<br>-Bugs
<br>-3D graphics
<br>However, try it if you like point-and-click thriller style adventure games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller-episode-1---the-hangman/user-reviews?user_review_id=3835252">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Cognition abilities worked really well.
<br>+ Lots of detective puzzles that made me feel smart!
<br>+ Good hint system. Just enough nudges to point me in the right direction.
<br>+ Beautiful background art!    Things I did not like:
<br>- Some annoying puzzles that just make no sense. This is one thing I do not miss from the golden era of adventure games!
<br>- Longish loading times.
<br>- Some plot holes. - Stiff facial animations.
<br>
<br>Overall though I found Cognition to be a very good game and can definitely recommend it to fans of the genre. I can&apos;t wait for the future episodes myself!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller-episode-1---the-hangman/user-reviews?user_review_id=2838500">Expand</a></span>

The animations could use a little work, but other than that, I&apos;d say it&apos;s an A+ title. This is one of the few episodic adventure games that I could actually sit down and play through both of the first two episodes in a single sitting, AND still want more. These episodes aren&apos;t really that short, either.</span>
