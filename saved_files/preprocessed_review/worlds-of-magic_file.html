<br>1. It&apos;s buggy. As hell. Like that tactical combat didn&apos;t work on release. Or lockups when taking cities. Or corrupting saves. Or a host of other issues. It should have never been released in this condition.
<br>
<br>2. Some of what made MoM great has been removed. For instance there are more shards now but none of them have the features or coolness of the old Myrror in the original game.
<br>
<br>These are just a couple of examples of issues. Major spell/racial imbalances, map zooming issues, control issues, AI issues...the list goes on and on. At this point it&apos;s so unpolished you can&apos;t even tell if it&apos;s a diamond or a cubic zirconia. It&apos;s just a rock.
<br>
<br>What it is right now is a buggy, pale version of a former classic. After a couple of games I see no reason to return to it.

After some reflection, I&apos;m opting for a  positive assessment since the amount of fun I&apos;ve had in 18 hours of play does outweigh if only by a narrow margin the frustration.
<br>
<br>On the up side, I&#x2019;m really glad someone finally made a serious attempt to update Simtex&#x2019;s wonderful 1994 game, Master of Magic. On the down side, I wish they hadn&#x2019;t done it so scrupulously as to imitate the bugginess that came with the original MoM release back in &#x2019;94. It was a hair-pulling disaster 21 years ago until the version 1.3 patch. A bad game with bugs puts you out of its misery pretty quickly as you move on. A good game with freezes, crashes and aggravations like roll-over pop-ups that only work sometimes is a torment that&#x2019;s hard to escape.
<br>
<br>Other reviewers have already accurately detailed both the good and the bad of this game. Based on the reviews, I held off buying it on Steam until there was a price reduction. I hoped most of the negative stuff would turn out to be idiosyncratic and related either to the reviewer&#x2019;s temperament or their rig. Mostly it&#x2019;s not. But the good stuff is also there. It&#x2019;s got enough of the MoM ethos to please devotees of the Simtex masterpiece. Even a non-MoM fantasy-based 4X fan will find much to like. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ve played lots of Age of Wonders III, Fallen Enchantress, Endless Legend and Warlock. &#xA0;World of Magic is in their league albeit dragged to the bottom of the table by its flaws.
<br>
<br>If the devs ever debug it, WoM will be a first-class fantasy-based 4X game. Even in its current state there&#x2019;s lots of fun to be had especially for fans of MoM as long as you can handle things like a game freezing just as you win a titanic battle on the tactical map or losing a saved game that you&#x2019;ve invested considerable time into without needing to down some Xanax.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worlds-of-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=5284835">Expand</a></span>
