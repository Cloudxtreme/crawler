If you leave the game, it&apos;s all gone. Oh sure, the game has checkpoints, but they&apos;re used only to resurrect you during this specific game session. If you leave the game, kiss your checkpoint good bye. Even an indie game can&apos;t be forgiven for not having a save feature. Even a very inexpensive indie game. People wouldn&apos;t tolerate this of a free game, nor should they. If you&apos;re the kind to play a game from beginning to end in one sitting and you have a generator to ensure that you won&apos;t lose your game in a power outage, maybe you won&apos;t care about this. Personally, I find in unacceptable. And they have the gall to present you with a menu option, when you start the game, that says, &quot;continue campaign.&quot; Do you know what that does? It lands you right back at the beginning!

Linear levels, a basic weapon cache, and bad graphics are some of other poor qualities that make up this game. Even the coop element doesn&apos;t make this game attractive. Skip this one. There&apos;s are countless other overhead shooters where your money would be better spent.</span>
