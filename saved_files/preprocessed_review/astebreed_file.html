I was not disappointed in the game.  The mechanics are great, and the game forces you to balance between using lock on shots, melee, and standard shots throughout the game.  In the final boss battle, if you have not mastered all the systems, you will die.  A lot.  Graphics are great, game supports 1440P as a display resolution (seems to be a 50/50 thing with indie games) and even up to 8K.  The game does have a cohesive story (if you can follow it, more below about that), and lets you skip cutscenes so you aren&apos;t stuck watching stuff instead of blowing **** up.  I also like that the game has a shield system that recharges when you don&apos;t get hit.  It makes it less frustrating than most bullet hell games.  It is still easy to die on the Hard settings, and you don&apos;t get combo points if you take damage, so there is always incentive to not get hit.
<br>
<br>So a few reasons why this game doesn&apos;t get a 10 -
<br>
<br>Too short.  I understand that it&apos;s supposed to be a score attack game, but still, 6 stages is a bit short.  I still find myself going back to beat my old high score, so the replay value is there.
<br>
<br>Japanese only voice acting.  Now, this normally isn&apos;t a problem, but when the actual text for the story is flying by super fast, and the only way to get it is the (very small) English text in the bottom left of the screen, you miss out on huge chunks of it.
<br>
<br>The game is a solid 8.5, and I would recommend to anyone that enjoys shooters.  Rounding up to 9 because the game deserves that instead of the 8, especially with the melee mechanic system that plays a pivotal role in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/astebreed/user-reviews?user_review_id=4256861">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Cheap bullet hell arcade game. It plays okay, but for people who do not speak japanese reading subtitles is virtually impossible. The game constantly spams the players with enemies and numerous important plot details at the same time, coupled with a lot of typical anime-style chatter from the protagonists. It&apos;s barely decent button-mashing, but nothing else.</span>

Sometimes it can be tough to read the subtitles but only because the fights are so intense.  One of the best action arcade shooters I have played in 2014.</span>

Despite classic arcade-like design principles, it&apos;s not a &quot;nostalgia game&quot;; it can hardly be described as &quot;X meets Y&quot;. Maybe Sin &amp; Punishment&apos;s cinematic on-rails presentation + a shmup&apos;s bullet dodging + Alien Soldier&apos;s sheer variety of stuff to do... but that wouldn&apos;t really do it justice.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not really a bullet-hell; I&apos;d have trouble calling it a shmup. It&apos;s more of an... anime mecha game. You control a robot while locking-on, shooting, sword-slashing and comboing your way through various perspective-shifting stages. You have two normal shots (activated by tapping their respective buttons) &amp; two lock-ons (holding down their respective button). The lock-ons are a forward &amp; spread shot respectively, either targeting around you in a circle or in a straight line. Your slash is more than it seems at first glance; sure, you can quickly tap the attack button to do a fast combo, but this can often leave you open; sometimes, AVOIDING the longer combo attack by timing your presses just right is the better way to go. You can also hold on to the sword button along with whatever direction you want to dash towards, sword-first. Lastly you have a variety of context-sensitive special attacks; if you press the special attack button while locked on to nothing, you will damage whatever is near you (the range of this effect increases once you unlock the second mech) and creates a short aura of invincibility around you, which adds a nice element of strategy. While locked on to a large group of enemies, your mecha will automatically home in on them and slash them up at a crazy speed; meanwhile, while only locked on to a single enemy, you will pull off a very anime-esque move on it taking out a significant chunk of its health. The scoring system is easy to understand and hard to master and involves plenty of practice of all the aforementioned skills (once again, refer to the tutorial on scoring). Many will feel that the game will completely destroy your fingers, but if you find yourself mindlessly mashing the normal shots chances are you&apos;re not playing it right; the lock-on is very useful throughout most of the game and balances out the button-mashing quite well. The on-rails camera-shifting (from side-scrolling to vertical shooter to behind-the-back third-person) is truly impressive; it helps add to the game&apos;s variety while also making for interestingly-composed cinematography.
<br>
<br>My only two significant gameplay gripes are the balance issues and the lack of a DEFAULT option to set the movement keys to WASD. The latter, however, is easily fixed by googling &quot;Astebreed WASD&quot; and getting the Astebreed tweaker from the Steam forums (however note that sometimes it might create a strange delay for the directional keys; if this happens, just restore the defaults and set your own controls again). The former might just be a result if my (crappy) play style, but it feels like an area in stage 3 along with the last boss are both a bit too much of a difficulty spike. Even then it&apos;s nothing as big as, say, the contrast in difficulty between Ikaruga&apos;s first and second stages. Beyond that we have the occasional bizarre crash when using the &quot;restart game&quot; feature, but this can&apos;t actually destroy one of your runs, so I can look past it (also my computer is an ancient piece of garbage that was old even when I got it in 2008 and I can&apos;t even properly play this on max settings)
<br>
<br>This is also a short game, but if you&apos;re into arcade games this should not be an issue; arcade design is not about artificially creating &quot;pacing&quot; by stopping the action to force you to solve physics &quot;puzzles&quot; or pushing a block over a switch, which can be an issue with otherwise-great games. There is no exploration and no grinding; the game&apos;s world is not your oyster. Good arcade design is about pure non-stop gameplay bliss, a barrage of creative enemy formations and set-pieces that will stay with you for years. It is not about offering the player the illusion that they are forging their own path, but about creating a pre-set obstacle course and then giving you a very wide variety of ways of making your way through it and grading them based on their inventiveness. Replayability comes in the form of beating all the modes with all the mechs, 1CCing hard more and improving your global score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/astebreed/user-reviews?user_review_id=6201956">Expand</a></span>

<br>+Great visuals and animation/cutscenes
<br>+Multiple difficulty modes
<br>+Gallery mode which showcases artwork and In-Game Lore
<br>+Leaderboards and Achievements
<br>+Chapter Select to start from whenever in the game (must beat game once)
<br>+Can be played with either keyboard and mouse (built around this) or with a controller easily
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Voiceovers are only in Japanese
<br>-Some voiceovers get cut off (can be read via subtitles but wont hear anything)
<br>-To activate full screen, you will have to select &quot;Yes&quot; upon start up, the only time you would need to use a keyboard if you go full controller route
<br>-Important story conversations occur during levels which would make it near impossible to read what the characters are saying unless you risk getting killed in game
<br>-Very short and can be quite easy</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/astebreed/user-reviews?user_review_id=6986182">Expand</a></span>

<br>I said casual, because it is trying to be more cinematic and therefore more forgiving since the focus is moved more away from bullethell and more towards the storyline that they seem to have put a good effort into.  It&apos;s a SHUMP for couch play and those that are just getting into the genre.
<br>Good music (nothing really memorable,though), manga cutscenes that can be skipped, and good subtitled voiceacting make this an enjoyable game.

<br>$14 is a great price, and on sale, it is a steal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/astebreed/user-reviews?user_review_id=4879166">Expand</a></span>

This game is fun and looks great. It isn&apos;t difficult to get from stage to stage, but the game does offers enough challenge for score chasing that drives you to re-play for a perfect run.</span>
