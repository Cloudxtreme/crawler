I&apos;ve played Cultures 2 for years and I have never gotten bored of it. The game gives you absolute control over a group of Vikings/Settlers, and leaves you to complete a few objectives. You may accomplish these objectives any way you want to. You can take as much time as you need, and usually you need at least 8 hours to complete a mission. Its still easy to save and come right back to it though. The hardest thing to do is survive. You have to get supplies to build a farm, windmill, and bakery just to get bread, and that usually takes 30 minuets. The only problem I had with this game is the poor AI. Soldiers will not eat while traveling, so you constantly have to babysit them and tell them to eat until they get to the spot you ordered them to. They also have a tendency to fall asleep during a battle. In all. this game is great, but it not for everyone, especially people with no patience or time on their hands.<br><br>P.S.: This game is very old and hard to find.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cultures-2-the-gates-of-asgard/user-reviews?user_review_id=1775384">Expand</a></span>
