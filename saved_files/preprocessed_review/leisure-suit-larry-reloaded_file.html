The story has been extended, the puzzles changed, and the graphics updated to a new generation of adventure game fans.  But, it still retains the charm that Al Lowe brought back in 1987.  If you&apos;re a fan of point-and-click games, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span>

<br>LSL Reloaded is an excellent remake of the original, with new puzzles, characters, updated humor, tons of new stuff, and is still faithful to what made the first game a hit.  I encountered 0 bugs while playing, the game never crashed.  I am glad they delayed the release because I enjoyed a flawless experience.  Replay has done an amazing job with this game, and they have my confidence for Larry 2.

<br>I laugh at those critics here that just bump MOH and uncharted clones. It&apos;s obvious that today, if you want to get a good score, you can&apos;t go beyond the common industry. Just follow the white rabbit, buy an engine license and make another battle game set in a future not so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3254551">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is the best Larry game I&apos;ve played in a long time, it brought a tear to my eye I laughed so hard thanks for the remake guys! Its good to relive our youth.</span>

I think about those days often.  Perhaps it is because video games were better back then, or perhaps it is because I simply enjoyed them more.  Either way, the magic in video games is gone.  When I backed Larry Reloaded, it was entirely for nostalgic reasons.  Remake or not, I wanted to see a new Al Lowe game.
<br>Playing the game, I found a familiar friend&#x2014;the old icon bar.  One of the greatest things about Larry games were the detailed sensory descriptions.  As graphics have improved, this has gone away to the detriment of the gaming experience.  A picture may say 1,000 words, but not necessarily the right words.  In adventures games, narrators felt like characters in their own right.  The narrator interacts with the player, compliments him when he solves a puzzle and mocks him when he is stuck.
<br>When entering Larry Reloaded, the veteran play will find himself in a familiar place, Lefty&#x2019;s Bar.  He&#x2019;s been here before and knows what to do.  The player walks up to the bar and orders a shot of whiskey.  Then he walks to the bathroom and gives that shot to a drunk.  However, instead of a TV remote, the drunk gives the player a coaster.  Suddenly the player&#x2014;who was content with a quick jog down memory lane&#x2014;realizes that Al Lowe and Josh Mandel are going to put him to work a bit.  The tweaked puzzles add some life to this game without taking away from the original purpose.
<br>Any fan of the series should be please with this update.  It is exactly what we were promised and then some.  I look forward to a remake of LSL2, which was always my favorite.  And I&#x2019;ll be the first in line to back that Kickstarter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3256608">Expand</a></span>

The artwork is beautiful and bright, the voice acting is top-notch and the music (by Grammy winning Austin Wintory) is even better.

<br>
<br>In the early part of last year a revolution of sorts began in gaming. That revolution being Kickstarter, the web-platform that allows you to post projects and get financial support from a community of people. (I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve heard of it, so I have no idea why I chose to explain it.) It&#x2019;s now around 14-15 months later and the first of these early gaming projects has been released! That game is Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards: Reloaded, a remake of the 1987 and 1991 game from Al Lowe. (I wrote a series of reviews a little over a year ago on the original Leisure Suit Larry game, as well as its sequels.)
<br>
<br>Providing a narrator  as well as having Jan Rabson reprise the role of Larry Laffer, gives the tale of love, perversion, and feelings not wholly unfamiliar a new lease on life.
<br>
<br>In fact, instead of delving into writing a new back story for this game, allow me to quote myself from last year:
<br>
<br>The original Leisure Suit Larry is the tale of Larry Laffer and his journey to city of Lost Wages (a clever play on Las Vegas) in search of the what all 40-year-old males are looking for: A way to lose his virginity. Isn&#x2019;t that just adorable? Larry&#x2019;s journey takes him down many paths in search of the right woman. Well, one path to be exact. Hey, this is a classic adventure game of the late-80&#x2032;s; linear games were the bread and butter of the gaming world at this time. Larry can travel all around Lost Wages and its stylish five locations: the Convenience Store; Disco; Casino; Wedding Chapel; and the most famous bar of them all, as stated by Destructoid, Lefty&#x2019;s Bar.
<br>
<br>Looking for Love in Lost Wages
<br>
<br>Larry; Larry Laffer is the very definition of a lovable loser. The man, for lack of a better qualification, is a character that is somehow unstuck in time. Larry, and what he represents, shouldn&#x2019;t make sense in the year 2013, yet here we are looking at a new game starring the aged protagonist. &#x201C;A new game?&#x201D; you might be asking. Yes, this is a new game, because while the bones may belong to the classic point-and-click adventure game of 20+ years ago, it has been reimagined and rewritten to bring it into the 21st century.
<br>
<br>The jokes, parts of the story, and even the puzzles have been rethought to both play up the nostalgia for those who played Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, while also making the game seem fresher in the eyes of a more modern audience. Honestly, after playing through it yesterday I am finding it hard to figure out if it is set in the 1980&#x2032;s or 2010&#x2032;s. The jokes work from the perspective of either era; particularly with the narrator regularly breaking the fourth wall to comment on the jokes themselves.
<br>
<br>Speaking of that narrator, Neil Ross makes his triumphant return to Leisure Suit Larry after having narrated the last true Larry game, Love for Sail back in 1997. Our younger readers, or anyone that never played an LSL title will likely recognize Neil from his work as the voice of the codex in the Mass Effect series. This, for the record, is a total mindfrell for me and at least partially explains my fascination with both series. Providing a narrator to this classic Larry adventure, as well as having Jan Rabson reprise the role of Larry Laffer, gives the tale of love, perversion, and feelings not wholly unfamiliar a new lease on life.
<br>
<br>The Times They Are a-Changin&#x2019;
<br>
<br>Being a remake of a remake of a classic game, there are obviously some changes in store. I already mentioned that some of the puzzles and jokes have been rethought in an effort to spice up the title, but that&#x2019;s not the only reason for a change. Due to the success of the Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded Kickstarter campaign last year, the folks at Replay Games were able to add in a new &#x201C;conquest&#x201D; for the &#x201C;venerable&#x201D; Larry Laffer. Jasmine is a lovely, as well as welcome addition to the game; one in which I will not spoil. While her storyline doesn&#x2019;t top the joy and absurdness of one of my personal favorite love interests, Fawn, I will say that she adds a certain heat to the already enjoyable game. With the addition of Jasmine, the folks at Replay Games and N-Fusion Interactive took the liberty of reworking some of the overall structure of Leisure Suit Larry. In the old days Larry would have the option of tracking down a certain inflatable friend in the hotel room of Eve, the final conquest, inflating said friend, and following it out onto the deck where he would meet the aforementioned Eve. In the new game, things are changed up drastically. Larry finds the blow-up doll still in the closet of a hotel room, but not the same one as before. Said balloon friend is also in terrible condition, requiring of an item that is acquired from Jasmine. It&#x2019;s a slight change, sure, but it changes up the flow and forces longtime Larry fans to rethink their strategies for completing the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3249347">Expand</a></span>

<br>They could probably have gotten away with simply updating the graphics to modern standards, but the improvements don&apos;t stop there. Almost every item you see on screen can be clicked on and interacted with in multiple ways. And each interaction results in a unique response. There are no generic lines to be found anywhere. The changed and added puzzles make the game interesting even for long-time Larry fans. The story is still basically the same, but many of the puzzles need to be solved differently. And, of course, there is a new sub-plot with a new girl added to the game.
<br>
<br>There is just one change that I didn&apos;t like. In the previous versions of the game you were awarded points for your actions. You could easily finish the game without the maximum points and you just knew that you missed something in the game. That added to the replayability. In the new version, the score system is unfortunately gone. It is no big deal, but I hope it will be back in future Larry games.
<br>
<br>If you liked the first Larry game before, you will like Larry Reloaded even more. If you only know the Larry from Magna Cum Laude or Box Office Bust, this is a game to show you why Larry Laffer is one of the most beloved characters in game history. If you always hated adventure games, this will probably not make you change your mind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3251239">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are amazing and they put a lot of time into the soundtrack this time. Overall it was enjoyable and brought back good memories of my childhood. The only reason I don&apos;t give a 10 is because I thought there would be much more new content than was added to this game. I was disappointed that some of the doors in the backgrounds that couldn&apos;t be entered and some of the items that couldn&apos;t be used. I can&apos;t understand why they were put there. I guess I just can&apos;t wait for a brand new Larry game to be released.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3260254">Expand</a></span>

The jokes aren&apos;t that dirty either, but more subtle and funny hints towards sexual things.
<br>
<br>Only thing keeping people from this might be the controls. It takes a while to get used to. Older players might be immediately comfortable with it, but younger players might never have seen this kind of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3250933">Expand</a></span>

Returning things back to Al Lowe and the original story-line was exactly what the franchise needed to get things going back in the right direction.
<br>
<br>While Larry Reloaded is a remake of the original  enough time has passed that the game felt new  and the addition of extremely solid voice-talent brought all the original humor to a new level.  Some serious laugh-out-loud funny moments  especially the dialogue with the hooker  too funny!
<br>
<br>A great music score also really kept those &quot;what am I suppose to do now&quot; moments flowing  and updates to the mission style that allows more exploration and removal all dead-ends made the game more enjoyable than the original.  I beat the game in a few sittings, but going back through now to enjoy some of the great narrator jokes connected to just about every object in the game.
<br>
<br>For fans of the click-and-point Adventure style games that Sierra made popular back in the day will love Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded  and for those who never had the pleasure, welcome to the party.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3257663">Expand</a></span>

I would&apos;ve given it a ten, but I would have liked to see some nudity easter eggs vis a vis Love for Sail, it is supposed to be an adult series after all.</span>

I&apos;ve been able to play on a 2012 Mac Mini and a desktop PC with 6 cores and a beefy NVIDIA GPU and the game runs smooth on both systems. The game uses an interface similar to the later LSL games with mouse driven actions rather than the old school text input, but it makes the game easy to navigate. It&apos;s a good remake and I hope they remake other games in the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3264247">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So, is Larry : Releaded any good?
<br>
<br>Yes! - if you can can tolerate the one (big) flaw this game has:
<br>
<br>The aniamtion.  Most animations only have a few frames, and feel more like scrolling your eyes over a comic than seeing a cartoon.
<br>
<br>But once you made your peace with that flaw (your brain will adapt quick, and your imagination will start to fill the gaps in animation), you get a really nice treat : this game.
<br>
<br>Larry is truly back.
<br>The game looks and sounds awesome, the voice actors are all great, the puzzles still hold up, Los Wages is soaked with atmosphere, and Larry is the same loveable loser you remember from Larry 7.
<br>
<br>They even added new content and mixed the puzzles up (compared with the original).
<br>I bought this game for the full price at day one and never regret it.
<br>
<br>Enjoy yourself, go hunt some tails and don&apos;t get killed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=4429170">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, the ages-old age verification remained true to its originally-annoying form but if it was easy to get around it then, it remained just as easy today (even easier, since you can just google the answers if actually fill it out).
<br>As to the game itself, the humor  the beating heart and soul of the LSL games  is top notch. What a difference it makes to have the Al Lowe, the actual man behind the original games, heavily involved in this game (the past few &quot;Larry&quot; games released since LSL7 were without his involvement  and boy does it show).
<br>The visuals are a treat, and the sound and music even more so  kudos to Austin Wintory on a fantastic score that never seems out of place.
<br>In the end, a shiny, funny new version of and old classic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3249000">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is games that make people laugh hard! Cheers!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3250716">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve played all the Larry games in my youth  starting with a second-hand copy of Larry 3 as a kid, then went and and got the collector&apos;s edition and Larry 7 when it released. The controls have definitely improved and have been simplified and the interface in Reloaded is a treat to work with!
<br>Everything is so fluid and responsive and the backgrounds and sprites really pop on a 1080p screen. Why the loader doesn&apos;t remember which video mode you&apos;d set prior though is puzzling. Considering gambling is a key element to the game I&apos;m surprised also that there is no automatic way to &quot;bet max&quot; and instead have to left-click the &apos;increase bet&apos; button multiple times as holding down the mouse button results in an &apos;ability wheel&apos; style overlay which I probably didn&apos;t use as much as I should have.
<br>
<br>All the above aside, I had a blast sinking a solid few hours into this game last night and with no walkthroughs or Google auto-suggestions, I was on my own with the puzzles which have been freshened up and a whole new section had me stumbling around lost for a while. When I finally discovered my missing link it all seemed &quot;so obvious&quot; in hindsight :)
<br>
<br>A relatively short game for $20, though if I had never played the series before it definitely would&apos;ve taken longer. 8 out of 10 (after a beer or two  from me!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3247386">Expand</a></span>

The original Leisure Suit Larry from 1987 was the first game I ever interacted with....as a toddler, so in short, Larry is my Super Mario (quite the comparison, eh?) Reloaded is really more a remake, then a reboot. This time with crisp, animated visuals, a full jazz-ensemble soundtrack (It ain&apos;t no Roland MT-32!), full voice acting, and new puzzles.
<br>
<br>Presentation wise, Reloaded hits a good majority of the marks. A few scenes come off as a bit out of place. The transition scene when riding in the cab, does look a bit cheap, and face-to-face close ups of the wonderful leading ladies, while beautify drawn, clash with the game&apos;s frequent, cartoonish art-style.
<br>
<br>On the audio frontier, the game&apos;s soundtrack is pleasant to listen to. While the soundtrack from the 1991 VGA remake is incredible, and nostalgic, it was nice to see a lot of new, original music accompany Larry as you attempt to &quot;score&quot; in Lost Wages. Voice acting is top notch. Having Jan Rabson return as the lovable loser, Larry Laffer, pretty much seals the deal. Laffer aside, the other voices are executed wonderfully, and compliment the writing.
<br>
<br>Speaking of which, the Larry games (The &apos;Al Lowe&apos; titles) have always been very well written. The jokes rarely miss, and really enhance the environment and tone of the game. Reloaded stands strong amongst previous entries in the series, and still shows that Leisure Suit Larry is still one of gaming&apos;s funniest brands. What might stand out is, excluding the two 3D entries to the series, Reloaded is easily the raunchiest Larry title of the bunch, but it feels natural due to the public&apos;s desensitized attitude towards adult humor in today&#x2019;s world. Never being unintentionally tasteless, the smart writing and clever jokes will never have the subject matter make the player feel like a complete pervert.
<br>
<br>The largest change comes to the gameplay. The game does share a very similar story line and puzzle set to the original. There are plenty of new routes and places to explore to complete the game. A walkthrough of the 1987 title, or its 1991 remake, will not get you through this 2013 version. This leaves the game presenting a near perfect balance in familiarity and freshness. The puzzle design is far more sophisticated than the original, and requires the player to think more outside-the-box, then before. Luckily, the refreshed user interface pacifies any intimidation the player may have.
<br>
<br>However, some of the weaker points from the original title has made its way back into Reloaded. Namely, the quick-save/quick-load gambling tactic. You constantly need to have cash in your inventory in order to progress. Thankfully, this time around you don&apos;t lose if you become broke, and the designers have made it so you can get back on your feet rather quickly once you&apos;re penniless. While this does reduce unnecessary challenge, it does handicap any urgency when it comes to balancing your finances. Cab rides and questionable women don&apos;t pay for themselves!
<br>
<br>Death, a factor quite common in old adventure titles makes a return, but merely for comedic purposes. Dying has no penalty, and is merely a creative way of saying &quot;You screwed up! Try again!&quot; Death is generally avoidable and won&apos;t happen too often.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, what we have is a solid remake of a PC-gaming classic. It&apos;s familiar, nostalgic, yet fresh. Though this title will mainly appeal to fans of Sierra, Al Lowe, and Larry himself, young adventure game aficionados should expect a great time creeping through Lost Wages. If this is the first in a series of remakes, and/or a sign of getting a real Leisure Suit Larry 8, I can say I eagerly await future products from this team. Al Lowe, and Replay Games show that Larry will never be a winner with the ladies, but he&apos;ll always be a winner to us gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3250715">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is, like the games it remakes, an 80&apos;s sex comedy centering around the loser protagonist trying to get lucky in Lost Wages. It&apos;s funny, offers some new twists for people who played the original. Adventure game newbies used to detailed hint systems or interfaces that highlight objects may find the game difficult, but it plays like a classic adventure to the core- although the deaths are far less inconvenient, serving more as gag scenes for the player. If you like classic adventures and don&apos;t mind some ribald comedy, check it out. If you expect it to be something it&apos;s not...steer clear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3250554">Expand</a></span>

Their useless opinions are not what&apos;s  important, what matters is the opinions of all the people that chose to help fund the making of this game.  I can honestly say Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded is worth every penny I contributed through Kickstarter and more.  Thank-you Replay for renewing the classic first Leisure Suit Larry game for the world to enjoy again.

<br>
<br>With that apart, I&apos;ve been playing Larry since the 90&apos;s, and this one is a welcome sight. After Box Office Bust, I thought the series would die. Maybe with this little push, someone will pick Larry up again and launch a new adventure, because the character definitely deserves it. I&apos;ve only played for half an hour (not counting the time I spent trying to get those damn questions right), and noticed that the same puzzles are there, but with a nice twist. On the 1st game you&apos;d get the remote and automatically change channels on the TV in the pimp&apos;s room, on &quot;Reloaded&quot; you have to get the batteries for the remote. The password to the pimp&apos;s room, which was previously conveniently written on the bathroom wall, now is more well hidden. Can&apos;t wait to get home and play it for a couple more hours. If you were born long enough to play the entire series, like I did, I definitely recommend you this game. If Larry Laffer doesn&apos;t ring you any bells... well... at least give it a rent and see what you think.
<br>
<br>Those pesky questions and the slightly boring narration that makes me just want to skip all those filler dialogues were a bit of a turnoff for me, but even though I played for little time, I still think it&apos;s great. I give it an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3248603">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Leisure Suit Larry remains true to the spirit of the original game while incorporating updated artwork and a excellent user interface.  The new music score and dialog help as well.  The most amazing thing is the depth.  There&apos;s so many things you can try, every object and action can be applied to everything in the game, often with very amusing results.

<br>Bravo!</span>

Sure it&apos;s not got smooth animation or state-of-the-art sh*t, but damn, it looks good (the art is great), sounds good and feels freakin great. Great effort and it&apos;s money better spent here than on bloody diablo 3.</span>

I loved the whole LSL series and I was a kickstarter supporter of the campaign because of it. I played many of the games multiple times, but perhaps I have aged a little too much, matured, or perhaps I just see a wee bit too much of the old Laffer in myself these days. The humor was good for the most part, I found the re-mix of a few puzzles confusing, and while the visuals were nice I found the animation a bit too choppy for my tastes. Nit picking I know, still bothered me a bit in this day of fantastically powerful devices. I do give kudos for the excellent cross platform support and it runs quite nicely on my Linux system which alone buys a few points from me. Overall I am happy with the experience, but I would like to have seen a bit more polish, and I really hope instead of going though the series again we will see LSL8 sooner rather than later.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3247316">Expand</a></span>

My biggest disappointment was the fact that beyond the graphical update, there was nothing new bars some puzzle tweaks. I think the kickstarter funds would have been better placed creating an entirely new Larry, based on what worked with the old ones as many of the &apos;modern&apos; Larrys are utter crap. I&apos;d have liked a continuation from Love For Sail, which was going to be called Lust In Space. This is a novelty and quickly wore thin for me and can&apos;t believe it took $600,000+ to achieve. Good game if you&apos;re nostalgic, but I think random gamers with no experience of Larry &quot;won&apos;t get it&quot; etc. Very funny, sarcastic humour, all amusing, but still short of that in Love For Sail. If any of the team involved happen to read this, consider Lust In Space next, continuing from the abduction scene at the end of Love For Sail </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3251189">Expand</a></span>

Compared to it, this remake of the original feels quite limited. It looks beautiful however and does bring back some fond memories. I recognize that Lowe had an extremely tough job, LSL is a series of games that were designed with a very different kind of Sunday afternoon in mind, one that existed somewhere in the early and mid 90&apos;s and then promptly disappeared, along with much of the world&apos;s innocence. He chose to play it safe and aim mainly at the people who have played the original and wanted an updated version without much else, and that&apos;s fine. I hope he remakes the rest of the early titles as well and makes some money for his retirement, I&apos;d gladly contribute to that without second thought. I would love to see a brand new LSL game from him, but I&apos;m not sure you can do that anymore and make a game that is as saucy as the original games were for their time, when you are dealing either with people who will instantly rush for a guide when they are stuck at a puzzle, or a horde of hypocritical douchebags who spend half their day watching porn and the other half screaming &quot;MISOGYNY&quot; at the slightest sexual innuendo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3269303">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game has all the fun of the first game, well the point-and-click version that is, and the excellent voice actor from the last good Larry games...
<br>I&apos;m not counting the cheap knock-off games in the &quot;post Al era&quot;... they never happened..

<br>
<br>Years later and it is the first kickstarter video game to be released. The graphics... are still nothing to write home about. In fact, some of the graphics are down right bad. However, the audio, the music, the humor, is spectacular. Every click with every type of mouse pointer gives a different result for every location. What happens when you look at a girl&apos;s arm? or lick the sidewalk or type and pick up a building? The narrator will have a unique and sometime hilarious response to your every action. That is what this game is really all about. Some unique Al Lowe humor that everyone has come to know and love. This humor is what was sorely missing in the 3D versions of this game and I missed it so much. Just wished the fixed up the sprite animations more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3251536">Expand</a></span>

<br>I found this trash very repetitive, a lot of boring and lame mini games inserted in a bad game with bad and uninspired characters. Larry franchise never was good, but this game is the worst of all the trash they were throwing to us. I feel sorry for the people to have the suffer buying this trash. The lack of ideas is very noticeable in this game, the mini games are almost the same over and over again, and the gameplay becomes incredibly boring and Larry seems like he never have sex with a woman, and looks like he never can do it. Every time when he is close to have something with a woman, something ridiculous happens. The game is bad in almost every aspect, sure make me laugh a couple of times, but finally i was laughing because i can&apos;t believe how BAD AND BORING this trash is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=4251278">Expand</a></span>

Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded is everything you&apos;d expect from the original VGA remake in 1991, if they had access to 2008 technology, and that shouldn&apos;t be mistaken as a compliment.  There is new content, to be sure, but it&apos;s not substantial enough to bear the burden of all the old material and puzzles while you trod through the game.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s talk of a LSL2 reboot done in a similar vain.  I would hope that Replay (an almost ironically apt company name) forgoes rewashing more of Sierra&apos;s old laundry and instead focuses on expanding the Larry universe with fresh stories, characters, and design philosophy.
<br>
<br>At $19.99, I can&apos;t suggest this turkey to any adventure gamer that has grown up and acquired discriminating taste in interactive storytelling.  It would have been more palatable at $5.99 as nostalgic curio for tablets or smartphones for those of us eager to relive what we have already done so, many times before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3251941">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I adored the old Larry games which I played through multiple times as a kid, and recently just to revisit the franchise. This remake plays worse that the old games, with frustrating controls, an annoying voice over, dull and inconsistent graphics etc.
<br>This game is a thorough disappointment.</span>

If you&apos;re a fan of Leisure Suit Larry, you probably already have this game and nothing more needs to be said. If you&apos;re an adventure game fan that never really played the 1987 or 1991 versions of Leisure Suit Larry, but curious as to what they&apos;re about, I&apos;d recommend you give this one a shot. Otherwise, you may want to reconsider checking it out as there&apos;s some worthy competition in the adventure gaming sphere nowadays.

They delivered EXACTLY what they promised.  I read the official &quot;metacritic&quot; reviews and I think just because they don&apos;t like this type of game they shouldn&apos;t be reviewing it.

I played them all when I was in high school so I hope they remake them all, especially 2 since I almost got to the end and realized I had to start from the very beginning again!!  I&apos;m so glad they got Al Lowe back.....he&apos;s why I bought it!!!</span>

<br>For the dirty old jokes and for all the memories with this awesome serie, this game got all my support, awesome job. Recommended</span>

There are TONS of dialogue, most of it very funny. Kudos to Al Lowe, Josh Mandela and Paul Trowe for bringing Larry back. Now remake LSL2!</span>

<br>It does fail a little with the animation, it&apos;s quite clunky at times and bugs (such as with save games and achievements) have not been addressed, which is disappointing.  The interface also feels rather unwieldy and slow compared to newer titles.

<br>Calloo Callay! Call in all your sick days, pour yourself your favorite beverage and sit down at your computer. After almost 20 years and two horrible remakes the lovable loser Leisure Suit Larry is back.
<br>A brief history of Larry
<br>In the year 1987 Sierra on-line released a game called leisure suit Larry in the land of the lounge lizards, about a 40-year-old Virgin who comes to the city of Lost Wages after his mother and father moved to Florida. This leaves Larry free to find true love so he goes to a small town outside Las Vegas called Lost Wages.
<br>Larry Reloaded
<br>Even if you haven&#x2019;t played the original Larry or an adventure game of any kind; no worries. This graphic adventure game uses a point-and-click interface. The Larry Reloaded plot is basically the same as the classic Larry version with Larry looking for true love. The puzzles have been changed, and are relocated. The Larry Reloaded game starts off with Larry pulling up in a cab in front of Lefties bar in the town of Lost Wages. This game is very colorful figuratively and literally. The high definition graphics of this game are awesome.
<br>The new girl is a really nice addition in the story. Without giving away too much, the machinations you go through to get the new girl to go out with Larry was, to put it in Larry&#x2019;s vernacular, &#x201C;the climax wasn&#x2019;t worth the finish.&#x201D;
<br>It is great to have Al Lowe and Josh Mandel at the helm of this reboot. The jokes are fast and furious and, most importantly, funny. Jan Rabson expertly performed the voice of Larry. I am extremely excited that the Larry franchises are back and I very much hope that the people who backed this game will back the next one. I know I will. I cannot wait to see what new humor and graphics are in store in the next installment.
<br>I give this game an &#x201C;A&#x201D;.

<br>
<br>The only drawback, in my opinion, is the exagerated use of the narrator in the game. Wherever you go, whatever you do, everytime you click the left button of the mouse, you get a long and well-acted presentation from the narrator. Why is this bad, you ask? Because the long speeches get boring and tedious and kind of hurt the gameplay. At a certain point I started cutting the narrator mid-sentence, since I wanted to move on, thus missing some important information.
<br>
<br>All in all, despite the tedious narrator, I had fun. Definitely worth buying if you like point-and-click adventures, and especially if you&apos;ve played one of the previous versions (the original from the late 80s, I think, and the point-and-click remake from the early 90s).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3815578">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story is as simple as it is hilarious. The whole premise of the game is you are playing 40 year old virgin Larry and your goal is to find &quot;love&quot; (get laid). Larry as well as all the other characters in this game are hilariously written. Seriously it has been awhile since I laughed this much at a game. None of the characters are particularly &quot;likeable&quot; in the same way that none of the South Park characters are &quot;likeable&quot;. They are all theives, liars, jerks, ext. but they are all really funny and enjoyable to interact with.
<br>
<br>Visuals/Sound-
<br>The 2-D handdrawn animations are all really well done and a pleasure to look at while still being loyal to the spirit of the original classic from way back when, same thing with the backgrounds and designs, basically the over all art style is appealing. The music is all really laid back (with rare moments of intensity when it fits the moment) and really helps set the mood, the sound effects all work as well and some of them are pretty funny. The voice acting ranges from pretty good to meh at best but no one is outright terrible in this.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-
<br>This game is a classic point and click adventure through and through but that is likely because (to my knowledge) the gameplay is largely unchanged from the original which isn&apos;t a bad thing at all. This game is every bit as fun as other point and click adventures like Kings Quest, Grim Fandango, and of course the other Leisure Suit Larry games. (Though I prefer Grim Fandango out of all of them XD) My only real complaints being that the UI is a bit finicky sometimes and that like most adventure games it takes forever to figure out what you need to do and unlike most of them their aren&apos;t that many clues to lead you on your way.
<br>
<br>Verdict-
<br>If you are into this genre of game then you need to play this game. I don&apos;t know if its worth playing through if you have already played the original but I would wager it is just for the higher quality audio and visuals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded/user-reviews?user_review_id=6274518">Expand</a></span>
