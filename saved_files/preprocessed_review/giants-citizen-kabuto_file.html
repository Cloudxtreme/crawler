I remember Giants came out relatively close to American McGee&apos;s Alice, another perfect 10. 2000 was a very good year.

Nevertheless, the PC version (from GoG) is incredibly, incredibly broken on Windows 10. I&apos;m not sure whether the original version was this bad. All the physics and hit detection fail to work correctly. Unless an enemy stops moving, my bullets will fail to hit it. The game isn&apos;t one bit balanced, and the save points vary all over the place. Some levels are way too long, and some are way too easy. It&apos;s quite repetitive. Every time I climb up a mountain, it feels like I&apos;m glitching my way through the game, yet that&apos;s the way to beat it. It feels like there was very little quality control put into the gameplay itself. On the other hand, I really, really like the smartass humor in this game. Its dialogue is a masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/giants-citizen-kabuto/user-reviews?user_review_id=5883418">Expand</a></span>

Just watching to cut scenes makes me crack up in laughter. This is a cult classic with a gripping and hilarious story line that is easy to follow and an amazing game play engine where you play as marines, then as a magical witch then finally as the Giant himself. While the first two modes are fantastic, the Giant can feel way too repetitive and a really letdown of a final chapter. Giants Citizen Kabuto also had an online mode which I believe is still active with a small group of people who organise game sessions. Overall amazing game, if you like a good laugh and an amazing game, play Giants Citizen Kabuto!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/giants-citizen-kabuto/user-reviews?user_review_id=7058002">Expand</a></span>
