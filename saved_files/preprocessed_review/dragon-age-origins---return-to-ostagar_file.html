It all seemed to start soon after they were sucked into the &apos;Evil Empire, EA. They started to add something to their games called DLC. Presumably these letters stand for &apos;Done Like Crap&apos;. Because they sure were. Almost every bit of DLC for Dragon Age and Mass Effect was a rip-off plain and simple. Some of it offered overpowered items. Some of it offered a couple of hours of game time. None of it evolved the game in question. For Dragon Age, a largely plot driven game, the DLC was lamentably bad. Please remember that in my new scoring system 5/10  0/10 in the old reckoning. Let&apos;s hope if Bioware continues with DLC in the future they eventually learn to make it worthwhile for the PLAYERS, not just a way of ripping-off their customers.
<br>
<br>THE GROT REVIEW CRITERIA: After a long time writing reviews like an anus, think its time to set a few bad habits straight: Stop insulting designers. Show some respect for the design process and getting games in circulation. Hence (1) No Red scores. (2) Game scores as follows: Bad Game 5/10. Poor Game 6/10. Mediocre Game: 7/10. Good Game 8/10. Great game 9/10. Stella Game 10/10. To get 10/10 it must be a game that can be (theoretically) play-able for 1000+ hours. Not only great but near endless fun. Games may be bad or poor but making them should earn respect. Thus even the worst POS will still be a 5/10. 0/10 no longer exists in my vocabulary. Yellow is the new red.
