They are so bad, that I honestly think Atari tested the entire PC version using the xbox controller. The major problems were: 1. Constantly being pulled out of first person view to get a better view of nothing. 2. Having to turn your character using the keyboard keys when holding a two-handed object such as an axe or a burning piece of wood. 3. Not being able to effectively use any of the objects you hold, if you stand in front of a door and attempt to bash the door in with a large object, you will swing it sideways and hit the wall, you always swing something the same way no matter what it is or what you are doing with it. Also, you can not swing something if it is on your left side, you have to pull it to the right using the mouse and then click to swing, why doesn&apos;t the mouse click just do that automatically (they the game doesn&apos;t inform you of this fact either). 4. Even at max settings, the game looks pathetic. Character textures look decent enough, but the far away textures and models (such as cars on the street far below you in the first level) look like they were rendered in Quake 3. The lighting is also terrible. In low lit areas, the game looks like it has an 8-bit color depth. A gray concrete floor will have swatches of green, blue, and orange swimming across it. Also, objects against a pitch black background will appear fully lit and objects in a partially, but still low lit area will appear pitch black as if texture-less. Bottom line, Atari failed to meet the minimum threshold of quality that any reasonable person would expect when purchasing this game. I gave it 1 point for installing without problems, running smoothly, and being entertaining for about 3 minutes. Other than that, the game is an epic failure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alone-in-the-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=414476">Expand</a></span>

I would highly recommend it if you own a good pad, or invest in one. Console ports are here to stay, and if they&apos;re like AITD, I&apos;m more than a happy camper. Good on them!</span>

Glad I picked it up from the bargain bin and didn&apos;t pay the full price as I would have felt pretty angry about it.

I spent too much time trying to get use to the awkward PC controls. The frequent need to switch between 1st and 3rd person views was the biggest problem. The 3rd person &quot;fixed&quot; view required orienting the main character with keyboard controls while the 1st person required using the mouse with the view rotating. I know my description is not easy to understand but believe me the character controls were almost unusable. The illogical trial and error method of progressing through the game was too much for me with lots of failures and restarts. Please game developers, at least give me a clue what&apos;s going on! The music in the game was probably good but it gets very old listening to when you have to continually use trial and error to get through levels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alone-in-the-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=1761654">Expand</a></span>

Apparently the FPS generation just doesn&apos;t get it and what I do not get is why a game that in its control scheme is so very similar to Resident Evil 4, why everyone is dumping on it. Like RE4, the controls are set up in easy FPS mode because its a SURVIVAL HORROR game. Take the time to learn them and you&apos;ll find the game is actually fun, very immersive and extremely atmospheric. There is destruction on a level of epicness in a game that I have never experience and I&apos;ve been playing games for a very long time and it gets pretty intense. Sure you die a lot, but the game does a really good job and creating subtle little &apos;checkpoints&apos; so you don&apos;t get frustrated at having to do everyone over again. The use of the physics and fire and how they play a puzzle role in the game is nothing short of brilliant. There is about 100 different ways you can dispatch enemies, create items and explosives and even trails to them. I also really enjoyed the inventory system, it&apos;s real time, looks very cool and keeps the game engaging while in combat. The graphics are amazinging. The fire effects are by far the best I have ever seen in a game and the level of detail on the characters models in jaw dropping. I mean you can see their pores and it looks fantastic. The lighting, shadows and bump mapping are all done extremely well too. And the game runs very well given how it looks. I have no idea about why people are complaining about the bugs, I have yet to find a single one. As far as the 3rd person and 1st person complains they aren&apos;t very well grounded. It&apos;s a very understandable design decision. The game goes into 3rd person mode automatically to give you a hint that you need to interact with the environment to advance and the transition between the two is seemless - you simply push a button to toggle between them. Why would you complain about having to use first person mode to use your fire extinguisher? It&apos;s not a weapon and the only time you need to go into 1st person mode to use it is to extinguish flame (non combat activity) the rest of the time you are using it to bash doors down and that&apos;s it. What&apos;s to complain about? If you could use the fire extinguisher in 3rd person mode you wouldn&apos;t hit a lick of flame because it requires precise use of the analog stick to do. DO NOT play this game without an xbox 360 controller, very frustrating to attempt analog feats in the game with the keyboard. Keep an open mind when you play this game and allow yourself to get into its style and I promise you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alone-in-the-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=416486">Expand</a></span>

Far from the point-and-shoot-and-collect-ammo-from-the-fallen, this game forces you to think on your feet. Combining items in your inventory in the split second you&apos;ve managed to avoid an attack, making quick decisions whether or not this is a fight you could win, for those who insist on interest and challenge in their games this is the real deal. Having played the game with only a mouse and keyboard, I agree to the criticisms of it being awkward... for the first five minutes. Through proper acclimatization (ie. actually taking time to figure out how the game works) it springs out at you from a genre dominated by the same old weapons, the same old regenerative health system, and lack of engrossing situation. As a gamer I looked at it tentatively, having paid too much to the critical feedback. I cannot say enough about this game to those looking for more from their game collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alone-in-the-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=418207">Expand</a></span>

The lock-onto-enemy is a cheap addition for a game [it just proves that the 3rd person perspective for this game is so cheap that they had to make an extra function just to stabilize the movement]&#x2026; The only things enjoyable about this game are some of the game play features such as item selection, the graphics, physics, and special effects, and the nice frame rate (e7400  9600GT). I don&#x2019;t recommend this game, unless you collect games in hope that one day this one will be worth some money&#x2026; lol!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alone-in-the-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=2933701">Expand</a></span>

I bought that game for 19.99, a real steal... Use a gamepad, a XBOX 360 controller if you have that hardware.</span>

MAybe the controls are unfamiliar because the character moves on a 1st person perspective when using the 3rd person perspective. But those experienced gamers might remember, AITD1, 2, and 3 had the same controls. Great story and graphics, some bugs that&apos;s why the 8. Worth buying.</span>

It does a good job of making you feel like your character, a &quot;normal&quot; man with no knowledge of who he is, waking up in a world that&apos;s falling apart around him, and you do whatever you can to survive. I also like that you ARE &quot;normal&quot; and don&apos;t have &quot;superhuman&quot; abilities. So don&apos;t expect to be Bruce Lee, or Marcus Phoenix coming in with fantastic fighting styles or evasive, experienced military moves for combat. Where would be the real sense in danger if you did? It is what it is, fellas. I also love the &quot;healing&quot; factor in the game, and the fact that your inventory is limited to what you can hold in your jacket. FINALLY some inventory realism, and not someone who&apos;s able to mysteriously carry 15 different automatic rifles, hiding 120 invisible clips (god knows where), which, even if there was a feasable graphic to show such an inventory, would encumber someone to immobility. Come on now... Voice acting is not the best, but it&apos;s by far not the worst. Have you ever played the original Resident Evil? My god... the voice acting on that was good for laughs, and that&apos;s it. This is far better than that... I also love the variety of weaponry you can create! Moltaiv Cocktails (however it&apos;s spelled), aerosol can and a lighter... now who hasn&apos;t imagined using that combo as a useful weapon? The only unrealistic weapon I see is adding fuel to your bullets, but one little thing isn&apos;t going to kill the game for me, I simply don&apos; t use it. As far as the usage of chairs, or whatever else you pick up as a weapon... like I said, this is not Bruce Lee or anything, so your average joe will have a bit of difficulty using a chair as a weapon, so don&apos;t be expecting to fling it around as though you&apos;ve been battling off hordes of enemies with a chair your entire life. It SHOULD be awkward at first. The only things I&apos;ll give you, are the control system is a bit clunky, and the switch to first and third person view can be disorienting, but you get used to it after a while; and the sound is a bit muted in my opinion. I have to crank my TV up higher than ever to get a satisfying volume from it. You&apos;ll especially notice a lack in luster in the sounds while in the driving scenes. All in all, it&apos;s not perfect. That I&apos;ll admit. But it is by far the best Horror Survival game I&apos;ve seen since the Resident Evil series (which has taken bad turns in and of itself). So it lives up to it&apos;s genre. Replay value may be an issue, so it may end up being better in the &quot;rental&quot; setup... but then again, how different was the Resident Evil experience each time you played through it? That was one of the greats. It&apos;s all a matter of how much you can immerse yourself into the game. Also, today&apos;s society is spoiled, expecting everything to be easy and handed to them. Thinking the world owes them for the... endless... back breaking... &quot;work&quot;? God, does that even exist anymore? If so, why is the majority of our society insanely obese? Yah, y&apos;all have it hard... Not all games are going to be easy, ladies. Also, if you&apos;re running on a PC version, well, all PC&apos;s are different, and most people who give games bad reviews are running on sub-standard equipment anyways, and are reviewing unfairly. There&apos;s also incompatibility issues which your standard joe-blow gamer out there are never aware of, and end up cursing computers left and right. Again, unfair reviewing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alone-in-the-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=414728">Expand</a></span>

The game had lots of potential and some great ideas, such as the inventory system, analogue movement of objects and weapons, episodic gameplay, real time fire, etc. However, the game lets itself down on what should be the basics! For example, some functions are only available in a specific view (e.g. if you pick up a fire extinguisher you need to go into first person to spray it, but third person to hit stuff with it. that wouldn&apos;t be so much of a problem, however you cannot strafe in third person view, yet you can in first person. You can imagine this gets extremely frustrating as &gt;&gt; the player naturally tries to move around the same way, no &gt;&gt; matter what view is selected. To add to this, when the game loads an event (e.g. a wall falls down and the floor opens up in a room) the game automatically puts you in third person view, so you have to manually change view back to first person if thats what you prefer. These events usually happen more than once in a short space of time, forcing you to either stick to third person view, or keep changing back to first person! ggggrrr! Another really simple but annoying flaw is that the game has one button for open, and one for close! (you don&apos;t need two buttons for this! just one would have done!) There are also alot of other buttons that contribute to an over complicated control system that only serves to confuse the player, rather than help them through the game. Ultimately, this removes the player from the &quot;experience&quot; and the game loses all hope of immersing you in, what could have been, very atmospheric gameplay. This frustrating control system also applies to the way in which objects are held (maybe analogue sticks work on the 360) and the combat is badly effected. On one particular occasion i was fighting a bad guy, and had knocked him clean out. All i had to do was drag him onto the fire to finish him off. simple in real life, but frustratingly difficult in the game. Its a shame, because the game has some nice ideas, just nowhere near the polish of other AAA titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alone-in-the-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=414866">Expand</a></span>

I purchased this game for &#xA3;20 and I have to say I&apos;ve loved it (Not every second) but the music, acting (bad in a few places), locations and story (far fetched but worthy) cant really be the reason you point at this game and say... this games shit because of that. The controls I feel have let this entire game down and maybe the combat. Alone in the Dark is innovative, atmospheric and beautiful.

If you are expecting a traditional FPS shooter, prepare to be disappointed with the somewhat wonky controls and uneven pacing - but this is a really fun and ambitious action/adventure game despite its flaws. I definitely recommend the console version as I imagine the game&apos;s flaws will be amplified more on the PC. Normally an 8.5 but I want to bring the average up a bit since I feel this game has been unfairly rated due to inappropriate expectations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alone-in-the-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=416422">Expand</a></span>

Yea the learning curve on the controls was about 30 mins but after you get them down you don&apos;t want to go back to the traditional controlling of games... dont put the game down just because your to dumb to figure out how it works.</span>

Alone in the dark was a classic survivl horror and was the basis of what would become the popular Resident Evil franchise, however, newer games with new ideas started coming out and Alone in the Dark was left out in the dust. Atari quickly put their minds to work and decided to resurrect this forgotten franchise but make it fit in with the new demographic of gamers by taking out everything that made Alone in the Dark great and adding in every sort of cliche in horror game history.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is the biggest thing that&apos;s been butchered in Alone in the Dark as it literraly doesn&apos;t live up to it&apos;s name. You&apos;re not alone because there are tons of people that will follow you around at some point and you&apos;re rarely in the dark. You can play the game from a first or third person perspective but the controls for both of these perspectives are terrible. When in first person, your sight is limited to what you can see an you&apos;ll most likely get stuck on something and half the time, you won&apos;t even know what you&apos;re stuck on. In third person, the controls feel restricted and you&apos;ll struggle to pull of basic actions in the game. The camera is awful in the third person view because your mouse is terrible for controlling the camera and it constantly fights with you. I failed doing a certain jump near the beginning of the game and it took me 6 attempts to get right because the camera switched perspectives when I went to jump. There are a few gameplay elements which seemed like good ideas but weren&apos;t used up to their full potential. The inventory management is one of them. In game, when you want to look through your inventory, the game doesn&apos;t pause and you need to look down at yourshirt and actually select the items you want to use which is a great idea but, you might be shocked to hear this, the controls suck in the inventory screen. You will constantly try and navigate over to a certain item that you want, only for the game to take you to an item that you&apos;ve never needed before. The game is also buggy as hell and some bugs will prevent you from proceeding with the game.
<br>
<br>The story is that Mr. forgettable and unlikeable main character wakes up shortly before he is meant to be killed by some men for whatever reason and the thing is Mr. forgettable and unlikeable main character can&apos;t remember anything about himself. However some weird creatures stop him from being killed and he escapes the building with a little bit of information about his task and he also escapes with Ms. Obvious girlfriend for unlikeable and forgettable main character. So the 2 go out and try and complete the task he&apos;s been given and also figure out who he is. By a horror stand point, this plot has been done to death but most horror games add a unique thing to it to make their specific telling of this plot memorble. Alone in the Dark doesn&apos;t. It literraaly takes the bear bones of a plot structure and uses it as it&apos;s final product.
<br>
<br>Graphics are a mixed bag and the graphics is probably the best thing this game has going for it. Certain things in Alone in the Dark look amazing. The fire looks brilliant and it&apos;s great just to watch the fire spread across more of a surface. The game overall looks OK but there are quite a few badly textured things you will come across throughout playing Alone in the Dark. Sound is relatively bad aswell, mainly because some sounds are actually missing from th game, mainly in the SFX. Some sounds cut out randomly and for no reason at all aswell.
<br>
<br>The game is quite short for a horror game and you can complete it within about 12 hours (my timer counter is broken for this, probably because my steam account had mercy on me and it didn&apos;t want anyone else to know that I had played this game for 12 hours.) There is no reason to replay Alone in the Dark either because there are so many bad things that are included in this that youwill not want to put yourself through this torture anymore.
<br>
<br>This was meant to have been the great return of a classic survival horror video game series but instead we were left with a buggy, ugly and unfinished mess
<br>
<br>Final verdict
