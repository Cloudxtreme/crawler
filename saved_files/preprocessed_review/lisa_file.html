<br>If your looking for something different, if you think games are an art form to express things deeper than shooting things. If you like turn based combat and can stomach dark truths, I highly recommend this game but only for people 20+ young people will not get so much out of it.</span>

LISA is an intense, hilarious, touching, and shocking platformer with an amazing story, surprisingly in-depth combat system, solid controls and gameplay, and basically truckloads of content. It&apos;s a very long game for the platformer genre, averaging about 10 hours, but trust me, once you get to the end you&apos;ll still feel like it ended too early: I wanted more, though the length is perfect for the storyline.
<br>
<br>There are shocking scenes in this game, and I warn that it&apos;s not for everyone. Especially those with abusive pasts, or basically anyone young, as many scenes are--at a lack of better **** up. But that&apos;s exactly why I got this game, I love games that mess with your head and this was advertised as such and let me tell you, it did not disappoint in any manner. When you first start LISA you will be confused, maybe overwhelmed, and probably feel like you can&apos;t beat it at points. This game is EXTREMELY unforgiving (assuming you don&apos;t reload your last save everytime something bad happens): some enemies possess &quot;fatal&quot; moves, which can one shot any of your party members out of the game for eternity (it&apos;s said these are extremely rare, though it happened to me multiple times), resting some places can result in party members being stolen and possibly killed, and you are faced with many very tough decisions, usually involving your party member&apos;s lives and all your belongings you&apos;ve gathered.
<br>
<br>This game accomplishes everything it sets out to do: it&apos;s a huge (pretty much open) world, where you can adventure to find hidden secrets and other companions that will help you in battle. The story is engaging and it will have you in tears at the final few scenes (I&apos;ll admit I teared up at a few points in this game). LISA is a SOLID experience, and I feel like any story-driven game lover will love the heck out of this game simply because of that fact, if not for the solid combat system and hilarious scenarios.
<br>
<br>That was something I did NOT expect: for LISA to be funny. I thought it&apos;d be depressing and shocking the entire time, but some of the scenes in this game made be actually laugh out loud; the writing for this game is beyond brilliant, during the hilarious and dramatic scenes alike. One of my two complaints I have with this game is just how unforgiving it is sometimes: for example, there&apos;s an unavoidable event where you could potentially loose your entire party (if you have bad luck), and then the game is unbeatable with no companions. However, it adds a very cool feel to the game; the feeling that each choice really does matter, because it could have fatal consequences. It also lends to the game&apos;s foreboding and inevitable mood.
<br>
<br>LISA is depressing, so if you&apos;re looking for an upbeat adventure, despite the hilarious snippets, you may want to stray away from this game, as it will not necessarily put you in a good mood, but it is an amazing experience and I think most gamers (if not everyone) should experience this story regardless. My only other
<br>complaint is the balancing. I feel like the combat--despite the system itself being very solid--is a bit broken given the right team composition. I got a character that could &quot;Oil Up&quot; enemies, and then the other three people in my party could cause fire damage, which will always critical strike on Oiled Up enemies; thus melting many otherwise difficult characters in no time at all. Also, by late game I had so much money and items that I could easily stockpile healing and &quot;AP/TP&quot; items and last forever in combat. The game starts out with scarce resources, which is a great feeling for an apocalyptic game, but then gets a bit too easy later. And I&apos;m not talking about the final island, which I feel is perfectly balanced and wraps the combat up in an incredibly well-done manner.
<br>
<br>Though despite a few cracks like that, the foundation of this game&apos;s difficulty is otherwise solid. The curve can be a bit steep but once again, that lends to the overall mood of the game; making you feel hopeless, as you would if you were actually the main character. Brad is his name, and he has an abusive past, he finds a baby girl in a post-apocalyptic world where only men survive, thus vows to raise and protect her from everybody else, but one day she goes missing...
<br>
<br>Very engaging story, satisfying gameplay, basically no cons at all, tear-jerking, shocking, hilarious. Pick up LISA today, I even got it on sale for next to nothing, so I paid a couple dollars for a 10 hour long experience that really stuck with me and became one of my all-time favorite games, and that means a lot coming from someone who has played hundreds of games throughout their life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lisa/user-reviews?user_review_id=5327767">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>LISA&apos;s main concept, a Father trying to protect his (adopted) daughter - indeed the last female on Earth - is incredibly compelling. Without giving too much away, I&apos;ll also say that the protagonist was incredibly sympathetic and tragic, something which really had me invested in his welfare.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is good though not necessarily my cup of java. It&apos;s basically a polished Earthbound battle system with some neat mini-games thrown in. The battle system suits the quirky style of the game and is a bit more complicated then the typical turn-based &apos;Press A to Win&apos;, though it&apos;s pretty easy to just spam status ailments to get through.
<br>
<br>Overall I was pretty lukewarm where the actual game mechanics were concerned. They were decent but I found myself ploughing through just to progress the story. That being said, LISA definitely has an amazing narrative and aesthetic and for this alone it deserves all the praise it gets.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lisa/user-reviews?user_review_id=4858915">Expand</a></span>

LISA is a game made by one man, who goes by the name of Dingaling.  This man, is a genius.  He&apos;s made a masterpiece in LISA, and likely my current favorite game of all time.  First off:  this game&apos;s graphics.  While it isn&apos;t a 4k hyper-realistic piece, it&apos;s graphical style perfectly compliments the world.  A crazy **** of colorful characters and items in a destroyed and drowned out wasteland.  From a brothel run by cross-dressing guys, to a dilapidated fast-food restaurant, it all looks cool, creepy, and hilarious in needed measure.  The story is this game&apos;s shining point however.  It&apos;s an apocalypse wherin all the women have dissipated, and as such, everything went crazy.  You take control of Brad, but make no mistake, Brad is his own character.  He finds a girl in the middle of the desert, some 15 years into the apocalypse, and tries to protect her.  This goes about as well as you&apos;d expect, so it&apos;s off to try and get her back with the help of a colorful cast of party members, all of which are unique, and all of which can die.  Not in a perma-death way, but there are certain moves enemies have, along with choices you can make in-game, that will make them die.  Die as in not-come-back DEAD.  Which segways perfectly into choices.  Choices matter in this game, and not just on a story level.  You can lose party members, items, and even both your ARMS in this game (Which disallows certain combos.)  The gameplay it effects is wonderful, a great take on standard RPG fare, though some bits *Cough* Roulette *Cough* can be a bit ****  It&apos;s the standard RPG system, with TP and SP doing the normal RPGMaker TP and SP stuff, but the main character, along with a few party members, can do combos.  These combos do damage PLUS a special move if you input the correct combo.  Not all characters have this, however, which I think is for the best.  IT mixes things up in an interesting way.  All of this is tied together by a weird soundtrack.  Good weird.  Like... my favorite soundtrack weird.  It&apos;s impossible to describe without first listening to some of the music, but it invokes every emotion it&apos;s supposed to, and there&apos;s a rumor that it was all done on the trial version of FL Studio, which is insane.  So, is this game worth it?  More than any other.  It&apos;s a $10, life ruining experience, and one that you can NOT pass up, no matter what.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lisa/user-reviews?user_review_id=7377570">Expand</a></span>

LISA is yes, an RPG maker game, but what Dingaling did with the given material is outright remarkable. There are also tons of various things to discover that are not needed to beat the game, so it is expected to play it multiple times, heck, it even has multiple endings! The battle system is the tried and tested turn based battle system, but has a couple interesting mini games built in. Think DDR with punches. It is one of my favourite games of all time, and in my opinion, it makes even games like Bioshock, which I love, look like Call of Duty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lisa/user-reviews?user_review_id=6072885">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>We follow life of Bard Armstrong, hunted by memory of his abusive father and sister he left alone to abuse. He hides his pent up guilt in drug known as Joy. Years after white flash happened he tries to redeem himself by  raising the last women in secret as his daughter. Secrets is out and now Brad have to face strong enemies nad mysterious mutants  to not let his foster daughter be murder raped by entire Olathe. Setting is pretty dark and yet it&apos;s balanced by all the jokes and goofy characters you meet along the way.
<br>
<br>Story and world is good enough to keep you playing to the very end and even replay one more time.  What i didn&apos;t  liked is how little the choices you make have any impact on game beside fighting. Game also supports only one ending with different scrolling  dialogues at the end. I hoped for more diversity in story like for example after killing guy A other guy B will have some grudge, those little things would make in my opinion more fun replayability. But i liked story in overall.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is typical turn base rpg, you choose action of every teamate and see how it is going. Game adds to some characters  &quot;Dial Combat&quot; possibility to use keys W, A, S, D to cast ability instead of choosing it from list, it deals more damage. Great thing about this game is amount of teammates you can recruit to team and that decision you make during adventure can drastically affect Brad combat strength. Also some of your &quot;friedns&quot; and Bradley occasionally gain status &quot;withdrawal&quot; which harshly decreases their ability to dish out dmg so always keep bunch of joy pills to munch on in your adventures as it eliminate this status. One of best thing in the game is it&apos;s enemy variety, you almost never fight the same looking guy, and after first playthrough game have Hard difficulty which allows you to save only once at save points, change some enemies to stronger versions, gives you access to location that is locked normally. I don&apos;t advise playing it first time as it might be extremaly annoying. Game can be very hard for some unlucky players as many enemies are able to perma kill your team member with one hit more than once per fight. The best part of the game is it soundtrack, it fits perfectly. Even after i stopped palying i return to listen it.
<br>
<br>LISA is very interesting game not perfect but i advise it to everyone who would like something fresh in a world where AAA titles are to afraid to try  telling more intimidating story. SOOoO yeah try it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lisa/user-reviews?user_review_id=7507455">Expand</a></span>
