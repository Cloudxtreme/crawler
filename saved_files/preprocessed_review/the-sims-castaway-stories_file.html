<br>I think they almost discovered a new format for adventure games, only falling short by keeping your character to so many schedules and not allowing more investigation options within dialog.
<br>At any rate, it&apos;s a really nice way to introduce yourself to Sims games.
<br>I&apos;d love to see this done within the new sims 3 game, with the ability for users to create and publish their own stories.
<br>Minor annoyances mainly revolve around pathing of your sim, and space on your home lot, since there is very little space that is flat enough for all the rewards your sim receives during the course of the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-castaway-stories/user-reviews?user_review_id=83082">Expand</a></span>
