<br>
<br>Sound:Nothing memorable.Its an indiegame ok but at least a better music or weapon sounds would be nice.When i compare it to Shadowrun Satallite Reign loses when it comes to sound.I miss memorable music and more/better voiced dialogues.
<br>
<br>Visuals:I dont think the visuals help the game.It might fit the cyperpunk setting but everything is so bright that its hard to concentrade on the important things.If you use the world scan for example the game throws far too much colours at you at the same time and you need the world scan often.
<br>
<br>Another problem is the camera.Its constantly moving around a little bit and you cant rotate the cam freely.That can be a problem in some situations.
<br>
<br>All in all i dont like the artstyle too.Not much customization when it comes to your agents for example.Everything looks uninteresting to me compared to Shadowrun.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:The gmeplay is the real partycrasher.I understand when youre indie you might neglect visuals or/and sound but the gameplay is an important point and here Satellite Reign struggles the most.
<br>
<br>The AI is really inconsistent.Sometimes the AI spottes you behind cover, when i use the same cover after loading, it works(despite the same pathe of the security).That happened far too often to me and that is just one example.Another example is that the silent-kill sometimes not worked for me.It does little to no damage but the guardsman called instantly reinforcements.Nice move!
<br>
<br>I get the feeling weapons in the world of SR are pretty weak.I need several seconds to gun down a weak guardsman.3-5 shots with a sniper rifle to kill the weakest enemy in the game out of cover?I get it, its a game where you sneak around but this is dumb.
<br>
<br>The pathfinding is broken too.Sometimes my agents order is &quot;get into cover&quot; and every agent is doing that.....except one.He stands there and chills all day....is spotted of course and the mission ends because everyone dies.This should never happend in this kind of game!NEVER EVER!!!
<br>
<br>Is there a story in this game?I think not really.Its so little story and its so uninteresting presented to the player that it is amazing.That might be ok in the 90s but its nearly 2016!
<br>
<br>I dont understand the XP system.Why for example is my hacker nearly 1 1/2 levels ahead of every other agent?What is the system behind XP distribution?Every agent got different XP and between my soldier and the hacker is a gap of 1 1/2 levels.I dont understand that.
<br>
<br>Progression in the game is too slow and the things you can to are so limited that its boring.When i compare it to Shadowrun again its laughable what you can do.
<br>
<br>Another big problem in the game is how saves work.You cant save during missions in restricted zones.Combined with the bad AI/pathfinding this will become more than annoying.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:With all the things said, i think a person that like syndicate might like SR too.For me the game is too flawed, too many opportunitys wasted and the AI and pathfinding problems break the game completely.Its not a bad game dont get me worng but i had NO fun while i tried it out.Its so boring with no storytelling it pains me.Cant give this game a pass, sorry.Without the AI pathfinding problems the game might be a decent remake and a 6.But those problems are there and i cant ignore those points.Final score is just a 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=5926231">Expand</a></span>

<br>To get started satellite reign is a cyberpunk indie game that gets everything that is cyberpunk right, very right. From what I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s supposed to be a spiritual successor to the first Syndicate game (not the botched sequel) As times have changed and technology has improved it is fairly easy to say that it is a very good improvement on its source material.
<br>
<br>The graphics are at a level I never expected of a non-triple-A cashcow and the districts of the game are all  done beautifully. However performance leaves a lot to be desired and even with a very good PC you probably won&apos;t be able to run it at a smooth FPS.
<br>
<br>Story is not the games strong point and while it is there it seems to be almost wholly made up of the genres cliches, as if they wrote down a list and filled in all the ticks. The few surprises it does throw at you are almost comical, one such is the ending but I won&apos;t spoil that for you.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is probably the games strongest feature as it gives you an amazing amount of ways to tackle the obstacles in your way. It&apos;s hard to describe them all here as every facility you break into is different but suffice to say that everything from full on one man stealth to using an army of your own enslaved cybernetic enemies to to break down the door. This combined with the open world of the game (funny enough I&apos;ve never seen a true open world strategy game before this) make for many diverse playstyles. The mission goal though remain strangely the same and although this actually doesn&apos;t bother due to the superb facility layouts it can be seen as slightly repetitive. The only time the game tries to break off from its&apos; formula at the final boss (which is the only boss if you don&apos;t count the odd mech or two who are a real challenge to take down) it screws it up by making you kill him three times before you actually win.
<br>
<br>The bad;
<br>The AI is... more than a little inconsistent. At times you&apos;ll watch it pull of amazing feats of tactical ingenuity and other times you&apos;ll see it run searching for you in the opposite direction of your gunshots. This and it&apos;s amazing ability to summon zerg rushes out of nowhere can be rather frustrating because then once you&apos;ve died you realize you&apos;ll have to do most if not all of the facility you were breaching again as there are no checkpoints while in enemy territory. Your squads AI too is susceptible to the inconsistencies as once I watched one of my man sprinting into another of my men without a clue that her could just walk around him.
<br>
<br>So final Verdict! :7/10
<br>As hard as this game was to get into at first I truly enjoyed myself playing it however I can&apos;t ignore the flaws, for all its polish and finesse the games bad AI and optimization issues coupled with it&apos;s lack of mission variety bring it down from what would have been a stellar 9.5 to a better than average 7. If you&apos;re the kind of person that can ignore these issues and is craving some cyberpunk then this is your cup of tea. If you a masochist who squee&apos;d whenever they died in dark souls then this game is also for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=5455154">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There&apos;s a lot of emergent gameplay here, as you guide your little band around the pedestrian-filled streets alleyways and plazas. The visuals are great, the weapon effects sharp and satisfying. You can tell the developer was passionate about the source material. The writing is competent and does a good job of fostering immersion. And the gradual accumulation of new gadgets and weapons gives a strong sense of progression.
<br>
<br>I have run into a few bugs here and there, but nothing major. The save system is built to prevent &quot;save spamming&quot;, so be prepared to steer your agents with caution any time you have them in combat or an area they are not authorized to be in. Have an escpae plan already in mind, and use it if things go all sideways on you. Worst case, you just spend some credits to quickly re-clone them at the nearest drop zone. If you can&apos;t afford that, you can re-clone them with a small experience penalty.
<br>
<br>There is no manual, which was a little regrettable, but I haven&apos;t found it too tough to learn the systems. The in-game tutorial is adequate to get you the basics.

<br>On the whole, a fantastic game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=5454668">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s satellite reign.  It&apos;s a little rough around the edges.  But when you consider it had less than 5 years and less than a million thrown at it, compared to most AAA games, it far out shines both in content, execution, and attention to detail.  Don&apos;t expect perfect AI, perfect pathing (what game really does?)  Or to know exactly how to proceed all the time.  You won&apos;t be spoonfed, but you won&apos;t be punished for ignorance the game left you with either.  Death has a cost, but only enough to punish your own mistakes.  And difficulty isn&apos;t created by simply forcing you to spend time like Destiny and other games over the past decade have done, difficulty comes with complexity, comes with whether or not you equipped your crew and chose the right skills.  And at 20-30 hours of gameplay if you focus, at most you&apos;re paying $1 per hour of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=5467326">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Good - the core gameplay is good and the graphics look great. The game does manage to retain the cyberpunk atmosphere of Syndicate Wars.
<br>
<br>Bad - by far the biggest problem is lack of customization for your team; I thought I would be able to design each of my agents from scratch and then gear them up before each mission. But no, each agent is predetermined and gear NEVER changes in appearance. All you can do is &apos;clone&apos; random npc&apos;s but all that changes is the head and hairstyle, so disappointing. You don&apos;t even get the freedom to deploy your team; instead you are forced to field each of the 4 classes instead of the classes you want to field.
<br>
<br>The devs really, really should have allowed the player full freedom of customization for the agents. Having a &apos;base&apos; would have worked better than always being in the game map.
<br>
<br>Verdict - Ironically, the games from 90&apos;s that inspired this actually do a lot of things better than this, like the Cryovat chamber where you applied mods to each cyborg and a clear mission briefing. If they brought out  an update that allowed me to fully create each agent and then gear them with different looking clothes then this game would jump to an 8. But as is, with no customization at all, its a hugely disappointing 6/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=5536699">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. The game was developed by five guys and when compared to titles from AAA studios, Satellite Reign certainly stacks up. As a community, we need to support our indie developers who bring diversity to the industry. Sure, the game has its little quirks but what game doesn&apos;t.

AI gets bugged and stuck in a places which are crucial to yous mission success. Your targets will run into a building you cant access so you wont be able to finish the mission. Path-finding is also bad. Theres no save option during missions. If you fail, and you will, because of bugs, you&apos;ll have to start over from the very beginning of the mission.

At the very least you&apos;ll be escorted off site and given a kick in the back, at worst you&apos;ll be served a bullet breakfast. Then again, you&apos;re not really here to just wave and say cheery words, you&apos;re in command of the finest your company has to supply, which at the beginning... isn&apos;t much.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ve managed to snag a prototype version of something called &quot;Res_Tech&quot; which allows you to resurrect your agents in the field to some extent, though it&apos;s far from perfect, the version you have will not preserve clones, so you&apos;ll need to replace them as clones are shot up. You&apos;ve also a small sum of money provided to you by the corp, and your agents who come armed with futuristic Uzis and the Infiltrator comes packing a sniper rifle. Poking around the skill upgrade system hints at the sheer potential for carnage your soldiers -will- be able to unleash, but to begin with, you&apos;re weak, you&apos;re small. The first jobs are going to be skin of the teeth things as you scrounge resources, get a few prototypes and start building up those all important weapons, gear and augments. In this regard, it&apos;s -very- close to the original Syndicate games, the feeling of power as you steadily improve your agents from &quot;Joe public with a gun&quot; to &quot;Cyber enhanced machines of destruction&quot;.
<br>
<br>The Persuadertron from Syndicate has been replaced with a button marked &quot;Hijack&quot;, which allows you to hack the brainware of pretty much anyone provided you have the appropriate skill set for it, again, initially you can only brainwash members of the public, maybe some police officers and the odd thug, but once you skill up you&apos;ll be able to convert Soldiers and even enemy corp members and return them to the clone pool, adding valuable and highly sought after clone bodies that come with built in bonuses to your army.
<br>
<br>The flow of the game is real-time all the way, each of your agents is class based. As well as managing their skill growth, gear loadouts, enhancements etc. As you gain power and start adding more skills, you&apos;ll find that you get more comfortable with managing the myriad of options available, and you&apos;ll be planning your routes in and out of complexes with astute precision. The plan doesn&apos;t -always- survive contact with the enemy, but when you pull it off smoothly, you&apos;ll feel badass. The graphics and sound design are very evocative of Blade Runner, with it&apos;s permanent rain soaked roads, and it&apos;s bright, cheery neon which overlays a dying, decrepit city in the most part, with only the areas for the affluent still being maintained to a high standard. It&apos;s very much a telling commentary on what a city might look like in the future, and a very dystopian and gritty approach to world building, and in places feels like it could serve as set dressing for the very film I mention.
<br>
<br>Satellite Reign is an example of how a game should-be done</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=5444135">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Satellite Reign is the same sort of game as Syndicate and it nails the Cyberpunk feel. The maps, the characters the text and corporations all just work and work well. They really make it feel like a Cyberpunk world in ways games like Shadow run totally failed to achieve.
<br>
<br>It plays like an open world game, only it is actually a large level based game that you unlock new areas as you progress, all part of the same world map but definitely not open.
<br>
<br>Still it is about roaming around and choosing your next target your self. Which is the core of most open ended games.
<br>
<br>The game play is fairly straight forward, break in to a company compound, steal money, prototypes etc, research them and upgrade your squad and do it all again. You can raid the same company twice if you like, the company seems to restock some of its loot over time but so far I have not gotten the rich rewards that I got after the first raid when revisiting the same company.
<br>
<br>As you progress you unlock new areas of the city to explore and raid for loot and other valuables, doing missions, levelling up, adding skills to your squad of 4 men.
<br>
<br>Aside from the slightly clunky interface which you do get use too, this game is a very good game.
<br>
<br>I cannot help but feel I am playing the original Syndicate again on the old Amiga, the difference being, Satelite Reign does a better job and because its new, it feels fresh and exciting.
<br>
<br>Strongly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=5645205">Expand</a></span>

What makes that even worse, is that you cannot save in &quot;red zones,&quot; and these red zones are where the majority of the gameplay takes place. I would love to say this is a great game.

Just last week I saw that Satellite Reign received a series of updates that fixed some of the problems that annoyed me from the begining and I decided to give it another try. And even though the game is still flawed in many ways, it has been fixed enough to be playable and enjoyable. At this time, if you&apos;re looking for a cyberpunk treat, you might want to give this one a try. It is still full of questionable solutions when it comes to gameplay and story, but at least it is enough of a decent game to try it out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=5460608">Expand</a></span>

<br>- AI is horrible and frustrating.
<br>- Weapons are boring and simple and seriously lack diversity.
<br>- Augmentations are weak in terms of diversity/types.
<br>- Cities feel hollow and dead with &apos;things moving around (its not a living city)

<br>Unbelievably bad game. I played and completed Syndicate ages ago when it was first released. Hard to believe that with modern hardware they can release a game that is much worse than the original.
<br>
<br>I got a bad feeling when I first launched the game and it took forever to load. This is the slowest launching game I&apos;ve played in many years. It goes downhill from there. The tutorial is next to useless. There is no manual and I disliked the game so much I wasn&apos;t willing to put the time into figuring out the details of how to play the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=6608900">Expand</a></span>

The story is great actually, some nice futuristic ideas (just standard sci-fi stuff really) which pull the missions together and keep the interest high.

<br>I have a fairly decent PC (can play Skyrim at 1080p no hassle) but for this game I have to set the quality low to get a bearable framerate. It would have been nice to be able to turn off a few more of the effects. Anyway, it still look and plays good, but then I&apos;m not too fussy with graphics. Overall I really enjoyed this and hope a sequel is released on PS4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=6072379">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Awesome graphics and atmosphere that really enhance the cyberpunk setting, challenging yet highly enjoyable real time squad based strategy that doesn&apos;t hold your hand yet enables you to customise your squad to allow you to focus on the way you want to play, stealth and combat are both satisfying and don&apos;t penalise you for when things go wrong, I cant honestly find much to fault with it. The AI path-finding might be the only occasional hiccup but to me just suits the chaotic nature of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=5637347">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of - I remember somewhat the original Syndicate Wars - enough to feel nostalgic about it but not enough to draw a direct comparison between the two. Might be for the better or worse for a game review but this is how it is.
<br>
<br>Satellite Reign is a real time squad based game set in a cyberpunk world of the future. The giant companies control the world and it&apos;s up to you and your squad to take the worst offender down. The story is simple and doesn&apos;t get much more complicated throughout the game. Most of the text is presented in writing and it&apos;s easier to just skim the text for important bits regarding the mission rather than trying to understand the story which seems a bit generic.
<br>
<br>Mechanically this is a squad based real time strategy game. You control four members of your squad in a pretty standard set up - soldier/heavy, support/medic, hacker and infiltrator/sniper. Each of those come with a special set of skills you can upgrade with experience gained. Those are pretty cool and useful - some more than other - but generally you do feel like you&apos;re making a choice by selecting what to upgrade and it does impact the way you play later on.
<br>
<br>Apart from the standard upgradeable skills you get to manage your squad load-out meaning guns, gear and implants. All of these feel pretty varied and provide an impact on the way you take on a mission. Some loud-outs are in fact better suited for certain missions than other - all depending on the mission type and facilities you&apos;re breaching, and your preffered game play. The amount of customisation here was pretty cool.
<br>
<br>There is also a cloning layer - a place where you take people and by assigning them to your squad members you enhance their abilities - but I found it pretty much useless - didn&apos;t understand the concept to well and ignored it entirely. It felt wonky and combined with often dying and loosing the bonuses felt like just too much work for little gain.
<br>
<br>Visually it&apos;s quite nice. The cyberbpunk atmosphere is there and looks really good. Although seems to be very power hungry. Sure, you can zoom in pretty close and it still lookes good but it&apos;s unplayable while zoomed in. So I was completly zoomed out the entire time. The camera for whatever artistic reason is constantly bobbing slightly left and right - didn&apos;t make me feel nauseous but I imagine it could make some people. Overall it felt like totally unnecessary thing with no way of turning it off. The graphic in general was looking good - very neon like - and fitting the setting.
<br>
<br>The game has a bit strange paste to it. It&apos;s slow at first - you&apos;re always under equiped with low tier guns, and no money. The enemies are also a bit hard at first in comparison to your setup. This leads to tackling the first mission very stealthy - luckily the game allows for such approach and you still get experience from doing things without causing mayhem. It gets better over time and things start balancing out and stealth stops being the only viable option.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m glad I&apos;ve stuck through the beginning part as the game picked up somewhere along mid-game and starts getting interesting. The mid and end game is far more interesting as you&apos;re much better equipped and have a lot more room for taking different approaches to each mission.
<br>
<br>The thing this begs for is an active pause though. It would change the game significantly and i feel for the better. As things stand right now there is no other way than just move your squad as a whole. There is just to little time for any flanking or other clever maneuvering. The slow-down time ability is there for the hacker but it has almost no meaningful impact on the game play.
<br>
<br>Overall in the end I found the game to be enjoyable despite a bit repetitive and not giving a lot of control of the action when things get spicy. I have a feeling that making small changes to the game play would make the game much more enjoyable than it is but as it stands it&apos;s still worth picking up and trying out yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/satellite-reign/user-reviews?user_review_id=7370485">Expand</a></span>
