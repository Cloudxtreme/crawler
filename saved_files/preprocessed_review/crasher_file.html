Though it&apos;s very limited in maps, the devs promise that will change and as it is, there&apos;s a staggering array of cars to choose from with wildly varied abilities. At first the low player count (5 v 5) scared me away, but when the price dropped and the demo came out I fell in love with the game almost immediately. It&apos;s not a traditional action game in the strictest sense, but instead incorporates elements of the Defense of the Ancients subgenre. It&apos;s an odd mix, but it works, and fans of both car combat and DotA should check this out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crasher/user-reviews?user_review_id=6508032">Expand</a></span>
