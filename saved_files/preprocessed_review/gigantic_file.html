Fractured Space filled that role for me for a while, but with about 300 players online a day it is on its way to the games haven&#x2026;.
<br>
<br>And then, Gigantic appeared. It caught my attention first with its looks and design. It was colourful and fun, but not childish. It had a strong visual identity and to my surprise, characters were all pretty well thought-out and just straight fun! Crazy moustached alchemist, old witch granny, owl musketeer&#x2026; It all clicked with me enough to give the game a try, and I was enchanted. Because Gigantic for me delivers the MOBA&#x2019;ish formula that just is extremely approachable, and here&#x2019;s why&#x2026;
<br>
<br>The game is simple. My biggest gripe with most MOBA&#x2019;s is how complex and layered their mechanics are. Towers, cores, upgrades, equips, consumables, lanes, minions &#x2013; there are a lot of tightly woven components to a classic MOBA that make these games tough to learn, offering a steep learning curve, which is not a bad thing on its own. Plenty of people enjoy a challenge of &#x2018;getting good&#x2019; but MOBAs are also infamous for being extremely toxic. You are either good on the spot, or you need to listen to the ultimate blamefest, every game. Gigantic on the other hand offers a lovely, pretty unique and simple set of mechanisms. Summon creatures that aid you at certain spots and produce power for your Big Guy (titular Gigantic beast). Kill others and their creatures to gather more Power. If your team gets 100 power before enemy team does, your Big Guy goes for a friendly visit to the enemy Big Guy to hold him down so you and your teammates can spank him good. Each Big Guy have three wounds and loooots of Health Points, so it will take usually a few power-races to take them down.
<br>
<br>And that&#x2019;s it, pretty much! It&#x2019;s much, much simpler formula, and I am sure not everyone will like it, but for me it fits perfectly with the game dynamics, because Gigantic is a third person action-shooter-rpg kind of mixture, where everything happens really, really fast. So if you will need to spend extra time on some additional, convoluted mechanics, it would just create frustrating downtime and plenty of confusion. In this setup you can focus on properly picking skills from a narrow tree of choices as you level up in each game, working with your team to deliver good pushes and defences and just do your job to push your Big Guy to victory. Which is great, because it happens naturally and you can really just try to enjoy playing your champion well!
<br>
<br>All in all, so far it&#x2019;s hard to say how&#x2019;s the balance, but the content is solid. Sure, there is only one game mode and just three maps, but with a lively and fun roster of characters, some extra creatures to pick from and the fact that at this moment all characters sees play, well, it&#x2019;s a really solid entertainment that I can recommend!
<br>
<br>If you&#x2019;re looking for a light, easy to access MOBA&#x2019;ish game, this one should fit you perfectly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gigantic/user-reviews?user_review_id=7439601">Expand</a></span>

Gigantic is a MOBA, in a sense, but it&apos;s really not in the context that most think of MOBAs (common correlation is to DotA, LoL). Gigantic is really it&apos;s own breed, and you could spend hours drawing comparisons to games like Overwatch (another I never really got into, despite my FPS-centered background), but you&apos;d never actually hit the nail on the head.
<br>
<br>The combat and movement is amongst the smoothest I&apos;ve experienced. The game just flows exceptionally. The heroes, while currently at a count of 19 with more to be added perpetually, are immensely diverse and while they have stark similarities to those in other games, still differentiate in unique ways that evoke the &quot;ohh that&apos;s cool&quot; response.
<br>
<br>There are 3 maps presently, with more to be added, that spice up games and encourage experimentation with different team comps to creatively pave your victory path. Additionally, each map changes mid-late game into &quot;clash mode&quot; where points are relocated and the space condensed to force more engagements, playstyle adjustment, and keep match times low. It really gets exciting and it&apos;s an awesome mechanic.
<br>
<br>The game is free, but you can buy an Ultimate Pack for $30 that has some unique skins, currency, fortune cards (awards things for various in-game goals on completion) and all heroes now and ever (Smite does this, it&apos;s a cool idea). There is no P2W at all, purchases are purely cosmetic or for heroes,  which require personal skill to succeed with.  Heroes can also be earned via soft &quot;crown&quot; currency over time for free (fortune cards help this), but it takes time.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s available on Steam, although it does open the Arc launcher and you have to make an Arc account. This isn&apos;t a fault of game quality, and although may be annoying for some, it&apos;s not that foreign if you&apos;ve played any of Ubisoft&apos;s games via Steam (U-Play launcher requirement). Not docking any points there, don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to discredit game quality because of that. My fingers can click and type a few more times today.

Once you get a couple games in it becomes familiar and deceptively addicting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gigantic/user-reviews?user_review_id=7422966">Expand</a></span>
