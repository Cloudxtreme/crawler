There are basically five new jobs, firefighter, home designers (interior and exterior)/hair sylists/tatoo artists (all designers of sorts), detectives, self-employed (inventors) and ghostbusters. The medical career has also been revamped, but is still a rabbit hole job, you can just engage in out of the office jobs now, like vaccinations. These are okay, they can get fairly repetitive, as a firefighter, considering there are only so many houses in a town, you&apos;ll eventually begin noticing that &quot;Hey, haven&apos;t I saved this house three times already?&quot; and contrary to what I expected, there isn&apos;t any challenge to the firefighter job, I guess this could be a good thing, since the Sims isn&apos;t supposed to be a mission-based type of game, but it seems stupid when your Sim can just stand in the fire and casually use his fire extinguisher to put out fire surrounding him. Also, no longer do firefighters use those stupid pickup trucks they did in the base game (not a huge issue, but it looks a lot better seeing them in actual firetrucks). You&apos;ll also be staying in the fire station waiting for a fire to happen (which happens oddly often), you can also experience earthquakes, which will cause a massive ****storm of accidents to occur all at once. Then there&apos;s home designers, you basically just wait for someone to call you saying they need you to redesign their house, which you&apos;re given a list of requirements and must do the best you can on a budget, so if you&apos;re one of those people who just buys the Sims to build houses, you may have a reason to stop motherloding and get a job. There&apos;s also hair stylists, fashion designers and tattoo artists, where someone needs a new look, and you can either do it for them, or be evil and make them hideous. Detective is interesting, you&apos;re called (or you can visit the cop shop to get a case) and don&apos;t seem to have a time limit (Maybe there is one, but I&apos;ve never run out of time, even when keeping a case over a few days), and just need to go &quot;talk to Jim Robins&quot;, &quot;Search through Roberta Williams garbage can&quot; etc. in order to put a case together and eventually (your sim will) solve it. They&apos;re super predictable and there&apos;s only about 5 cases including in Ambitions, so once you&apos;ve done about 5 cases, you&apos;ll start doing the same cases over and over and over again. The Detective career is interesting, but considering the limited amount of cases in the game, it gets really boring repetitive in a short amount of time. Honestly, I&apos;ve never tried self-employed, but it seems as if you must develop your inventing skill, then apply to be self employed  (I believe you can also be an artist) at city hall, you then just sit at a desk &quot;inventing&quot; and sell your inventions. The more skilled you are, the more cash you&apos;ll bring in. Finally there&apos;s ghostbusters, which you&apos;ll be called and told &quot;There&apos;s ghosts in my house&quot; and you must go suck them up in a vacuum where you can then sell them at the science lab. There&apos;s also some new buy objects (including a new car and many new appliances, surfaces, decor items and more) and some new build objects. One big edition, which is probably my favourite part of the expansion, is laundry. It&apos;s totally optional if you don&apos;t like the sound of it. You can now create a laundromat for your town and go there to pay and do laundry, or you can actually buy machines at home (or a clothesline, if your Sim is eco-friendly, a new trait that makes your Sim vomit if they use eco-murderous appliances or items) where your Sims will start dropping clothes sometimes when they change (you can buy hampers to keep your house clean, which of course get full) and then do laundry, which gives your Sim a very long lasting happy moodley (your sim is happier for a while). Is The Sims 3: Ambitions worth it, let it be noted that in the Town Life expansion, there is laundry, and that one only costs $20, rather than $30, so if you don&apos;t like jobs and just motherlode like the cheater you are, then you probably will not enjoy this expansion, if you do get jobs for your Sims and are upset by the lack of interaction, you will probably enjoy this expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3-ambitions/user-reviews?user_review_id=1938291">Expand</a></span>
