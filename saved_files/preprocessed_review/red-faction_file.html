But the game is FUN. I used the various weapons equally, the environmental damage is neat (although underused), the story is simple yet interesting, and the fast paced gameplay keeps you on edge. What I especially appreciated were the various branching paths leading to the same objective.

And great gashes, the VEHICLES!! The only FPS game I&apos;ve ever seen with vehicles was Tribes 2 (though Tribes 1 probably has them too), and they were cool, but THESE VEHICLES TOTALLY BEAT THE LIVING SNOT OUT OF THEM!</span>

Only thing stopping it from similar quality games of the time such as Half Life is a little lack of polish in certain areas and not taking advantage of the biggest asset with the Geo-Mod.

It moves at an extremely fast speed, and it has a bit more depth to it than other first person shooters, which usually center around the plot of &quot;find the keycard to open the door&quot;. There is very little of that in RF.
<br>
<br>The game is rather difficult, which compensates somewhat for the fact that it is short, maybe 10-15 hours long. But those 10-15 hours are worth it, as there is no wasted time here. RF never, ever, gets boring.
<br>
<br>As for the controls, if you have played Oni before, you already know the basic control scheme. It&apos;s fairly easy to get used to. Just play the training level and you&apos;ll probably have it down quickly, although you may want to indulge in some minor retooling, since the action button is insanely far away from the movement buttons in the default control scheme.
<br>
<br>As for the graphics, they are good, but not great. There is a certain choppiness to everything in the cinemas, and sometimes movement of your enemies seems quite awkward and forced. But this is okay, since you encounter some rather nasty looking creatures later on, and the lack of excellent graphics means that they are not quite as terrifying as you would expect.
<br>
<br>One really nice facet of this game is the Geo-Mod engine, which allows you to blow holes in about 80% of everything you see. Door locked? No problem. Just whip out the Rocket Launcher (a.k.a. &quot;Big Earl&quot;)and blast about 3 rockets into the wall, enabling you to simply go around the door. Unfortunately, you cannot simply blow a hole in the door, and there are parts of the game where you can&apos;t take advantage of the Geo-Mod engine. Oh well.
<br>
<br>Lastly, the plot and voice acting are both very good. The plot is simple, but not boring at all, and the acting is great.
<br>
<br>This game is unbelievable. Volition and THQ did a great job.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-faction/user-reviews?user_review_id=3685420">Expand</a></span>

The geo-mod is cool, though as many others have said, it is extremely under-utilized. You go around a locked door once, then that&apos;s pretty much it (I tried doing this around other doors to get a good vantage point on enemies but found the rock completely indestructible). The game is extremely hard, and sometimes in a fun way, but a lot of times it just felt cheap. The AI knows where you are at all times and shoots you before you even see them, and getting swarmed by multiple enemies that take 30+ bullets to kill is just frustrating. Speaking of frustrations, a lot of the bosses are BAD and not for GOOD reasons. They either kill you through walls or get stuck on an environment. I had to start over with one boss around 20 times until the boss finally decided to do what it was supposed to do. The game has a lot of cool ideas, but it just wasn&apos;t fun to play. Most of the time I just played to try to finish the story, but quit because I wasn&apos;t enjoying the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-faction/user-reviews?user_review_id=3439427">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps what Red Faction is most known for is the Geo-mod, which makes a lot of the environment destructible with the right weaponry. However, although this is a really great feature, I felt as though the game used nowhere near enough of its potential. You only really had to do it a couple of times in the beginning and then for the rest of the game it was forgotten and ignored completely. As a simple FPS game, Red Faction is not bad at all. It is fun for short bursts of playtime as you mindlessly shoot the enemies with a nice variety of guns in a cool sci-fi setting. The background music is really cool too and fits the setting really well. In some ways I felt as though the game was inspired by Half Life and Deus Ex. However, having said all that, the game has plenty of drawbacks. I&apos;m completely looking past the silly voice acting since it was kind of funny in some ways. The drawback mainly for me was that Red Faction was very repetitive and just a mindless shooter. It didn&apos;t involve you using any clever tactics and such. The whole game is just how quickly you can shoot all the people in the room. You can only play it in short, half-hour bursts before getting bored. Although the game did try to change pace in some parts, I personally found all those parts to be quite ineffective and even annoying, whether it&apos;s getting a dumb AI robot to hover over a disposal pit, extremely bland underwater combat, or the stealthy infiltration parts. Although stealthy parts weren&apos;t too bad, the game didn&apos;t have enough to make them more engaging. Most of the time there was no way of telling what would cause someone to become suspicious of you and what wouldn&apos;t. And also, when your cover does get blown, you have to still continue the rest of the area in your disguise with just a stealth pistol, which was pretty annoying because by that stage I would&apos;ve preferred to take out more powerful weapons to fight off the guards. In the end I just don&apos;t see this game lasting me many hours. To conclude, I&apos;d say unless you wish to play every FPS game under the Sun, give this one a miss. If you are into older FPS games, just stick with Half Life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-faction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2696796">Expand</a></span>

Frustrating since its rated a lot higher than a lot of other superior shooters.  This is not a classic, its a game studio with a limited budget and imagination. 1/10 Did not enjoy.</span>

And &apos;Red Faction&apos; was a pretty popular game upon it&apos;s release, but for the most part nobody really cared about it all that much after that. Which makes sense I suppose, I mean, &apos;Half Life&apos; had the mod &apos;Counter-Strike&apos; and it&apos;s revolutionary multiplayer, and &apos;Red Faction&apos; had the gimmick of being able to destroy everything in your path, which was actually a pretty big deal back then if I remember correctly.
<br>
<br>But still, &apos;Half Life&apos; was the game everyone cared about, the game everybody played; so it&apos;s safe to say that &apos;Red Faction&apos; was swept under the rug for the majority of kids growing up in the 90&apos;s. Which isn&apos;t all that surprising actually, games were much more hit or miss back in those days, so when people found something that was great, they stuck to it and played it til they could no longer. To say it best, &apos;Red Faction&apos; was the Utah Jazz to &apos;Half Life&apos;s&apos; Chicago Bulls. Yeah, let&apos;s see how many of you get that reference.
<br>
<br>However, after coming back to this game after almost two decades, and having never beaten it until just recently, I can honestly say that &apos;Red Faction&apos; is just as good as &apos;Half Life&apos;, if not better. You would think that such an early game with the premise for total destruction would be mediocre at best, but the developers nailed it the first time around. Combine that with combat that&apos;s just as fun as any other first person shooter on the market today, controls that feel natural from the get-go, and the ability to drive vehicles much like in the &apos;Halo&apos; games, and you&apos;ve got yourself one hell of a timeless shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-faction/user-reviews?user_review_id=5073842">Expand</a></span>

There are only some minor things not letting it get the maximum score.
<br>
<br>As in a classic first-person shooter (FPS) game, you will be shooting enemies a lot in Red Faction. Both the enemies and available weapons will get tougher over time. This monotony is split by a few &quot;stealth&quot; sections, several driving/flying/swimming sections (which was quite a new feature in 2001) and a few cutscenes. Speaking about cutscenes - if the game as a whole graphically is quite good by standards of 2001, then the cutscenes are definitely outdated.
<br>
<br>Red Faction technically is not really innovative game (think of Max Payne, which was released the same year), mostly following the well-tried experience of the Half Life (1998) generation FPS games. The exception is its innovative Geo-Mod game engine, which allows to create fully destructible game world. Too bad this potentially revolutionary game engine wasn&apos;t used to its full potential by Red Faction&apos;s developer team; its most unique features are hardly used designing game&apos;s locations. It&apos;s interesting the much newer Geo-Mod 2 engine is heavily used in Red Faction: Guerrilla, but lacks the reality feel of the older Geo-Mod engine.
<br>
<br>The game is too easy to beat - if you play carefully and quick-save a lot, even at &quot;impossible&quot; difficulty level there will be only a handful of challenging moments in the game.
<br>
<br>The story in the start lacks some logic. Why Ultor would spend enormous money on shipping miners to Mars and then &quot;treat them like dirt&quot;? Every miner on Mars has cost Ultor hundreds of thousands, if not millions (it&apos;s year 2075 - only a few decades after the first colony on Mars). It&apos;s economically unreasonable to beat them up or shut down just for fun.

Probably not as innovative as the original Max Payne, but still a great game that&apos;s worth a playthrough if old-school is your preference.
<br>
<br>Guns are great, and destructible terrain is fun. Game-play rewards tactical thinking and choosing the correct weapon for the right situation. Game-play and gun-play are smooth, and graphics are pretty good for a game from 2001; I never had my immersion broken b/c of low-res textures. Level design never felt boring, though it was sometimes mildly confusing.
<br>
<br>Some things are just outright frustrating, though. Maybe I&apos;ve been spoiled by the recent generation of games that have direction finders and maps (though I didn&apos;t have a problem in Max Payne or Max Payne 2), but lack of directions and small switches to press to proceed can equal many minutes of running around aimlessly, looking for the way forward. Health is at a premium on any difficulty. Story is meh. Voice acting (except for Hendrix) is sub-par. Music is annoying and repetitive. The final levels felt tacked on, making the game too long - though, at 6 hours for a run-through, the game is actually anything but long.
<br>
<br>And while I didn&apos;t have the bugs that other gamers have encountered (like the submarine exploding for no reason - use V-sync, the bug comes from an uncapped frame-rate), I could only play an hour or so before the voices stopped sounding. I had to exit the game, and verify the file cache. There were usually 3 files that had to be re-acquired. Once done, the game proceeded normally - for another hour or so. Annoying, but not really game-breaking (I wasn&apos;t playing with any mods).
<br>
<br>Worth a look for for any Red Faction fan, or someone who enjoys old-school shooters. But there will be no hand-holding. Or clues. Or detailed directions.
<br>
<br>EDIT: Played with the Pure Faction mod installed, and the above problem with the voices disappeared. Pure Faction also enables native 16:9 resolutions (so the image isn&apos;t stretched) and has numerous other fixes. Recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-faction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6491886">Expand</a></span>
