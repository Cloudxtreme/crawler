It has a Native American storyline and characters which is very rare for all games, let alone a FPS. You get sucked up along with your girlfriend and Cherokee grandfather to an alien ship that is processing the people of Earth for food. You spend most of the game searching for your girlfriend and that leads you to destroying the main boss. It sounds a little hokey but it works and I never rolled my eyes at the story which I can&apos;t say for a lot of games.  The graphics are a bit dated with the human animations looking slightly blocky but the lighting system and textures were detailed. Since it is an older game (2006) I was not able to play at the full resolution of my monitor and had to settle for 1600x1200. The odd thing is that now matter what aspect ratio I selected all the resolutions were the same. At any rate it played fine and I had no trouble with how it looked. The game is VERY similar to Quake 4 but I liked Prey better because of the story and gameplay. One of the unique things about it was that you can&apos;t really die. When you loose all your health your are transported to the death world where you shoot wraiths to gain your health and spirit back. This helps the gameplay flow so much more smoothly than any other game I have played. It breaks the monotony of the save/load cycle which was one thing I did not enjoy about Quake. Also when you die and come back the level loads instantly, no more waiting for the whole thing to load again and making you frustrated about getting past a hard part. There is also a spirit walk mode where you leave your body and enter a spirit world to pass through force fields and access switches or other items you would be unable to normally.  The sound and music fit right in with the game. Despite being a Native American game there were just a couple sections where the music matched. The death/spirit world and visiting the ancestral grounds. It&apos;s mostly short chanting and it makes sense to make it simple rather than drawn out singing chanting that may take you out of the game. The voice acting was also done well. In particular the main character and last boss. It&apos;s not often that I find myself glad to hear the main character shouting obscenities or the sickly sweet voice of the villain. And lets not forget Art Bell as himself on the call in radio station. The game has some shortcomings. It&apos;s fairly quick, I blasted through it in around 6 hours and 30 minutes. The death world has a lot to do with that though. If I did not have to constantly save and load in Quake I probably could have shaved hours off my final time. And besides, too many hours in a FPS game ruins it for me. Half Life was great, but damn was it long.  The graphics are a bit dated, but again for 2006 time it was good. The difficulty may be a bit on the easy side. I would rather have it too easy than too hard however. After completing the game on normal mode you can play on the harder Cherokee mode. As much as I enjoyed this game I wouldn&apos;t go through it again just for a harder difficulty.
<br>
<br>I fully recommend this game to all type of game players, you don&apos;t have to be into FPS type games to enjoy it. It does have quite a bit of gore and swearing(you can turn off obscenities though), so not for the younger gamers. You can pick it up for ~$10 shipped or check your local game store. For some odd reason this game is not on the Steam network. I think it would be able to enjoy much more success if it was. The sequel is due out the end of December 2012 and I know I will be buying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=2500037">Expand</a></span>

Its portal mechanism isn&apos;t as sophisticated or important as it is in Portal, which came a year later, but it has some interesting unexpected consequences for the player, but that are obviously intended by the developers. If you like shooters and Portal, you&apos;ll love this combination. It&apos;s also nice to have a Cherokee who isn&apos;t a caricature as the protagonist and hero. The story is engaging and sporadically immersing. There&apos;s one point where I screwed up and both I and the character simultaneously said, &quot;Oh, s**t!

My biggest issue is that they combat is a little clunky, but the story, the creative game play involving the use of alternating gravity, using teleportation portals, etc. along with strong voice acting (the female lead irritate the hell out of me at times and other times it was passable  the rest of the voice acting was perfect), great visuals, the creative use of spirit and a really engaging story make this one hell of a good game.
<br>
<br>I hope that Prey 2 comes out of development hell, but then again it apparently will not have Tommy as the main protagonist despite the ending of Prey  which is disappointing.  But then again I could be totally off as there is not much known about Prey 2 other than the pissing match that goes on at time about who is to blame for it being stalled.
<br>
<br>If you like story driven games with the need to figure some things out too as you go, I would recommend this title.  Its a bit hard to find as it is not available via any download outlets and you can find only a few copies on re-sellers like Amazon.  This game is well worth a try and works great on the PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=3262274">Expand</a></span>

Most people says that it&apos;s an Okay game. I say it was Amazing! The game was made in the id Tech 4 engine which is a Doom 3 engine. You can still feel that this game is a rip-off Doom 3, but it&apos;s made on the same game engine so maybe it has some aggreements with id Software. The gameplay is more like Doom 3, but it&apos;s more story-based. You and your girlfriend gets abducted by aliens. You made to escape, but you must save your girlfriend. There are some sad moments too so I think the Story was great. But god, the environments  and the aliens are as disgusting as Half-Life (in a good way though). It really feels that you are in there. The realism is great and still comparable to HL2. The gameplay is just your typical shooter, but it&apos;s more than that. Why? The weapons were made by aliens instead of humans, but the other reason is just like Half Life 2, Prey has puzzles. But compared to HL2, this one blows your mind completely. They are more than just puzzles, they kill gravity. Unlike any other games I&apos;ve played so far (still counting Portal), the puzzle just blows your mind. There are portals that can teleport you somewhere, but it can also shrinks you into a miniature look. There are floors that kill the law of gravity, and more weird things. They used the engine perfectly on this game. I loved it. Too bad with game like this, id Software didn&apos;t put more efforts on their recent games like RAGE. So overall, Prey is an amazing game and it&apos;s one of my most favorite game of all time.

If George Noory was a Native American Indian and game developer he would create this game. I&apos;ve never seen Indians and Aliens combined in a game before! It&apos;s awesome and I enjoyed it very much. It mixes first person shooting, bashing, smashing, frying and freezing, with mind screwing puzzles, zero gravity at times, 3D Space where there is no up or down, and a strange and twisted story of a Native American who goes up against Aliens. LOL Whoever came up with this game and developed the story and game play had to be smoking some strong stuff in his peace pipe. Along with the mix of shooting and puzzles, there is comedy through out with the voice overs. Lots of swearing and blood, and a strange mix of weapons. It seems to be a nice balance of difficulty and playability for the average gamer and moves along at a good pace to keep you playing to the next level. Well, I&apos;m going to go take something for my dizziness and go to bed and have nightmares now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=1712914">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s certainly an enjoyable shooter, but I found the shifting gravity and static portals to be a bit of a distraction at best and annoying at worst. There are a few instances where the mechanics work really well, and some clever environments are constructed, but otherwise it feels like a bit of a wasted opportunity. Also, there&apos;s a point right at the beginning when you are shrunk to a tiny size and appear on a sphere in a tiny box, and the idea of miniaturisation appealed to me much more than all the gravity shifting and portals, but this never happens again for the entire game!
<br>The combat and weapons are enjoyable, although I felt that ammo ran out too fast on most weapons, interrupting the pace of combat somewhat. Also, there weren&apos;t enough wide open arenas, and most of these came towards the end of the game. This, along with the plodding pace of the plot, means the whole game feels like it takes a really long time to hit its stride. I appreciated that the opening section of the game (after the bar section, which was a superb prologue) was meant to build the atmosphere, but it overplayed it a little too long for me, especially as the only thing you&apos;re doing for the entire game is chasing after your girlfriend to rescue her (because, you know, girls need rescuing). Again, the plot becomes more interesting towards the end, but it&apos;s too little too late.
<br>Another annoyance is your character&apos;s voice, which chirps in, or rather shouts in, on a regular basis. And the voice acting isn&apos;t exactly award winning, either. Another thing was irked me was that the art style was far too similar to DOOM 3 and Quake 4, which just adds to its derivative feel. I know it used the same engine, but that&apos;s no reason to ape the art style (and even your main weapon has exactly the same sound effect as your rifle from Quake 4!).
<br>An enjoyable shooter overall, but a bit of a waste.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=3612878">Expand</a></span>

Kind of reminds me of QUAKE 4, so if you liked that you&apos;ll probably enjoy Prey more or less. What&apos;s interesting is the atmosphere is surprisingly good in Prey, despite it being older and appearing to not have put too much effort into purposefully making it very atmospheric. In a couple scenes in the bar/inn it feels like you&apos;re actually there. The enemies are well balanced as well as the ammo/guns. Specifically the ammo is very well balanced, you get appropriate ammo depending on the damage of each gun that makes it feel natural, and not getting overloaded with ammo like most games. The enemies get more difficult gradually and have some very creative designs. I&apos;m not sure if you could consider Prey a horror game, but like Dead Space or Doom it has some pretty scary monsters/scenarios. Prey also touches on some mind-bending factors which keep the game very entertaining, and it&apos;s just long enough for the story it&apos;s trying to tell, which it does very well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=3894621">Expand</a></span>

Yet i didnt really care that much for the gameplay and shooting mechanics. Its is an interesting game, but it does feel very clunky.</span>

I always wanted to try it out, i heard a lot of good about it, and i love the developers previous game (Rune) so i gave it a try. For a 2006 game, it&apos;s ok, feels like and old school shooter and it has its charm. The level design is very interesting and there are a few elements witch was very new for me (like the &quot;immortality&quot;) Unfortunately i found the game a bit boring, but maybe it&apos;s only my bad, because i played it in a wrong year. If this game would be released in 1999 (just like DNF) this would be a bigger classic now, in my opinion. But except the fact of development hardness, it&apos;s still a classic. The ending was a bit... weird, i would like to see an another close, but i understand they had future plans with the IP. It&apos;s ok that Bethesda cancelled the development of the second game. No need for sequel for this story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=5526137">Expand</a></span>

The game is ok to play to change your mind and enjoy a nice relax moment but there isn&apos;t anything into it that makes you jump or say &quot;Damn that is nice&quot;. I agree with many of you that the game can lacks of AI and the graph are same as DOOM III and QUAKE 4. I think the game would have been better with some good jokes like Duke Nukem 3D and make the game much, much longer without feeling to blow your brains out cause it&apos;s getting boring. For now the top game remain in my opimion HL2. because the engine hasn&apos;t change at all and it seems a copy past from other games. Sorry to say this but ven F.E.A.R is better then this game. Hell... even Marathon from Bungie is better even if it&apos;s old. For now all I want is to see in the future a new remade and better Duke Numkem 3D with better chicks and &quot;sex&quot; into it, please don&apos;t forget the jokes and porn into it. Take care all and remember... spending too much money on games that end fast isn&apos;t cool. Like Episode 1 of HL2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=390018">Expand</a></span>

You go on a boring ride and fall of into a big butt (you&apos;ll know what i mean if you play). So the graphics look good, but as you play through, pick up weapons etc it gets really tedious there are no differences of creative streeks anywhere. Everything looks the same the only plus point I can give are the gravity paths and that is about it! A disapointing game after a really good start.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=389968">Expand</a></span>

The storyline is really lame, real copycat game, and those upside-down walk things are quite cool the first time you see them, but they do nothing but annoy you. Sorry, but I absolutely do not recommend this game.</span>

I know the two games have in common only the name and little else, but since the name is what it is, right or wrong, I decided to look back at the past. Because I have to understand. Because I think a reboot must respect the original. I already knew Prey, back in the golden age of video games, I remember a PC magazine I was used to read, talking about the game and praising it.
<br>
<br>Maybe Prey&apos;s plot isn&apos;t very original, but it works, has its own atmosphere and surprised me too. I really liked the concept of &quot;prey&quot;. Aliens artificially planted life here on Earth, eons ago, and then returned to reap humans and use them as nourishment. But Aliens don&apos;t consume them all, so they can continue to proliferate and Aliens can keep use them at the next passage. Just like Native americans did with american bison, before Europeans destroyed their world and threatened an entire habitat. A relationship that is based on the balanced principle of food chain (a predator and a prey, in fact, as long as there is the one the other will exist), certainly the difference is that The Sphere is more a parasite than an alpha predator. Interesting is also the anti-antropocentric side of the plot: humans are nothing but food, meat, nourishment. A reality so clear that frightens most of the world&apos;s population. What matters probably is our legacy, our origins, our descendants, and that&apos;s exactly what Domasi discovers moving into the adventure, coming to accept what he is and completing his path as a Cherokee, becoming more conscious of his own existence.
<br>
<br>Prey&apos;s gameplay is just amazing, one of the best and most elaborate for an FPS. Weapons are quite varied and fun to use, they have a primary and secondary fire mode; surprisingly they don&apos;t require to replace the ammo&apos;s magazine because of (I suppose) their &quot;organic&quot; nature: in Prey, weapons are alive or have bio-parts, and simply shoots up until the total ammunition storage ends, which isn&apos;t displayed in numerical quantities but with a bar that runs out with use. Same concept for life points. Use of physics, but above all use of gravity in the game, is extraordinary: interactivity is high, it&apos;s possible to move many small objects, or to climb over them, but what is great is the use of &quot;Wall walk&quot;, which change completely the levels and game&apos;s prospective, overturning the game&apos;s world and requiring concentration to not remain locked in the illusion that the level is the same. Even moving on asteroids with a low, but own, gravity is very fun. Puzzles are simple but good enough: the one with giant cube is very nice. Is possible to use the Indian spirit, which separates from the physical body and moves to solve some puzzles, but also to attack enemies, explore environments or activating objects. Innovative is the use of transfer portals to move from one area to another, or to unlock secondary rooms. Nice use of armed aircraft too, fun even if requires a bit of practice. In Prey death doesn&apos;t exist: towards the beginning of the game, in fact, with obtain of Indian powers is possible to return to life exactly where the protagonist died. Certainly this could lower the level of challenge, but everything is already pre-calculated, so Prey is and remains a difficult game. Enemies&apos; AI is good, they take different behaviors based on distance, they hide and repair, use grenades, and dodge shots. Fighting against bosses is also good and challenging at the right point. With less than 9 hours, maybe it&apos;s a bit short, but intense experience. Prey is a game with an immense and structured gameplay to be an FPS, not easy to define but in few words: innovative, immersive, fun.
<br>
<br>Graphically Prey is great, both to be a 2006 game and even today. Certainly it&apos;s aged, but power of id Tech 4 is strong and maintains high standards even after more than a decade. Use of physics is well done and literally surpasses many modern games. The audio component is nice, both the one composed by Jeremy Soule (as &quot; Prey Overture&quot;) and songs such as &quot;Barracuda&quot;, &quot;Don&apos;t Fear The Reaper&quot; and &quot;Take Me Home&quot;.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know what the new Arkane Studios&apos; Prey will be. What I can say is that old Prey is a fantastic game, a masterpiece, an innovative and original FPS that despite 11 years of troubled development, it proved to be excellent. That&apos;s why the legacy that Arkane Studios has to collect is very heavy and important. I don&apos;t think that, anyway, they can manage to achive an FPS with such a successful gameplay. Too bad that by now the old Prey it&apos;s not (and will probably never be again) officially available. Can still found around, or on eBay, but its availability remains poor. PC gamers however have their methods to find games outside the official routes. I therefore suggest to anyone to play this game, using every method at disposal, because Prey is really beautiful and doesn&apos;t deserve to be forgotten. Don&apos;t let it be forgotten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=7252797">Expand</a></span>

Controls were pretty tight and responsive for such old game that it made me think of FPS games that came out years after it which felt much worse to play. Graphics have also held up really well over those years, most suprisingly because game has barely any colours and is pretty dark, many games that came out few years later with similiar visual style fair much worse when looked upon from today. However it does feel bit annoyingly old schoolish by todays standards. Like sometimes game clearly gives you visual clues what do in a level, while at times you&apos;ll get stuck thinking what are you suppose to do, where to go, what to press or how to beat a boss type enemy. I can respect the lack of hand holding which has plagued modern gaming, but atleast please give me some hint.
<br>
<br>Gravity, portal, puzzle based levels were a nice highlight too, but often felt more like a cool gimmick than true deep game feature like in Valve&apos;s Portal. Game doesnt have many guns, most of them atleast felt kinda unique, with interesting design which made the guns actually organic with living like moving parts, hadnt seen that before in FPS games, small but cool detail. Enemy design and variety wasnt as good, plus they werent the most fun to fight against, some felt overpowered who dealt lots of damage to you from just couple of shots, while themselves being bullet sponges at times, or maybe it goes down to show some of the guns were underpowered. The dying system gave me mixed feelings aswell, from one side its helpful when you felt you died from a cheap death, which happaned quite a lot for me, from other it made the game bit too easy if you would be looking for a challenge.
<br>
<br>Setting was cool, having a cherokee protagonist and game centered around native american culture theme and local alien abduction was definetly a big plus which helped setting the game apart from others. Story itself was fun enough with some nice twists but i wouldnt call it a selling point alone, but not bad at all by any means.
<br>
<br>I honestly became bit sad during credits when it was said Prey would continue, but we all know that thanks to Bethesda corporate scum wont happen, needless to say i would had preffered Prey 2 bounty hunter game than what we got in 2017&apos;s reboot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=7538786">Expand</a></span>

While the story line is fantastic it lacks some in no being able to deviate from the story line, That tends to leave replayablity of the main story line low. If your a hard core FPS gamer you may or may not like this game for the story. If you a casual gamer that plays for the story, you will likely enjoy it.</span>

And it&apos;s a FUN game. It&apos;s alternately funny, disgusting, and rocking, which is everything I ask out of a game. As Duke Nukem was to Doom, so is Prey to Doom 3--a fast, hard hitting romp through alien melting.</span>

Repetitive at times, some very nice moments (like the fight with the first boss) which are easily forgotten once you start backtracking a level to find a switch you missed at the beginning.</span>

The 13 hours were a lot of guts, blood, guns, aliens, and rescuing your girlfriend. You play as and Indian-American who gets abducted by aliens who want to feed off humans, along with your grandfather and girlfriend. Along the way you encounter new enemies, levels, and guns which will help you to finish the game. The story gets more and more good, even though some people say it&apos;s cliched. I totally recommend this game to any crazy FPS gamer who likes guts and guns. This has to be one of the best game i ever played but it cannot compete with the Orange box and i mean no way!! Buy it off ebay. Only costs around ten bucks. Worth your money!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=85621">Expand</a></span>

I mean, DNF is much more inexcusable but look - here is Prey, and it looks exactly like Doom 3 - how many times must we be put through the biomechanical-aliens/save-the-world plot? How many times? Developers, pull your heads out your butts and do something DIFFERENT!</span>

Unfortunately, it&apos;s also pretty lackluster. It commits the biggest crime possibly in the FPS genre, namely that the combat isn&apos;t very good. Your basic enemy (hunters) are dumb as rocks. Not dumb as in stand in the middle of room and not moving (they do that too), but dumb as in they refuse to shoot at you unless you stand still for several seconds. There are some other monsters, but all their attacks are easily dodgable. There is simply no challenge in combat. What&apos;s worse, even if you die, you simply resurrect where you died with 50% health and 50% spirit. Booring. The story is non-existant for at least 50% of the time. There are 4-5 levels in between that simply do nothing to advance the story, give goals for the player or elaborate on the game world. They are simply there. What story there is is fairly cliched. You have the bad guys, the guys opposed to the bad guys who recruit you and that&apos;s it. There are some revelations, but nothing earth shattering. A lot of loose ends are still remaining and lots of random moments that don&apos;t get explained at all. The sounds of Prey are decent, but the music is the real highlight. It&apos;s a great soundtrack. The sound effects for the aliens are your standard shrieks, moans and grunts. There&apos;s definately nothing that will stand out after you are done with the game. Physics and interactivity border on a 2002 or 2003 game. You can&apos;t grab any physics object, which doesn&apos;t matter anyways, as 99% of all objects are boxes of one sort or another. You can&apos;t pick up grenades thrown by the enemies. After HL2, I&apos;m surprised developers don&apos;t see the potential in having every physics object truly interactive. The puzzles are good, some of them might take a few minutes to complete, which is about the high end of not being frustrated. Spiritwalking is definately not used to it&apos;s potential though. Every time you see a forcefield, it&apos;s spiritwalk across and deactivate it. A little variety would have gone a long way. Wall-walking is definately cool though. Prey&apos;s length is definately short. Forget what you&apos;ve been hearing about 8-12 hour adventure, anyone who&apos;s played a few FPS&apos;s will finish this game in 6-8 hours. Definately not a full price purchase, wait until it hits 30 or so bucks. It&apos;s not worth a purchase at full price. HL2 Episode 1 offers slightly less, but it&apos;s also half the price. Prey&apos;s graphics are 2004ish at best. Low-res textures (by today&apos;s standards) are everywhere. There is no HDR, hell I don&apos;t even think there&apos;s bloom. There are a few fancy shader effects, but nothing really impressive. You can definately see the Doom3 engine&apos;s age in this game. Everything has a shiny and/or plastic sheen. The characters are really disappointing as well. They are oddly proportioned and Jen has elf ears. The voice acting and script are about par. There are some points in the game where the voice acting truly stands out and is worthy of being in a triple A game, but then the next scene will have simply atrocious acting. The writing is also bipolar. There are some great lines, but then you&apos;ll hear &quot;DIE DIE DIE&quot; said in a serious way. It doesn&apos;t fit. Finally, let&apos;s end on a good note. The weapons are definately the highlight of Prey; it&apos;s a damn shame that you don&apos;t need any of them though. Your first true weapon in the game is all you&apos;ll need for 90% of the time. The other weapons are simply overkill. There are bosses, but they require zero thinking to kill and even less skill, again thanks to deathwalk. There is not a single point in the entire game where you can&apos;t deathwalk, even in the last battle. Prey is an average shooter at best. It is not the next HL or FEAR or even Q4. It&apos;s spotty, inconsistent, and uninspired. FEAR showed us that level design doesn&apos;t mean much if the combat is intense, bloody and feels good. Q4&apos;s level design is about par with Prey&apos;s (vertical walkways and spiritwalking don&apos;t particularly mask the corridor shooter that is underneath) but at least the combat was vicious. Prey suffers from a lack of focus. It&apos;s combat is weak and easy. The story is lackluster. The sounds are generic. The level design has it&apos;s moments, but often times one can accurately predict what&apos;s going to happen in the next room. The puzzles are definately a good point though; I enjoyed many of them. Unfortunately, a couple good puzzles and some cool weapons don&apos;t make up for many of Prey&apos;s negatives. Prey is pretty much an average shooter, through and through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=389817">Expand</a></span>

The environments are at times amazing, but the game mostly defaults to the usual series of &quot;Corridors and Rooms for Fighting inTM&quot;. The plot&apos;s fairly clich&#xE9;, good enough to keep you playing to see out the epilogue, but nothing particularly memorable. Voice acting totters between average and above average. It does the job and the actors give off a sense that they did their best with what they were given. It&apos;s a good product with a smattering of new ideas, but it never gave me the impression that I was playing something special. So after the hype and on-again-off-again development time, I was left somewhat disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=389826">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are the same as Doom III; I really can&apos;t see the enhancement. The sound is excellent. The voice acting is very good. The game is quite short, my son has finished it already. To the people that say this game offers nothing new, I would have to counter with the fact that my son isn&apos;t really a FPS player, but when he saw this, he had to play it through to the end. It must have something, because he passed on Doom III and Quake IV. All in all, I&apos;d say the Metascore is an acurate rating of this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=389900">Expand</a></span>

Prey is highly likable with a lot of nice things that are a step above D3 and Q4, but it feels more like a mod or an expansion than a real game. It&apos;s waaaay too easy, so it&apos;s basically run and gun your way to the end. Puzzles are easy, enemies are predictable, AI isn&apos;t that smart. Prey has so much potential, but it doesn&apos;t live up to it&apos;s own hype. I think it looks very good and then new gravity / portals idea makes the game enjoyable, but it&apos;s just one more baby step up the D3 engine ladder. Nothing revolutionary, nothing to blow your socks off, but all that said, it&apos;s a nice game idea, it looks nice and plays well. A nice game, but nowhere near worth the price tag. Wait for this one to hit the bargain bin (you likely won&apos;t have to wait too long). It&apos;s absolutely worth picking up, but not until the price is around $20, which it will be fairly quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=390135">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> While it may have 1 or 2 flaws with the AI, Prey is a amazing change in the FPS genre. Combining elements of horror, sci-fi, and supernatural in a way that just blew me away. The inovative gameplay (which is a complete mind trip in and of its self) and story are reason enough to buy this game. -ps i loved the Art Bell sequences, a true treat to all those AM coast to Coast fans out there.</span>

So, if the purpose of player-written reviews like this is to inform other potential players/buyers, I think it&apos;s necessary that I tell you a bit about myself and what I like, don&apos;t like, and look for in a game. I&apos;m not a fan of much science fiction. I think bullets and bombs are much cooler than lasers and plasma. I prefer a backwards distopia over an advanced, scientific culture. Think Warhammer: 40K/HL2 versus Star Wars/Star Trek. The quality of a game&apos;s graphics engine is the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. For me, it goes gameplay, then immersiveness/presentation, then story, then graphics quality. I&apos;m currently playing STALKER and Bioshock and I much prefer STALKER. My favorite games include Fallout 2, Half Life 2, both the Total War and Civilization series, Quake 1, Diablo 2, and some others. Oh, and long walks on a dystopian, refuse-strewn, toxic waste-ridden beach. ; ) Seriously this is important, so I hope that much helps. Maybe we need profiles to file this stuff in, so people can check that and get an idea of our perspective before reading the reviews. This is one of the few times I&apos;ve felt that I&apos;ve actually wasted my money when buying a game. Remember, it&apos;s just personal taste. You don&apos;t have to agree with me. I heard so much about Prey. &quot;Hey! Have you seen the new Prey video?! They&apos;re walking on the CEILINGS, dude!&quot; (something like that). It looked really freakin&apos; cool, too, so I had reasonably high expectations. The beginning was good. I liked how everything started. Then the first hour or two went by, and I was having fun--not a lot of fun, but still fun. And then the next couple hours went by with very little change in gameplay. I was still running down bland (the graphics were pretty and things were colorful, but so much was the same) one-way sci-fi corridors, using sci-fi weapons (which were good. maybe the best part of the game), fighting typical sci-fi monsters/aliens. Rinse, repeat. Oh, wait, I forgot the portals and gravity switches. Interesting concepts. Looking/moving through the portals was entertaining, yet, they stopped there. You&apos;ve got some pretty unique and possibly game-defining technology at your fingertips and all you do is use it to add minor, borderline-forgettable accents to an already very pretty, very generic fps. I felt like I was lied to. Maybe I didn&apos;t watch enough gameplay videos to be warned haha. I really thought the entire point of Prey was to blow your mind with fighting enemies up and down walls and in/out of portals for at least 50% of the game and in many different clever variations. The novelty wore down to a minimal level fairly quickly. And then came the lackluster final battle. And then it was over. 8-10 graphically pretty hours of over-hyped, lackluster fps play. And that spirit world thing? Felt like an afterthought, to me. The only thing going through my mind when I was shooting arrows at blue and red spirits was &quot;Could we please hurry this up so I can get out of here?&quot; Pros: Beautiful. A top-notch selection of weapons to play with. More than a few little &quot;Hey, that was cool&quot; moments. Cons: Story like a wallflower on prom night (ie doesn&apos;t stand out, or, &quot;What story?&quot;). Well-rendered, but still quite generic sci-fi environments (I cite Quake 2, Doom 3, Unreal, and Unreal 2 as games with similar stylings). Squandered opportunities for Prey to be something truly special--portals and gravity shift technology was not used often enough and cleverly enough to make much difference. Other: Is &quot;short&quot; a pro or a con?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=402424">Expand</a></span>

This has INSPIRED ME TO DO GREAT THINGS. Prey, was NOT one of these games. It started off well. The whole feeling of being abducted and finding yourself in a gibbering nightmare which had already broken the psyche of other people genuinely disturbed me. This is what I look for in a survival horror. The first few levels were real adventures in immersion and good storytelling. It was then at some point after killing that Demon Boss thing with it&apos;s own gun. (Weapons were superbly done, cannot fault the art direction in this game!) That things started to get a bit samey. I&apos;d be walking down another strange metal hall, with another row of freudian innuendos all over the walls, with more samey enemies which I would kill with a minor stroke of annoyance when I was teleported yet again to that same blue-ish thing to kill a few red things. It suffered from the same basic problem as Bioshock, wherin death has no consequence. You can just respawn about two feet from where you died so long as you hit enough red things. So you stop defending your life out of fear and start doing it so as not to drag the whole experience out any longer than is absolutely necessary. My attitude switched from &quot;I wonder what&apos;ll be on this level&quot; to &quot;Not another pissing level.&quot; The game could have been improved by cutting out the unnecessary levels and adding in a few more big concepts other than walk through forcefeild and push switch or shoot thing to change location of floor. Though despite what I have said I do think Prey is a good game. The same way that a Citreon Saxo is a good car. Sure it does what it&apos;s supposed to but you&apos;re always there wanting something more. Like how the storyline from the middle onward seemed to fall away. Moments like Tommy puking when he uses the gravity changer for the first time and catching glimpses of the resistance doing their thing as you tried to catch up to them were lost in favour of &apos;get here&apos; or &apos;climb this tower populated with a metric asston of enemies and save the damsel in distress.&apos; A solid seven. Pros: Art direction, first half of the story, adaptive AI, Cons: Lack of consequence for death cheapens combat, repetitive and badly paced gameplay, overused scenery.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=411591">Expand</a></span>

You may not like the game, but giving it a zero says more about your ignorance than the game. The clever portals and gravity changes are the first new things I&apos;ve seen in an FPS in a long time. The game maps are often brilliant and will force you to problem solve in 3 dimensions. What the game badly needed was more wide areas with tactical combat against a lot more enemies. You never take on more than a few at a time and it&apos;s always in cramped quarters. Even well-designed puzzles get old when they&apos;re linked back to back.

I personally hated the weapon selection and the general feel of the weapons. Its also very short. That being said, it is a cool game and when the price drops to $35-40 it will be worth your money if you like the genre.</span>

Unfortunately, Prey falls flat on its face in everything it tries... the only thing saving it from a 0 is the inclusion of the Talon segments. Everything else, however, is boring, predictable, and gimmicky.</span>

Is this innovation truly so or just a &quot;gimmick&quot;? Sadly, as I have read others who truly wanted more out of this experience say, Prey has fallen short of innovation (while still adding an idea to the FPS market that I hope really catches on in some way). The great thing about this game is truly the idea of messing around with gravity, physics, and even to some extent yer own soul. Unfortunately it really felt that when the developers came up with these ideas they didnt ask the good questions like &quot;Now will we make all this work as a cohesive whole?&quot; because quite honestly while the puzzles were great quite often I had no idea why some sequences were there and others were kind of used then forgotten. A good example to me is a great scene that blew my mind graphically. A room was created right before my eyes while im moving around not in a movie sequence but real time. A truly inspired moment that I only recall at the moment happening once. After finishing the game all I wanted to know was why they didnt mess with your head like that more often. The portals were a great idea but to me it felt like they knew they wanted them to add a great puzzle dynamic but in interest of using them alot they lost any sense of making it a cool thing to do throughout the entire game which left it feeling stale quite rapidly and just seemed no different then walking through a door once you got used to the idea. Innovation (or lack thereof) aside we have gameplay, graphics, and story left. Gameplay was pretty standard (molded in my opinoin straight from Doom 3) run... gun... solve a puzzle... get a soda (oh wait I did that in real life)... feel alone but have some- thing that drives you to keep going on this crazy ride... you get the idea I&apos;m sure. I enjoy this formula (dont get me wrong at all) but it&apos;s not a captivating formula nor is it new. Graphics were pretty standard as well which is why those players out there not into fantastical Sci-Fi hated it the most. A standard idea for that is develop new conceptual designs (aliens, guns, enivronments) which they did quite well but in my opinoin (I personally just like great stories so i dont care how real or straight up fantastical it turns out) they didnt push the envelop enough in the innovation department (start over if you forgot :P) to really make you care. Like Doom 3 the maps are very dark. In this they did make me happy cus i was never blind but because they used the Doom 3 engine alot of environments while great concepts did feel dull (darkness tends to create that feel in games if not done well enough) and sometimes I really just wanted to have a scene in reality (like in the town hes from or something) because of this. I really did get sick of being on that ship it bored me so much. Lastly, the story wasnt captivating enough, it was the same old anti-hero (guy who doesnt want to take responsibility for his life, family, heritage) that gets thrust into a situation that forces him to face everything he hates. Not spectacular by any means and Im not gonna give anything away but they went really sappy with it to. All in all its fun to play worth paying a small fee (like 10$ or whatever its at now) but dont expect the innovative epic experience it wants you to get if your like me and you like your games to feel truly fleshed out. I had to give it a 7 and that was because it was fun to play but not worth playing again until im bored.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=407471">Expand</a></span>

For longtime players like myself the portal and gravity shifts were a nice touch. Play could have been longer and difficulty should have been ramped up a little earlier. Very good game though.</span>
