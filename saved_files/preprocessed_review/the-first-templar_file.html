Unfortunately, there are many aspects of the game that look aged and tired. Shallow voice acting, both regarding content and delivery, kills the idea of voice acting. Running animations that look almost as if they came out of a last-gen console game got me all a titter. Seeing the characters display the same gestures repeatedly during dialogue sequences was actually the last straw for me, causing me to turn the game off.  It&apos;s not all bad, however. Having a controller hooked up lets you (nigh-instantly) do split-screen co-op, a feature that has long been dead on PC, and one that I miss constantly. The story might be good, if it weren&apos;t for the glaring delivery fumbles mentioned earlier. Sadly, the game deprived me of the patience to find out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-first-templar/user-reviews?user_review_id=1610475">Expand</a></span>

Moreover, guest characters can neither level up nor learn new abilities. You are, essentially, an NPC henchman in your friend&apos;s game. Animations are choppy and slow, weapons have no &quot;weight&quot; and the graphics are beyond antiquated - they are horrible. Easily the worst PC game in years, and an utter waste of money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-first-templar/user-reviews?user_review_id=1722547">Expand</a></span>

<br>Bad things:
<br>-combat moves are not much,also evey character has almost the same special abilities
<br>-bad skill system that is almost the same in every character and that made me spend XP randomly.
<br>-stealth is very easy and not realistic.
<br>-has about 8 soundtracks and most of them are short.
<br>-repetitive bonus missions where you get to burn supplies and sh*t.
<br>-what is challenging of finding collectibles when they are not well hidden??!
<br>in the end it&apos;s a good game that took me exactly 12 hours to complete with all these bonus missions and it&apos;s worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-first-templar/user-reviews?user_review_id=3986081">Expand</a></span>

The fact is that at its current price (and you can pick it up for under a fiver in most places now) it represents exceptional value and entertainment. The graphics and animation some people have whined about arent exactly going to win any major awards but niether are they going to make you cringe and complain unless you are one of those people who just HAS to have the prettiest looking games and couldn&apos;t care less about gameplay. So lets just move on from that and say that TFT is pure hack &apos;n&apos; slash clothed in a good story with an extremely high standard of voice acting. It&apos;s a shame that it has flaws that stop it being successful as a full-price release -and here they are: Anyone buying this game solely because they want a co-op game forget it; the co-op is just a minor diversion from what is essentially a single player game. The character skill progression system doesnt offer much variety in the way you play the game, most people will just boost health then proceed to mash away at the left mouse buton in most combat situations and its entirely possible to win the game on the normal setting by taking the health upgrades and just clicking away. The game is completely linear but I&apos;m really not a person who cares overmuch for non-linear anyway - I believe you can have just as much fun when you know which direction you are headed as when you are distracted by random choice. There&apos;s nothing wrong with the way stealth works in the game other than a major exploit/bug issue in that since the game will always restart you at the nearest &quot;checkpoint&quot; to which you died you can just run right through the biggest stealth level with every npc on the map chasing you and if you dont die till one of the last save points the game will restart you there with full health -oops. SO-O not sounding too good so far? Nope, but the storyline and the voice acting are engaging enough to lift this otherwise mediocre game well out of the mire and into Completing it Several Times and Getting All the Costumes Achievements Etc Status. The samey combat CAN be played about with if you take the time to get to grips with all those new moves you bought from the skill tree but didnt bother to use on your first playthrough because you didnt need to, the stealth section will work well enough if you play it as it&apos;s meant to be played, the combat is broken up by fairly simple logic puzzles where you switch between control of two characters, and the Templar&apos;s Chronicle that you collect throughout the game is interesting and based on real historical evidence. So for all its flaws I&apos;m giving this a solid seven for the simple fact that I enjoyed it anyway, played it to the end, and will play it to the end again on hard mode. How many games DONT keep you engaged enough that you can say you finished them (and maybe more than once)? I suspect most.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-first-templar/user-reviews?user_review_id=2503301">Expand</a></span>

Artists and level designers did their best. Though in these locations and there is nothing particularly grand, they are made with proper approach to detail and in any time not copying each other, carrying their share of uniqueness. Graphic design is praiseworthy: crisp texture, plenty of shadows, soft lighting - all this can not but rejoice. Sorry, but pumped up the animation. And if the stiff gait of heroes can still endure, the absence of any sane great facial animation contrasts with their high quality traced persons.
<br>
<br>From cards to ax
<br>
<br>The First Templar is not quickly dispersed. Many players will throw it right at the beginning: oddly enough, it performed worse than the rest of the game. Those who remain in it and advance further, unlikely to be impressed by anything. The ancient tale about the search for the Holy Grail - too worn out topic for speculation and a little bonus in the form of scattered Templar Code page level - fun for the units. Let&apos;s leave it to the conscience of Haemimont Games, because of their track record before that was limited mainly historical strategy. The First Templar - the first attempt in the genre of slasher developers, and call it a failure does not. However, just as difficult to confidently call it a success.
<br>
<br>Pros: nice graphics; good location; Templars.
<br>Cons: monotonous gameplay; a simple fighting system; slow development activities; levers.
<br>Verdict: not the best representative of the genre. It may interest fans of the Knights Templar and ancient traps.

<br>
<br>The story itself is pleasantly uncomplicated. I didn&apos;t even bother much with it. What&apos;s that? We&apos;re a knight in search of the Holy Grail? Whatever. Let&apos;s get our swords out and start slashing. The voice acting is generally good, but nothing outstanding. The atmosphere is great, though; the desert fortress of Acre is bright and dusty, while the village and swamps at the base of Montsegur castle are drab and dark. Environments in general are nicely detailed - not earth-shattering, but nice. You&apos;ll come across some incredibly low-res rocks and water at odd places in the game (usually towards the end). Fire and smoke are particularly well-rendered. This is not an open world btw; travel too far one way or another, and you&apos;ll come up against an invisible wall.
<br>
<br>The combat is very quick to learn, and the upgrade tree is very deep. There is some stealth (very easy), some boss battles (hard, but not too hard), Switching from one character to another is simple and seamless: just hit the Tab key to change to the other character. And you will need to do this to solve some of the dungeon puzzles. The puzzles themselves aren&apos;t that hard to complete, though if you charge in without analyzing the situation first, you&apos;ll die quickly.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s the problem with The First Templar: there&apos;s nothing really outstanding about it, but it is not a bad game either. It is average in just about every quantifiable category. I had fun with it. Not a must-buy at the current list price of $20; at $6 or less, though, it&apos;s a fun game to while away a few hours.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re purchasing for the co-op, only the hosting player gets achievements, so be sure to take turns hosting the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-first-templar/user-reviews?user_review_id=6492131">Expand</a></span>

I picked it up for .47 cents at a local store, and while I&apos;m not ashamed of it, I believe I would have payed a nice 20 dollars for this if asked. The graphics are nice, the combat is amazingly smooth. The block mechanics are a bit frustrating, and the double tap for dodging is... well, dodgy, but that game is overall a solid hack-and-slash. The skills as you progress are fun, the level design--while horribly linear--is well thought out. There are audio volume issues, yes, but the soundtrack is beautiful, and the voice acting isn&apos;t unbearably terrible. The story is simple, but combat is the focus of the game, and exploration the second, so I don&apos;t mind.
<br>
<br>In short, this game has aged remarkably well. It&apos;s simple, and worth picking up for a relaxing hack-and-slash adventure while waiting for the next AAA title you&apos;ll add to your library.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-first-templar/user-reviews?user_review_id=6671844">Expand</a></span>
