It featured gorgeous graphics for its time, and that in conjunction with the eery soundtrack created an atmospheric and immersive gameplay experience that still holds up today.</span>

A timeless classic who&apos;s art and production values are present in every facet of the game. From the lavish gothic UI and richly detailed character art and units the game is very beautiful. The art style has always made the Disciples series stand out. Gorgeous illustrated Unit portraits complement the nicely detailed maps, models and UI.
<br>
<br>When Disciples II originally launched it didn&apos;t garner the sort of appreciation it deserves. It became a bit of a cult classic and had improved on nearly every aspect of its forebear Disciples: Sacred Lands.
<br>
<br>I remember my first experience with the game was the demo I received through PC Gamer. I was hooked and drawn into its dark world. Its fantasy atmosphere was just that good. I loved that demo so much that when I saw Disciples II:Dark Prophecy and its two expansions were released in the &quot;Fantasy 6 pack&quot; I had to pick it up.
<br>
<br>The game is a turn based strategy game that has you playing one of 4 factions in the fantasy world of Nevendaar. Over the course of a scenario or mission you build a party and explored the map, fighting enemies, looting ruins, finding artifacts and treasure. As you capture cities, or plant rods (Using the Archangel healer hero) you expand your territory. Each faction has a visibly distinct terrain type that you expand to control resources on the map. You can play as the human empire, dwarven mountain clans, demonic legions of the damned, or even the undead hordes. Each faction has a respective god. The Highfather, Wotan, Bethrezen and Mortis. The game also features a scenario editor as well.
<br>
<br>Disciples II represents the very best of turn based strategy games and is right up there with the likes of Fire Emblem. There have been reports that the game has issues on Windows 7 64-bit on Steam. You may have better luck buying the game through GoG galaxy. I didn&apos;t run into any issues but that isn&apos;t to say others haven&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disciples-ii-dark-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6592897">Expand</a></span>

The only thing is combat, which becomes surprisingly boring after a while since there isn&apos;t much tactics involved in it. It would have been nice if units could move, and mages could cast a variety of spell rather than just one simple attack. Other than that the game is quite a lot of fun.</span>

A timeless classic who&apos;s art and production values are present in every facet of the game. From the lavish gothic UI and richly detailed character art and units the game is very beautiful. The art style has always made the Disciples series stand out. Gorgeous illustrated Unit portraits complement the nicely detailed maps, models and UI.
<br>
<br>When Disciples II originally launched it didn&apos;t garner the sort of appreciation it deserves. It became a bit of a cult classic and had improved on nearly every aspect of its forebear Disciples: Sacred Lands.
<br>
<br>I remember my first experience with the game was the demo I received through PC Gamer. I was hooked and drawn into its dark world. Its fantasy atmosphere was just that good. I loved that demo so much that when I saw Disciples II:Dark Prophecy and its two expansions were released in the &quot;Fantasy 6 pack&quot; I had to pick it up.
<br>
<br>The game is a turn based strategy game that has you playing one of 4 factions in the fantasy world of Nevendaar. Over the course of a scenario or mission you build a party and explored the map, fighting enemies, looting ruins, finding artifacts and treasure. As you capture cities, or plant rods (Using the Archangel healer hero) you expand your territory. Each faction has a visibly distinct terrain type that you expand to control resources on the map. You can play as the human empire, dwarven mountain clans, demonic legions of the damned, or even the undead hordes. Each faction has a respective god. The Highfather, Wotan, Bethrezen and Mortis. The game also features a scenario editor as well.
<br>
<br>Disciples II represents the very best of turn based strategy games and is right up there with the likes of Fire Emblem. There have been reports that the game has issues on Windows 7 64-bit on Steam. You may have better luck buying the game through GoG galaxy. I didn&apos;t run into any issues but that isn&apos;t to say others haven&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disciples-ii-dark-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6112654">Expand</a></span>
