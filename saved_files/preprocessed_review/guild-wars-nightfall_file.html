It blows Factions out of the water and it still gets a 1, that just shows you how bad Factions was/is. If you&apos;re into the game mainly for PvE (like I was) then don&apos;t waste your time, but if you&apos;re into it for PvP and unlocking things through PvP then the game isn&apos;t half bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-nightfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=398220">Expand</a></span>

This is to little to late as though I enjoyed guildwars when first released its now becomming far to familiar. I&apos;m giving it a 5 as it does not require the previous games and that there is no sub to pay. Anet needs to take the franchice a new direction like into the future.</span>

Sounds like a good idea? Read on. I can&apos;t begin to express my disapointment in this game. The flatter this game got is seriously exaggerated or the people playing it aren&apos;t really that demanding over their hard earned cash. The graphics are seriously poor, they are either not-cohesive with the background and they are also awkwardly animated. The user interface is at best cluttered and confusing. Even though it is highly custom friendly it looks like something from the Dungeon Siege 2 programmer&apos;s scratch board, where, by the way, this game goes alot for looks inspiration; the looting system and AI henchmen/hero wink the eye at it. On that, the henchmen and hero&apos;s sound like a great idea at first but, again, it works against it. It makes pve too easy. Most times you will just run amock and mayheming stuff while your artificial buddies heal and join you in the over easy slaughter. Not a real challange. The sound is decent, the theme music is catchy and appropriate, the voices feel forced and over acted. The intros feel unfinished. The whole thing looks forcefully glued together. The plot is irrelevant, you don&apos;t really feel compeled to know what&apos;s happening, you just move on and kill things, you don&apos;t really get a sense of depth. Instant travelling, althought like a great idea, doesn&apos;t help any. They obviously want you to get to full level asap so you can join the game&apos;s greatest strengtht. PVP. And well, if you like pvp there are probably a ton of other games that cover that. No wonder they arent giving out free trials. If I was a publisher that had a monthly free game that played like this, I would too try to hide it from customers before they could at least purchase the trial keys. The upside: No fee&apos;s, highly customable, instant full lvl for pvp bliss. There&apos;s less grinding compared to other online RPG&apos;s... except I don&apos;t think most people play that long to care. The downside: Gameplay is clumsy as well as clumsy and unfinished looks with a confusing UI, no real sense of immersion, looks and plays like an average shareware budget game with a full retail price. Conclusion: If you are still curious and tempted to get the game (like I was) don&apos;t let the &quot;free monthly fee&quot; be the only reason since that is only a major selling point if you DO endup playing the game often. There are other choices with no monthly fee&apos;s that are much more enjoyable than this game. Even an old school title like DS2, which undoubtly served as an inspiration for this game, would prove more fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-nightfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=399145">Expand</a></span>
