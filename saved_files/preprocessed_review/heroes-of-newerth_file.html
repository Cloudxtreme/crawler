The graphics help to bring the players into the right mood for a battle between the avatars. The community isn&apos;t the best but when you reach a higher mmr/psr the community improves slightly. Everyone who tries the game for the first time usually ends up with noobs as both teammates and opponents. Personal experience tells me that the reason newcomers complain about the community is that they, the newcomers, just ignore the more experienced players when they try to give them an advice in the hero picking phase or so. If you are patient and willing to play for the team rather than for yourself only, the mood for that game will nearly all ways be nice and calm.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=2111336">Expand</a></span>

All three games have insanely TERRIFYING and rewarding learning curves and on top of that the community of players is nightmarish. Players in this game are ruthless, mean, spiteful, and better than you. These games will absolutely wreck you for the first month of play until you learn every hero, their skills, the map, the items, and the mechanics. When you overcome all of this and get decent with a few heroes so much so that you can actually change the outcome of a game then THIS BECOMES THE ONLY GAME YOU EVER WANT TO PLAY. This whole experience is infinitely easier and more fun if you have a few friends to accompany you throughout. Your friends will help you learn everything quicker, you will be able to be more strategic and communicate with your teammates better, and most importantly your friends will help you keep your chin up and stay positive and take the high road when people with huge e-peens and superiority complexes try to get in your face about the game. I can go on for another 4000 characters about this game but I already think that people won&apos;t read this haha. PHENOMENAL GAME, UNBELIEVABLY REWARDING, BETTER THAN THE COMPETITION, AND BUILDS CHARACTER!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115018">Expand</a></span>

It adds new heroes as well as total copies from DotA. Originally Heroes of Newerth seemed to be made to be a total clone of DotA to give Dota players the ability to try out a &quot;Dota 2.0&quot; as such. At first it was a very promising game to totally wipe out DotA with new important features and engine and graphical enhancements. The gameplay itself is extremely solid and stays true to Dota, but now the gameplay is the only thing it has going for it. Heroes of Newerth is a terribly coded game, graphical issues, crashes, connection problems, servers dropping out, annoying bugs and much more stuff added to just be a pain in the backside. To make things worse, the community sucks, but it isn&apos;t the games fault for that, it&apos;s more the genre... S2 as a company also is pretty damn ordinary and I get the sense that they always take the factor of adding new stuff to the game, rather than fixing the current stuff that doesn&apos;t work (most patches will always have a bug that will not be fixed for a long time, for example, simple things like Herodex sorting and the time until you can unpause is still not fixed). Another thing is, if you compare Icefrog&apos;s  balance change schedule of Dota, to S2&apos;s, it is generally pretty disgusting. A GAME LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BE BALANCED REGULARLY, NOT ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS! When they do finally decide to balance the game it&apos;s usually too few and too minor changes to affect anything (did anyone see how Icefrog balanced the game, he was a freaking beast). To size it up, HoN has good points and many bad points, the gameplay is excellent, everything else is pretty damn ordinary. Still a better game than LoL though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=2014570">Expand</a></span>

The game feels responsive, which is of massive importance in this genre.

I created an account specifically to create a review that more accurately reflects this game--I think it has received a lot of criticism that is just wrong, which is common for cutthroat games like these.  HoN does not have the worst player community, Dota does.  Dota 2 may be better, but I will never know because Dota 2 is just a Dota clone that has even more childish looking graphics, and they added in the ridiculous Clinkz hero on purpose, which is unforgivably stupid (Scout in HoN can be compared to Clinkz, but he is at least melee which makes him 3x more vulnerable).  League of Legends has the most cartoonish graphics of all, and attracts people who are cartoonish and childish themselves.  Heroes of Newerth is distastefully ridiculous at times, but more often than not, the game is just down right hilarious (e.g., the owl with laserbeams graphic for their 1st year anniversary).  Heroes of Newerth is the only MOBA game that is geared for mature adults, but it still of course does have people raging and insulting on the internet.  Their penalties for leavers has stopped that problem almost completely, but I do disapprove of their concede system, which makes many games finish unnecessarily early if they start badly.
<br>
<br>Now let&apos;s get down to the details of the gameplay itself.  When playing MOBA games, it becomes clear that people have no idea what&apos;s fair and balanced.  When Dota would receive updates, it was a constant disappointment.  As the leadership in Dota 2 is the same, I would expect the same results.  Every update to Heroes of Newerth was the complete opposite, with the exception of some hero additions who don&apos;t pique my interest.  The item changes and additions have been absolutely incredible.  The game has also has as many options as you could want, very simple hotkey setup, and outright hilarious voice choices (Including Samuel L. Jackson parodying himself from Pulp Fiction!).  Best of all, they have finally added in the funnest mode of play (OMG mode in Dota 1), called Rift Wars, where the skills are randomly chosen and change after each death.  The worst thing about this game is that it takes a while to get used to, and doesn&apos;t feel great when you lose terribly.  As a bottom line, if you like strategy rpg games made for adults and are competitive, exciting, and have a fantasy setting, this is the best sport you could waste your time with.

<br>Note:  When I recently re-installed the game, I had to switch the graphics to OpenGL and then do a &quot;repair install&quot; from the options menu, which took an extra 5 minutes for my free game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3958749">Expand</a></span>

LoL sucks so in my opinion there are two great classic moba&apos;s to choose from dota 2 and hon. The main reason i like hon better is because of the differences from dota  . There is no secret shop, you have auto leveling and runes are better is hon (because of the refresher rune) there are other differences but these are why i like hon better. The one thing i can say is that S2 is horrible and the dota servers better. Ever want a laugh look up S2&apos;ed in youtube and you will see what i am talking about. 8 out of 10 is a very honest review for this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4390574">Expand</a></span>

Needs some better support for guild. Has in-game VOIP, great spectator system and a lot of re-playability. Definitely worth checking out if your waiting for DOTA 2.</span>

The only critique I have with this game is it&apos;s incredible steep learning curve. To actually be a valuable asset to your team you have to play numerous hours (20+), and in the beginning you&apos;re going to feed very very much. Anyhow, I&apos;m hooked since the first minute. TLDR: The best MOBA on the market with a extremly high skill ceiling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=1797385">Expand</a></span>

There are many things to learn and that comes with practice and hour and hours of time playing and watching replays and asking questions. The community however will not be welcoming you as a new players in general (this includes myself). you can be kicked for poor play, you will be verbally aggressed for simply not being good!  That said, the game has recently become free to play, so what do you have to lose other than hours of valuable time and possibly your soul!

There is no easy way to put it, but you will want to yell at your team mates and they will want to yell at you. With a game so focused on working as a team where it is all about setting up combinations that are effective in team battles you can not avoid emotions. Really need to stress to not take this game too seriously as it is just a game and having fun is the goal, but be prepared to be just torn apart if you do anything that someone else feels isn&apos;t up to snuff. The good thing is that when you are playing well as a team nothing is quite as awesome as turning a game where you were losing into a game where you are destroying. That  is why I keep coming back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=1384145">Expand</a></span>

It is essentially a copy from the Warcraft 3 custom map &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot; or &quot;DotA&quot;.<br><br>In HoN (and DotA) you choose from a vast variety of Heroes, each with different roles and abilities. Your team of five players versus another five players with the aim of &quot;pushing&quot; lanes, and eventually destroying the opponent&apos;s main structure. AI units (&quot;creeps&quot;) spawn every 30 seconds from either side of the three lanes, which automatically attempt the push the lane. If your Hero is nearby when an enemy creep or enemy Hero dies, you gain experience. By gaining experience, your Hero eventually levels up, allowing you to learn/improve your different abilities. By killing creeps and Heroes, you gain gold (as well as gaining gold periodically) which allows you to purchase items to make your Hero stronger.<br><br>The graphics in HoN is a huge improvement over the Warcraft 3 graphics DotA was utilising and being able to reconnect to a game is a great if you have an unexpected connection issue.<br><br>Many of the Heroes in HoN are clones from the DotA Heroes, which for someone like myself is good - having played DotA for a while, I am able to play HoN with all my old favourites. Although, not all the Heroes from DotA have been ported over. And there are even some non-DotA Heroes in HoN which are really good.<br><br>For someone new to this type of game, HoN can be quite difficult to grasp. The majority of the HoN community can be quite mean to new players. However, an easy way to overcome this is to play no-stat games. In HoN, different statistics are tracked as you play, such as Kill:Death Ratio, win %, and Public Skill Rating (PSR). When you win/lose your PSR will go up/down depending on the PSR of all the other people playing. Since most people would like to have a high PSR, they critizise new players who cause them to lose the game, and thus cause their PSR to go down. When playing a no-stat game, none of the stats a tracked, so people aren&apos;t aggressive.<br><br>However, the game costs 30USD. Which, for a game, 30USD isn&apos;t really that much.<br>Every now and again, Heroes of Newerth has a free-to-play-weekend or even a free-to-play-week where you can play as much as you like for the period. If you want to try -before-you-buy, keep an eye out for these free-to-play periods.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=1365774">Expand</a></span>

Overall the community is fairly similar to DOTA, however due to the statistics, if you have a low K/D Ratio or Kills to Deaths ratio, odds are you won&apos;t be allowed in numerous games, and thats a problem for some new players and a solution for more of the veteran players who hate playing with newbies.  I believe this game was built well, with great intentions, but seems to be missing the option of hiding statistics to make life easier on newbies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=1366594">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I also enjoy the graphics style, and most of the original (non-dota) heroes are relatively well-designed and made, with some exceptions. I love the MMR system and the region locks so I don&apos;t have to deal with people that don&apos;t speak English every single game (I&apos;m looking at you, Dota 2). However, the game&apos;s community is also one of the worst out there - very discouraging to new players. Also there&apos;s a ton of trolls and griefers. Would recommend to play with a team to deal with that, or try to get up to 1800+ MMR where there is less trolls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4137229">Expand</a></span>

Dota 2 is a thumbed down version of the original dota,and much less action based+fun than hon. League of legends has always been a terrible game,and I highly recommend HoN over any other moba game if you&apos;re tired to dota.</span>

I had played DotA and LoL, but neither of them had prepared me for this game. The learning curve is insane, and the system is not friendly to new players. There are hardly any kind of information outside of the website itself, including new player guides. Even being experienced with gameplay and strategy, I could not understand the game itself. The spells have no given range indicator, the tutorial has no true learning in it (just completely destroying bots with a 24 level advantage if i remember correctly) The system does not even at least match new players with other new players, instead you could be playing with someone who has actively played since the release (unlikely but possible). Spending money on this game also provides such advantages that cannot be overcome through earning in games. It is also difficult to join a game, for all the players are usually on European or South American servers. Without going into the real gameplay at all, HoN is much worse than other games of its kind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=1799877">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not very user friendly to new players and the community is horrible to everyone (or just about anyone and everyone who has a bad game). I only play this game with friends because its the only time I enjoy it and will never play it again with randoms. some of the biggest cons which rank below how bad the community is is that the matchmaking is pretty poorly done and you can wait up to 10 minutes to get into some games. This game can be enjoyable and well-balanced however I highly recommend that you play it with people you know so you get the most enjoyment out of it. I am not overreacting to how bad the community is (90% of games I&apos;ve played have contained flaming and abuse), If the community was better I&apos;d give this game a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=2158808">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are a bit dark and gory but if you are into that type of thing, it isn&apos;t an issue at all. The controls are responsive; more so than DotA 2 but less than LoL. Unfortunately, what could be an exceptional gaming experience is ruined by arguably the most rude bunch of gamers in the MOBA world. It was shocking to see how visceral the players were. I would note that their rudeness is only comparable to their utter contempt for anyone beginning the game. If you like MOBA type games, you will be better off sticking to DotA 2 or LoL. Unless you are also an ass, then you will fit right in. It is a shame really that a great game platform is really ruined by the community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=2736754">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been trying out Gemini which is a slow starter but very excellent in mid-late game. The bots in this game is a bit smarter than the bots in LoL- if you&apos;re playing hard ones of course, or else they&apos;ll just run at you and AA you until they die. Overall I think that this is a hard game to master, unlike LoL&apos;s simplicity for newer players, I wouldn&apos;t recommend this if you don&apos;t have the patience to practice against bots until you&apos;re DECENT. I also don&apos;t like the little gimmicks with the shop like wtf change your name&apos;s colour?
<br>
<br>EDIT *most important of all*: The **** voice acting is horrendous! The effects they add to them is just un-****-believably annoying. Had to mute the voices because they were bothering me. The turrets don&apos;t make sense too, if you attack them with your minions you get targeted suddenly for no god damn reason. It&apos;s also laggy when you move... Yup I just remembered all of these reasons why it&apos;s hard to switch over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4050723">Expand</a></span>

<br>Essentially a dota port, but does a lot of things differently and questionably so. I started playing it in beta back in &apos;09 and have now migrated to Dota 2 after dropping this game in 2010. At the time it came out, it was the best MOBA game out there; it had fixes for everything that made dota clunky and miserable, and some cool new graphics/art. Things like reconnecting to games if your computer crashed, online matchmaking, parties, etc. which dota sorely lacked and still has issues with. One new introduction, that I would argue is incredibly detrimental, is player stats. That is: gold/min, kdr, etc. This REALLY encourages individualistic play over team play in what is clearly a team game. Another downside is that HoN has an incredibly unforgiving and downright mean user base, and hardly anyone is ever banned for abusive language or behavior.
<br>
<br>It began to diverge from dota and try to claim a new identity of its own when the devs caught wind of dota 2. Now, the game is in a weird place where League of Legends has a far larger user base, and is making more money off of them, and Dota 2 is coming in with Valve&apos;s full force behind it. HoN is trying to play both sides by adding unique heroes and go free-to-play.
<br>
<br>To be honest, if I had to rate this game today, it would get a 5; Dota 2 just blows it out of the water and there&apos;s no reason to stick with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=2151080">Expand</a></span>

It took me a lot of time to adapt, after I did it became a little bit better but not much. It is good S2Games took the world of Savage 1 and 2 and expanded it much more than before but this is not a game for everyone and it wasn&apos;t for me, I&apos;d rather be playing Savage 2 that apparently has way more people than this. Graphics are good, sound is decent, story doesn&apos;t exist, and the gameplay is tedious. It may get repetitive in a short time the only thing that varies is the heroes, once you figure out the different types it becomes the same thing over and over. I didn&apos;t enjoy this, the best part of this game though it that its free, so try it and take the verdict yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=2405779">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Since writing my original review, I discovered that the game was updated a few months ago with bots and other improvements.  The addition of bots piqued my interest and I downloaded Heroes of Newerth again.  I was actually quite impressed with the changes that adding bots did to the game.  Although there were still a lot of rude people (mostly from Europe, therefore I permanently avoided using those servers after games with guys who cussed repeatedly over the voice chat at mistakes teammates made), I enjoyed the updated tutorial (thank goodness!) which better introduced me to the game than the original did last summer.  I also liked the AI of the bots to a certain extent.  The number of bots are very limited.  Developer S2 only made a handful of bots internally, leaving the rest of the bots for the community to create.  Other than that, predicting the bots&apos; behavior after a few rounds helped me settle into the steep learning curve a lot easier than the first time I played.  Since Co-op vs. AI was added, the player community overall improved a lot, especially after I learned that vote-kicking outright was replaced with vote-kicking AFK players only.
<br>
<br>However, I still have some issues with the game.  I&apos;ve been playing off and on for a few weeks now and I noticed something that the game lacks, and that is balancing.  Every single update that comes out, there is only the cosmetic bug fixes to some heroes so their abilities respond better, but overall, I&apos;ve seen absolutely no hero balancing whatsoever.  Therefore, a hero that&apos;s fed early can snowball out of control very easily and single-handedly fend off the entire enemy team (or kill them within a second as soon as they spawn at the fountain).  Not even the champions of League of Legends can do this sort of slaughter!  It&apos;s ridiculous.
<br>
<br>Overall, the bots (and a friendly player) brought me back into the game.  While it&apos;s still not a cakewalk for new players to pick up the game, the overhauled tutorial and new bots will still help rookies get familiar with the game.  I&apos;d still recommend League of Legends over Heroes of Newerth  due partially to the lack of hero balancing  but if you can grasp the mechanics quickly, the game is a fun, fast-paced alternative MOBA to play if you&apos;re looking for something new.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3013671">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Heroes of Newerth has a highly technical aspect worth praise and leads the game to having a high replay value. The game is also responsive, which is worth noting compared to DOTA and Dota 2, which are known for being relatively unresponsive.
<br>
<br>HoN uses a free-2-play model with a low pay-2-win barring in the form of &apos;early access&apos; that is currently suspended for an indeterminate amount of time. Therefore, has de facto no pay-2-win aspect.
<br>
<br>The game is not meant for the casual gamer and lends itself to the moderate-hardcore gaming crowd. For those moderate-hardcore gamers, this is definitely worth giving a try. Casual gamers, steer clear.
<br>
<br>All my reviews are given a base of 10 with marks of -1 points for notable negative aspects of the game.
<br>
<br>-1 Extremely critical community. Unfriendly, sometimes even hostile, to new players.
<br>-1 Developers of the game (S2 Games) historically, consistently implement and reverse major changes.
<br>-1 Features Region Locks</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3239194">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Compared to Dota 2 and LoL, i find it more mature (within the game, not the community) and very much more withdrawn from the basic skills. Its very challenging and has it intense moments.
<br>
<br>When you are fighting 5vs5 in the middle of the wars and your team is winning and raising down their base, its a pretty good feeling.
<br>
<br>Tho HoN has it downs too. The community is full with alot of self-ego rich kids, or russian idiots who dont even show respect to the others. They prefer to speak russian in the mic and ignore the rest of the team when they queue together as friends.
<br>
<br>If your looking for a good and advanced MOBA game, i&apos;ll still recommend HoN over Dota2 and LoL.
<br>
<br>Just get ready to have some patience and pick support alot to raise your MMR.
<br>When your getting higher rank, (1800+) you&apos;ll notice abit change in the attitude of your teammates which is good.
<br>
<br>More people are mature and reasonable, but beyond that is just a freaking disaster. Especially when you start your rank at 1500+. Be ready that people will not communicate, or pick support in the match.
<br>
<br>So aslong your patience, and willing to support with wards and courier alot in the start. You&apos;ll get your turn to pick a agi/strenght in time. :-)
<br>
<br>Due to the lack of community, im giving this game a 6. If it wouldnt because of the community, (or the money-grabbing S2 which releases a &quot;once in a lifetime alternative avatar then re-release it the next half year&quot; it would be a 10/10 gameplay.
<br>
<br>Because when you do get a good game, that rush is just incredible.
<br>Its very challenging and intense. HoN has it moments when its ALOT of fun and very compelling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-of-newerth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3879084">Expand</a></span>
