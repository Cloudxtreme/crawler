<br>The thing I find horrible is the execution. Just a few songs that you have to repeat over and over to grind for items and at some point, you&apos;ll likely to suddenly hit a wall with some enemy because he has so much health and so high a defense that you just can&apos;t kill him fast enough, no matter the spell combination. And once again, the grinding would have to commence. But not with me. I&apos;ve played those same songs over and over already, providing no new challenge upon repetition (unlike games like e.g. Frequency where you would get a rating, you could see your improvement and whatnot) and I won&apos;t any more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/before-the-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2624341">Expand</a></span>

Several NPCs have some really great dialogue, which kept me eager to push through to the next story scene. It would have been nice to have a lot more variety in the music, but thankfully the handful of tracks, especially Ronald Jankee&apos;s work, are all great. Considering only two people made the game (and it only cost me $1.25), Sequence was and is a memorable experience worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/before-the-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2788910">Expand</a></span>

But it is slightly deeper than just hitting the right button with the song rhythm because they throw in some RPG elements like spells, armor, and weapons alongside some basic character stats like hit points and mana. The music is the strong part of the game although so far it&apos;s been mostly techno type stuff. The story is vague and dumb. Overall, it&apos;s a bizarre attempt at mixing these two game genres together and the execution comes off pretty weak. It&apos;s definitely different...I&apos;ll give it that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/before-the-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2198051">Expand</a></span>

But the game-play, I feel, isn&apos;t where this game shines. The music is catchy and full of silly names. I found myself drifting off to sleep one night and I couldn&apos;t get the blasted tune of one song out of my mind! And also: this game is fully voice acted. It&apos;s not the greatest voice acting, but it is certainly not the worst. As well, the whole cast of characters are full of internet life, with many &quot;sub culture&quot; jokes finding their way into the game. This and the voice acting really breathe life into Sequence, and that&apos;s what I think makes this game worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/before-the-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1816249">Expand</a></span>

The core of the game is essentially a Stepmania clone (i.e., Dance Dance Revolution with the arrow keys). However, sequence makes things more complicated by giving you three screens to cycle between. The red screen is the DEFEND screen, and all beats you miss on this screen are taken as damage. The green screen is the CAST screen, which only throws beats at you when you attempt to cast a spell or effect via hotkeys on the numpad. Missing beats on the CAST screen causes your spell to automatically fail. The blue screen is a MANA recovery screen. There is no penalty for missing beats, but every beat hit recovers a small amount of mana. The action is complex, as you have to punch the arrows to the beat, cycle between the three screens, and cast spells all at once, which gives you quite a lot to watch. The only things I can say to watch out for with this game is that, firstly depending on your monitor, you may have to manually calibrate lag, and while the game makes adjusting the offset extremely easy, it does not provide a very good means of testing your offset compared to other popular rhythm games. As a result, it can take some trial and error to work out lag issues. Secondly, although this is not a complaint per se, I would caution any prospective buyers that the RPG elements in the game are extremely light. There is no exploration, there are three monsters to fight per floor, and you simply choose the monster as you would a song in Stepmania or DDR. You replay the monsters (i.e., songs) for experience or item drops that give you attack or defense perks, and there are some synthesis/item creation mechanics, but this is a rhythm game with some RPG stuff tacked on, not the other way around. Finally, the game has a sense of humor that some people are going to appreciate for its silliness and some people are going to find just dumb. For me, the humor has been hit or miss, floating at about the 50/50 mark. All in all, though, the game is great for a light and breezy casual game that&apos;s easy to jump in and out of, especially considering its low asking price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/before-the-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1804846">Expand</a></span>

Voice-acting and music are top-notch, there&apos;s also plenty of good humour here. It&apos;s a rhythm game, but far more complicated than standard one. You need to control three separate screens, so without an xbox controller you will fail miserably;) Gameplay is difficult, that is for sure... but who does not like challenges? :)  I highly recommend this for all lovers of finger-breaking, rhythm games and arcade games in general. It won&apos;t steal your heart, but it&apos;s charming enough to steal a couple hours of your life ;)  In conclusion :  7 points for Sequence!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/before-the-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1981674">Expand</a></span>

And while I mean that as a negative this game isnt the holy grail of indie gaming as people say it is.<br><br>Now to get started I gotta say I have played indie games in the past, I have bought every single humble bundle. But what I mean when I say &quot;cheap&quot; is that this game feels like a flash game, more so than most flash games now days. The gameplay can be described simply an RPG with DDR as the fighting mechanic, wich sounds cool but the game really lacks any energy to deliver said coolness. Part of the problem is the characters stand still, some animation would really help to game this game feel less dull. The music dosent help too much either as it&apos;s mostly pretty laid back. Some drum n&apos; bass or eurobeat would really make difference in the tone of this game.<br><br>And lastly we come to the dialogue. oh dear, this is awful. This really feels like the developers are trying way too hard to be funny, and they&apos;re not most of the time.<br>And it&apos;s not like when they fail you think &quot;hey, &quot;A&quot; for effort&quot; but rather &quot;Oh no shut up you hipsters&quot;. What it boils down to is that this game feels like its made by hipsters for hipsters, and while that dosent kill the gameplay it still would need some time in development and maybe one more person to be in charge of the step charts.<br><br>After all else has been said, pick it up once it&apos;s on sale, its not exactly worth 4&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/before-the-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2074281">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played Through Fire and Flames on Guitar hero on expert, and I play StepMania, one of the most intense rhythm games out there. When I saw this game I was kinda disappointed at first because the notes (arrows) looked very simple, and at first glance it looks MUCH too simple in comparison to something like Dragonforce on guitar hero, but when combined with the RPG mechanic, and having to switch between 3 screens, it ended up being surprisingly challenging.
<br>
<br>The crafting system could use some tweaks, and the overall gameplay is somewhat repetitive (as to be expected of a rhythm game) but I absolutely loved the story line, and the songs. One of the only indie games that I&apos;ve enjoyed.

This game is a grindfest with rythm gameplay. They keep reusing the same songs over and over again right from the second level. You keep having to re-fight the same ennemies to get XP and the elements to create new items... There is no real RPG in the fact that you dont have anything to explore or anything. You jump from menu to menu and when ready to battle you select &quot; battle&quot;. That&apos;s it. The story isnt compelling either but the dialogues are funny if you like slightly immature jokes. Other issue is that the musics, though nice, dont seem to fit a rythm game to me. They lack contrast and the keys you have to press dont seem to match the musics at all half of the times. Be sure to have a joypad to play too.

<br>The things I don&apos;t like as much is that the game recycles lots of music (Little more variation would be nice). The thing that really kills it for me is the interface... It&apos;s extremely difficult to tell when a spell is ready, and I have lost several battles because of that. Also, the spell effects are ALWAYS in the way of your sight which means; the better you are, the more you will be shooting yourself in the foot. It&apos;s really sad, as It&apos;s really an easy fix, and the game would be much better without compromising it&apos;s unique gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/before-the-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2739282">Expand</a></span>
