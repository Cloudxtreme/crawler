It isnt the most serious shooter in the world.  But if you play things other than call of duty then get this! you wont be dissapointed.  Looks amazing on a good gaming pc!

There is this mass illusion in the game industry that each game has mechanics slightly more polished than its predecessors. While you can tweak it a bit, the shooter formula has reached its apex, and while Bioshock Infinite does improve superficially on both the vigors and the guns, especially in the latter category (gunfire and recoil more realistic), it&apos;s really what it doesn&apos;t do that the game needed more of. Some have complained about the lack of RPG elements (with the exception of gun and vigor upgrades), such as inventory or map screen. I found this to be a huge improvement. There is no menu interaction to slow the pacing and you&apos;re always on the move. I thought the tone of the game world would have felt more immersive with the lack of a HUD, much like the first gameplay demo Irrational Games released several years ago. But all of the above are personal opinions and design choices. What left a sour taste in my mouth wasn&apos;t anything you can experience in the game itself. No, you could only experience this bittersweet regret if you had watched, in eager anticipation, all of Ken Levine&apos;s interviews, only to realize you had just witnessed the biggest cop out in gaming history.
<br>
<br>Expectation #1: An actual floating city, complete with physics.
<br>
<br>After the first demo that was released (which is never shown in the game), we see one of the massive, orange balloons tethered to the corner of a belltower deflate suddenly and the massive structure starts to pivot towards the ground, the bell flying loose from its moorings only to come grinding to a stop inches away from your feet, the cobblestones buckling under its weight and shooting off in every direction. Later, Ken Levine commented on the instablity of the city, how the tech team had made it pulse with life, and hinted that you&apos;d be able to topple the city around you. This fell short on both accounts, the only undulating architecture in the game appearing during the first half, and after you&apos;re solidly captivated by the world, these stellar sights give way to more mundane gameplay (street shootouts and interior combat). It never feels like their main selling point is really taken to its full potential.
<br>
<br>Expectation #2: Watch the city tear itself apart (pre-Rapture)
<br>
<br>This is the big one. I want to be as harsh as possible when I say that this was a blatant lie. We were supposedly going to &apos;watch the city fall apart before us&apos;. We were told that there would be moments where you would have to interact with citizens on the street, such as pointing a gun at a potential mugger to send him scrambling, or intervening in a local execution (both of which are shown in the same demo). There are maybe three moments in the entire game where you feel this sort of weight behind your actions, and they are as superfluous as they are dull. You can&apos;t change the overall outcome of anything, although watching the colorful, Independence Day style utopia burn slowly is captivating in its own way. I would have preferred a little more interaction, hence replayability.
<br>
<br>Expectation #3: A decent resolution.
<br>
<br>This one is debatable. And the main reason for the spoilers tag. Let&apos;s get the big one out of the way, the resolutions to each storyline. Both Daisy Fitzroy and Jeremiah Fink are shadowbox characters that bleed out of the story as quickly as they pop in. Slate is one of the more interesting characters but doesn&apos;t feel fully fleshed out. Don&apos;t get me started on Comstock. Let&apos;s face it, time travel was both the protagonist and antagonist here. It solves everything (most levels are going back and forth through the area in different time periods), and also helps ease along the ruthlessly shoehorned ending. But despite all of this, the ending was emotional and relatively significant enough to make it feel as if it &apos;belonged&apos;. It was the gamer in me that made me want to slap Ken Levine. Songbird becomes your best bud and then you get to watch him drown in two seconds. Apparently the Bioshock story will never change because even with its fairly restricted narrative parameters, it&apos;s the doorway to infinite worlds just like it with new coats of paint (so we can expect this disappointment forever). Oh, and my personal favorite: The final boss is three waves of the easiest enemies in the game. No Handyman. No Songbird. Fail.
<br>
<br>But aside from all the things they promised and didn&apos;t deliver, this is a bittersweet shooter, with some amazingly satisfying gameplay regarding the vigors and gunplay, but some equally frustrating inconsistencies in the pacing and storyline. Oh, and this game tries desperately to emulate Disney (and doesn&apos;t do a bad job), but it&apos;s so obvious in parts it&apos;s almost painful, especially if you&apos;re like me and find the overall &apos;girl in a tower&apos; concept a little overused and cheesy.
<br>
<br>Still, if you&apos;re a fan of shooters or Bioshock in general, you owe it to yourself to see how far the series has come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3087888">Expand</a></span>

It is also overated, over-hyped and someone less than the coming-of-the-Messiah it pretends to be. Infinite has wonderful ambience and atmosphere. The city of Columbia was built with passion and care. The art STYLING is brilliant. Likewise the main characters are sublime. Certain set-pieces are BRILLIANT. Yet finally this game does not stand up as a product that is worth $60. It is far too short and the shooting/exploring elements are far too limited, a kind of theatrical filler between the numerous set-pieces of this scenic railroad. Good though it is, this is a game to wait for. Wait till the hype blows over and get it when it hits its true value of around $20. The combat is fun but not challenging. Enemy AI is weak. The game is also far too linear and NARROW in terms of both player progress and narrative. The game finally exposes its true weaknesses, after many great moments when the plot falls to pieces at the end with one of the most head-scratching (in a negative sense) and RIDICULOUS conclusions you will ever see in a game. The ending is not deep. It is not a philosphical marvel. It&apos;s an incoherent mess that will have you wondering what the team at Irrational Games have been smoking for the last FIVE YEARS. While the anti-American Exceptionism is fairly amusing is is also over-played. Doesn&apos;t Ken Levine understand the word subtlety? Bioware Infinite is definitely a game to be enjoyed when the price comes down. I understand the desire of users to praose any game to the heavens. It happened also with Skyrim, which simply was also not very good. Keep waiting boys and girls, a true 10/10 game will get made eventually. Enough dudes are working at it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3058943">Expand</a></span>

You can tell that there was an enormous amount of thought put into every detail, down to the very last corner. Bioshock Infinite is my favorite game to date, no question about it.
<br>
<br>To start, the art direction is very good. Everything is arranged to be very appealing, and the colors are very balanced. I loved just walking around the city and soaking it all up. There are 1912 style shops to go into, and they are all populated. In one area, there is even a good, three-minute quartet that you can just sit and listen to. I was very impressed with the magnitude of everything. Seldom are you placed in a small, dark room or hallway. Most of the game is set in colorful areas with large statues and airy buildings.
<br>
<br>I liked that it didn&apos;t actually put you in the dark, but gave a dark feeling when it was appropriate. As per the Bioshock games, some of the events are quite dark-- and I liked the uneasy feeling without the dark corridors of Rapture.
<br>
<br>Combat is a step up from other games in the genre. The introduction of &quot;skylines&quot; allows you to jump quickly from place to place, making everything very fast paced. I didn&apos;t quite like the inventory management as much as in the original Bioshock, however. I found it much harder to deal with my Vigors, mainly because you couldn&apos;t just scroll through them like in the other game. Still, you get used to it-- that&apos;s a fairly minor gripe.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t really say much about the story. If I told you what was so great about it, I&apos;d spoil it for you. I can say that it puzzled me, and it was a few hours after finishing the game that I worked everything out. I felt like some of the points were repeated too much though. I get that they try to help everyone understand it well, but I&apos;d rather just have it all thrown at me-- that way it&apos;s more fun to work out on my own.
<br>
<br>Overall, Irrational Games has gone above and beyond what anyone expected. The only way you&apos;d find this game worse than the original is if you&apos;re somewhat nostalgic. Even if you didn&apos;t like the first or second game, I really suggest that you still give Bioshock Infinite a try. As a side note, there are a few things that you won&apos;t quite understand if you skip the first game. They are little details, but in a game like Bioshock Infinite, it&apos;s those little details that really count.
<br>
<br>This game is worth every cent. If you can&apos;t afford it, you can get it off the grey market for an earbud or so (about $35).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3092741">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is good, the story is wonderfully told and the world is worth the purchase alone. In a market saturated by &quot;HOORA AMERICA&quot;shooters (Battlefield, Call of Duty, Homefront, Medal of Honor), it&apos;s refreshing to see a game tear American Exceptionalism apart. While the gameplay is pretty solid, the real stars are the story and the world. The developers took a lot of big risks in this game, with a lot of decisions that could have easily backfired and ruined the whole experience. The fact that everything works so well together is remarkable in its own right. I think calling it &quot;The greatest game of all time&quot; like some other reviewers are is kind of a stretch, but certainly I don&apos;t think anything else coming out this year will even approach the quality of Bioshock Infinite. If you liked the first Bioshock, you probably already have this game, but if you don&apos;t you owe it to yourself to get this. If you felt that the gameplay was dull in the original Bioshock or that that lack of subtlety in dealing with broader philosophical and political concepts was problematic, you&apos;re going to find the same issues here. However, I absolutely loved the experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3074582">Expand</a></span>

A graphics itself feels kinda old, but light effects are awesome, so i don&apos;t have any complaints. It&apos;s a little bit laggy on ultra 1080p on my GTX 560, but i hope they&apos;ll fix it later.</span>

However, once you get that out of the way, it&apos;s a much better version of it than the previous two.  For example, while combat is still the same setup (replace plasmid with vigor) and enemies still can feel a little bullet-spongy (I recommend turning off health meters in the options menu, as well as most other HUD notifications), most encounters take place in these big open areas that are also densely packed with cool tactical options.  The result is some thrilling and crazy combat moments that in most games would be heavily scripted.  No more &quot;electrocute-wrench&quot; through the whole game.  Graphically, you can sometimes see some flat textures up close reminding you that this is a game that has been worked on for 6 years, but on the whole it is quite gorgeous.  Nice to play an FPS that doesn&apos;t look like a brown and grey modern military shooter or a future space war that might as well  be a military shooter for how it looks.
<br>
<br>On that note, this game has the best storytelling since Half-Life 2.  No sitting through pre-rendered cutscenes full of people spewing exposition at you.  Just exploring the environment explains what&apos;s going on in the world and hints at some weird stuff behind the surface.  This game also deals with racism and religious fundamentalism in a far less heavy handed manner than you would expect.  Nice to play a game that doesn&apos;t treat you like a moron who can&apos;t follow a simple story.
<br>
<br>So in summary: Yes, if you go into this game expecting it to be the industry-changing miracle some people are making it out to be, you will be let down.  But if you go in expecting an FPS that is far more immersive, original and entertaining than 95% of what you&apos;ve played in the last few years, you&apos;ll get it.  Hell, it&apos;s basically a 10-hour escort mission with a character you still care about by the end and never get annoyed with.  That alone deserves some kudos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3059336">Expand</a></span>

With an unrivalled plot, the likes of which overwhelm all but the &apos;A-est&apos; of the A-list Hollywood movies, The most compelling efforts of the writers is to convey the underlying themes that don&apos;t become apparent until late on in the story and with a beautifully devious twist of an ending, it certainly leaves the player wanting to get on the wiki site ti learn more. Bioshock Infinite is certainly one to be remembered, and with the nourishing level of detail, forgetting the beauty (and ensuing chaos) of Columbia will prove difficult for any gamer. With the physics engines and graphics cards of 2013, Infinite leaves us thinking &quot;Damn, if only Rapture had looked this good.&quot;
<br>
<br>If anything could be said against the game, it would be Irrational&apos;s lack of effort towards creating a fully function AI society. Whilst the player is indeed submerged in a city with non-aggressive AI to bolster the feeling that you are in a real human settlement and not just a war zone, Irrational struggles to do this improvement over the game&apos;s predecessors any real justice with the lack of interaction between the AI and the player itself. One finds themself questioning the difference between taking stuff from a chest of drawers and taking stuff from a chest of drawers with the word &apos;steal&apos; at the bottom of the screen, demonstrating the scripted incidents carried out by the competely robotic artificial intelligence.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3162682">Expand</a></span>

Seriously, some of the stuff in these comments is ridiculous. The setting is &quot;unimaginative&quot;? What? How can you complain about a steampunk, floating city being &quot;unimaginative&quot; when there are games like Call of Duty and Battlefield getting farted out that use a brown, dust filled desert-industrial environment which seems to be a sort of basic formula for games nowadays. Anyway, the setting IS imaginative, and the story IS good, anybody who is saying the story &quot;made no sense&quot; probably just didn&apos;t understand it because they have the IQ of a coconut. The story made sense perfectly fine to me, and to 98% of the other people who played the game, as well. That said, if you don&apos;t like exploring, and just prefer to shoot people, don&apos;t buy this game and then complain that it was too well paced and you didn&apos;t spend 100% of your time killing other humans, because there is a big emphasis on exploration in this game, gear, money, and voxophones, which flesh out the story really nicely are all found by exploration. Also you get to see more of the city and experience the graphics design, because it is spectacular. Basically, it has everything good that the first Bioshock had, fast paced and exciting combat, amazing, albeit very different, atmosphere, an emphasis on exploration and a great story, without the redundant binary moral choice system. Also Elizabeth is a really nice addition to the game, one of the best support characters since Alyx.
<br>
<br>Basically, if you haven&apos;t played it, and are here to write a bad review because you watched TotalBiscuit&apos;s WTF is? video, then go away. If you DID play it, and didn&apos;t enjoy it, fair enough, but don&apos;t criticise something simply because of its genre. Yes, it didn&apos;t have any puzzles or stealth. Do you know why? Because it&apos;s an FPS, you moron.  Anyway, if you enjoyed the original, you&apos;ll love this, it&apos;s definitely a Bioshock game, I&apos;d say it was even better than the 1st.  The worst thing about it was the soundtrack, and that&apos;s just because I can&apos;t remember anything about it, and I finished the game yesterday. Great combat, great story, great atmosphere, great pacing, great graphics, it did everything well. I&apos;m giving it a 9 because of a few things I didn&apos;t like. The vigors are a bit unoriginal, except for the Bucking Bronco and Murder of Crows, and even that is basically just a repackaged Insect Swarm from B1. I preferred the gun upgrade system in B1, and the upgrades for that were much more original than the ones in this, which pretty much consist of &quot;damage increase&quot;, &quot;clip size increase&quot;, &quot;recoil decrease&quot;, and &quot;accuracy increase&quot;. It&apos;s a fantastic game, but there ARE a few things that stop it from being a 10. I would give it 9.5 if I could, but there is no 9.5,  so it gets a 9. I loved it, and will definitely buy the DLC planned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3129222">Expand</a></span>

If you do not play this game, then at least watch a friend play it. This is an amazing game beyond what I expected from any game in 2013. The only problem I see is that games now have to live up to this standard.</span>

You have to love a game that is built not to please everyone, or to appeal to the biggest demographic of the lowest common denominator. Bioware Infinite is about a development team trying to realise their creative vision. This is a very fun shooter, but by no means is it the kind of shooter that is going to inspire thousands of hours of shooting.</span>

<br>
<br>If you are familiar with Bioshock, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS.
<br>
<br>The middle is a bit padded but this game is easily one of the best games I have every played. It is up with my favorites and thats a hard bar to reach. GOTY already and its only March folks  Do yourself the favor and pick up this absolute gem of a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3063198">Expand</a></span>

And now I get to play one of the best games of this generation. When you first step into Columbia it feels like the first time at a theme park, the atmosphere is something no hardcore or casual gamer should miss out on. The combat has improved since the first game, using the Skyline is a great addition to the combat and of course getting around. Elizabeth is a character you want around you, and never gets in your way or does annoying things to hinder combat (take note Capcom). I haven&apos;t finished the game yet, but to me its a game you don&apos;t want to ever end, the experience is that good! I understand certain people won&apos;t like this game, every game in existence has players that won&apos;t like it, but come on, people who give 0&apos;s to a game like this is just trolling! @ciuchina82 How is multiplayer a joke? There is no multiplayer! and to allow your son of 4 years old to play this then I review your parenting a 0/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3060042">Expand</a></span>

However, I am going to review this game based on my 5 hours of gameplay... why? you may ask? Because the first 2 HOURS of gameplay were more enjoyable than the entire BioShock series. It sucks you in, immediately, and never let&apos;s go. If you bought this game on launch for $60 give yourself a pat on the back. You truly made a strong purchasing decision that just helped the gaming industry as a whole.

I also really enjoyed the story and thought the characters were interesting and having Elizabeth as a partner was very fun and worked really well.  Points deducted for repetitive combat and repetitive enemies. The powers are not very inspired and have a simplistic &quot;fire at enemy or lay a trap&quot;. The game stutters when loading new areas even with solid 60fps (gtx 570, settings on med/high) and thus breaks the immersion. You can only carry two guns which is disappointing and I pretty much went the entire game with raven power, shock power, sniper rifle and machine gun. I very rarely changed tactics and progressed easily with this setup. Was also dissapointed to find med kits had been removed and you cannot carry additional salts to power up your abilities when running low (have to rely on Elizabeth or the surrounding area). Was a good solid game, however the original Bioshock is still my favourite.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3071641">Expand</a></span>

As gaming and other software begins to explore the use of cloud technology and rapid solid state memory, more intense graphics will become the standard along with perfected sound.  This game, however, already has those.  As a preface, to truly appreciate this game I think you have to enjoy story telling.  This game is HEAVILY story driven with fantastic writing.  I spent at least an hour in the chapel after landing in Columbia.  Needless to say I have not finished the game  yet  but I am savoring it.  I am playing on hard as suggested by PC Gamer  because most story centric games have little replay value  but this game&apos;s story is deep and rich enough to deserve at least another replay.  I know I will replay it with the 1999 option after hard so that I can see how I might end without a winnable ending.  This is a game about the journey.  To rush through it is to completely miss the substance of the game.  This is not an ADD friendly game.  While the combat is exhilarating and amazingly fun (much like but improved over the original Bioshock) you do have to use tactics and planning to survive.  I also appreciate that on the non-1999 version you are not overly punished for screwing up and experimenting.  The voice acting, the graphics, the atmosphere, the sheer creative genius of this world inspired me to buy a season pass as I would love more of this game.  Ken Levine and the entire Irrational Games team should be given a well deserved standing ovation.  I hope that Irrational will take their time, but not as much time, developing their next game.  A return to a cyberpunk world would be wonderful, perhaps as a System Shock 3?  Take a well deserved break Mr. Levine  come back refreshed and let that genius flow again into yet another wonderful experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3059753">Expand</a></span>

The story inspires a variety of emotions, it is complex and controversial but avoids many mistakes that others before have done in this genre. The graphics and artwork create an amazing atmosphere to make you feel like a part of the world and the changes in the story are perfectly reflected in the environment. The gameplay is nothing special, but it is functional and very balanced. All powers and weapons have their strengths and weaknesses, making you actually have to plan what to use rather than zerg everything. All around this is one of the best games of all time and will probably remain at the top for a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3062371">Expand</a></span>

Moreover, if you want a game that&apos;s tailored to your every need and desire, why don&apos;t you go make your own game? exactly! You don&apos;t have to sit here and be a troll and ruin it for others who would have probably liked the game. They weren&apos;t making the game only for you, like your very own personalized version or something like that. You do not gain anything by trolling, if a person want to buy the game they will do it regardless of what you post here, because it is their choice that they can make, and no matter what some troll on the internet says is going to stop them ok. By have a nice day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3067580">Expand</a></span>

Pretty close to perfect, very reminiscent of Half-life 2 in how well realized the world and the characters are.  Game of the year so far.</span>

Just like the first game did. Infinite has exciting gameplay, with various ways to approach encounters. You have Elizabeth there to help. She gives you ammo, salt and health when you need it. She can also open rips in the world to give you the edge in combat. The graphics are amazing, mixed with excellent use of lighting and sound. the world is truly amazing. I love the way that it is specifically a different experience to the previous games. There you are stuck in Rapture, a claustrophobic, dark and broken city. Here we have a huge open beaming world, with light. It&apos;s still terribly evil though  All that aside this game is absolutely amazing and If a game is better than this in the next 2 years I will be very surprised. GOTY for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3059049">Expand</a></span>

Anyone who gives this game a negative review likely hails from the &quot;CoD era&quot; of shooters, unable to appreciate this game for what it is. No it does not have the polished combat of some games but it does not need it. This is not something to be rushed through in as short as you can, you must be willing to sit back and explore, listen to the diaries, learn the history and indulge into the story. Only then will you see how perfect this game is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3059326">Expand</a></span>

With more freedom than previous titles, I cant find anything wrong with this game.  Aside from all the obvious ones, graphics are awesome, gameplay is phenominal, the music and environments are 2nd to none.  The game is very immersive.

It is a return to form after Bioshock 2, and with the lack of multiplayer and a more intricate singleplayer experience that is quite evident.</span>

Having been sucked into Infinite&apos;s universe (having been mesmerized for up to 7 hours), I can say that I will finally finish 1 and start playing number 2 aswell, as soon as I have played infinite, once or twice, or thrice. This game is so good it beggars belief, just get it. The only thing I can point fingers at is the texture work, it could use a loving hand to be honest. Other than that, the atmosphere, the sound score, the gun play, the vigor play, the connection gameplay wise with Elizabeth, the story, the aesthetics and graphics (other than texture work) are all top of the line.

<br>Until now I thought Tomb Raider would run with the game of the year title, it is a contender, but I have a slight feeling that this will run with it. It is definitely the better game in my book, although it is most definitely worth it to own both! And you should, own both.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3061674">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is a spoiler free review. I won&apos;t touch the story-line  it&apos;s epic and I&apos;ll end it at that.
<br>I&apos;m loving Infinite so far. But as a long time BioShock fan I must say the graphics are mildly disappointing. Especially if you lurk around in every corner of the game. The flowers, the fruits, walls etc. just look like they were rushed up during development. That&apos;s the only part which is bad about the game.
<br>The guns, they are so well balanced. For every different heavy hitter you WILLL need a different technique. I found out that the hard way, haha! The Vigor combos and Vigor  Gun damage combos are epic. The Vigor themselves don&apos;t feel OP so you&apos;ll constantly have to use different ones at different times.
<br>I played the Industrial revolution, and well I personally feel that the rewards, specially the early 500$ you get from completing IR will give you an edge early on as you can quickly buy health kits, salt and ammo. But that&apos;s ok.
<br>Music is just mind blowing. Literally mind blowing.
<br>Elizabeth and here gossips are epic. Don&apos;t consider here a fancy-dandy superwomen without brains, she&apos;s bloody smart, and helps a lot.
<br>Still think they could have done the game graphically a bit much better.
<br>Anyhow that probably shouldn&apos;t keep me from giving BS: Infinite a 10/10.
<br>Also, any idiot voting 0s or 1s is probably trolling around without having actually played the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3059060">Expand</a></span>

Like my first runs through Half-Life 2, BioShock, and Fallout 3, I was at a loss for words from start to end with BioShock Infinite. Let me start this review with the only negative I can possibly attempt to give it- the middle is slightly blurry with a couple of quick transitions that only make sense after you have completed the game. However, the combat during that time completely makes up for it. I really want to keep this review short, so I&apos;ll get straight to the point. 1. Buy this game. 2. The atmosphere, combat, story, visuals, characters, and much more, combine together to make one of the most enjoyable fictional (beyond just video games) experiences I have ever encountered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3059935">Expand</a></span>

So I can understand people clinging to this like the second coming when a half way decent game pops up. I get it! Let us get one thing straight though. This game does not top the original Bioshock in any aspect for me personally. The mechanics are the same with some refinements but nothing mind blowing. The sky hook is a gimmick IMHO. Really had more emotion with the little girls in the original Bioshock. Columbia is trying to pull the &quot;oh we went there!&quot; with the racism card. This is Bioshock rehashed but without heart and full of hate hidden throughout the world. To those who missed the first Bioshock then I understand why you think this is a masterpiece. There is a reason why originals hold their place in our hearts compared to sequels. Nothing Irrational Games does will capture the heart of Rapture again! Infinite is a great shooter just not as great as the one from 2007. Be realistic and don&apos;t let the hype machine fool you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3059102">Expand</a></span>

Gone is the atmosphere of tension, solitude and slow, cloying fear, of being a rat in an alien maze, desperately fighting the machinations of a near-ubiquitously powerful, intelligent enemy who hates you more than anything else. Gone is the rapidly blurring dichotomy of you and the warped genetic monstrosities you fight against. Gone is the sprawling, labyrinthine level-design that made you feel a stranger in an even stranger land.
<br>
<br>Instead, brightly coloured setpieces tower above poor-quality environmental textures plagued by pop-in effects and graphical errors. All pretensions of atmosphere disappear in a neo-Americana hell, populated by  a number of identical racist caricatures whose threat towards you is as laughable as their suicidal and stupid combat AI. What tropes of old remain, like the strange powers you and an illogically small proportion of NPC&apos;s possess, the garish, loudly coloured vending machines, are not given even the merest pretensions of logical existence in a world that remains true to the &apos;Shock series in barely more than name alone.
<br>
<br>The satisfying gunplay of Bioshock is replaced with something that seems two steps back  guns feel like they lack weight and impact, melee combat has gone from having some of the most visceral and brutal force to an insufficient, chaotic slugfest. Each blow of the wrench in Bioshock 1 felt like the fist of an angry God compared to the mess that is Infinite&apos;s hand to hand combat. Weapon upgrades feel tacked on, (gone are the tactical uses for each weapon: You will rarely require to change between two.) lacking the incredibly unique feeling and game-changing add-ones of Bioshock that added striking visual components to your weaponry.
<br>
<br>Gunplay itself is almost parodic  your limited selection of weapons, when the gimmicky or inferior are pared away, leave you to fight against generic waves of identical enemies with your iron sights and  in what feels like a near slap in the face, _regenerating shields._
<br>
<br>Plasmids (or &apos;vigours&apos;) feel similarly superfluous, despite an obvious attempt to broad the range of options both between and within them. Their use feels as unsatisfying and generic as the gimmicks of many other mid-quality FPS offerings that the Shock pedigree should stand above. Environmental uses for vigours are easily missed and of limited use. Contrast the feel of the fire power in Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite. In the former, a click of the fingers instantly set an enemy ablaze. It was fast, punishing and conveyed the utter power of ADAM, at the expense of your own body. It was a standard fallback for many players for good reason, for it was ubiquitously useful, but not overpowering. In the darkness of Rapture, the flames you ignited with a snap of your fingers were immediate reminders of power.
<br>
<br>In Infinite, the clunky, slow moving projectile feels more like a grenade. Enemies who rush at you wildly in chaotic, rarely tactical combat make efficient use of the power difficult, and the flames themselves seem ineffectual, difficult to use when other powers are simpler and easier to use. Environmental uses like conveniently placed oil-slicks are rarely of any real value. The use of almost any vigour seems a waste of resources. Unsatisfying, unrewarding, unpolished.
<br>
<br>The story itself is a decidedly average mess, riddled with plot holes and uncompelling characters. Your constant companion is, while relatively likeable and useful, not something I expected from a franchise that made it&apos;s name on the back of well-crafted atmospheric tension.
<br>
<br>Gone too are some of the rewarding RPG elements, replaced by a bizarre &apos;gear&apos; system that seems more at home in a Borderlands game than Bioshock. Not a few hours into the game and you are furnished with a pair of trousers that allow you to punch people from three-times the distance away, (often launching you off the edge of the city to an untimely, undeserved death) or another item of clothing that inexplicably causes opponents you strike in melee to spontaneously burst into flames and burn to skeletons before your eyes. A hat it was, I think. What were they thinking?!
<br>
<br>This is of course rhetorical. It is obvious what they were thinking. A combination of changing appeal to a casual audience and rushed production values, Infinite is the death-knell of the &apos;Shock series. What&apos;s worse is that the this same audience of &apos;gamers&apos;, too captivated by their understanding of (actually visually average, but disguised by gross amounts of bloom and fog) setpieces that the developer literally drags your attention to as &apos;good graphics&apos;, (which is what a good game is all about, right?) who purchase an identical Call of Duty game EVERY year, are lapping titles like Infinite up.
<br>
<br>Rest In Peace. We hardly knew ye.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3213646">Expand</a></span>

Instead, it goes out with a whimper, like a failed film-student project.  Still, the beginning is a well grounded start to what could have been game of the year, with characters that start off believable and interesting.  Too bad it steers off course and never reaches full promise.

Frankly, most of the elements that were unique to BioShock have been utterly stripped from this title. There&apos;s still plasmids (Vigors) and a steampunk setting but that is where the similarities cease. The hacking elements are gone,  lockpicking is taken away from the player and given to an AI, the research camera is removed, and paying attention to health has been replaced with the all-too-generic &quot;regenerating health&quot; mechanic. BioShock&apos;s &quot;Big Daddies&quot; are replaced with &quot;Handymen&quot; who are seen far too infrequently, and &quot;Motorized Patriots&quot; which are overused. The vast majority of the enemy AI are merely footsolders who are easy to defeat (and completely stupid) even on the hardest setting. The shooting mechanics have never been particularly strong in the BioShock franchise but BioShock Infinite strips it down further, allowing players to carry only two weapons at any given time like any other stock FPS title. In addition, the vigor powers themselves are lackluster and chances are you&apos;ll go through the entire game running with Possession (the hacking &quot;replacement&quot;) and Bucking Bronco or Murder of Crows (the two Vigors which have the most effect on enemy mobs  loss of control and stun+damage, respectively). We get Vigor powers like &quot;Shock Jockey&quot; (the name should tell you what it does) and the game points out how we can use it to power up devices  but then we only get one particular device to use it on and little reason to use it again. So this leaves us with the story which seems to be getting the most praise. However, the story itself is a series of walking cliches and tropes about multiverse theory and time-space manipulation and, frankly, has been addressed better elsewhere in countless science fiction novels, movies, TV shows, and even comic books. When the game explains the concepts of &quot;constants and variables&quot; in the multiverse it feels more like they&apos;re attempting to justify why the game took such a hard 90 degree turn away from previous gameplay demos in order to proffer this metaphysical theme. Where, for example, is the Elizabeth AI we were shown where she fought along side of us? Gone and replaced with a cowering AI that gets in the way and offers little help but tossing us items from time to time. Where, for example, were the critical moments in the game shown during gameplay demos of E3&apos;s past? Gone and replaced with overly cerebral tropes about quantum mechanics and multiple realities. Where, for example, are all the examples of how the sky-rail plays a critical role in the game? Just gone, entirely. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the story is heads and shoulders better than MOST games these days and the attention to detail is second to none. For those reasons alone the game should be experienced at least once. It&apos;s just the story isn&apos;t nearly as new OR earth shattering as many claim it to be and, if I didn&apos;t care about spoilers, I could point out how Infinite almost perfectly parallels the story of Walter and Peter Bishop from the TV show Fringe. While the story is better than most it really doesn&apos;t make the shortcomings of the gameplay easier to bear. Finally, for a game which was designed exclusively for single player, the game is very short, clocking in at a total of 14 hours on the hard difficulty setting with most of the collectibles obtained. Given the fact that many elements were chopped out of the gameplay videos, I can&apos;t help but wonder how much is sitting on the cutting room floor, or if key parts were stripped in order to push out fast DLC. There&apos;s no reason this game shouldn&apos;t have been AT LEAST 20 hours in length, especially given how linear it is designed. All in all, it&apos;s a decent game but painfully average in terms of gameplay and only barely above average in terms of story. Levine spent so much time on the metaphysical that it feels like he and the development team forgot that it was all of the elements, combined, that made BioShock so distinct and enjoyable. It&apos;s worth playing at least once to soak in all the wonder but, sadly, you won&apos;t really be going back to play it again since nothing (except difficulty) changes between play throughs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3068217">Expand</a></span>

In terms of gameplay itself the only unique thing about it was the skyline which was fun to use. The rest of the game itself just didn&apos;t feel that great. Looking out in the distance and looking at the view and the world that they created was awesome. One thing to expect is repetitive gameplay. You will find all the missions to be the same. You will be running from map to map running and gunning. There were no unique quests. Even after finishing I felt as if it was extremely liner and have no desire to return to this game. The only thing this game has for it was its super awesome voice acting and its stunning visuals. The skyline added a very unique system but it was a bit disappointing. All in all I gotta rate this game a 6.5/10. Due to the weird plot twists, uninteresting enemies, repetitive gameplay. If this game would improve its maps. Making everything more like its original. This game would easily make my top of the list. It all came down to its average gameplay and linear story. The game was incredibly easy. I toned it up to hard and still found my self sprinting through the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3061990">Expand</a></span>

The combat is weak, the story is complete nonsense, the characters have no personality, the graphics are poor up close, the choices don&apos;t impact anything or anyone, it is the most linear game i have played in a long while and it feels more like a shooting gallery at times and the magic or whatever its called is not needed. It just tries to copy Call of Duty to much with its gameplay and fails miserably. The ending is the worst thing about the game because it retcons System Shock 1&amp;2 and BioShock 1&amp;2 and is just stupid. The world however looks nice and it is very detailed, only if you look at it from far away. I&apos;m getting the idea that a lot of these &quot;Reviewers&quot; have finished the game. Plus the game is more of a &quot;You should feel bad if you are a white person&quot; kind of game.
<br>
<br>Tl;dr Just buy any CoD4  or Half life 2 its basically the same but with more re-playability, strategy, creativity and mod-ability, better writing, better characters, memorable guns and Multilayer.

<br>
<br>Why is this game scored so high by so many people? i don&apos;t get it. The game is a simple run and gun with ugly graphic, poor animations, and weak linear level design. Horrible style mash-up, poor UI, and clunky controls. Aliens: Colonial Marines got ripped apart last month (By myself included) for being a very average game with a big set of boots to fill. However i wouldnt say this game is technically any better. It feels like a very average last gen game to me. I prefer gameplay to graphics but i found this game lacking in both. I am genuinely confused by the gushing reviews of &quot;perfection&quot; this and &quot;masterpiece&quot; that.
<br>
<br>It was a constant race toward the reason to switch it off. Between the boredom and the motion sickness caused by the poor mouse sensitivity settings, i got no enjoyment from this title at all. The motion sickness piped it in the end and i gladly quit after only a few hours ....probably forever.
<br>
<br>For goodness sake play a demo! I guess this game is love it or hate it. P.S. If someone wants to pay me a large amount in used notes, i will say its great aswell!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3069788">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. The weapon ironsights forces you into toggle mode. You cannot switch it to &quot;on hold&quot; mode, which is incredibly aggravating. The same is true for sprint and crouch. Where is the customization? It&apos;s a crime this feature was left out of the PC port.
<br>
<br>2. Forced to edit .ini files. The mouse aiming is atrocious on default. It wasn&apos;t until I read that mouse smoothing and auto-aim was enabled by default that I was able to fix this problem. Again, there are no settings in game to toggle these. You have to dig around in .ini file to turn them off manually. 3. You can only carry 2 guns. The hell? Who thought this was a good idea? In both prior incarnations of the game you had the freedom to choose any gun available for the situation. Now you are pigeon holed. Decreasing the amount of choice in a game is simply bad design.
<br>
<br>4. Bloom and DOF covers up incredibly low poly-count models, extreme polygon warping in many animations due to poor skeletal/mesh weighting (contorted necks and arms are the most obvious areas), and low quality textures even on the highest setting. Don&apos;t look too close at anything our you&apos;ll be sorely disappointed.
<br>
<br>5. Main character talks to himself... a lot. I wouldn&apos;t mind too much if he actually had something interesting to say, but the self-monologuing of stupid quips gets old fast.
<br>
<br>6. No player choice. The game is completely linear and &quot;on-rails.&quot; This is not the direction AAA games should be going. As a gamer I want more freedom, not more restriction. What&apos;s even more insulting is the developer try&apos;s to trick the gamer into thinking he has choice by giving him binary: pick A (evil act) or pick B (good act). However, no matter what you pick (I&apos;ve tested each so far) results in the exact same resulting cut-scene and outcome. What is good about the game:
<br>
<br>1. The detail of Elizabeth (you&apos;re sidekick) is incredible. The artists did an absolutely fantastic job on bringing this character life. The animations are gorgeous, the voice acting is superb, and the interaction in combat feels good. If there&apos;s one reason to play this game, its to experience this character truly come to life throughout the story. Bravo.
<br>
<br>2. The level artists also did a fantastic job. The vistas in the game are simply breath-taking, just don&apos;t look too closely at anything and the visage holds up.
<br>
<br>3. Fascinating story. Not the best, but worth a look. I personally feel the developers tried too hard to be controversial here, by blatantly throwing racism and gender inequality in your face at every chance they can get. However, there are some nice subtitles that are spread throughout the game which was a pleasant surprise.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>
<br>Worth playing. It&apos;s definitely not game of the year (Tomb Raider has locked up tight imo), but if you don&apos;t mind paying for an interactive movie, and overlooking the inherent console restrictions, this is worth picking up. Even though flying through the city on rails at high speeds is quite fun the first few times, there&apos;s really not much else in terms on innovation to the FPS genre.

The original Bioshock is my favorite game of all time, this game had  me longing to go back and play it.  It&apos;s been said over and over, yes, the game has a beautiful landscape, other than that, it&apos;s a flop.
<br>
<br>First, there is no lock-picking, puzzles, and very limited upgrading.  I remember playing the original Bioshock and you could hack turrets, camera, etc.  You have one vigor  (lame excuse for plasmids) that can take control of turrets.  It will fire on your enemies for 10 or so seconds then turn back on you.  There is no way to fully take control of them and you find yourself just blowing the thing up as soon as possible.  This brings me to my next point.  I only used shock jockey once acquired, there are seven or so other vigors but use up too much salt and are pointless.  They have a new clothing system but only two or three items are useful.
<br>
<br>The weapons could have been interesting but they give them all to you right out of the gates.  You can upgrade them easily and they are readily available.  Usually you get better weapons as the game progresses, they just seem to throw them at you whenever.  You can only hold two at a time.  I never found myself really getting to like a certain weapon and upgrading it.  You just pick stuff up, fire it till empty, and some other gun will be lying next to you.
<br>
<br>There is only one real boss fight, (lady Comstock) all of the other characters are killed via cut scene.  This really make for anti-climatic missions.  The last mission is very mundane and ends up feeling like the previous quest.  I beat this game in probably six hours on hard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3096245">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s terrible, any hope you have of being immersed is constantly stolen from you. As you are constantly reminded not only is this a game- it&apos;s JUST a game. As a movie this would be fantastic, as an adventure game even better. But as a FPS with the Bioshock name on it?

I adored the plot, I adored Elizabeth, and I adored the sky city of Columbia. So why do I have no choice but to give this a highly negative review...?
<br>
<br>The game  is an interactive movie more than it is, well, a game. Every single-player campaign and story released today cannot truly qualify as a game. Everybody who picked up this game would have been grossly unimpressed by the shoddy and thin &quot;core&quot; gameplay elements here, had this game been released in the era of real games (80&apos;s to the 00&apos;s). Given the outstanding reviews, I expected either a retro game experience or a revolutionary one, and got something that would probably be best described as a diluted version of Call of Duty&apos;s gameplay. Now, don&apos;t bite my head off for that one. It&apos;s clear that all FPS games today borrow from the core formula used in &quot;modern warfare&quot;-type shooters, like the ability to carry only 2 guns, the recoil physics, the *very* specific ammo types, the realistic iron-sights, cover-and-heal mechanics, &apos;hit&apos; indication on your reticule, checkpoint saves, etc. etc. Newer gamers take these for granted  they are really just annoying little copy-cat additions all the latest FPS games have. The point is, the actual gameplay borrows from a modern shooter and yet feels as clunky and unsatisfying as a previous-generation shooter, failing entirely to be either one.
<br>
<br>The guns are *extremely* unimaginative and generic (shotgun, burst-gun, sniper rifle, non-sniper rifle...), and some of them are completely useless. This is a highly redundant and annoying system. For example, since you lack alternate firing modes, you literally have to switch to a burst-gun and use exclusive burst-gun ammo instead of using an SMG and switching it to burst fire, saving you one ammo type to collect.
<br>
<br>There are plasmids in this game, now relabeled as &quot;vigors&quot; for some reason. You get several types, each with a very amusing short tutorial video, silent-film style. Unfortunately, though useful and somewhat creative, they are often ineffective and expensive to use.
<br>
<br>Item collection is erratic as hell. You will find &apos;vigor ammo&apos; (&quot;salts&quot;) all over non-combat scenes but extremely sparsely placed over areas of prolonged combat. For this reason, you usually find yourself maxing out your relatively small &quot;salts gauge&quot; and unable to collect additional salts for half the game, while being unable to use any vigors for the other half of the game because you have no salts left! The same thing applies to ammo, which is made even worse because you can hold very little ammo of any type, and there are far too many types in the game due to the inflated number of generic guns available.
<br>
<br>Thankfully, however, a very pleasant-looking NPC supplies you with a bit of health, salts and ammo during battle to compensate for the awful item placement. She will give it to you in the nick of time, but if you run out again, you&apos;re screwed  you have to wait a very long time to get anything else from her. It works to balance out the poor level design, but it is just a patch on an ugly gameplay wort.
<br>
<br>For a game with such an enormous graphics budget, some of the characters look very cartoonish while others look human. There are also *very* few face models in this game. Columbia is populated almost entirely with Generic Male NPC #1 and Generic Female NPC #1. I understand the need for face model recycling, but when you have three clones of the same woman in front of you with different voices, it gets ridiculous. There are also many invisible walls, which become apparent when you try to shoot around obstacles or jump on crates. And for the love of The Prophet, don&apos;t look at background details too closely! The bag of apples is literally a JPEG of a pile of apples stretched over a bag  and what&apos;s worse, the designers put full-3D apples on top of them for the player to collect. The graphics are *very* far from being fleshed-out in any way here.
<br>
<br>The best weapon is a melee hand-held slicing thingy, kind of like the painkiller (if you can even remember that game...) You use it to bash enemies&apos; heads in, and you can perform overly gruesome finishing moves with it. There is *no* reason to use these moves, unless you like seeing heads explode, and the little indicator that tells you when to activate them is not easy to find in a pinch. Also, every time you melee, the camera gets fixed in the attacking direction, meaning if you melee multiple times, your character is thrown between enemies and you&apos;re essentially just button mashing at that point, because you can&apos;t see what&apos;s going on. The number of enemy types is also slim and uninteresting.
<br>
<br>In short, play this game for the story. It&apos;s a pretty good one, but if you were expecting a fun game, look elsewhere!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3093606">Expand</a></span>

<br>Elizabeth is one of the most annoying &apos;buddies&apos; in a game ever, walking in front when trying to shoot enemies, talking inane crap whilst walking around you like a fly in your peripherals, not to mention her clattering shoes,(Jesus).
<br>There&apos;s way too much money and ammo lying about, and that&apos;s on the hard setting, this just ruins any sense of tension there could of been. Pathetic A.I., you could have replaced them with potatoes and it would of been just as challenging.
<br>Ken Levine lookalike N.P.C&apos;s? Maybe this is just me, but one of the male head models looks the spitting image of Ken Levine. I&apos;m cool with a little &apos;in house&apos; fun, but when there&apos;s only about four head models in the whole game it gets a bit tedious.
<br>Bad collision detection. The invisible walls around lots of objects is laughable.
<br>A talking protagonist. This doesn&apos;t work for me, but this is a personal thing I guess. As the games progressing, I don&apos;t want to be told what my characters thinking or feeling as it just destroys any sense of immersion. The Graphics are no better than a 2007 game, with bells and whistles on. Not that graphics make a game, but the masses that seem to be praising this pale imitation tend to think it&apos;s visually stunning.  On the whole, it&apos;s just a terrible reproduction of the first BioShock but set in the sky for novelty. It&apos;s difficulty is so easy a child could finish it, (perhaps this explains the high scores,) and the story just feels like something a first year student would write an essay about after their first spliff. (Heavy man).
<br>Oh I forgot to mention the Willy Wonka lift at the beginning! HaHa, that was so funny, oh it wasn&apos;t meant to be..?
<br>3 stars for the sky-lines.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3072856">Expand</a></span>

Lets see first thing is graphics, well this is such a clever ruse, all that bloom, fog and light shafts are well placed to cover poor models and textures in general(and I am not a person who praise graphics but this simply couldn&apos;t be overlooked). Next thing is horrible collision zones, at first it was not a big deal but it became more and more annoying. Also difficulty is pretty low i cannot even imagine how easier the game could get on lower difficulties. Story and characters are mix up of several clich&#xE9;s with several ups and downs and for once finally useful sidekick on the contrary enemy AI is quite poor and you will see big number of enemies stucked in some obstacle. There is also that unpleasant fact that this game embrace only checkpoint saves. So not being a fanboy nor hater i have to say Bioshock Infinite is pretty average game with tremendous hype, I&apos;m glad i got my copy free because otherwise i would be really really angry at myself for wasting money. P.S. for all the people that say Bioshock is best rated FPS in history just check Half Life 2 and see for yourself</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3060049">Expand</a></span>

That being said, the rest of the game is pretty bad compared to Bioshock 1 and is absolutely wiped out by SS2. There are three different variations on a machine gun and three different variants on a grenade launcher alone. I actually feel like I&apos;m playing Halo in the sky with this one  move from one wide-open area with obvious cover and spawning generic enemies to kill, then move to the next and repeat. Oh, and don&apos;t forget Elizabeth, who you either have to comfort every ten minutes or who throws you health and ammo like nobody&apos;s business because god forbid there&apos;s a little bit of challenge. Not to mention the needlessly complicated time travel 2deep4u plot with, guess what, a twist halfway through the game! Oh man, it&apos;s almost like we didn&apos;t see this coming because Ken Levine hasn&apos;t put this in two famous games already! Why Halo 4 has a 6.9 user score but this has a 9.0 is beyond me when they both suffer from the same problems. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the completely subtle message of Booker immediately becoming a racist dick upon being baptized. Nice job with the subtlety, Ken.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3062468">Expand</a></span>

Loved the trailers and hoped for a great experience, but it still feels awkward, somehow untouchable. For me, it&apos;s like walking and fighting through a picture which has a cartoon-ques look with brutal content and no soul, no vibe, no grounding, just a lot of details. I will not complain about the rosebushes made of &quot;concrete&quot;, the birds who are able to fly under water and through statues  or the washy pixels when you get closer to walls or any other objects. The graphics are not sensational, but OK. The disturbing part is, that they are supporting the strange atmosphere of this game by blocking you to immerse into it. I hope for the better in the hours to come, but I have little hope that I will warm up. What a shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3068451">Expand</a></span>

It was hyped so much that in the end it just shatters before succeeding in what it is trying to do.   Bioshock 1 was a lot better than this. I really don&apos;t understand why are people so overwhelmed by this game. Lets see first thing is graphics, well this is such a clever ruse, all that bloom, fog and light shafts are well placed to cover poor models and textures in general. Next thing is horrible collision zones, at first it was not a big deal but it became more and more annoying. Also difficulty is pretty low i cannot even imagine how easier the game could get on lower difficulties.
<br>
<br>I bought this game mainly for the story and characters, but it is not that good, and are mix up of several clich&#xE9;s with several ups and downs and for once finally useful sidekick on the contrary enemy AI is quite poor and you will see big number of enemies stucked in some obstacle. There is also that unpleasant fact that this game embrace only checkpoint saves.
<br>
<br>This game is quite average, and people need to start thinking for themselves and not pay attention to &quot;Professional&quot; reviewers, who are always biased, and have a hidden agenda with their reviews.  Look at IGN for example they had the &quot;exclusive&quot; review, so they obviously wont rate it with less than a stellar review.
<br>
<br>Professional reviews suck, and that is just the plain truth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3067513">Expand</a></span>

Under the brightly coloured mask that Infinite wears, hides the same unsettling tone. Bioshock: Infinite is set in a whole new world to explore. In contrast to the dark, dank underwater city that is Rapture, Infinite is set in Zachary Comstock&#x2019;s city in the sky &#x2013; Columbia. Bioshock: Infinite comes into its own with a new, engaging and unique storyline to get stuck into. But it isn&#x2019;t entirely separate from previous Bioshock games; there are many links and references &#x2013; including a lovely little visit to Rapture &#x2013; to feed the nostalgia. Also, except some minor name swaps, many of the basic combat mechanics carried over, along with some exciting twists.
<br>You play as Booker Dewitt, a man overcome by guilt, trying to pay off past sins by completing a single task; recovering the &#x2018;lamb&#x2019; of Columbia. Now, this may seem like quite the fetch mission, however, Elizabeth Comstock turns out to be one of the most interesting characters in the game (as well as a very useful companion). The storyline consistently carries an air of mystery that keeps you pushing forward for the next detail. There are also other intriguing characters with their own side-stories running alongside Booker and Elizabeth&#x2019;s that build further on the immersion. Some important mentions include: the Lutece twins- two multiverse-travelling quantum physicists, Jeremiah Fink - a powerful business man with quite the role in Columbia and Daisy Fitzroy &#x2013; the leader of the Vox, a resistance against the corrupt dictator, Comstock. The DLC gives even further detail into the circumstances that led to each of the different fates that could become Columbia and the world as a whole adding another layer of intrigue. The game wraps off nicely with a unique ending that will leave a mark and raises many questions and may even bring about a feels-train.
<br>As previously mentioned, many of the same basic mechanics are kept such as the use of EVE (now called salts) to power plasmids (now called vigors). Infinite is set up to be parallel to Bioshock 2, later explaining the similar characteristics yet different names. However, there are many new features that are unique to Infinite. The major change is the use of Elizabeth&#x2019;s ability to open tears, bringing in new ways to fight such as bringing in turrets or useful environmental objects such as puddles. Tears are used on a sort of cooldown, closing after a set amount of time and therefore need to be used tactfully but can be incredibly useful when turning the tide of a battle. There are also new ways to get around the map via the addition of sky-hooks that allow a new form of mobility &#x2013; sky-lines &#x2013; but also doubles up as a neat melee weapon. Enemies also utilise this, often creating chaotic yet incredibly fun battles. Infinite also introduces a new range of enemies such as the Handyman, Songbird (my personal favourite) and motorised patriots each with their own set of strengths and weaknesses, and levels of difficulty.
<br>The graphics of the original game may not compare to that of more recently released games, there has been a re-master for newer platforms which further adds to the games quality. It is also important to note that the graphics are highly stylized and therefore not meant to be overly realistic Overall, the story in Infinite, while it can be confusing at times, is one of its best features, as well as the interesting game-play mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=7580513">Expand</a></span>

I was not a fan of the first Bioshock. The twist in that was asinine and completely out of left field, it was something that a washed up Shyamalan would come up with. Infinite was good. The story, although in my opinion far from brilliant, was still very good for a video game seeing how rarely video games have good plots and actually had something of a smart twist in it, unlike the first one. I&apos;ve seen people complaining about &apos;low texture quality&apos;. Please, oh please tell me you are joking. The game looks fantastic. If they can make the game look great without destroying people&apos;s frame rates, why in any logical world would they not?
<br>
<br>In my opinion, ten hours is too short for any game, as that&apos;s all it took me to beat it. Nonetheless, in comparison to a lot of &quot;next gen&quot; (how I hate that word due to the awfulness of a lot of the games it&apos;s attached to) games, it&apos;s damn near a masterpiece, and definitely worth trying out if it&apos;s on sale or whatever. I also had no issues with the game play, all in all I&apos;d estimate I&apos;ve played at least two thousand hours of first person shooter games and this is far from being terrible. It&apos;s not the most creative of shooters (I suppose the first Bioshock had that element going for it when it came out), but it gets the job done, the aesthetic of it all is brilliant and it has two genuinely likable protagonists. Don&apos;t overlook this one after seeing what some people have been saying about it as while they&apos;re quite justified in wanting more, by our modern game standards this is pretty good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3908634">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve only now finished this game, despite having it for a while, and I thought I&apos;d give my impressions of it. First of all, it is undeniably overrated. Playing the last Bioshock games and moving to this one; they haven&apos;t really done anything revolutionary. Sure, it&apos;s an enjoyable game, and it mixes up the FPS genre, but it really isn&apos;t worth the perfect scores that are granted to it.
<br>
<br>To start, seeing as it&apos;s a PC game, let&apos;s look at the graphics. Stunning, right? Well yeah, they&apos;re pretty good, but considering the game is linear, it isn&apos;t really cutting edge. Not to say it&apos;s ugly, but it&apos;s using the sort of water-colour pallet which can be found in other games like Dishonoured. It&apos;s nice to look at, but it isn&apos;t really the breath taking sights which appear in games such as Metro: Last Light or Crysis 3.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay, it&apos;s fun, and I can lose time in it, but it can feel a little bit shallow at times. Before you rage against me, examine the &apos;vigors&apos; of the game. The same as plasmids in the former Bioshocks, they give you superhuman powers with which you can wreck everything. But among them, there are just a few too many similarities for my liking. Bucking Bronco, Undertow and Shock Jockey all have effects which aren&apos;t particularly unique. The first upgrade essentially stuns an enemy. The second upgrades mix things up a bit but then other similarities can be found; for example the mine effects of Shock Jockey and Devil&apos;s Kiss. Some are more interesting, like Charge or Possession, but in the end they don&apos;t act too differently to, say, shooting an enemy in another game in a weak spot and watching them recoil. Add some gunplay of which the most interesting part are the gun noises, and it failed to give any memorable weapons, or moment&apos;s that I&apos;ll remember using them.
<br>
<br>As for the story...it&apos;s interesting? Elizabeth is a nice character, but I feel as if she&apos;s kinda there to cater to the audiences&apos; idea of a perfect girl, or something thereabouts. Booker is one of those protagonists with a grizzled attitude, tough guy exterior blah blah blah. He had some interesting moments, but most of those seemed to be swept up in his  choices. Some of the more interesting plot developments later on in the game just made me feel disconnected; I won&apos;t spoil them, but it feels as if your actions have less effect on your own environment, and that just makes me question Booker&apos;s actions all the more.
<br>
<br>All in all, it&apos;s not a bad game by any means. Moments like moving around on the sky rail were always fun, but I just feel that it hasn&apos;t really turned out to be as good as everyone said. Gameplay is solid, graphics are nice and the story will probably leave some people in love with the characters, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth full price, especially if you&apos;re buying for a console for whatever reason. Wait for a steam sale, pick it up and play through it and then you&apos;ll be able to get all the necessary references. If you&apos;re not interested in that sort of thing, then you might want to give it a miss.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3904213">Expand</a></span>

<br>The place where Infinite falls short, however, is in the gameplay category. The game pits you up against wave after wave of the same enemies over and over again. It tries to mix it up a bit by adding in some special enemies like the Fireman or the Handyman but all they do is create an annoyance as they&apos;re not very fun to battle and take a ridiculous amount of hits to kill.
<br>
<br>With all the work that went into the atmosphere of this game, I wish they had taken a bit more time to make it worth playing for more than a half hour at a time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3831630">Expand</a></span>

Despite its obvious irrelevance to the series, the games story is rather interesting, although at times the voice acting can go from very good to very bad in just a few short moments what really makes this game shine is that it places you into a world that feels very alive. Although this is not a strength in a game like Bioshock, where you play an aggressor the entire time. Having no abilities to interact with the citizens of Columbia is a major downfall, from the star of this game you most certainly do not feel like a hero. Game feel and story aside the combat can be bland and sometimes frustrating, though the sky hook is interesting it also can place you into enemy fire with ease as you will find someone flanking you without even being aware of where they came from. This aside the combat feels rewarding even after taking down the same copy pasted enemies dozens of time each encounter still felt rewarding. With beautiful graphics and wonderful visuals and for those of you dense enough to not guess the ending, a great story though despite being filled to the overflowing brim with plot holes is captivating and interesting. However the only reason I cannot give this game a better score is that it has simply no business being a &quot;Bioshock&quot; game. With only a slight amount of references to the Bioshock series that not only feel forced but feel completely out of place, being a game that takes place before the creation of Andrew Ryan&apos;s Rapture there is very little in this game that justifies itself as being called Bioshock. The only reason &quot;Bioshock Infinite&quot; was named as such was to make money off of a franchise that was guaranteed to make sales. Even if you are a giant Bioshock fan this games ending will keep you happy as this &quot;filler episode&quot; of a game has no relevance in the long run of the series. However if you have never played a Bioshock game, great news this isn&apos;t really a Bioshock game anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3902497">Expand</a></span>

<br>PROS: + Some interesting story elements + Power combos feel rewarding + Not enough money to buy all upgrades mean prioritizing
<br>CONS: - Frequent framerate issues on high end PC - Occasional gamebreaking tiling issues (why is this still not fixed?) - Not all story elements resolved to satisfaction
<br>
<br>REVIEW: I&apos;ll be straight up in saying that shooters aren&apos;t my favorite genre, but all the hype about how good the story was intrigued me and I bought this game for what I heard was an engaging storyline with memorable protagonists. It turns out that this is partially true, in that one character (Elizabeth) is memorable, as is the gimmick of a floating city and dimension-hopping. However, the rest of the story is blah, and all ends aren&apos;t satisfactorily resolved by the ending cinimatics. Is this a relatively good story for a shooter? Absolutely. Would the story stand on it&apos;s own as a book or even a movie? Never.
<br>
<br>But back to what I liked about the game: the power system works pretty well, in fact it is probably the best  thing about this game (a megaman-like dependence on exploiting enemy weaknesses becomes important in late game or high difficulties), and the combos feel powerful, as do purchase-able upgrades. Which speaks to another positive: you cannot afford to buy all the upgrades. This means finding out what your play style is and sticking to it, which is a glimmer of integrity from the increasingly erratic 2K Games.
<br>
<br>What sucks? Well, for starters there are FREQUENT framerate issues on a high-end PC, as well as game-breaking occasions where enemies, floors, walls, etc. are unsee-able because their skins don&apos;t show up. Is the air shooting you? It will go away with a restart, but if the autosave was in an inconvenient spot, you still have to play it over, aside from the obvious downside of completely breaking your momentum. I also have gripes about the story. The first 80% of the game explains nothing-which is fine, if you are playing a mystery game. Why doesn&apos;t this work here? Because the objectives you spent all that time pursuing no longer exist when you hop a reality. You end up with a Lord-of-the-Rings style question at the end: why didn&apos;t we just fly to Mt Doom (or the final Bioshock bad-guy fight, as the case may be) and skip the big nothing in the middle? Furthermore, only one characters motives are explained (Booker&apos;s, don&apos;t expect ever to find out what is going on with the twins) and many loose ends remain.
<br>
<br>SUMMARY: Was this game good? Well, the last 20% had satisfying gameplay and there were moments of greatness... I&apos;d say it is worth playing if you can get it on sale for $15 or less. Don&apos;t expect story greatness, or even bug-free gaming, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4210311">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay is moderately fun: if you consider this an FPS, there are better games in that genre available. The much critically acclaimed story wasn&apos;t exactly as good as I expected either.
<br>
<br>But the total package of the style, gameplay and story make it well worth playing. Just don&apos;t go in expecting an RPG the likes of Fallout or a fun shooter like, let&apos;s say Borderlands.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4778375">Expand</a></span>

The money that you need  is mostly found by searching barrels and boxes and trash cans (who&apos;s throwing away all this money?!?) and bodies.

In fact, it feels more like an RPG than an FPS; the developer is really keen on you exploring the world and eavesdropping on conversations. Bioshock 2 left me cold; I had been hoping that Bioshock infinite would recapture the magic of the first game, but it just doesn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3297370">Expand</a></span>
