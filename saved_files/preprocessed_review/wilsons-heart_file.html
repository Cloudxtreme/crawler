It&apos;s a lengthy 8-hour adventure with great production values, excellent graphics, and a ton of atmosphere. The scenario is incredibly creative, steeped in vintage 1940s horror vibes, and each sequence manages to introduce clever new ideas. During a time when made-for-VR games are still mostly short and shallow, this is undeniably a AAA game with the substance and value you&apos;d expect from a console game.
<br>
<br>At its core, this is an adventure game, driven more by puzzles and story than by action or gameplay mechanics, and that&apos;s a good thing, since the mechanics themselves are probably the weakest part. While interacting in VR is normally very intuitive, Wilson&apos;s Heart often has clumsy scenarios where you&apos;re not quite sure how to make the game do what you want to do. The movement mechanic is a very limiting node-teleport, and you can&apos;t even take more than a step in any direction before the game freezes and makes you move back. When everything works like you&apos;d expect it, it&apos;s a joy to grab and throw and punch, but there are too many moments where you&apos;ll be clumsily trying to figure out where to put your hands.
<br>
<br>Despite these flaws, I&apos;d have no hesitation recommending Wilson&apos;s Heart. It&apos;s a gorgeous, clever, one-of-a-kind game that could only exist in VR. It offers the right amount of scary to make you jump and sweat, but not give you PTSD, and it&apos;s one of the biggest, most ambitious VR originals to date.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wilsons-heart/user-reviews?user_review_id=7366957">Expand</a></span>
