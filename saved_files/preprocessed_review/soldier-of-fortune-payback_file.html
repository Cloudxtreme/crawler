Multiplayer? Meh.. Buy CoD4 if you want good run and gun playing.</span>

However, aside from these flaws is a very okay game. It looks really nice (problem here is you can&apos;t change the quality, for lower end PC owners, like me,) and the gore system is returned, adding that nice touch of realism. To wrap everything up: I say, check out this game, but don&apos;t bother wasting money buying it, play it at a friend&apos;s house or pirate it. Save your money for the much better Soldier of Fortune 1 or 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soldier-of-fortune-payback/user-reviews?user_review_id=1983260">Expand</a></span>

And considering that&apos;s what people are picking up the game for, they&apos;ve lost their best selling point from the word go. Where Soldier of Fortune 2, had dynamic entry/exit wounds and smash away skull sections, in SoF:Payback were treated to a few very average decapitations, and lame blood splatter decals everywhere else. In fact, I would go as far to say that the gore system in Bioshock was better, and that speaks for itself. As for the storyline, short and tacky, absolutely no cover anywhere in the levels, it&apos;s pretty much you getting shot at constantly, trying to work out where the enemies are behind the lame 2d esque scenery. How Activision could have even released this, thinking it was a complete game is beyond me, if you want the full on gory experience just pick up a copy of SoF2. Activision Value have completely butchered this series. I can&apos;t belive I picked up this game over Call Of Duty 4, worst &#xA3;30 i&apos;ve spent in my life. I&apos;ve given it a 1, because the weapon models and reload animations look pretty cool, but it&apos;s definitely not enough to sell the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soldier-of-fortune-payback/user-reviews?user_review_id=406911">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a lack of detail work, but the graphics engine isn&apos;t too shabby; it even performs well. It&apos;s violent, and the gore is more than a little excessive as it only takes a few shots to an arm to totally tear the thing off. Then there&apos;s the bad: The AI is completely stupid. They either simply charge mindlessly at you or they camp and wait to ambush. With the former, they&apos;re pretty much gonna die as they don&apos;t even shoot at you; and with the latter, they&apos;ll either have a limb poking out to give them away or they&apos;ll instantly kill you if you fail to spot them. As for the so-called story line, it&apos;s complete and utter garbage. The characters are introduced in a shoddy fashion, the voice acting is atrocious, and the dialog itself is just as bad. Gameplay is also lacking, and all the maps are extremely linear with a waypoint on your HUD always telling you where to go. Long story short, I only picked it up because I found it on a clearance rack for an extremely low price. I sure wouldn&apos;t pay full for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soldier-of-fortune-payback/user-reviews?user_review_id=410349">Expand</a></span>

Whoever at Activision decided to hand it down to their red headed step children budget company and let Cauldron LLC develop it is a total moron. Everything about the game is crap and there is not one single feature that redeems it. A HUGE disappointment for SoF fans and even FPS fans. It plays and feels like a console shooter. In fact, as soon as you get to the menu screens, it feels like a direct port and I think it is. There aren&apos;t even any graphics options, except to change the resolution and you can&apos;t even chat in multiplayer. The gameplay is awful, you just fun and shoot and your enemies barely even move out of the way unless you throw a grenade at them. The storyline is pathetic and has very little if any relationship to the previous games. DO NOT but this game whatever you do. This game deserves to die and rot in hell, it is a total embarrassment to the series and should not even be counted as part of it. Activision, you should be ashamed of yourselves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soldier-of-fortune-payback/user-reviews?user_review_id=406073">Expand</a></span>

Let me explain, I say that because everything in it is &quot;classic.&quot; Such as the boss battles. None of this headshot crap, it is unload everything into them like 90&apos;s games did. Graphics are just a little bit above par. Story, why is everyone mad about it, I got it. Mason has two obsticals, the Wall brothers and his own revenge. Levels are short and quick, but no problem, up the difficulty and play again. I love the weapon customization. All in all it is a very standard shooter. Die hard fans might like it, but I think it&apos;s the second best in the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soldier-of-fortune-payback/user-reviews?user_review_id=739592">Expand</a></span>
