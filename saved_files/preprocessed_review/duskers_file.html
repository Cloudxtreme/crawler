It also avoids narrating anything, which sets you up for claustrophobic exploration of derelict space ship after derelict space ship as you attempt to piece together what&apos;s going on by yourself. To do this you must use, arm and upgrade drones. You start with just three, but more can be salvaged as you go.
<br>Aliens are almost all either dangerous or terrifying, and are really best avoided altogether, unless you have some sort of plan for how to kill them. Fortunately there is a robust array of drone upgrades that makes this a little easier. You can use Stealth to sneak up close to an alien so you can shoot it with Turret. Or you can Scan rooms from a distance, activate stationary onboard turrets and open doors to funnel scanned aliens towards them. Or you can simply open an airlock to flush aliens into space. Make one mistake though and you&apos;re dead. It&apos;s very nerve-wracking. There are also Mines, Interfaces for logging onto ship computers, Gather modifications for scavenging ships and Generator mods, needed to access power grids so you can open doors. Not everything is immediately useful, and experimentation is recommended with new mods.
<br>In addition to the aliens there are also many environmental threats. Radiation from space can compromise segments of a space ship, and, given time, an entire spaceship can be flooded with it. There are highly annoying leaks from the hull, which will threaten any stationary drones so you&apos;re never safe. There are also meteor strikes, although these are rare early in the game. Luckily you can get in your little docking vehicle and leave at any time. Of course then you won&apos;t get all the fuel and other resources you desperately need, and will have to hope for better luck on the next derelict. And finally the derelicts can be commandeered as well, effectively replacing your active ship between the missions. This gives various effects, but mainly affects how many mods the actual ship can have. For example commandeering a military ship often lets you fire weapons anywhere on a derelict you&apos;re exploring, while other ships will let you scan without using your drones or even power parts of a derelict power grid from the ship, leaving your generator drone free to do something else.
<br>
<br>Duskers can be somewhat frustrating at first. Each drone mod requires a bit of practice before you get the timing down. And while you&apos;re getting used to new things you will die. Over and over again. And because the game generates random ships every time, it never really gets predictable. The best tip is to abandon ship while you still can. Call me a coward, but fleeing at the first sign of trouble is the only reason I got anywhere in this game. I highly recommend being a coward. I also recommend Duskers. It&apos;s atmospheric , demanding and rewarding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duskers/user-reviews?user_review_id=6802203">Expand</a></span>
