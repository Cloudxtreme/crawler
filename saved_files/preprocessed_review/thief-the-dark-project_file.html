Thief brought a breath of fresh air to 1st person &apos;shooters&apos;.  It has to be the best stealth game series I have played to date.  You sneak around and hide in shadows and either knock people out or put an arrow in them.  Your missions are almost always to get into someplace and steal something.  And the storyline is just awesome.   It&apos;s way better then that joke of a game &quot;Assassin&apos;s Creed&quot;-- which I discovered was nothing close to what Thief was.  I have yet to find any game that matches Thief in style.  I found a website where a group has made an open source game that is like Thief (but it is buggy yet and relies on fan-made mission).  Recently I read that Thief 4 is being worked on, but so far no release date!  I only had one part of the game that I didn&apos;t like, and that was where they put zombies in the game.  It wasn&apos;t that bad, but I like going up against people that seemed to have some intelligence not some mindless walking goon that made a noise when it saw or heard me-- but thankfully it was only in one part of the game so I can&apos;t really complain that much about it.  Overall the entire series is just fun to play, and I recommend it to anyone that is tired of mindless shoot &apos;em ups that have weak or no story lines.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief-the-dark-project/user-reviews?user_review_id=1466316">Expand</a></span>

This game had everything: charismatic main protagonist and villains (Garrett, Viktoria, the Trickster etc.), a great new engine (Dark Engine which featured new alpha blending, texture filtering and lighting techniques... all quiet revolutionary back than). Great game and level design (It was designed to be largely unscripted; events, instead of being pre-defined by designers, occur naturally.) Great gameplay (Thief focused on stealth and evasion from a first-person perspective, and not full frontal action.) Atmosphere (The game takes place in a metropolis called &quot;the City&quot; which has been noted to contain elements of fantasy, the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution.) Cutscenes (They were partly animated, partly made with live actors and motion capture technology). Even today  the Thief series is the ultimate stealth game in gaming history. The stealth system was very new when the game was released. The player had to rely on the environment  to avoid being detected. Shadows could be used to avoid notice; a monitor on the heads-up display (HUD) indicated the player character&apos;s visibility level. The player  could lean, crouch, climb, swim and run, among other actions. Surfaces caused varying amounts of noise; for example, carpet is quiet and ceramic tiles are very loud. Enemies were reacting to these factors, and players could manipulate these element of gameplay to distract NPCs etc. Go play Thief:TDS than go and play the rest of the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief-the-dark-project/user-reviews?user_review_id=2766468">Expand</a></span>

A.I. is one of the key ingredients in stealth games considering you have to analyze movement and patterns of behavior to be successful.

Not only is it satisfying, you get to watch awesome cut scenes and mission briefings.

The stealth is obviously Thief&apos;s main strength: finishing a level undetected without killing anyone is immensely satisfying. Thief does have it&apos;s gripes: the game burdens itself with too much zombie and burrick-killing which did little more than make the game punishing at times. The Dark Engine also comes with a couple of annoying quirks; namely slippery movement and fiddly inventory management.

Story, voice acting, and level design don&apos;t age; if they&apos;re great at release, they&apos;re great forever, and so it is with Thief. All that remains to review is the technology, and this is where this game and its sequel, Thief II: The Metal Age, really shine. Even the best-conceived and -executed games of the late &apos;90s put their advancing age on full display, with the exception of Thief, and here are the reasons: (1) After all this time, no game has made better use of sound. With headphones or surround-sound, you can literally close your eyes and know where every conversation, grunt, footstep, dripping fountain, and crackling torch are located and how far away they are. The sound design of Thief remains simply astonishing, and it&apos;s a critical part of the gameplay; you navigate through the sprawling levels and enthralling missions as much by sound as by sight. (2) Similarly, the use of light and shadows remains unsurpassed. (3) The NPCs have superior AI compared to most games, then and now. Their actions and reactions are varied, complex, and extremely sensitive to how visible you are, how much noise you make, how far away you are, whether you have a weapon drawn, how long you&apos;ve been in hiding after once being spotted, and so on. And they talk like real human beings! I&apos;m not sure there was a single line of repeating dialogue in the entire game. (4) Finally, the graphics, though limited by the technology of the day, remain surprisingly fresh because of the Dark Engine&apos;s unique, angular building blocks. Characters and environments are constructed from skewed polygons that make up for a lack of resolution with a slightly weird distortion, as though you&apos;re looking through a kaleidoscope, or perhaps on an extremely low dose of acid. That&apos;s not a perfect description, but suffice it to say that Thief looks quite like no other game. Thief IS like no other game. You can buy it cheap these days, and if you love gaming and are open to an experience that challenges your mind more than your twitch reflexes, it is absolutely worth the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief-the-dark-project/user-reviews?user_review_id=2620665">Expand</a></span>

Thief: The Dark Project or Thief: Gold, developed from the now defunct company Looking Glass Studios puts you in the Steampunk Victorian times, with creepy music, great atmosphere (believe me this game scares me to bits!), great story line and great voice acting! The only problems I encountered with the game is that its too confusing to get to somewhere, and also the first time I got it, it was poorly optimized, so I highly recommend if you are using an up-to-date PC, to download an unofficial patch which fixes some of the problems like cut scenes not working, bad resolutions and poor quality. But set aside all these problems, and you have a perfect stealth masterpiece.

It&apos;s a simple and well told tale of someone biting off more than they can chew.  Garrett&apos;s ultimate heist takes him to a variety of locations in the City ranging from mansions, prisons, tombs, and the churches of religious fanatics.  The experience never seems to get stale as you sneak through dark corridors, avoiding detection from your enemies while stripping the place of valuables.  There are a few missions that don&apos;t hit their target as effectively as they should, otherwise this is probably one of the best and influential stealth games in history.  A must play for fans of the stealth genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief-the-dark-project/user-reviews?user_review_id=4413804">Expand</a></span>

The only problem contains within what many old games suffered back then, complicated areas made that way with very similar looking walls, I didn&apos;t enjoy that in The Wolfenstein 3d, this time it didn&apos;t work either. On the other hand the game had extraordinary and interesting plot, I loved the cinematics and the badass protagonist.

You are placed in huge mission areas and its up to you to use your wits and problem solving skills to over come each and every obstacle Garrett(MasterThief) faces. Thief Gold has an incredible amount of depth partly because the man who is behind Bioshock had a big influence on this game.

<br>On a side note the visuals in this game can be somewhat bland but in my opinion that is no reason to bring the score down since there are so many amazing modders that keep this game running with the big boys even today.
