<br>
<br>Story:
<br>
<br>based on Dimitri Glukowski&apos;s book Metro 2033, Metro Last Light is meant as the 2nd Part of the already known Metro 2033 Game. After Artjom has killed all dark ones in Metro 2033 he is now send out to find the last survivor and get in contact with him to find out more about the dark ones and then has to kill him.
<br>But as usual not everything works as expected and so he gets into real trouble again with the faschists and communists. But enough of the Story itself.
<br>So from the kind of telling the story, Metro Last Light has a Half Life stile storytelling. So every person interacts with you and tells you whats going on, but you never reply to them ingame  thats what I would see as the biggest issue in the game, because the story looses atmosphere through it. Only in the loading screens Artjom talks about whats happening.
<br>
<br>Audio:
<br>
<br>The audio is a bit of a two sided swort. There will be people complaining by the russian accent but others would say this is a necessary part of the game. I belong to the second ones, so for me this is not a point where Last Light looses score. But as I already told in story part, you protagonist never talks. Thats sad. Except of this, for a story telling shooter alle the weapon sounds and the environment sounds a really great an atmospheric.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>
<br>So gameplay I liked the very most. Is it changing your filters for your gas mask, or wiping the dirt out of you view until pumping up the electricity for your flashlight/nightvision  this all fits so much into gameplay and is from my side the most ignored feature in most scores. So whenever the action began to start these elements made it a fight for survival which really kept me having fun on it.
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>
<br>Well the most pro argument why Metro is at least at the same meta score as Bioshock Infinite for me.
<br>I know most people would now say, yes but the Graphics are not everything. Thats right, but in a FPS Graphics are mainly the focus and not the story!  So from the awesome lightning, detailed textures (espacially in the outdoor regions) and awesome animations of the characters this game is really one of the best looking games that you can play at this time. So especially for the PC version that is coming pretty close to Battlefields actual Frostbite engine!
<br>
<br>Verdict:
<br>
<br>So for me this is also a must play title. It also tells parts of the book Metro 2033 new and changes the story that far, that Metro 2035 will be based on the events in Last Light.
<br>The game is not too short, it took me about 15 hours I guess and I really enjoyed the twists and the awesome looking graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3193401">Expand</a></span>

You can easily lose yourself there playing Metro, and you might as well lose your friends and relatives for that period of time... And thats okay  it is the experience we&apos;ve been waiting for since 2033 and the sequel is definitely worth it.</span>

<br>
<br>Good things:
<br>- More types of monsters
<br>- the metro feels more alive, more is happening there.
<br>- New way yo take down human enemies, by knocking them unconscious.
<br>- Stealth system has improved, enemies must individually see you to know your location.
<br>and you will have a moment of doubt if you walk into light, if you get out of the light quickly the guards
<br>will doubt they saw you.
<br>
<br>The less good:
<br>- The human enemy knockdown is too powerfull, it works on all medium armored humans.
<br>Will not work on heavy armored humans. It works both when you ar undetected as when you are
<br>detected. You can run towards the enemy and knock them unconscious. Just too powerful. Needs
<br>tweaking here.
<br>- Stealth needs tweaking too, enemies won&apos;t see you when you are right in front them. And you walks
<br>always 100% silent, that&apos;s not realistic. I miss the glass on the ground which made stealth a challenge
<br>in Metro 2033. In last light you can walk around without much problems, it lacks challenge.
<br>- In normal difficulty the throw knifes do not reflect of armor pieces, which did happen in Metro 2033.
<br>That&apos;s a shame really, that made it more realistic.
<br>
<br>Overall I must say I enjoyed it. It&apos;s worth the 8. With some good tweaks it can be higher!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3170208">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you are on the fence about buying this, the game itself is fantastic, graphically its on par with Crysis 3 easily, especially the lighting.
<br>The sound quality is fantastic, and the atmosphere conveyed using the sound, especially around the various creatures in the game, has been nothing but a pleasure to the ears; though when in towns its hard to hear anyone talking to you about the plot line or otherwise with so much background noise, which is my main gripe with the game, but with subtitles its somewhat forgivable (don&apos;t expect great English voice acting).
<br>
<br>By far the biggest improvement is the gun play, which has come leaps and bounds from 2033.  The guns all have weight, and seem very fun, smooth and yet clunky all at the same time, which is good by and for the setting of the game and what weapons are available to you.  I still wish monsters showed more impact when shot with a double barrel shotgun, or anything else for that matter, but overall its a massive step up, and I would argue the shooting to easily contend with the top shooters of todays video games.
<br>
<br>The single best part of the game though is the atmosphere where I can gladly say they have nailed, down to every last detail.  Its gritty, unnerving and wholly a joy and terror to explore the underground tunnels and its especially a treat to break the ground level onto the surface.  I don&apos;t want to spoil anything more about this aspect of the game, but I would consider this game buy worthy just for the emotions it stirs in ones playing it.
<br>
<br>I have not beaten the game, I&apos;m merely putting my two sense in so that people whom have yet to play it have some base lane outside of game review websites.   If you are wanting to buy the game, awesome, its well worth it and a massive step up from Metro:2033, it can also easily appeal to people whom maybe did not want or like the first game in the series.   But if you are having hesitations, it may be worth renting or borrowing later down the road to test the waters.  Also, I highly disagree with this whole &quot;range mode&quot; DCL, its simply another way to cheat gamers, and I will not be buying the upgrade.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3158100">Expand</a></span>

I am nearly towards the end and have found it to be substantially better than the first game. Fight mechanics and game-play have been greatly improved. This is one of the most immersive games I&apos;ve played since....well, since Metro 2033. The musical score is great and adds to the overall experience. Enemies are more varied this time around, and so are the weapons. I see there are a lot of trolls around commenting in here who haven&apos;t even played the game and giving it a zero score, so I will give this a 10 to bring it back up. This is truly a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3158851">Expand</a></span>

Like, what other game lets you play in a post apocalyptic Moscow metro? None. This game delivers that and does it extremely well. Though Last Light has it&apos;s problems such as its really linear story, AI Stealth detection is a bit forgiving and off but not enough to ruin it for you. There are also technical difficulties that the developers can fix. And my biggest problem with the game is that its main characters voice does not use it in game but only in loading screens. I think if they put his voice in game, then dialogue would sound allot less awkward and better. Narrative would become amazing. Over all this game is a must own for any one looking into a well driven story, especially if your a metro fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3159278">Expand</a></span>

Which is a really taxing antialiasing that isn&apos;t necessary; msaa would of sufficed. The reason i&apos;m giving this a 9, is the story can be rather cheesy sometimes.</span>

The story is also interesting. DO NOT listen to the people that rate it 1&apos;s 2&apos;s and 3&apos;s etc bashing the game. They are talking complete nonsense. Most of these negative reviews will no doubt come from the &quot;angryjoe ranger mode DLC debacle&quot; band wagon jumpers. That is not a reason to bash the game, at all, end of.

<br>STALKER series and Fallout series are far better than this.</span>

Artyom, pull the lever, Artyom shine your flash light, Artyom climb up the ladder, Arytom follow me.  The game so &quot;railroad track linear&quot; anyway, you couldn&apos;t go anywhere else if you wanted to.  Take notice of all the high user reviews.  90% of them have no review history.  They just popped on the grid like Metro was the first game they ever played.  Can someone say &quot;suspicious&quot;?  The graphics feel like the first Metro.  They were cool then, but when you take a close look at the detail, it&apos;s so dated.  The hallways have that computer precision geometry.  The sound needs so much work.
<br>The atmospheric plays in the background, but the rusty elevator I&apos;m riding is completely silent.   Details details.  Is it a game changer?  Maybe maybe not, but as the little things start to accumulate, you realize how much you appreciate a game that has polish.  Like the voice acting.  It is bad bad.  It sounds like the actors are reading directly from the script into the microphone.  It&apos;s almost painful to listen to.  Like when the lower ranking officer gets his dialog cut off by the higher ranking officer.  You know, like when you&apos;re cut off mid-sentence?  Except the low ranking guy just reads his script to the cut off point and there&apos;s a pause BEFORE he get&apos;s cut off?  Little things. I like an immersive experience and what caught my eye about this game was all the reviews that say what a great feel this game has.  It might, but the devil is in the details, and this game misses in some very pronounced ways.  At least do yourself the smallest favor.  Don&apos;t spend that fifty bucks because you may feel like I do.  Paying top dollar is for games that live up to the score, and the scores on this game have been dubiously amped.  It&apos;s not quite a money grab, but it sure leans that way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160302">Expand</a></span>

On top of that your hand is held throughout most of the game and whatever npc that is guiding you around won&apos;t shut up. No open world elements so go into this knowing that it is a 100% linear shooter, you have one path to go down and that is it. Very disappointing</span>

To enhance the game&apos;s experience, play this at night and be sure to turn the brightness down in the game. Play the game on the hardest mode possible, even on regular difficulty the ammo is too abundant and you could easily play through the entire game guns blazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3902669">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>- The gameplay has vastly improved. When I first played Metro 2033 the controls felt fine. But after playing Last Light I went back to 2033 and it felt clunky. In Last Light everything feels more fluid and natural.
<br>- The Dark One child is awesome! Now this is what Elizabeth in BioShock Infinite should have been like. Elizabeth was basically a walking ammo/health dispenser and she served no real purpose story wise. But the Dark One child was written into the game well. At one point in the game the child accompanies you, and while he jumps around he talks to you, explaining back story and creating a character for himself. You actually start to get attached to him and his cute human clothes. He does find useful items on occasion, but it doesn&apos;t feel like he&apos;s a dispenser.
<br>- The levels are better. Unlike in 2033, there are a lot more levels with human enemies. This isn&apos;t for everyone, but the stealth missions are always my favorite so this is a pro for me.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Linear! You go from A to B in each level and there&apos;s only one way to get there. Sure there are some extra buildings or corridors to explore but they only lead to a dead end and some loot.
<br>- The companions are annoying (except for the Dark One child)! There&apos;s always an NPC to guide you and harass you with what to do. Hearing &quot;Artyom, climb the ladder!&quot; a dozen times gets tiring when I&apos;m trying to explore the extra rooms.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not a perfect game, but it&apos;s definitely an improvement over 2033. All the negative reviews I read are too nit-picky. Being linear and having on and off voice acting does not make this game bad, and does not credit a 0 score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3168818">Expand</a></span>

I decided to buy it anyway and was not disappointed, it became one of my most favorite games that I ever played. Then comes Last Light. Last Light improves on almost everything that 2033 had issues with, from the gameplay to the AI.
<br>
<br>Last Light starts off a year after 2033 and expands on the story of 2033. You are Artyom and you have a mission to find the last remaining &quot;Dark One&quot; a race of creatures that were believed to be evil on the first game. I am not going to go any further into the story than so people can play the first game and be surprised of the out come. The story of Last Light is well told, which is a very good thing since Last Light is a story driven FPS. You a should play 2033 first before trying this game to understand fully what is going on. The story starts out slow, but picks up in its emotion and intensity through out. It will have you craving for more. Voice acting is sufficant, it is not bad yet not great, but even with the voice acting being the way it is you still care for certain characters and loath others. If you are looking for an FPS with story focus Last Light could be a good choice.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is another aspect of the game that has been enhanced. AI on the first game was hit or miss. Sometimes the enemies would be as dumb as rocks and other times they could spot you through a wall. This time around though the AI is actually smart. Taking guys out silently will not have them running at you, they actually try to search for the source of the noise. If you are in a dark enough area crouched, they will not see you. The handling of the guns feels so much smoother, it is up there with the AAA shooters that are dominating the market. Stealth is a big part of Last Light, the enhanced gameplay helps with this aspect as well. When going into a room with a bunch of men. You can sneak around and unscrew the light bulbs so it will be harder for enemies to find you. And if you are lucky enough there might be a fuse box to turn off making it completely dark and might even lure an enemy over for an easy kill, that is out of the way. You can even make it through the game with out even killing a single human. Even when combat becomes hectic the fluid gunplay holds up and makes for a great and challenging time. Humans are not the only enemies on the game, there are monsters as well, who are mostly fought upclose and personal with no stealth. Although there are parts where you can sneek past the creatures to conserve ammo, which brings me up to another aspect of the game, the ammo. Instead of running and gunning you should take your time and plan your tactics out, ammo is a scarcity. Every bullet you pick up bring ease to the fights. Another way ammo is used is for money, yes money. There is a special military grade bullet that is used as currency. This ammo is even more rare and is also a lot more powerful, taking enemies down much quicker, but I recommend not doing that to often, since the ammo is good to buy other items such as filters. When going up to the surface from the Metro you have to put on a gas mask that is limited of oxygen. To continue being able to breath you need to find filters, which are rare as well and are a relief when found. With the enhanced and refind gameplay Last Light is turning out to be one of the greatest games of this year.
<br>
<br>For anyone who has played 2033 you will know that graphics and detail are big part of Metro as well. LL does not disappoint, it is one of the best looking games of this years especially on PC. The detail in the world is beautiful, in a depressing way. The would is full of life(and death)  from stations with many people to interact with the game just looks great. Not a single corner is left unthought of.
<br>
<br>So in all if you are looking forward to an FPS that is different than other shooters that is story driven, then this game is for you. Probably the closet game I can compare LL to is Half-Life. You will feel emotion in its story and feel for the characters in a world full of life and death. Metro LL is not for everyone though, some might be turned off by the slower more emotional pace of the gameplay and story and may not like that the game is harder than most shooters out there, but if you can get past that be prepared to get blown away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3169740">Expand</a></span>

<br>Fantastic eerie environments, great characters you can relate to, excellent ambiance, challenging combat with resource management if you play on harder modes. Storytelling was good and the entire &quot;campaign&quot; lasted about 20 hours for me but my only beef with it was the rather abrupt ending.
<br>
<br>If anyone asks, I highly recommend this game; buy it, loan it, rent it, steal it etc</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171918">Expand</a></span>

<br>Metro: Last Light more than makes up for its linear gameplay by making the world extremely rich and detailed. However, I felt at times that the game was even more &quot;on rails&quot; than the original.
<br>The game is a quality title, but I could not help but find myself irritated by the EXCESSIVE reuse of models and voices. And they are the same models and voices from the first game, so returning players will know what I mean immediately. They reuse the same male child model for every single kid in the metro and they did it again this game. Same voice, same face, on every...single...kid. Now to top it off; the alien children in the game, share the SAME...EXACT...VOICE. Inexcusable.
<br>Game loses points for excessive reuse of models and voices, even ones from the FIRST game, as well as the fact that the story was not as deep and intriguing as the original, feeling like it had been written strictly for the purposes of creating a sequel for the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3293456">Expand</a></span>

The game has survival horror elements that do scare the crap out of you even when your out side in the morning that&apos;s a good sign for a survival horror and the environment looks just great and it&apos;s a lot better than the first game witch was alright. My biggest problem is that ranger difficulty cost 5$ unless you pre ordered it and that just pissed me off because that&apos;s supposed to give you the best experience but it doesn&apos;t ruin the game witch is great so I think you shouldn&apos;t pass this up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3169992">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s railed on purpose (It&apos;s a book) you have to FOLLOW A STORY (MAX PAYNE). There&apos;s only two options that you can make in the game KILL or NOT to KILL! If you like open world play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. People who played METRO 2033 can&apos;t complaint that it&apos;s not open world (It&apos;s open enough to  your pants when you outside metro).
<br>Bad Story? Well to bad for you, probably Bioshock Infinite has more story for you... I found this story amazingly retarded as gameplay itself (referring to Bioshock)! I&apos;ve enjoined this METRO and it&apos;s thrilling story.
<br>Bad Acting? Well Russian accent, whats wrong with that? You in underground Moscow buddy;)!
<br>Best graphics you ever experienced! Put your SLI/CroFire in good use!
<br>This was a Good Buy for Me!!!
<br>
<br>that know everything about how story is must be or how NOT OPEN environment is, but they do rate Bioshock Infinite  as 10/10 (Those are true gamers)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3169474">Expand</a></span>

Never before in a game have I been able to just walk over to a man telling stories to a child and been captivated myself.  This is what so many games nowadays lack; the ability to interest you with ambient details.  The game successfully conveyed to me what was going on, even though I had never read the book.  Metro LL also does a spectacular job of immersing me and is able to frighten me at certain times too! It is quite good at evoking emotion from me as well.  This game is seriously a masterpiece, a non-stop fun and immersive experience from beginning to end.

Don&apos;t be fooled by the people who complain they can&apos;t get 60+ FPS with max settings. The developers have really pushed the graphics to next generation and it shows. The AI is vastly improved (still room for improvement) and the compelling story of the game continues. This game is a must have.</span>

<br>Sadly there are a few technical issues, especially for nvidia users.  The current WHQL drivers(320.49) cause hardlocks of the game requiring a reboot, otherwise you&apos;re left with a looping driver crash/restart problem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3302262">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics on a high-end machine are superb.  The best FPS I&apos;ve ever seen, even besting Crysis 3.  Gameplay is really a lot of fun.  Only bad point is the story is extremely disjointed an really hokey in some points.  I don&apos;t know if there was something lost in translation, but some of the dialogue is really corny, and full of non-sequetors. Some of the technology and plot devices are pretty unbelievable, but this is post-apocolyptic video game, so I&apos;m not going to quibble.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3607036">Expand</a></span>

Take time to snoop around and explore what you can. Loved the journey</span>

<br>Metro is the same genre as Bioshock Infinite (Exploring unique linear world mixed with a fine story and weak shooter), and for me  Metro is better in this.</span>

                                        <span>I have to say, i was in tears when i finished the Single Player campaign. Graphics? Superb. Gameplay? Addicting. Atmosphere? Survival-horror in the best of the genre, breathtaking. But the storyline brings you to somewhere that you keep feeling, after playing, that if they release the sequel just two or three months later Metro Last Light, it would still be perfect! Masterpiece.</span>

I can&apos;t give it a 10 because as pointed out, some of the AI is a bit off and there are a few inconsistencies ... plus I would have loved to see a &quot;lean&quot; mechanism for stealth. Still, for atmosphere, story, immersion, shooting mechanics graphics (awesome detail),etc. it would probably rate a 10. When you stop and consider the budget and the conditions under which these guys worked under, especially in Metro 2033, you just can&apos;t help applaud what they&apos;ve been able to create. This game will suck you in, chew you up and spit you out and the larger gaming companies could really take note as to what makes a game good --- and it isn&apos;t MONEY. I ran the patched version for AMDs with the FOV tweak, I crashed 3 times total in the game and experienced no other bugs, maybe I was just lucky but this game was actually the least buggy game I played in 2013. As far as I&apos;m concerned, this is my GOTY for 2013 ... yes, easily over bioshock infinite. You really have to wonder about who is slipping who money when it comes to &quot;critic&quot; reviews, because they rarely seem to have a clue.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3924583">Expand</a></span>

It is an example of what COD and HALO players have been missing out on with recend FPS: a great campaign. It will take you about 15 hours to complete on normal. If you buy the extra Ranger Mode DLC, it will take closer to thirty with the much increased difficulty. The story in this game is O.K., it gets a little dull towards the end, but that is only because of the increased action. The real fun is addressing every single situation differently, whether you want to sneak by, silently kill everyone or just go in guns blazing. Different factors will affect the way you play: you might get help from a supernatural source, be fighting monsters from above or have a cracked gas mask that requires the utmost care not to break. Juggling limited ammo and gas filters as well as pumping up your air powered rifles and flashlight electricity make this incredibly challenging. Which, one man army COD players, is actually a very good thing. You actually have to think to fight (good FPS skills still required.) Graphics look absolutely top notch, even though unless you have a great computer your graphics must be reduced. Loads of DLC will be coming, as will many more hours of gameplay. All in all, these countless coming hours will be every bit more special that the countless hours of typical multiplayer FPS that is typically popular.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3287165">Expand</a></span>

<br>The plot is good but you maybe won&#xB4;t understand everything if you haven&#xB4;t played Metro 2033 or read the books.
<br>Fighting in the game feels great, even if the stealth part feels a bit silly.
<br>Many levels are designed open and you can choose different ways to proceed and there are more variations of different and unique weapons than in Metro 2033.
<br>There are some survival aspects in the game, you still have to search the areas in the game for bullets, weapons and filters for your gas mask. Surviving the world of Metro: Last Light on higher difficulties like the Ranger Mode won&#xB4;t be an easy task.
<br>The world the game presents you is full of stunning environments and creates a depressing atmosphere which can not be described easily.
<br>To keep it short: This is not a game. This is a experience.
<br>And everyone should have experienced it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3436106">Expand</a></span>

On the other hand I had all the memories and feelings from 1st part fresh when I dived intro LL.
<br>The graphics were amazing  max settings gave and amazing picture.
<br>Shooting system was fine  it would take a few  to get me down, and same applied for any normal enemy.
<br>Story-line was somewhat predictable, yet interesting and witch bunch of unexpected turn-overs.
<br>
<br>Now, the only two things I didn&apos;t like about this game are: how ranger-hardcore mode is developed, and how AI performs with stealth system.
<br>There are a HUD system in the game (basic for any game yea?), but on hardcore level it goes away to give you realism. I love challenges, I love games that give me challenges. But playing Metro LL for the first time on the top hard level  is somewhat pain in the ass. That happens because you don&apos;t see the hud, you don&apos;t know the hud. That&apos;s why I had BIG problems using explosives through the whole game. Only in the end I managed to somehow switch them using the sound that the hud emits when you pick specific item from the round menu of additional weapons. So, high five to 4A games for not testing the quality of game experience on the hardest mode in the game.
<br>Now AI. It&apos;s sometimes just plain stupid, or the computer thinks that player totally dissolves with the background, but there were a LOT of moments when it was natural if AI would detect me (like enemy looking exactly at me from 5 meters away, or calm guard who just chilled while I was killing his mate who was standing a step away from him with throwing knife, etc etc).
<br>
<br>All in all it was a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3168833">Expand</a></span>

This game is already one of my favorite shooters of recent memory. The developers have created a labor of love for the PC and it pushes the GPU to the limits. Not many devs out there are pushing out products that are this bleeding edge. Sure, depending on your GPU and the drivers you are running, you may experience some graphical issues but those were quickly patched (in my case, at least). The shooter mechanics have been polished to near perfection, which is a major plus over 2033. The affection that these devs show towards the narrative is such a breath of fresh air. But it is the attention to detail with the atmosphere of this post-apocalyptic world that will take away that breath. If you are a fan of Fallout 3 or the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, this game deserves your attention. A solidly satisfying experience from beginning to end.

Though this my first review on metacritic dont be confused, I&apos;ve been playing games since colossal cave adventure on an osborne luggable, this is a well made game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3200227">Expand</a></span>

What I got was something closer to Bioshock, but with amazing graphics and awesome environments to explore.  I greatly enjoyed this game with its good shooting mechanics and stealth sections.  The characters are interesting (except for your in-game character who is completely mute) and there is a nice narration between loading screens.  I picked this up and couldn&apos;t put it down until I finished it.  Some people say it is too linear and I suppose it is very linear but a game about being in a maze of subway tunnels would get dangerously confusing if it wasn&apos;t.  Some games do open world very well but I don&apos;t think it should be a requirement.  Highly recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4416076">Expand</a></span>

The environment just sucks you right in and is very immersive, and the plotline is fantastic. Combat mechanics are ok enough not to hinder with the story. Monsters are terrifying and tough. Ammo is limited and precious. Graphics and attention to detail are incredible. The game is a great balance between plot development and combat. Overall very well done.
<br>
<br>Negatives: Just like the first Metro, very linear gameplay. I do understand that they want you to feel like nowhere is safe to stay and you need to keep moving, but Fallout accomplishes this and is still open-world. It was also just a very short game. I felt like I got to the end very quick, maybe 8 real hours of gameplay time if you drag it out. Lastly, I hate that your actions from the first game have ZERO impact on this one. I saved the dark ones in the first game, but you have no option to play the storyline as that outcome in this sequel.
<br>
<br>Overall, I loved this game and I am stoked for the next sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3425726">Expand</a></span>

<br>Metro: Last Light was an impulse purchase for me, and I started my game experience rather dubious about its prospects.  I had read reviews saying &quot;inconsistent difficulty&quot; and &quot;poor AI&quot;, but also &quot;strong story&quot;.
<br>
<br>The tutorial and first level or so didn&apos;t impress me, but dear lord does the story and intensity ever ramp up!  My first playthough has been on Hardcore, and it&apos;s earning the name.  The gameplay is intense and immersive.  It&apos;s been a long time since a game has raised my heart rate like Last Light does.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Involving, mature story with adult themes and lots of background detail.
<br>An amazing amount of custom voice acting and animation.
<br>Although linear, has solid level design and no &quot;infinite bad guys&quot;.
<br>Intense &quot;survival horror&quot; combat mixed with standard CoD type combat.
<br>Pretty good  enjoyable stealth implementation.
<br>Oh my God, they&apos;re not kidding with the &quot;Mature&quot; rating!  NOT FOR CHILDREN
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>Not particularly innovative in gameplay mechanics.  Experienced FPS players will recognize everything that comes along.  Familiar isn&apos;t necessarily bad, though.
<br>
<br>Quite linear.  More like CoD than Bioshock.  Personally this doesn&apos;t bug me, but several other reviewers have complained that the world isn&apos;t sandbox.  It&apos;s not that kind of game.
<br>
<br>In order to get my heart thumping, the game does occasionally throw multiple strong and fast opponents at me, while I have poor visibility or sight lines.  Some may call this &quot;inconsistent difficulty&quot;.  Personally, I find the intensity and challenge to be a positive quality.
<br>
<br>Had to turn off &quot;Advanced Physics&quot;, it was lagging the game out.  If you&apos;re having massive slowdown, turn off the Advanced Physics option in the GamePlay menu!

Its&apos; greatest achievement is giving you an incredible sense of play, the metro world is so rich, not since the original bioshock have I enjoyed being in a game world so much. Wiping rain off you gas mask, pumping your flashlight to charge, and other such features really make you feel as if you are in this post apocalyptic future. Characters are good, with a few good twists, and the bad bits (falling into water, mutants a bit lame, so balance issues) are far outweighed by the good. Give it a go!

There are a little too many cutscenes where the game holds you hand and just lets you watch or maybe tells you to rapidly press a button. I feel as if there are more of that compared to the original Metro 2033. You can make a few smaller choices of strategy and customize your weapon load out but that&apos;s it. All in all the game is exiting even though, like I said, it&apos;s very linear. It&apos;s also beautiful to look at given your PC can handle it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3804072">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not very often that a game can blend both stealth play and traditional shooter play, Metro does not do this well, but it does do it better than others. The stealth aspect is very important to maintain because without making a headshot, you might as well be firing spitballs at the enemies. There are serious issues with balance when it comes down to it. Most of the guns just plain suck, they do pretty much close to zero damage, except the revolver of course. If you don&apos;t stack 3 of them as your weapons then you&apos;re basically putting yourself at a huge disadvantage. Grab  1 revolver for each; stealth, long-range, and short/mid-range, and you&apos;ll be set for the entire game. Besides the guns, there are numerous &quot;thrown&quot; items that you can use. You won&apos;t though, because that damn revolver dwarfs everything. It&apos;s always quicker to just shoot, even if you have to reload first. Besides the throwables, you also have the ability to knife. DO NOT EVER USE THE KNIFE. It is completely broken and horribly implemented into the game. You&apos;ll never stab where you&apos;re aiming; You&apos;ll always hit left or right of where you actually aimed, leaving the enemy free to ruin your face. Along with that, the animations for the stabbing are so jerky and sporadic that there is a curve to get used to the games horrible animations, just so you can used to the knifes horrible aim. I repeat, do not ever knife in this game unless you are stealth-killing someone.
<br>
<br>The story and dialogue are, well, I can&apos;t comment on the story in full because the lack of play testing (or so I assume) is keeping me from completing the game. I&apos;m stuck at the armored were-beast thing down in the catacombs with 1 good gun (the revolver), and two piles of sh!t (shotgun, and the so-called &quot;best and most sought after AR in the Metro&quot;), along with all the other useless weapons at my disposal. I carefully spend my time putting upwards of 300 bullets into the bosses face, only to be left to use my throwables, only then to be left to stab. Always resulting in my death. Again, this game has some serious balance issues. Bad as the issues are, I still want to complete the story and find out what the deal is with the overly affectionate Dark One that seems to have a boner for Art. As far as the dialogue is concerned, it&apos;s pretty bad. You remember back in grade school, when you had to read a paper in front of the class? And everyone always did it as quick as possible with absolutely no emotion? Yeah, the voice &quot;acting&quot; is that bad. The mouths don&apos;t even attempt to line up with the words coming out of them, but that&apos;s nothing new for video games.
<br>
<br>The environments in the game are actually really good. Whether you&apos;re in the metro or above ground, there is an innate sense of immersion that they achieve. When you&apos;re crawling around underground you really feel like it&apos;s a subway; tight spaces, open exposed pipes, and bugs, TONS of bugs and webs really help bring the atmosphere to life in the otherwise droll grey colors in the metro. Above ground, there&apos;s a sense like at any moment the wrong footstep could unleash hell on your unsuspecting ass. Whether you&apos;re in the grasslands, the marsh, or wherever, the above ground environments really project a sense of desolation in a ruined world. The enemies above ground are great too, if only the guns did more damage. 8 shots to the face with a shotgun and you&apos;re still charging right for me? Give me a break, that&apos;s entirely unrealistic, even for fiction.
<br>
<br>So what&apos;s the verdict? If you can get it for free or borrow it, definitely give it a try. I wouldn&apos;t pay any more $20 for it though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4108929">Expand</a></span>

I have 46 in borderlands 2 not counting any DLC play time and still working on the main quest.  More backtracking there of course, but still. This game is worth it if you get it on sale, but for me full price is too much for 10 hrs of play time.

It&apos;s not an open-roam game like Borderlands or Fallout 3, but from the beginning it&apos;s clear that&apos;s not what it sets out to do. Have you ever went on the Disneyland Pirates of the Carribean or Indiana Jones ride where you experience various visual and audio stimulus and it makes you feel as if you are passing through a movie? That&apos;s the best way I can describe Metro, though you feel like you&#x2019;re actually in a movie  navigating the gorgeously grim cinematography, fighting monsters and humans alike, strolling through vibrant pockets of civilization  this paired with some really cool mechanics like having to crank charge your flashlight after extended use, swap out a cracked gas mask, or occasionally wipe blood off it  these all culminate into a very memorable experience that is a welcome breath of fresh air from the achievement-laden, progression-fueled games of today; Metro on the other hand, focuses its attention on storytelling through its gritty realism and quick-pacing. I&apos;m not a huge FPS fan, but I couldn&#x2019;t help but love this game, I blasted through it in a bit over a day!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3363718">Expand</a></span>

Great story and atmosphere, looks incredible (comparable to Crysis 3 but runs about 100 x better on PC). Well worth the money you put down on and I enjoyed this more then Bioshock Infinite which is a testamant to the games overriding quality.</span>

Not because it may give me nightmares, but because I feel restless after completing such an amazing journey. My mind is racing, trying to comprehend how a game can be this good. I&apos;m absolutely blown away by every aspect of Metro Last Light. It is more than just a PC game, it is a work of art and a piece of humanity, no less. I loved Metro 2033, I was really looking forward to this game, and more of the same would be perfectly fine by me. However, everything got turned up to 11 in Last Light from 2033. With great polish and presentation it is such a better game than 2033. The world is completely realized with much attention to detail, it is easy to get lost in it for hours. Every corner of the world, every character feel so alive, almost like there is a soul behind it all. The story is excellent, the touch of Dmitry Glukhovsky is clear. It always keeps you curious about what is next. Where does this lead and how will it unfold, I just could not get enough of it. The brute reality of war and the paranormal subconscious of Metro are fused together. Many characters are introduced and very well developed. I enjoyed to learn more about Artyom and understand him. Khan is at his best. There is so little time for Artyom and Anna together, but the attachment created is so strong. I only wish we could find out more about Ulman and Miller. The gameplay is smooth and satisfying. No matter if you want to clear your way with lead or stay in shadows. The introduced take-downs are varied enough and are effective. The pacing is unpredictable to say the least, but somehow it fits perfectly. The game is about 15 hours, depending on how you play. It feels complete, but I wish it would go on for more. The weapons feel much better and there is more than before. New guns are great and fit in the world of Metro. The customization is just right as well, and guns behavior does depend heavily on how you set them up. Throwing knifes are much easier to use now, but I did not mind them in 2033 either. I personally welcome the limit on number of guns you can take with now. Human AI is not bad at all. I just wish they would actually search the area instead of standing in one spot and wondering if they seen anything. Monster/Mutant AI is excellent however. Here and there it even seems like tactics are involved. Fighting for survival gets extremely tense and I love it. Last, but not the least are the graphics and art style. I have never seen a game so beautiful. Its hard to not just stop and stare, simply amazing! The immersion is endless. I ended up with 380+ screenshots by end of the game. The lighting, texture, character models, animations, etc. Everything is top notch quality. The optimization though is not really there. However, the game runs smooth maxed on two 7870s LE with the latest patch. 30-80 FPS, quite a variance indeed. As far is art style goes, the whole game is a masterpiece. Whichever way you look, its like you are in art gallery. To sum it up, Metro Last Light is a superb shooter, stealth, adventure or simply, it is orgasmic. I always ask myself a question about every great FPS since 2005: Is this game better than Half Life 2? By the end of Metro Last Light I could surely say for the first time ever, YES! Bioshock Infinite came so close, but Metro has done it for me, finally. I applaud and bow to 4A, Dmitry Glukhovsky and Deep Silver. Buy this game, you will never regret it </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=3168864">Expand</a></span>
