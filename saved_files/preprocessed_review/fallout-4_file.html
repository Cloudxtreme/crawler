Like many, I&apos;ve enjoyed previous Fallout games (a little too much) so here&apos;s the review I thought I&apos;d never write. Please consider user reviews before making this (expensive) purchase people, there&apos;s quite a lot critics just don&apos;t touch on. I only wish I&apos;d read some before throwing money at this game, as it turns out, the only fool is me. Let&apos;s get this on the road. (Lengthy read ahead)
<br>
<br>Over the better part of a decade, a whole crop of great, immersive open-world RPG&apos;s have been released. The sheer amount of depth, immersion, gameplay and graphics quality of quite a few of them is impressive - we&apos;re no longer forced to make great consessions in favor of a superior RPG experience. (The Witcher 3 hammers that point home for sure) Which is why I was so sure that the previous &quot;King of the Hill&quot; of immersive RPG&apos;s would positively outdo itself in its newest itineration, as well as retain all the great stuff that fans of roleplaying games have come to expect from it. I thought it would be the postapocalyptic pendent to Witcher 3, turns out it&apos;s the postapocalyptic version of Far Cry - minus some of the entertaining characters.
<br>Well, nevermind all that - after having played Fallout 4 I&apos;d be happy if it was so much as a carbon copy of Fallout 3 or New Vegas, truth be told it&apos;s not even in the ballpark on that front.
<br>
<br>So, let&apos;s get to the meat of it. What could possibly cause a game that came out close to a decade after Fallout 3 to be a vastly inferior roleplaying game? For starters, ask yourself what *you* expect from a game when you buy an open-world RPG. An exciting, intricately woven main story that keeps you on your toes? A slew of immersive and emotionally involving side quests with many characters outside the beaten track of the main story to keep you invested and playing all day? Wanting to sleep but you can&apos;t, because you have that last emotionally involving questline hammering in your head? A feeling that the world is populated with interesting characters with a unique backstory? Not knowing what you&apos;ll find beyond that next hill? The hard decisions? The diplomacy, the player choice? The freedom? The feeling that your choices in-game matter?
<br>
<br>Well, if the answer to any of this was &quot;yes&quot;, then skip Fallout 4. None of  that is present in the game. (I&apos;m not going to go into the slew of bugs, the disappointing graphics, the horrid character animations, the watered down perks, etc. That&apos;s been said before and I&apos;d like to focus on why FO4 is a dismal RPG experience.)
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re wondering why, after 15 hours of play, the world already feels devoid of people to talk to, interesting story lines and never generates an adequate sense of population (minus the shooting gallery of ferals, raiders and super mutants ofcourse) then the answer is --- because this is unfortunately what Fallout 4 is. It hands you a main storyline which, apart from being hammy and badly-written, is predictable and quite the F03 story copypasta. (Searching for a family member), the side quests are MMO-style fetch or kill quests, given to you by the same clone-stamp NPC&apos;s that hand you the same dialogue over and over with no backstory or immersion whatsoever.
<br>
<br>&quot;But there&apos;s still the exploring!&quot; You scream. Well, think about it this way. If you *know* ahead of time you&apos;ll either find a group of raiders or ferals or supermutants behind the next hill, what&apos;s the reason for wondering what&apos;s there in the first place? - You already know. You won&apos;t find any hidden interesting factions, pockets of people hidden away that give immersive quests or anything of the sort. You won&apos;t be asking yourself what painful, meaningful decisions you may be forced to make next - because there aren&apos;t any in this game. This &quot;knowing&quot; kills the fun of exploration the previous games had IMO. (Unless you treated the world as nothing but a loot chest with accompanying shooting gallery, in which case you may enjoy this - but even then only to a degree, and if loot is your main prio, so many more games centered around that have you well and truly covered.)
<br>
<br>I was stoked to hear they added relationships to the game. Like everything else remotely RPG in this game though, this too is a sick, outdated joke. You can &quot;flirt&quot; yet not a single frame of animation indicates you&apos;re actually in a relationship. Not one hug or kiss. Companions don&apos;t generally react any differently to you even at max affinity. You can&apos;t sleep in the same bed as your supposed &quot;lover&quot; at night. (Error message &quot;this bed is being used&quot; - yeah, by my supposed &quot;lover&quot;...) The relationship feels nonexistent to the degree i&apos;m wondering why they bothered with the mechanic at all.
<br>
<br>In every way shape and form, this game underdelivers on the RPG element and overdoes it on the &quot;stoof 2 shoot&quot; motif. If you haven&apos;t played previous installments, do yourself a favour and give this one a miss in favour of modded versions of previous games. You&apos;ll get a far more rewarding package all the way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6084926">Expand</a></span>

<br>The shooting mechanics are awful. VATS, on the other hand, will carry you throughout the game and make firefights too easy. As for fire fighting, there&apos;s too much of it (and fetch quests... but it&apos;s usually &apos;kill everybody and fetch X quests&apos;). Crafting is bland as there&apos;s very little reason to not use the single best MOD for each slot (the fact there is a BEST mod for each slot is enough for you to realize there&apos;s very little choice involved). Perks are awful and uninspired. Narrative is linear and there&apos;s very little you can do to change it - meaning there is very little (or rather, NONE) roleplaying going on, as the outcome to every quest is the same.
<br>
<br>Overall, a horrible game that might keep you interested for 20 hours or so. It&apos;s BORING. Somehow Bethesda is making WORSE games with each new title. I don&apos;t think Oblivion is the best game in the world - it had its fair share of issues - but the questlines were some of the most interesting I&apos;d seen in a long time (even more interesting than the quests in Morrowind, honestly). Skyrim was an ACTION RPG with interesting mechanics, but HORRIBLE story telling and awful quests. Fallout 3 was somewhat bad, but New Vegas made a good impression on me.
<br>
<br>Fallout 4 is AWFUL. Seriously, I wish I could take my money back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6059663">Expand</a></span>

The writing, dialog, and character build is so simple and dull. Just run around and kill stuff. I wish Obsidian would get to make a real Fallout game.</span>

Its hard to call this game, a Fallout game. Bethesda completely removed all the elements that Fallout Fans loved. The biggest element that Bethesda removed was choice. Literally you can make zero  game changing choices in this game. Remember in the past Fallouts when all the little side quests actually affected the ending of the game or the side quest would affect the main quest. Well that&apos;s gone. To some up Fallout 4, Its just one big disappointment</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6019086">Expand</a></span>

Yes the guns are boring, yes the quests are boring, yes the main quest line is a generic cut and paste job, yes the dialogue wheel is a terrible idea that spoils the game, and no you aren&apos;t crazy you should feel ripped off. I waited years for this game. Fallout 3 alone I must have logged nearly 750 hours if not more. I was stuck on that game for literally 2 years enjoying every moment of it. I bought it for every platform I owned over the years. Fallout: NV was nearly the same. But, fallout 4 I put 150 hour (at least 20 of which I&apos;m sure was me texting/being afk), and just moved on to other games. It was boring, tedious, survival mode is just bullet sponge mode, and the rpg elements have been so stripped down so a  smart lemur could figure it out.
<br>
<br>I honestly believe that Bethesda was much more worried about having Fallout sell in mass quantities, which is perfectly fine, but to do this instead of making a great game they made the game play &quot;streamlined.&quot; With dialogue that was easier to choice, gun play that fells more like battlefield or cod, and most of all releasing it before the bomb cost became too much. The latter is most apparent not by the insane amount of glitches (which is almost Bethesda&apos;s trademark), and more to do with poor animations, a weak variety of location, guns, quest types, etc..., characters you don&apos;t care about, and writing that is cringe worthy.
<br>
<br>In short If you haven&apos;t bought it wait for the game of the year to drop to 20 bucks then buy it. If you already have bought it sorry for your lose of $60 I feel your pain.
<br>
<br>On a different note I would like to get on my soapbox for the next few sentences. Nearly 90% of reviews I see positive and negative alike say something to the effect of &quot;the modded community will fix [fill in thing that Bethesda should have fix or included before release].&quot; My reason for bring this up is to ask is it right of us to expect unpaid people to fix a shoddy game made by studio that made millions in sales of a product that personally I feel is not really complete or up to par.  I believe that it is not fair to except modders to fix salaried developers short comings. Unfortunately Bethesda doesn&apos;t care they their made money and the modding community will fix the garbage textures, etc.. because they care, its their hobby, or they are passionate about fixing issues they see in the game. But, personally I do not feel comfortable with that and you should take a second to question if you are too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6071037">Expand</a></span>

With dialogue and effect that would be thouught out by a 6-year old. The story is bad. No immersion to the world.
<br>
<br>All in all, it&apos;s a shooter for the COD fanboy, set in a wasteland. Nothing to do with the original series anymore. Plus, quests have degraded to a MMO standard.
<br>
<br>An absolutely horrible game by a funding/quality standard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6028233">Expand</a></span>

With its very poorly implemented settlement system, and it&apos;s vast array of technical and graphical issues, most of which Bethesda has yet to acknowledge much less address, the game failed to even come close to the high bar established by Fallout 3.
<br>
<br>I have never been bored with any Fallout game until now, I found the storyline to be pale, non immersive, repetitive and poorly written.  The companions and their storylines were also mediocre and I ended up leaving them farming or defending somewhere...   To me, the only companion, except Dogmeat, which which I was able to form any sort of bond with was...umm...well, I guess there weren&apos;t any.  The much touted graphics simply were not that good, and certainly not in the same league as DA: Inquisition or Witcher 3.
<br>
<br>Fallout 4 seems more like a game that was pushed out the door before it was ready.  There is a rough, poorly crafted and unfinished feel about the game that I haven&apos;t before in the entire Fallout universe.  That coupled with Bethesda&apos;s insistence on putting it on the much hated Steam platform makes this my least favorite of all of the Fallout games.  Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, and its heavy metal game music as opposed to the 30s - 50s genre of the rest of the series, was my least favorite Fallout game until now.
<br>
<br>I have finished my first playthrough, and I am not even remotely interested in going through the game for a second playthrough;  F03 and Vegas I have played and replayed for years now.  In all honesty, F04 will probably end up relegated to Walmart&apos;s bargain game bin, it&apos;s just that poorly done.  Truthfully, I am surprised that there is such a disparity between the critic and user ratings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5941923">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>due to my love for (actual) rpg&apos;s (of which, there are very few)  i have to label this slop of a game as my most disappointing game ever.  fallout 3, as a new-gen starter left great impressions, despite, its casual inclusions.  newvegas remedied so much of the casual, stupefied, dumbnumb of fallout 3 that i thought skyrim would, obviously, be the best rpg to date.  lol.  beth proved that a more casual, stupefied, accessible game is NEVER beyond reach.  (LUCKILY, the very INHERENT nature of tes games allows the decline of rpg mechanics and gameplay to be masked and LIED about.  ie. skyrims a great game, but, for true rpg gamers its a joke.)
<br>
<br>fallout 4 is a technical mess.  a creative mess.  a coherent mess.  a mechanical gameplay mess.
<br>
<br>i&apos;ve argued since oblivion that i will NEVER again put tes/beth games on my auto-buy list.
<br>
<br>with fallout 4, i now put beth on my DO NOT BUY until they pluckin prove it to me list.
<br>
<br>how far they have fallen...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6099961">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only redeeming aspect is the settlement &quot;rebuild the world&quot; idea, unfortunately that part is not good enough to make fallout IV a game to remember. Some low cost indie game do a better job at it, in my opinion.
<br>
<br>You can play it of course,, if you don&apos;t have anything better to do, it&apos;s an AAA title, a game that can swallow a bunch of hours of time. But this is not a game that i recomand.

The story is beyond wretched, being shallow and pedantic, offering the playing no insight or even enjoyment. The big surprise during the game was so insulting I went on a murderous rampage which only served to illustrate how little the players actions actually drive anything since no one in the Institute seemed to care that I had just blown their leader&apos;s head off with a Gauss Rifle.
<br>
<br>Any and all RPG elements have been stripped away leaving a bare bones PERK chart that does not allow for any kind of character customization beyond what kind of pants are you going to wear.
<br>
<br>Side quests are the same rehash of shot all the mutants and raiders, find some random piece of fluff and pound sand.
<br>
<br>And while this is easily the nicest looking Fallout game, with excellent use of colour and weather effects, the character models can&apos;t seem to work their mouths properly.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s hard to believe this repetitive, shooter mess has come from Bethesda, the same company that brought us Morrowind&apos;s completely player driven experience and seemingly endless night sky. Bethesda seems to have made Fallout 4 as streamlined as possible and in so doing has alienated the Fallout audience.
<br>
<br>&quot;Disappointing&quot; sums up Fallout 4, with the only worth while addition being a deep and involved crafting system. I rather like crafting systems especially in post-apocalyptic settings. But the crafting and base building of Fallout 4 belong in a better game, plain and simple.
<br>
<br>Fallout 4 is too simple to appeal to any Role-Playing game enthusiast, it&apos;s combat is too clumsy and awkward to appeal to shooting fans and the story is too **** to appeal to anyone!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5903316">Expand</a></span>

I had hopes, because somehow I did like Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but this just doesn&apos;t work for me. I looked up a few old fallout videos, and instantly remembered, why they were great. The feeling of progress, hubs filled with good quests, fighting with a lot of strategy ...
<br>
<br>It does start engaging, but looses consistently until I just couldn&apos;t endure it anymore, feeling crushed by how much (50-66%?) still was unexplored. And why should I explore? To kill another pack of raiders or super mutants, clean out some thrashed buildings and gain hundreds of tons of useless stuff? I had some fun building up my first settlement, building defenses, housing etc. Until I realized, doing so is just a great waste of time. Even with dozens of turrets, walls etc. they can&apos;t fight for themselves at all. If a settlement is attacked and you don&apos;t show up, everything is lost. So, what for?
<br>
<br>The story isn&apos;t motivating, it just dissolves somehow. The parties you can join are boring. Most of the character&apos;s you meet are boring. The quests aren&apos;t interesting or meaningful. Skill system isn&apos;t fun or meaningful. Game looks bland. It can be modded, and needs a lot of it, but that doesn&apos;t help on the long run, if the design is broken. It&apos;s their best voice acting and dialog system to date, but in it&apos;s core it has nothing of fun to offer. What a waste of potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6128280">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is a pretty ocean 1 inch deep. Its a shame that people think that this is a RPG.
<br>Only thing worth mentioning is the crafting system.
<br>
<br>The so called &quot;professional&quot; critics give this game 95 points because they are on Bethesda&apos;s payroll.
<br>It makes me sad to see where the gaming industry is going.
<br>Tod Howard does it again.</span>

Your choices don&apos;t make a bit of difference because the 4 choices you get all do the same thing, and you only get to choose between 2 endings. There is no good or evil because your character can only be good. The story line and characters are so boring and forgettable I fell asleep several times while playing. The entire wasteland is made up of almost nothing but generic raiders who&apos;s sole purpose in life is to raid these struggling settlements on the other side of the map rather than just scavenge through local buildings for easily available loot.. The weapons modding and settlement building are cool I guess, but I don&apos;t really understand how a weapons and armor made from scrap found around the wasteland can have unlimited durability yet a military grade suite of armor needs to constantly be repaired. They took out factions, speech checks, persuasion, armor and weapons durability, karma, and the ability to choose several different endings. I can see now why Bethesda didn&apos;t want any leaked footage getting out before launch day, people would have cancelled their pre-orders and never bought the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5934337">Expand</a></span>

They have gutted the franchise of everything that made it great in the first place; fun RPG mechanics that allow for many different types of character builds; morally ambiguous choices that impact the game world and story; and writing that is equally dark, comedic and original. In place of those qualities they have left an empty, Fallout shaped shell.
<br>
<br>The writing is horrible and riddled with cliches and tropes. There is basically no reason to even pretend that this is an RPG anymore rather than merely an open-world shooter. The narrative is completely linear and accepts very little input from the player. The mechanics, while enjoyable as merely an action game, have no relation to the character-building depth that is supposed to be associated with RPGs, especially considering that your character is a blank slate.
<br>
<br>The graphics are not on par with what is technologically feasible at this time. It is one of the worst looking games to come out this year.
<br>
<br>All in all, Bethesda has succeeded in making a game that is nearly perfect in its mediocrity. They have shown themselves to be careless and faithless stewards of the Fallout franchise and have shown a complete lack of respect for its fans. At this point, Fallout has been reduced to the creative level of Call of Duty and can be expected to come out every once in a while as barely improved iterations of the same mediocre formula, just because people will buy it and not for the love of game development or the IP itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5891432">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Shoddy performance
<br>- Same bugs as Skyrim. It&apos;s nice to know these idiots are learning from past games...oh wait...
<br>- 7 years waiting for this junk? What a joke. This game could have easily come out 4 years ago.
<br>- Far too easy. Within an hour you have power armour and have killed a Deathclaw. Within 3 hours I had killed a legendary deathclaw and got my hands on a Fatboy.
<br>- Still walled/loading screen separated towns. GTA doesn&apos;t need them so why the **** does this shoddy game?
<br>
<br>- No actual choice. Again, this game isn&apos;t fit for 2015. Unlike every other rpg out there this game still gives you no choice on how you want to play it. You have to be the good guy and go down the linear storyline. It&apos;s horribly dated.
<br>

It&apos;s not that it&apos;s a bad game, it was fun, I did play 130 hours. but it wasn&apos;t what I was expecting. I liked, the branching  story paths, unpredictability and the ability to solve problems without violence, that the previous games had.  None of which are found in this one. While the new weapon mods system is great, as Is the new power armor system, everything else falls short. And a lot of things made no sense. After a battle fought in power armor parts had to be fixed since a grenade fell nearby. Understandable, but if you fight the same battle in raider armor made from junk you never need to fix it. Weapons also never break, weaken or jam, even those made from plumbing supplies and driftwood. Which oddly enough describes half the guns in this game. The build system lacks physics making it possible to build bases that hover in the air. And they have a crippling parts count limit that seems pretty arbitrary.
<br>
<br>The game is small both in size and density. There are 3 towns with voiced characters. everywhere else is populated by raiders. Skyrim had 9 believably large cities and several more towns. all with voiced characters and many side quests New Vegas had at least 7. Even fallout 3 had 4 such locations. Most fallout 4 side quests use repetitive dialogue, especially the minutemen ones. And nearly all consist of Nothing more than, going somewhere and killing or fetching something. gone too is the humor these quests brought in previous titles.
<br>
<br>the story relies on a series of twilight zone style twists. Which of course are no fun the next time. Dialogue options are limited and you don&apos;t actually know what your own character is going to say. Perks have no effect on dialogue at all and neither does the special.
<br>
<br>The background given to your character if they are male is that there a war veteran, while if your female you&apos;re a lawyer, and yet the story progresses exactly the same. Despite most of it involving killing people. Come on since she is voiced and a Lawyer; I expected her to be a little upset after killing somebody the first time, but... nope. She didn&apos;t even react to facing a Deathclaw, which also happens in the first 20 min. Why they didn&apos;t Just have whoever YOU choose be the ex soldier, I don&apos;t know, It would have made more sense. Especially since you get your first power armor within the first 20 minutes, and know how to work it, something a lawyer turned housewife should not know how to do.
<br>
<br>The largest gripe of all I had is in nearly every quest nothing you do matters. You can talk somebody out of killing a person, only to have their partner do it anyway, with the dialogue after being identical. No choice you make in a quest has any repercussions later. In fact there is no karma system, or even a bounty system like Skyrim. You can walk into town, kill 5 guards come back a few days later and they&apos;re back to cracking jokes about your armor. In general the game doesn&apos;t really let you be evil, no mater how many people you kill or what quest options you choose, folks will treat you as their savior. No hidden faction or missions are revealed for your misdeeds, unlike the previous fallout&apos;s or Skyrim.
<br>
<br>Unlike New Vegas, you can&apos;t broker alliances between factions. Worst of all No matter who you side with, you get the same end missions.  Many of which share animations, scenes and objectives. followed by the same monologue and montage after. Despite having radically different agendas all factions resort to the same exact methods. Making every choice you thought you made meaningless. Which is why I agree with many others in saying that this Is an FPS game. Not even a particularly good one.
<br>
<br>On top of all this it lacks polish. Despite my I7 nvidia gtx 970 and 32gb of ram letting me average 60 fps, on one helicopter gunner mission it always drops to 12 fps.

<br>
<br>expect to hear the phrase &quot;I normally don&apos;t like RPGs, but I really like this one&quot;, as it is a FPS (Boaderlands is a close comparison) with weak RPG elements, almost all choice and story striped out to cram in more go to radiant location kill everyone get radiant item, repeat
<br>
<br>and as is common with Large AAA games expect the ending to be very unpolished and half arsed (suffice to say all the paths to the end are more or less copy and past, and the path you take is akin to pressing one of three buttons), the further you go expect conversations to end half way through, bosses to spawn where they are not supposed to, and lots of sitting (or shooting) for X amount of time until the story wants to progress
<br>
<br>your seance of agency is pretty much zero
<br>
<br>and three months after release there has been one minor patch, leaving many bugs (including game backbreaking ones such removing from the game world your companions or Quest NPCs, Ending Quest Conversation Prematurely, or a peak you get early on thats supposed to give 20% increase to headshoot chance...gives 2000% pretty much eliminating any difficulty, only way to get rid of is to restart or use command codes)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6038890">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The main story is a fart. When I was through, an NPC said something along the line of &quot;finally, we have defeated this threat&quot;. I honestly didn&apos;t know why the faction I defeated was a threat at all. The story was ridiculous at best; brain damaging at worst. I often thought &quot;how stupid is this?&quot; and never got involved emotionally.
<br>
<br>The focus on crafting and building settlements is even a bigger fart. You can build tons of settlements navigating through a terrible interface. But then, there&apos;s no effect on the story or the wasteland. Once again: ridiculous at best, brain damaging at worst.
<br>
<br>The animations are **** I often turned around to not have to see the terrible animations, e.g. of the journalist that you meet. Graphics are otherwise OK, but not astonishing.
<br>
<br>I already mentioned it in connection with crafting: user interface is **** than **** Nothing more to say.
<br>
<br>Quests are **** farts, literally all of them. Yes, that&apos;s right: all of them! Kill X, kill Y, bring me Z, kill X, bring me Y, find X, kill Y. Be careful, this is brain damaging and an insult to intelligence.
<br>
<br>I could continue but I won&apos;t. I played the game for 15 hours and that&apos;ll be it.
<br>
<br>Buy it once it&apos;s at 5 Euros if you really want it. It may not even be worth this much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6217874">Expand</a></span>

I spent a couple hours picking up highly recommended mods.  After getting everything running nicely, I was absolutely shocked when comparing the modded FNV experience with FO4.
<br>
<br>Modded FNV has:
<br>-Better textures
<br>-Better performance in fps
<br>-Better character faces and facial animations
<br>-Better weapon textures AND a huge variety of weapons
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s only considering the aesthetic improvements, the massive amount of additional modded content notwithstanding.  I am frankly shocked that a AAA development studio is unable to meet or exceed the development quality of mods made by unpaid community modders in a game using the same engine.  I can only guess that a priority on console development is why the PC offering is so poor in comparison.
<br>
<br>I would have been able to overlook the technical ineptitude of the game if there were anything resembling the soul of Fallout still present.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, the essence of Fallout has always been choice and flexibility in how to resolve problems.  In previous Fallout titles, everything from a total pacifist run to wholesale murder of nearly everyone were viable ways to play the game, with potential alternate routes depending on skill checks and your character&apos;s inclinations.  Fallout 4 gives us improved gunplay, but has stripped out the ability to make meaningful decisions about how to resolve problems, as nearly every quest can only be resolved by going in and shooting up the place.
<br>
<br>The voiced protagonist contributes to this straitjacketing.  This is a design decision that does not work within a sandbox RPG.  Games like Mass Effect worked better with a voiced protagonist because the story and setting were more focused and the base character more developed.  The dialogue was also more consistently written and voice-acted-- I have no desire to do another playthrough to hear the female voice actor, but the male voice actor at least was inconsistent in the tone and style of his delivery to the point of totally breaking immersion.
<br>
<br>The writing quality and pacing was bad.  Your character wakes up a subjective 15 minutes after having breakfast with his family to a post-apocalytpic wasteland, and rather than giving us any reflection on the massive future shock and dislocation the character would surely be feeling, we&apos;re picking up power armor and a minigun and killing a deathclaw within an hour.  I thought the power armor and minigun were fine as a teaser for things to come, since you don&apos;t have fusion cores and ammo readily available in the early game, but it would have been nice to have even a cursory nod toward having the character understand what the hell happened to the world around him.
<br>
<br>The main storyline serves to introduce the player to the main factions present in the Commonwealth.  However, at a crucial juncture, the lack of choice in resolving conflict undermines the story, as the player is locked into wholesale slaughter of all the competing factions, with no chance for diplomacy or double-dealing.  Most or all of the factions aren&apos;t really in diametric opposition, so this turn in the story feels incredibly forced, and like the writers just ran out of steam.  The ending was so abrupt and underwhelming that I literally had to use Google to confirm that I really had seen the ending.
<br>
<br>The choice to implement random-style loot on legendary enemies and to tie equipment modding to junk scavenging are mildly interesting at first, but dissolve into tedium quickly due to the uselessness of most of the legendary affixes, and the hours of scouring forgettable locations for junk.  It would be generous to call the settlement features half-finished.  I don&apos;t get where the demand for Minecraft/Sims-style crossover gameplay was coming from-- it doesn&apos;t appeal to me in a role-playing title but that still doesn&apos;t excuse Bethesda&apos;s half-baked implementation.
<br>
<br>Bethesda chose to strip out the soul of Fallout games in favor of making a generic shooter that combines shooter, RPG, and builder elements, but does none of them very well.  They&apos;ve gone from a &quot;must-buy&quot; development studio to one that I will approach with heavy skepticism in the future, and wait on user reviews for an accurate representation of the game since it seems the professional reviewers have little integrity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5957988">Expand</a></span>

<br>- no character development (both numbers and role-playing)
<br>- linear (aka absolutely no choice and consequence) and cliche story (bad writing, terrible VO)
<br>- no alternatives to... shooting things
<br>- autodialogue with yes/yes/sarcastic(yes)/no(yes) options
<br>- UI and M&amp;KB support
<br>- bugs, crashes, low performance
<br>- immortal NPCs
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not sure what this game is. I know it&apos;s not a RPG. A shooter? Metro is a better shooter with similar setting, at least highest difficulty means realism, not HP pool bloat. Town sim? Minecraft? Rage?
<br>
<br>All in all... 3/10
<br>People will probably find it fun and casual shooter. For me it&apos;s just too... boring and underdeveloped.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5797859">Expand</a></span>

But its very clear that Betesda doesn&apos;t give a **** about the franchise, or the fans and are catering to casual gamers.  if you want an RPG experience, go back and play modded skyrim, fallout 1,2,3, or wasteland 2.  IF you want a good dystropian shooter, play metro 2033 and last light. This feels like the worst of both worlds.

<br>Also the graphics looks several years old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5773257">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And let&#xB4;s talk about the performance. Is really bad for his dated graphics. You can play it well but don&#xB4;t expect a constant 60 fps even with a decent machine.

The old attribute / skill / perk system (which worked fine) has been completely ruined, forcing you to basically choose between a role-playing build that sucks at combat or a character who excels at combat but has no flavor. Previous Fallout entries balanced combat with roleplaying but Fallout 4 feels like a combat game with roleplaying aspects thrown in as an afterthought. Half of the perks are useless, and then half of the remaining useful perks have boring stat affects that hardly bend the rules of the game. Lets talk weapons. Do you like energy weapons? Do you like pistols? Well, too bad, because in Fallout 4 it is all about boring rifles you can find in countless other games. You are given more pistols (and energy weapons) in the first couple of hours of New Vegas than you are in the entirety of Fallout 4, which uses &quot;weapon customization&quot; to try to hide its complete lack of weapon diversity. Armor suffers from a lack of diversity as well, but Power Armor does not make up for that a little bit. Maybe if the devs spent less time on a useless settlement crafting gimmick they could have focused on what actually matters in a Fallout title. The heart of roleplaying is making choices and completing interesting quests. Fallout 4 offers very little choices. Your character is a helpful good guy. There is nothing you can do to change that. So lets talk quests. Half of the &quot;quests&quot; are radiant / fetch quests that fall into the category of go here, kill everything, get this one thing, bring it back. Past this the interesting quests that give you many different paths to reach a solution are few and far between. If you compare the number of side quests in Fallout 4 to other Fallout games its pathetic. You know how being able to persuade people was actually useful in New Vegas and Fallout 3? Yeah, well forget about that here. I rarely came across any opportunities to persuade other NPCs, and the few ones I did come across revolved around asking for more caps for completing quests. What happened to the quests that you could solve without violence? Not to mention, interacting with other NPCs is extremely awkward. Its hard to tell when you have initiated dialogue, the animations are strange, the fact that your character speaks is terrible, etc. And companions? Utterly retarded. They will rush into combat when you are sneaking. They will run right over traps you are carefully trying to defuse. They won&apos;t be able to find their way out of a room with one exit. Its embarrassing and frustrating. The only memorable character in the entire game I found was Nic Valentine. So the quests and character interactions are a complete bust, but I was hoping it would at least be interesting to explore the map. How wrong I was. So many locations obviously had very little thought put into them, and the fact that I was forced to clear out the same locations multiple times in order to complete quests grew tiring. Ever heard the phrase &quot;wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle&quot; ? Well it absolutely applies to this game. It baffles me also how Fallout 4 saw all the great changes Fallout New Vegas made and COMPLETELY IGNORED THEM! No ammo crafting. No reputations with factions. No making speech ACTUALLY USEFUL. And on top of that they don&apos;t fix what was wrong with previous Fallout games (the bugs, loading times, clunky combat, etc.) I won&apos;t be purchasing Fallout 5 if the same team is responsible. Fallout 4 may be a decent game, but it is an absolutely atrocious Fallout game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6292363">Expand</a></span>

But what we have now? Ok, I won&apos;t say about Fallout 3 and New Vegas, it&apos;s not bad at all. We are talking about Fallout 4. I am really disappointed. What happens with dialogues? I feel like a stupid, when I&apos;m try to choose the answer. It&apos;s same, only intonation changes. And where is atmosphere? I only start a game and I already have power armor and minigun. And people call me a &quot;general&quot;. What about the construction of the buildings? Forget physical science. You can build in the air! Where is the logic? Most of all I hate main plot. It&apos;s horrible. It&apos;s like a cheap and snotty novel. And I don&apos;t know, but I have a feeling of deja vu. No, really? How many years have passed since Fallout 3? And the only thing you did just replaced children and parents. And now motherfather save the child. Huh? Santa Barbara. Why Bethesda doesn&apos;t use plot from canceled game Fallout Extreme? I find it very cool! And much more gorgeous. Just google it. Why reinvent the wheel, when you already have one? Just imagine how Fallout looked like! Travel the world to stop chinese army! Visit Pacific Northwest, Bering Strait, Northeast Asia and China. See? It&apos;s open world. A big one. And an interesting one. You can see Fallout World from the other side. But it&apos;s only a dreams.

Role play system has also failed, special is not special anymore if you know what I mean. Smart, ironic, funny dialogs that made previous Fallout games unique turned into stupid and simple phrases, it seems that Bethesda finds users not smart enough to understand more than 2 words on the screen. I&apos;ve finished the game and I have no wish to play it anymore.

This game really feels like bioshock infinite, no what I am saying it&apos;s bioshock infinite for 80%, 20% its Far Cry-  a sandbox fps. there&apos;s only few dialogue options with so-called &apos;&apos;residents&apos;&apos;, there&apos;s no attachment felt to the people you encounter. The only thing that can save this game is the Creation kit and hundreds of talented modders. And the ctitics score of 10 out of 10?

Honestly dont know what the developer was thinking but i gave up on this game after 8 hours. Doesn&apos;t get any better but if your IQ is below 50 and you like a third person Halo game then by all means.

<br>Also I want to note lag of dialogues in the Russian version when some characters speak.

Without this the developers didn&apos;t have any incentive to add very many evil actions. Even choosing the be rude option in dialogue nets the same response half the time. Second is the redo of the perk system. Because you can potentially unlock any first level of a perk, they made most of them combat oriented, but unnecessary. Since there are no skills, there are very little ways perks play into missions. Finally the dialogue system is just confusing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5834787">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It is 2015. Why can&apos;t we have games that actually actually BELONG on next gen consoles. The textures and animations are laughable garbage. My friend tried to tell me that it&apos;s in the art style of Fallout 3. LOL Why would you want to make that game look **** on purpose? At least Fallout 3 PASSED as a PS3 game then.
<br>
<br>They never really fixed the issues that 3 and New Vegas had either. The shooting is awkward as **** can&apos;t aim at anything and the vats system is about 3x worse, Interface and the Pip-Boy system is still confusing, the Open world may be interesting, but after about 2 hours of play it&apos;s hard to progress when you don&apos;t have the necessary equipment. The characters are still bland and lifeless. The bad animations were passable in the 2 previous games, but not they just look awkward and unlifelike.
<br>
<br>The new things are awful too. They added a dog! ...So has Call Of Duty! WHO CARES! Your character can speak now? That wouldn&apos;t have done anything in the first place. Codsdick can say my name which is cool  but also unnecessary. It&apos;s cool to see how the world got ****ed but other than that the story is **** The soundtrack, although fantastic, is the same as Fallout 3 which is lazy on a lot of aspects.
<br>
<br>The saddest thing is that people LIKE this game. Bethesda needs to step their game up and people need to see through the hype and nostalgia and see why this game is the Watch Dogs of 2015.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5772141">Expand</a></span>

The voice acting is terrible, maybe because of the writing, but it&apos;s emotionless, NOT engaging and extremely shallow. The NPCs you meet are lifeless. The dialog wheel is horrible. The base building is nothing short of bonkers, should have been done via an overview-type UI, the current one is just a mindless minecraft wanna-be feeling, and it simply takes too long to do simple things. And the general UI, dear actual old man in the sky, it is poor and NOT intuitive. The shooting is mediocre, but it could be a lot worse. The music is actually pretty decent, captures a good atmosphere, but they manage to spoil any potential in it due to the lack of engagement from the story and characters in it. The protagonist, despite what he goes through at the start of the game makes me feel NOTHING for him. The start of the game greatly misuses the setup. A setup that should have taken way more time as to allow for the player to build some empathy with the involved parties, but alas it just assumes that because of what happens surely the player MUST empathize. Guess what, I don&apos;t in the slightest. It&apos;s frankly the worst AAA game I&apos;ve played this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5843269">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gunplay is by far the best between the three first person shooter fallouts but that&apos;s about the only good thing I can say about it. Everyone already talked about how poorly the game looks, the animations, as well as the performance so I won&apos;t bother too much with it. But I just gotta say that there are dozens of games out there that are much bigger and detailed than this one that manage to run much better on most machines. Hell just look at all this year&apos;s releases if you want proof, this just feels like lazy optimization in the developers part.  My gtx 770 could max out MGS5 and play at a stable 60fps at all times, the witcher 3 made it struggle to maintain 50fps on high but at least that game had detail and was much better looking than this one making it excusable. This one runs at 60 on high but dips to the 40s for no real reason constantly.I don&apos;t even want to know what this runs and looks like on consoles.
<br>
<br>The story and characters are mediocre at best with it getting worse as you progress, whether you got spoiled or not. It also has that god awful speech wheel that is only there because your character is now voiced and they had to limit your freedom on what you could or could not say. The Special system is now meaningless since upgrading it is a joke unlike literally every game before it, where putting a point was a struggle and an achievement at the same time. Remember going to the BoS base in FO1 and getting that machine to give you a point in a stat if you had the right drive for it? Or that Hubologist in San Francisco or NCR that had a chance to give you luck or decrease it depending on your luck in FO2? How about 3 and NV where you had to sacrifice a perk to get one stat point up? It wasn&apos;t as bad as sacrificing a perk in the first 2 games since you got perks every 3 levels but still it was a sacrifice, here its just &quot;lol put a point more on it&quot; . Skills are not even skills. This game was just poor decisions all around
<br>
<br>Also for PC this port hot garbage with the UI taken straight out of the console version, don&apos;t get me wrong even in the context of a console it looks like a mess but its even worse when you have a PC that could use a more sleeker menu. If you really want to play this game and like wasting money like me then wait for UI mods to fix it.
<br>
<br>The main reason I gave this a 5 and not something lower is because shooting stuff and looting stuff while 60s music plays in the background is still fun, but honestly there are better options for that everywhere. Overall the whole time I&apos;ve played this game the only thing I could think of is man, I really wish I was playing 3 or NV right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5672051">Expand</a></span>

Out of all the big AAA game releases this year, Fallout 4 spits in the face of its own hype. The across the board glitches, late PS2/early PS3 textures, and the dull storyline clearly indicate that this &apos;game&apos; did not spend enough time in the oven.  It is my contention that Bethesda released this disaster with full expectation of a horde of modders descending on it to fix its many and gratuitous faults. (Hooray, for the modders...Boo for Bethesda for using you as a resource for free labor).
<br>
<br>In the wake of The Witcher 3 and yes, even GTA V this can&apos;t be the &quot;masterpiece&apos; that Bethesda wanted to gift the gaming world. The fact that the major review sites can even give it such high scores has permanently damaged my opinion of their objectivity and increased my possibly paranoid belief in a behind the scenes payola scheme.
<br>
<br>Avoid this at all costs... or at least until the talented modders have transformed it into the game it SHOULD be a year from now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5794480">Expand</a></span>

It definitely deserves all the negative reviews especially the ones about graphics. I couldn&apos;t stand all those ugly textures and prosaic RPG elements, and removed the game after the first chapter. Don&apos;t waste your time, go get some real RPG and play it. A total disappointment from Bethesda, the developer of a legend like Skyrim.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6042730">Expand</a></span>

<br>To all fans of the Fallout series, stay away, this is not the game we were waiting for, as someone who played hundred of hours in New Vegas i was very disappointed: the RPG elements have been completely stripped to make room for the FPS centric, this game has been streamlined in order to appeal to the mass of casual players and has basically become a (mediocre) linear story driven open world shooter, sure there are good things in it and it&apos;s not a terrible game, quite the opposite it&apos;s enjoyable for the first hours, but don&apos;t think you can play it over and over and still find it amusing like past FO games trust me.
<br>It&apos;s pointless to list everything that is wrong here, just go look at the user score reviews, if so many people complains about the same things be sure that there is a valid reason behind.
<br>P.S. I&apos;m giving it such a low score to compensate to all the fanboys 10/10 and balance the score overall i think it would be a 6-7/10 game but i would rate it 5 because of the name it bears and how over hyped it was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5841405">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dialogues are dumbed down, as well as the whole dialogue system. Weapons don&apos;t malfunction anymore. Main story line?

It is a dull, high spec&apos;d low quality, unimaginative rpg where you are shoe horned into a broad story of one individual.  Dual uninspired dialogue and choices, the most you will get out of this game is using it as a walking simulator and mass murder simulator.  It is incredibly non optimized, a strewn mish mash of key bindings that make no sense compared to the previous games that worked far better, and a UI in past games that worked far better, but they now have a horrid GUI.
<br>
<br>Fallout 4 is the Oblivion of Morrowind if Morrowind was FO3/NV, they completely missed the mark and made a console game for casuals in this generation.  Terrible tacked on building and mod simulator to make money off the crop of recent titles.  They just didn&apos;t put the heart and feelings of the past games in this, it isn&apos;t there, there is no nostalgia to lean upon, go play FO3 and NV and mod them like mad.  Mods and dlc cannot save FO4.
<br>
<br>We can only hope they go back to the pure roots and get a developer that actually loves Fallout that in FO5 in 4 years no talking protagonist, more branching storylines, and nothing fancy to hype.  Back to skills, back to actual roleplaying, back to an actual working UI, back to something made specifically for PC gamers.  Graphics might just be the one semi decent thing it has going for it despite what most say, and that is all imo.  It however still deserves a zero for bringing out such vitriol I had after 20 hours of play that I had to spend a day to calm down and play games I actually like, such as FO3 and Payday2 (which I don&apos;t agree with certain things such as micro transactions) but I play it because I enjoy it, and I do not in anyway as of this moment like FO4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5694532">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Dumbed down Mass Effect lookalike dialog system (the &quot;Sarcastic&quot; option deserves an additional mention as choosing this option can cause unpredictable results)
<br>- Character progression has also been dumbed down,
<br>- Poor enemy and NPC AI.
<br>- Story writing is probably the worst one of all of Bethesda&apos;s games.
<br>- All the bugs you can or cannot handle.
<br>
<br>All in all it sits somewhere between F:3 and F:NV and after seeing what a HUGE improvement Skyrim was over Oblivion as well as the fantastic marketing campaign for F:4 I expected this to be the much sought improvement as well. Instead it is overall barely a slightly better F:3 (a 2008 game!!!). By today&apos;s standards it is a failure.

<br>
<br>Seriously, please play the game, make a list of everything good and bad and construct a score out of it. Just as an example, if you compare the graphics of Fallout 4 with the graphics of any game released in the last two years, how can it have a higher score than 50% in that aspect?
<br>
<br>Or how can it have a high score in storytelling, atmosphere or anything close to it if you compare it to Witcher 3? Where is the relation between your scores?
<br>
<br>Please tell me HOW can you get scores around 90% for a game if anyone that is not blind AND deaf can see that it is very sub par in at least 3 categories? (input devices, graphics, stability... even if you disregard storytelling and whatever else is wrong with the game.)
<br>
<br>Oh well. I will never believe any review done by &quot;expert&quot; critiquers ever again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5773293">Expand</a></span>

Skills were removed, perks have been stripped down and combined, advanced perks have no consequences, and you can level into an abomination thanks to the removal of the level cap. The biggest problem is that despite the weapons you can customize, and the endings you work towards, everything just feels too samey.
<br>
<br>The absent karma system is secondary to the forced plot and meaningless quests. You will say things in dialogue that you may hate thanks to the brief and absolutely retarded options provided on your dialogue wheel. The tone of your character and the choice of words are abysmal and unexpected blah blah blah, heres the real reason why I rated this game a 0:
<br>
<br>In the opening of New Vegas, someone shot me with a smug face and took my parcel. I wake up angry wanting revenge, while at the same time being curious about the item I was meant to deliver. I sneak critical exploded the head of the tutorial lady mid-tutorial, then mass murdered everyone in tutorial town. I enjoyed that. A little afterwards I  started to feel bad so I restarted the game and ended up destroying the town again, but this time with the aid of a faction looking to take over the town. Then I entered the base of this evil faction and started wiping out everyone with a sniper rifle from one of  their watchtowers.  Afterwards I found a plasma gun and really liked how it looked and shot, so I started choosing perks related to robotics, plasma and laser weapons. When I reached the character who shot you, whom you may or may not want to get revenge on in the game, there are so many ways to take care of him that I ended up reloading and retrying countless times. I ended up tricking him into a personal meeting at his apartment bar where I shot his personalized gun out of his hand, equipped it, shot his head making him stagger, and then switched to my axe, and ferociously wailed at his leg at lightning speed without vats thanks to the insane perks for melee weapons Obsidian thought out, then as he staggered again, I threw a grenade and ducked behind the counter as body parts flew everywhere... ahhhh what fun, and the joke is that the main story just begins to advance at this point after countless hours of amazing well thoughtout quests you go through before reaching Vegas itself. By the end of New Vegas, I had aided, destroyed, tricked, and robbed several factions, and ended quests how I saw fit. I had all the perks that stack damage and criticals attributed to laser and plasma weapons, in combination with the plasma and laser explosion perk, which made the last quarter of the game and DLCs a firework show of exploding cazadors and deathclaws! The credits summarized the monstrosity of my actions and I closed the game eager to start a new character who was well mannered and liked to sneak around with a powerfist and silenced weapons.
<br>
<br>In Fallout 4, you go to tutorial town and said no to helping them,  but you ended up forcefully helping them anyway. You reloaded, and tried to kill tutorial black guy, sorry not allowed. The one and only reason for this, is because this game exists to give non-fallout players a taste of everything that Bethesda thinks makes a fallout game right at the tutorial- power armor, deathclaw, and gattling gun-. The purpose behind this reason, is to profit accordingly from the albino gamer who only understands 2 words with the additional dull expectation of some kind of dumb plot (which needs to be forced if albinos are expected to notice it ) that will act as a medium for those 2 words: &quot;gun&quot; and &quot;kill&quot;.  Too bad this was at the cost of simply producing a good Fallout game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5822444">Expand</a></span>

The things that make Fallout what it is have been removed from this game. This is not a Role Playing Game, this is an open world shooter. You do not play a role, you are a designed character. The game has completely lost it&apos;s immersion and the world feels cold and empty, it is impossible to forget you are playing a game. The worlds of Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim felt like they were alive, the characters had wants and needs, they had worries, they had motives, I cared about their stories and was able to base my further decisions in the game on those stories and those lives that felt like they really were being affected. The characters in Fallout 4 are a joke, they never feel authentic, though that may be due to the fact that Bethesda took away ALL decision making in this game. There is no choice in dialogue, just different ways of saying the same thing, seriously, your responses do not change anything, at all, ever. There is no weapon repair, there is no skills, SPECIAL doesn&apos;t matter, the closest RPG element is the fact that you level up and get &quot;perks&quot; (just stat increases, not really perks). You, of course, cannot play a &quot;role&quot; as there is no decision making or different between your character and everyone else for the most part., you cannot role play in this game. I could go on and on, but I&apos;ve been clear, this is not Fallout as you would expect a sequel, this is an open world shooter that takes place in the Fallout world, but this game should not be Fallout 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5848507">Expand</a></span>

In Fallout 4 however the game appears to be about nothing more than capping enemies in the head with an assortment of different weapons.
<br>
<br>The design of the game has gone from being a game which tells a story. To simply a game about playing a game. Fifteen minutes after leaving the Vault butt-naked with nothing but a blue jumper suit and a pistol to your name, you will acquire a suit of high tech Power armor along with a Minigun to go along with it. Twenty minutes into the game you will be destroying some of the most powerful enemies in Fallout lore, the dreaded Deathclaw government experimented super soldier.
<br>
<br>A few more hours into the game and you will have a mini nuclear rocket launch (The Fatman). An assortment of weapons from machine guns, pistols, sniper rifles, shotguns, auto pistols (list goes on).
<br>
<br>Another hour into the game and you will meet the Elite Brotherhood of Steel, the futuristic faction of super soldiers who guard their high technology secrets furiously. Don&apos;t worry though because they&apos;ll be happy to recruit you into their ranks almost instantly. Thus giving you access to laser weapons and other high tech weapons. The recon leader of the Brotherhood is even nice enough to give you his prized possession, his legendary laser rifle. Yes he will give his most prized weapon to some random wastelander he met just ten minutes ago.
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s Fallout 4 for you. It doesn&apos;t even attempt to make any sense. It has no character progression because your character will go from zero to hero before you even get ten percent into the game. And the games world is not a wasteland. It&apos;s just a game world which looks like a wasteland and has a bunch of loot thrown into it so that the console players can run around capping zombies and raiders without even trying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5680504">Expand</a></span>

Then the game is perfectly tailored for you! Gather old tires, toasters and cup, hit them with a hammer and build a shack out of them! Want some magic with alchemy? No problem! Mix 3 bottles of irradiated water and it&apos;s safe to drink now! Miracles! If you really love pictures instead of numbers, dialogues that don&apos;t strain your brain cells and you are brave enough to gaze into the uncanny valley of horrible Fallout 4 faces, you&apos;ll love the game.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, if you enjoyed Fallout 1 and Fallout 2, loved story told in both of these games, interesting characters, tactical combat and immersion in a post-apocalyptic world, you have nothing to do here. The game should be called Minecraft 2: Call of Duty and Fallout, because that&apos;s the feeling you&apos;re get.
<br>
<br>You all got fooled by pre-release hype. You loved the game because of trailers it showed you. There will still be thousands of people who will be thrilled about the game and will have hard time deciding between Minecraft and Fallout 4. Unfortunately, if you are not entertained by collecting all the junk in the wasteland, this game is not for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5687237">Expand</a></span>

Thus in turn I have to give it a low effort score for its many bugs low quality dialogue sequences, sub par story telling and some of the most obvious plot lines in video game history. I was really hoping for something great from this one but it seems its all hype from Bethesda once again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5669141">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Let&apos;s &apos;try&apos; to do this from the start.
<br>You play a guy with military training who goes into cryo, or a women with household chores training (completely ignoring the complete survival chance disparity in the husband/wife). You then have to go look for your infant son. You, like a complete idiot, still think your son is a newborn despite the fact that you quite obviously exit cyro-stasis at very different times.
<br>
<br>You then are then ham-fisted a dog from the get go (like, hey guys, dogs are cool right?) as well as having a bunch of other immortal god companions who spend the entire fight on their ass. You can only play one character - concerned daddy. I mean, concerned daddy can either be chill about finding his son and be polite, or be slightly abrupt and annoyed about finding his son. But at the end of the day, you&apos;re not choosing who you want to be; the game has already done that for you. You&apos;re roleplaying exactly what Bethesda wants.
<br>
<br>Fort building is a joke. The NPC&apos;s will literally steal your power armour and make it impossible for you to recover (exo-suits can&apos;t be taken off corpses, just the armour) straight from your fort. That&apos;s right, settlers know how to use power armour. Guess training ain&apos;t needed, huh? Placement is regularly buggy and fussy, and whilst you can scrap all sorts of **** and that&apos;s cool and all, you can&apos;t level out the ground you&apos;re building on which just leads to the realistic &apos;build space&apos; being where the game sodding well lets you. 3-4 slots in the first one and a couple in one or two others. Oh, and the house you build for yourself? Gonna get invaded by settlers.
<br>
<br>You&apos;re once again ham-fisted the role of brotherhood knight, oh, and you&apos;re also the general of the minutemen! After about 3 minutes outta the vault.
<br>
<br>Sidequests are literally MMO tier - go here, kill raiders, come back, get reward.
<br>
<br>Optimisation is &apos;eh&apos; at best, and your FPS will get annihilated in the city.
<br>
<br>Difficulty seems to vary to ridiculous degrees with some areas seemingly levelling with you and others being preset.
<br>
<br>The weapon customisation is cool, but the quantity of skills and components required just for say.. a shotgun stock is ridiculous and will take a huge amount of levels.
<br>
<br>The looting gets ridiculous too when you see names like &quot;Tactical compensated heavy stocked automatic suppressed bayoneted laser rifle&quot; and after a while, all these mods mean nothing, it just turns into another slog fest of putting round after round into some up-levelled raider&apos;s skull, desperately hoping the fight will end.
<br>
<br>Radiation actually matters now which is nice. But no radiation sickness. (wat)
<br>
<br>Power armour is a cool rethink. Shame it completely ****s all over the lore.
<br>
<br>Romance companions? What like say &quot;I thunk we should be more than fronds&quot; &quot;oki, we are  lol&quot;
<br>
<br>Just generally being ham-fisted with companions. Stop it, stop.
<br>
<br>Seriously, am I not allowed my own house? I know I&apos;ve said it, but when I build my own house I don&apos;t want it invaded by a brahmin caravan that blocks the doorway.
<br>
<br>No more skills, just a ****ty rethink of the perk system simply leads to a game where you don&apos;t get a stronger character, the game just keeps asking you to play it FPS style and occasionally pick up a new weapon.
<br>
<br>Honestly the most disappointing starting vault ever.
<br>10 people in cryo and some staff that died after a year. Absolutely tiny too.
<br>
<br>Simply put, this isn&apos;t an rpg anymore. This is like if they stole Mass Effect&apos;s dialogue wheel, made a huge mess out of it, and removed any last semblance of an RPG.
<br>
<br>Well, back to Fallout 1-3 + Vegas, guess that&apos;s where the franchise ended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5683424">Expand</a></span>

I cant belive someone can work on something for years and then deliver something like that. Yet again we have unfinished product, and now we have to wait that famous &quot;first week patch&quot; to work out so many problems. A lot of people say how this is based on consoles and I must agree, because that brings money, at least in the heads of this &quot;hard working people&quot;. Everything becomes fake these days, they spend milions of dollars to advertising the crap. You cant, you just cant go to reduction of game, because that dosent match your master consoles plan. PC today is virtually unlimited, and what we have? Those consoles are made from pc core, and if someone lose pc players that is their unconditional fall. I mean in 2015 we have loading screen for entering the building? When you speak to the people in the game it all feels stretch, even the story isnt something. The game feels out of date, because of smart reducttion of people behind this game. Yes you can build your own settlement, you can craft some most generic weapons I ever see, just dosent seems right. A lot of people say it is a Sykrim, but without dragos, yea, sykrim also had his own reductions for the same reasons, and that game was out 2011, and now what year is it? After 4 years, you deliver the same? Something is fron with game industry, and we need gaming revolution, every game become like sport, non of few changes, another year on cover and voila you have a BRAND NEW game.

<br>
<br>Only PROS: It actually runs on day-one, unlike other games (*cough* Batman: Arkham Knight *cough*)
<br>
<br>Here are the MAIN problems briefly:
<br>
<br>-Graphics out of a 2000&apos;s game. Sometimes they are so badly done they look cartoonish, like Telltale&apos;s Walking Dead/Wolf Among Us.
<br>-Nice that everything is voiced, however you are limited to 4 answers per dialogue including the classic (Witty, Kind, Evil, No ty) - How innovative!
<br>-You basically get the Power Armor 15 minutes into the game, taking any challenge out of it.
<br>-No real Survival theme. More like a First Person Shooter
<br>-The towns are tiny. Even the supposingly &quot;Jewel&quot; of the game, the big, main settlement - Diamond City, is as small as Dawnstar in Skyrim...and feels like its been rushed - like a copy-paste of megaton from Fallout 3.
<br>-Still use the same weird &quot;hacking&quot; of computer terminals in which you have to guess 4-5 times and then wait to try again.
<br>-Skill not high enough? Forget trying. Unlike Skyrim in which you could ATTEMPT to break a Master lock (even with level 1 lockpicking), in Fallout 4 you simply are locked from doing so if you don&apos;t have the appropriate perk unlocked.
<br>
<br>-Dialogues are plain childish - no imagination or creative thinking behind them.
<br>-Story is boring and uninteresting. Nothing that makes me want to investigate and find out what is going on (bad graphics add to that).
<br>-On dialogues, now you can fully be in 3rd person and look around. However, the camera goes nuts and shows blank walls, or it fully zooms on NPC&apos;s hair, etc.
<br>
<br>-Holstered weapons dissapear - nothing at your sides.
<br>-Enemies get stuck, jump around, run in T-pose. Quest NPCs bug and roam to places unknown, making quests unable to complete.
<br>
<br>-No RPG soul in it. More like an FPS like CoD.
<br>-Landscapes are simply bad. Nothing breath-taking like Skyrim - hell, I could just sit in front of a river and watch the scenery in Skyrim!
<br>-Wax museum character models - although character creation looks dope, the poor graphic quality and the same base, copy-pasted face for NPCs ruins it all.
<br>ALSO: Bethesda didn&apos;t even bother changing the hand meshes. Play Male or Female character, your hands use the same (male) model. I played 10 minutes on my female character accidentally this morning, and I realized it when I went 3rd person that I play a female. The hands textures are the same FOR CHRIST SAKE.
<br>
<br>-You need three hands to play (REALLY? WASD, MOUSE, AND ARROWS? SERIOUSLY BETHESDA?)
<br>-Keyboard keys are hardcoded, for example you can&apos;t switch the F-key back to 1st/3rd person like it was in Skyrim - forcing you to use &quot;V&quot;
<br>
<br>More, but it&apos;s adding to the inevitable: Let&apos;s hope that the modding community can fix this mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5688600">Expand</a></span>

<br>Honesty, Bethesda is much more interested in streamlining the game to widen their audience that they lost me. If you told me back in 1997 that this is what Fallout would become I&apos;d be dumb-founded. With each sequel a game should add more content with each iteration. But because we have to appeal to the mainstream casual audience now we have to remove a lot of the features that made this series great because it&apos;ll be to difficult for the masses. Very disappointed that it&apos;s come to this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5703200">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I don&apos;t even want to start talking about quests, characters and story. Other people have already said it multiple times. This is an emotionless piece of concrete that feels way outdated. When you look at other games which came 2014-2015 you see castles, mansions and cute huts. When you look at F4, you see dirty shack with holes in walls and rain coming through the ceiling.

None of the good features Obsiadian made in Vegas made it to F4. Lack of  hardcore mode is the most disappointing which turns survival postapo game into dull shooter. I dont care mods will change this. Im reviewing the game Bethesda made, not community.
<br>
<br>I will not comment about graphics, that was never part of fallout and I dont mind 64x64px texture being used on bobby pin as well as 5x10m big billboard although it does make your eyes hurt.
<br>
<br>Lack of skills is surprise. If you dont have certain perk, you wont even have chance to try to pick a lock. Game simply doesnt allow you to use it.  I&apos;d love to hear Todd Howards speech how less RPG elements actually enhance RPG genere ;)
<br>SPECIAL is plain pointless and it only affects your hitpoints, action points and carry capacity. Charisma and intelligence are dump stats. Yes, intelligence 1 lets you use same dialogue options and hack computers like a pro. So much for Fallout 1, 2 where intelligence 1 made you a total retard and you couldnt even talk to intelligent people. You simply didnt understand what they are saying. No such cases here in F4.
<br>
<br>Conversations are limited to 4 dialogue options. I liked voice narration, however some players who are role playing might not like it. It makes you feel less connected with hero. Feels like you are just observing someone, doesnt make you feel its you.
<br>
<br>I couldnt help myslef but for the whole time, I had immersion Im playing idSofts RAGE.
<br>
<br>Whie its good the shooting mechanics is better, they fixed combat but completely ignored RPG part of the game. Fallout 4 is as much RPG as Borderlands is. You have generic character pretty much 40% of players will have and you chose perks from simple tree. Its a first/3rd person action shooter. I wouldnt be surprised if there was autoheal.
<br>
<br>You can choose to be good or bad. Thats about it. In both cases, you are supposed to kill everything you meet. Conversations, barter, sneak, etc simply wont allow you to progress without killing everything.
<br>For more violent players, it also doesnt feel like RPG. You can use every weapon you pick, no more specialization in energy weapons or conventional firearms. This also implies the feel its a shooter. Whatever gun you find, you can use it. Weapon quality degradation is out, no more hunting for spare parts to fix them.
<br>
<br>I didnt bother with the Minecraft or Tower defense part of the game, as I simply think its completely out of topic and has no placein RPG games. Imagine having solitaire minigame in Need for Speed for instance ;)
<br>
<br>All in all, Fallout 4 is mediocre first person shooter in open world with inventory. RPG wise its disaster.
<br>F1 and F2 fans will absolutely hate it. F3 fans will not like it for even more dunped down RPG elements. (unless they played F3 as shooter as well.)
<br>
<br>Call of Duty and Doom fans will feel right at home though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5671598">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m even more impressed that they are still so salty that Fallout New Vegas added so many good features, that they chose to actually OMIT them instead. (Faction reputation is a big one, multiple choice, survival mode)
<br>
<br>This is a complete 360 degrees from Fallout New Vegas. Let&apos;s start with the big bear in the room - dialogue and writing in general. Somewhere out there is a nice interview stating that giving the player a varied choice of dialogue in fallout 3 didn&apos;t allow them to tell a story quite like they wanted. You know what the problem is? A role-playing game isn&apos;t about being told a story, it is about making your OWN story. Especially in one like Fallout. All this talk from Todd Howard bout how player freedom remains their number one goal, yet they cuddle you through the whole story. (Which only has two endings, and considering the outcomes, seems a little extreme) So now here&apos;s the problem - Bethesda had YEARS to do this. Compare this to Obsidian who wrote for New Vegas, and it&apos;s absolutely asinine and no Bethesda excuse can really justify this. New Vegas allowed you to kill whoever you want, side with whoever you want (within reason since the BoS clearly couldn&apos;t take hoover dam) and be whatever player you want. You want to be a psychotic killer and murder everybody and become a slaver? You bet buddy. Dialogue was varied and rich. The story and world also made sense. There was little, if anything, in New Vegas that really seemed out of place in the world. The world felt alive, connected, reasonable. It also broke away from the post apoc trend and explored the &quot;post post&quot; apocalyptic theme (which is what Fallout intended to be). I figured that maybe Bethesda would realize why so many people enjoyed New Vegas and blend it with elements of what people enjoyed out of 3. Instead, they took a complete 360. Cut away player choice in story, made your protagonist voiced, don&apos;t let you kill just ANYBODY, and slap you on the wrist for it. It also relies on an RPG SIN which is telling you to care about a thing and gives you no reason other than &quot;well it&apos;s the best choice!&quot; Now don&apos;t get me wrong - obviously we want to progress through the story because it&apos;s a **** game. But the whole story relies on the FIND YOUR SON thing up until you find him. The story is so heavily dependent on it that the game does little to convince you about what&apos;s right and wrong in the game. That&apos;s boring. That&apos;s awful and lazy writing. There is literally no excuse for a game that has been in the works for allegedly 6 years when another publisher did it it better in far less time.
<br>
<br>Another weakness of FO4 - rather than making everything a moral grey area with exceptions (like it should be in a world of people just trying to survive), it does the GOOD GUY BAD GUY thing again. It&apos;s again just plain lazy. That doesn&apos;t mean everything has to be subjective, but it severely sacrifices player choice.
<br>
<br>So now let&apos;s talk about gameplay. One step forward, but two steps backwards. The gunplay is the best yet. Apart from a few quirks and weird scaling issues, every weapon feels like it can be useful with some mods. Customization is fun, rewarding, and adds much needed depth.. If there is one thing Fallout 4 gets right, it is this. If the previous bit had been in check, this easily could have made me ignore the other flaws. I&apos;m excited to see where PC modding (you know, assuming we DON&apos;T get paid mods) takes this system. The settlement thing can be fun as well, if not a little more time consuming than I wish.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s the two steps back part - it does away with the classic leveling system and &quot;Skyrimfies&quot; it. You can more or less become a God and get everything you want. 10 in all SPECIAL, etc. The previous system was nice because you got a nifty perk AND level up a stat. FO4&apos;s perks just seem less varied, and you either get a niche perk OR something useful. I&apos;m not saying the previous system was great, but since you can basically get every single perk that is remotely useful, really detracts from the multiple playthrough thing. It&apos;s not a HUGE complaint, but it was clear the audience they were going for (as if it wasn&apos;t clear enough) was the Skyrim audience. People who want max everything and to just dick around.
<br>Another note is scaling is just piss awful. You can get some of the best **** way too early in the game. (Power armor makes no sense)
<br>
<br>Overall - is Fallout 4 a bad game? No. It has strengths. The problem is that everything else is just so mediocre. I legitimately went into FO4 thinking &quot;well there is no way they made it worse&quot; and yet somehow, against ALL odds, 6 years, and such a large budget, they found away. Beth painted a canvas full of things to explore and instead they wasted it by not capitalizing on the Synths concept. Overall, a bad sign of what&apos;s to come since Beth clearly only cares about capitalizing on profit.

Bethesda has finally realized how bad they are at making RPG&apos;s so they go all-out with this post-apocalyptic Far Cry. Skyrim with guns? Ha, you wish. At least in Skyrim you had the desire to find out something interesting despite the **** design. In Fallout 4, your desire to vomit stops you even from laughing at the bland characters, HORRIBLE writing, crappy voice-overs, dumbed down systems and retarded AI.
<br>
<br>Everything in this game is a step down from New Vegas and even Fallout 3 and Skyrim. Gone are the Fallout skills systems, reactivity and robust dialogue. They way Bethesda bastardized such an important core of Fallout is just baffling to me.
<br>
<br>Bethesda has never known how to properly write their games, and Fallout 4 is the ultimate testament to this. The new dialogue wheel is simply atrocious and I don&apos;t even want to guess how much ganja was consumed when the storyline was written. The opening is the ultimate cringe, even by Bethesda&apos;s standards. Main quest doesn&apos;t matter ? Guess neither do characters, side quests and dialogue. Because they are all garbage too.
<br>
<br>So, the legendary Bethesda performance? As expected, the game runs like **** and I&apos;ve encountered more bugs than I care to list. Modders are going to have to work triple shifts to make this console port even semi-playable.
<br>I don&apos;t even care about the graphics that much, sure they are quite lame considering it&apos;s 2015 but art direction is actually alright at times. The lighting makes for some moody environments and gunplay actually feels improved but I am kinda past caring at this point.
<br>
<br>Bethesda, you sure never change. You won&apos;t even bother to improve the biggest shortcomings and bugs of your previous games. But hey, it&apos;s okay when Bethesda does it because their bugs are &quot;heheheh so funny&quot;.

Removal of skills, simplified/cringe-worthy dialogue, no innovation in freedom of choice, uninteresting NPC&apos;s and quests, and an incredibly linear story line. The only decent thing about this &apos;Fallout&quot; is the customization and gunfights-- everything else is a large letdown. I waited 7 long-ass years to play this game, and when I saw the trailer footage for the first time, tears of joy came to my eyes; thanks Todd for a 60$ disappointment. Never pre-ordering a Bethesda game again, fml.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5763807">Expand</a></span>
