Its a very basic shooter in terms of weapons but the real art of the game comes in the 0 G combat arenas. Graphically great, concept great, just enough game modes to keep me occupied, Wish there were slightly more elaborate levels and wpns to add little more depth to the game.</span>

As for the single weapon loadout - while it doesn&apos;t match most FPS games where your holding 10 different ones - it is rather realistic for the setting. You&apos;re already in a cumbersome space suit so handling weapons in zero g wouldn&apos;t be feasible. The single multi-functional weapon makes a great deal more sense. The gun isn&apos;t stuck on full auto either, in all the matches I&apos;ve played so far in the game players prefer doing burst fire for accuracy rather than hold down the mouse everytime they want to shoot something. I did like the three grenade types that are linked to the rifle - ICE MPR EMP - as they add some interesting tactics to the mix. Fire and EMP onto a point to disable and detach players from the ground then toss in an MPR to throw them clear of the point still disabled. One thing I wish was covered a bit better would be that you can hold the button to &apos;charge&apos; the grenades so to speak to detonate at longer distances, most new players just tab the button and so they go off within 10m. One thing I have been amazed to see is that Futuremark has been wonderful in talking daily with their playerbase and running a Beta &apos;Arconauts&apos; program to test out their free DLC&apos;s before release. There have been a few patches so far that include almost 90% player&apos;s ideas &amp; issues from the game. Voice support will be added in the next patch so that should help those coming from other FPS titles where that is standard - I know I myself was thrown off by the chat only communication. I would rate the game a 9/10 as its well done and is doing something unique rather than following the age old formulas for an FPS title; however, the dedication they have to their community and actually taking and implementing user feedback makes this game a perfect 10/10 in my eyes. If they keep at it all the problems and missing components will be fixed and the game will be quite wonderful to play both competitively and casually.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=741891">Expand</a></span>

If you enjoyed games like Counter Strike and Team Fortress, then this is really a game you should pick up.

The controls are extremely simple to learn, unless you are a hardcore fps gamer that plays 8 hours a day. I personally think that having only 1 gun is magic. Having lots of guns and mods can be totally daunting and there are certain combinations that are extremely overpowered(Im looking at YOU, CoD MW2.) Having only 4 maps is a slight dis-advantage, but after playing for a couple hours, just flip upside down and it is a whole new map! I enjoy the game having such high requirments. Basically everyones computer dosn&apos;t suck and there is minimal lag. I also like to just somtimes stop, and look out into space, the graphics are amazing. Plus if you have any suggestions, they have an open, active forum you can post on. If Futuremark studios just opened some modding options, it would complete the game for me. This title is extremely original and innovative. I would say a must own if your computer can play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=744195">Expand</a></span>

Some criticize the game&apos;s lack of content (including maps). While understanding the frustration of a CS player to have only 4 maps too chose for, you must play to realize that a 3D 6DOF map has nothing to do with a classic 3D 4DOF map : The possibilities are huge! After a month playing on the same 4 maps, I discover every day new routes or cool spots. Game&apos;s intense shadows contrasts and silent mode add another additional dimension to gameplay: stealth and that makes the map more complicated. Furthermore, additional content will be offered free to the community I give 10 to this game because it brings into play all that I ever dreamed with a perfect realization. Finally something new in the world of FPS !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=741965">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not your normal FPS and there are a LOT of things you will have to rethink, like not holding W to go forward as you can be stealthy and drift. The freedom of movement and looking makes for a interesting experience too, and, you guessed it, more learning. But don&apos;t let the originality stop you from getting this game, it really is great. Also, on a side note, Futuremark Games has the best support in the gaming industry HANDS DOWN! Just go look through the forums and you will see how active the devs are in answering questions and releasing updates to satisfy requests.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=740171">Expand</a></span>

With free roam over the entire area rather than just walking on the ground as any usual FPS, you get far more ability to evade, snipe and just whoop some spatial but. I think knowing how skilled some people are, given a few days of game play to get used to the controls I think some people will find it quite the challenging and testing experience to play. Perfect for people who do NOT want to be babied into having things so simple a 2 years old could play them. Develop skills and use them... Prove how good you really are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=741232">Expand</a></span>

The extra dimension gives you alot more flexibility when planning a strategy, and the graphics are awesome. It breaks the mold when it comes to strategy, but feels like all other fps innovations (and some basics) that have happened over the years were thrown out the window. I like how theyve made the controls easy to use but hard to master, but this just may be a side-effect of the &apos;full&apos; 3d implementation (ability to move freely on all axes). It was frustrating at first but i finally got used to it. Though i do believe they should add a tips screen or &apos;gasp&apos; some tutorials to make it a bit easier for ppl to grasp. The lack of different classes was kind of refreshing, everybody has the same kit. And choosing what your team needs vs whats fun is not an issue like it can be in some other games. But when the 1 weapon you do have sucks it is a bit disappointing. The weapon is stuck in full auto, except for when you are using the scope, then it fires 10 round bursts. And the scope is lackluster at best (no zoom just a scope). I hope they update this in a later patch. The games lack of any anti-cheat also was an unwelcome occourence. Not that i like programs like punkbuster running all the time (which i dont) but in this case id rather have it be there. This game is still pretty small (only 5-6 servers full last weekend) and its hard to just avoid them. And i have yet to see any server admins to issue the banhammer. Ill give it an 9 for what it is right now, all that it really needs it a bit of polish, and none of the issues are all that great in the scope of things. And id rather support an indie developer with a good idea, than keep throwin money at studios that keep making the same cookie cutter game over and over again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=741637">Expand</a></span>

I liked the idea of it more than actually playing it, so I didn&apos;t play that much.<br><br>Since then, Newmark has continued to add features and refine it. Originally, each astronaut had an assault rifle, grenade launcher, and ice pick. Then they added sniper rifle, SMG, MG, and shotgun. That was great, but I still got my butt kicked every single time. The other multiplayer players were a lot better than me. Playing was more fun, but kind of humiliating.<br><br>One day, I noticed they had added bots to multiplayer servers. These were bots I could actually kill. I could go to an unpopulated bot server and actually play at my level. Recently, late March 2011, they just added single player versus bots for all gametypes. This is great because now I can practice on my own without repetitive death syndrome (RDS) kicking in.<br><br>FPS in three dimensions is kind of a new thing. It takes getting used to. The ability to groom with single player is great. The only reason I have not given this a ten is because full keymapping is not yet implemented. That is to say that I cannot map certain actions to certain punctuation keys like semi-colon or apostrophe. If you have a more standard preference like WASD, this will not be a problem. However, all mine center around comma and period as left and right strafe, low on the keyboard. Low on the keyboard because I am a Tyrannosaurus Rex and I have tiny arms, you know.<br><br>The game is very sharp-looking. The amount of music is limited, but quite amazing and perfect for the game. I think the theme is very memorable. The levels are okay. I&apos;m not a big fan of the idea of the moon having exploded, but that&apos;s a decent enough excuse for gobs of asteroids and twisted space stations orbiting Earth.<br><br>The rendering of Earth is beautiful and underscores our insignificance in the grand scheme of things. Looking down on our &quot;big blue marble,&quot; we are filled with wonder and the desire for peace for all mankind. It was our nobler qualities that brought us up here to receive this gravely important understanding. But then a command is barked in your ear, and you are reminded of your objective as the enemy closes in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1550442">Expand</a></span>

This is only a team death match game, and it does that extremely well. The recently added single-player mode is a great way to practice your navigation, shooting, and avoidance skills. You&apos;ll need all the practice you can get because this game is all about skill and tactics. You don&apos;t get overpowering space bazookas and area of effect weapons. You have to be able to  aim and you have to be able to do it as you&apos;re drifting in space and turning along three axes. And you need to be aware of your environment because the enemy can sneak up on you from any direction, including above or below you, and there are plenty of places where they can hide. It would be interesting to see this game expanded to have more roles, like the usual medics and engineers, or to add things like mines or defensive structures, or lockable doors/gates, etc., but the game is suspenseful and frantic enough that you don&apos;t really miss them when you&apos;re in the fray. The  game is worth having just for the ambiance of the space combat. I don&apos;t know of any other game that gives you this, and the bar is set pretty high for anyone who wants to compete on this level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1941593">Expand</a></span>

My first impression was that Shattered Horizon should have been a Quake or Half-Life mod, and that I would rather be playing a Quake or Half-Life mod.</span>

I would give this trash a negative ZERO, but they just don&apos;t let you rate it that low. Most usually why steam had it on sale!</span>

I had loved the concept, and thought it was one that was long overdue. However, as much as I think they implemented a good system for maneuvering around in zero-g, and the graphics looked good. It suffered from some serious problems. The largest issue was that there are two types of game, a couple variations on control point maps (attack/defend, everyone trying to capture all points) and what is essentially a deathmatch mode. These were really limiting I felt. I thought, that the novelty of the zero-g element was that, something of a novelty. While I thought it was important for someone to execute something like this, I felt it didn&apos;t make for a whole game. It needed something campaign-y or something to prevent it from being run of the mill in other ways. The fact that the game modes are so limited really sort of ruins what is otherwise really excellent. Perhaps with further updates, more game modes, or something genuinely novel in terms of gameplay, something that compliments the neat quality of zero-g and the beautiful vistas in the game (pun not intended), it will turn into a great game. If they ever offer a demo I reccomend trying it, or a free weekend at steam I&apos;d definitely take a look if you have a directx 10 system that can run it. It is relatively inexpensive at 20.00USD, so it&apos;s not too big a bite to buy it, but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll play it that much, even with the beta testers discount I felt as though the money may not have been well spent. It&apos;s fun to play briefly...and lays a groundwork for something really cool. Hopefully the potential will be realized.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=738929">Expand</a></span>

All have pros and cons. Also several new maps have been added, making the tech demo this game released as a coherent, complete game a year later. It works flawlessly on windows vista and 7, any reports of unplayability on 7 should be long since rectified, unless they run outdated drivers. The graphics are rediculously good even by late 2011 standards, completely AAA sound and video, the only thing this game lacks is an online player base. I play in the PST timezone (california) and there is rarely more than one server of players on after 8-9pm. During the day there are some great matches I just wish there were more going on.  They have also added a bot system to make single player practice feasible during multiplayer downtime.  They have varying difficulties and aim pretty well, almost too well, but their static objectives kinda remind you you&apos;re playing alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2004556">Expand</a></span>

While it does take a bit of a learning curve, it&apos;s pretty easy to get the hang of as long as you aren&apos;t lagging graphically. It does take a pretty heavy toll on slightly older cards, but still runs beautifully at maximum settings with newer variants. The small number of maps does make it feel a bit like a demo, but it&apos;s got enough substance there to warrant spending 5 or 10 bucks to get it on sale (It&apos;s been featured several times in Steam&apos;s Christmas and summer sales).<br><br>Overall it isn&apos;t as complex or full-featured as Battlefield or Team Fortress, but it&apos;s still quite nicely done and should bring decent players a lot of casual fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shattered-horizon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1536000">Expand</a></span>
