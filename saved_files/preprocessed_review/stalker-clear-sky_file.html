<br>I had the game in &apos;08, a cracked version. I played for about an hour. I couldn&apos;t play more because of the bugs in the main quest. It&apos;s OK for a game to have bugs, but in main quest? Was CS not tested at all? After the discount in steam (new year sale), i bought the game, hoping to be able to play it this time. And having played the game for 21 hours, it was OK. There were crashes at least two times than SoC, but it was bearable. Being a member of a faction is very fun too, I really wanted that in SoC. Although faction quests and other side quests are very repetitive, I fought for factions for more than 5-6 hours. There is a point in faction wars in which you cannot do anything anymore, but before reaching there, it&apos;s very fun. So far so good, right? Let&apos;s talk about game mechanics. I&apos;m not a very good FPS player but I have a habit that whenever I play an FPS game, I select the hardest difficulty level. But guess what? CS is hard. Really hard. Of four difficulty levels, I selected 4, after playing for 20 minutes at most, I had to change to 3, then 2. But it&apos;s not because I was acting stupid, I always play RPG-like FPS games slowly, have more equipment, better weapons and armor, then go. After the enemies started throwing grenades, I realized that was not my fault. That was the AI. They hit you. Hard. And when they throw a grenade, it lands at most 50 centimeters from your feet. Then boom, quick load. The loading times are much longer than Max Payne 3. I think they should change the loading strategy if you&apos;re loading the same map. Steam tells me I played 21 hours and i think about 1 hour of it is loading. And about storyline. I read some comments about how bad the story is, but I liked it. I don&apos;t want to give spoilers but come on people, the last part was really good (and hard).
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a good game, not as good as SoC but good enough for it&apos;s price (currently $2.5). The AI could have been better, game logic could have been better, side quests could have been more interesting. But still, it&apos;s a S.T.A.L.K.E.R., the essence is still there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=2869082">Expand</a></span>

It is dreadfully slow, the weapons are simply awful, and it is much much more linear. As others have pointed out, you can empty an entire clip into an enemy&apos;s head, and he just stands there, while a grenade can come at you from 1/4 mile away and kill you. Makes ZERO sense.

What used to be an irradiated, gloomy world with a few makeshift safe havens has become a happy partyland with some turf wars. It&apos;s as if the producers said let&apos;s trash our award winning atmosphere and slap a shitty story onto it and we&apos;ll call it a prequel, apparently their old company was right in restricting these guys.</span>

I struggled to bring myself to complete this one. So many bugs, flaws, and poor design. Forget about running the game with dynamic lighting, you&apos;ll get only about 5-10 FPS with that enabled even with a modern PC. The turf war is introduced in the beginning but that is the last you will hear about it as the main storyline is strictly linear with no player choices. Twice during my playthough i came to an unavoidable part where i would lose all of my money. This in effect caused me to be unable to purchase any higher end armor so when i reached the later stage of the game i had poor armor that was basically ineffective. Aimbotting enemies that can see through bushs and brush, and that can land a grenade directly at your feet from 50+ yards ruins the game even further. The map is expansive, but unfortunately it is almost a complete carbon copy from the first game with the exception of 2-3 areas. Weapons degrade faster than a condom and you will often find your gun jamming at the most inopportune times, unable to buy a better weapon or repair your current one because the game decided to rob you of all your cash a few missions earlier. &quot;Friendlies&quot; will randomly become hostile to you for no reason, even ones that are supposed to give you some dialogue, this forces you to reload a previous save again and again until the game decides to act like it is meant to.  The atmosphere is even worse than the first one, there are no scares or exploration, it&apos;s basically just a straight up shooter. Overall it is just a complete disaster of a game that you should avoid at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578231">Expand</a></span>

There are plenty of bugs, but the community patch for 1.504 fixes most of them. Graphics are nice but you need a great rig to run them.</span>

This is simply because everything STALKER was praised for was dropped for a different style. Where as SoC was a lonewolf survival/horror game, Clear Sky makes a poor attempt as some kind of squad based all out shooter. There&apos;s far too many human beings to consider the zone desolate in this one, far too little mutants and and jumpy encounters to consider it survival/horror and both of these combined just rips the atmosphere away from STALKER. While this different game isn&apos;t too bad and worth a play through or too it is definitely a step backwards from the original.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=84466">Expand</a></span>

You literally shoot enemies 3-5 times in the head and they are still alive, it&apos;s absolutely disgraceful. The game has such a great story behind it, but the actual control, feel and design of the game is so bad that you will shut it off immediately. Even after several hours of trying to enjoy it, I simply can&apos;t get over the fact that it&apos;s so repetitive, dull and badly designed that you spend 80% of the time in the game dying and running, even on the lowest difficulty. Avoid buying this game before the developers learn how to script and not sell garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=1716838">Expand</a></span>

Then I tried the faction system, well thats a huge ripoff, it sucks horribly. After around 4h of gaming it got so boring that i decided there had to be something more there, something thats fun to play. Well 15h played and its even more boring.</span>

Please wait a few months while the rest of the public work as the lab rats finding all the bugs and flaws in this poorly tested game before even thinking of buying it and with any luck you may have a better experience of the game than I had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=417374">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately good ideas are brought down by a shoddy execution and bad design - once we leave inital areas of the game turns out about a half of game&apos;s areas are lazy rehashes of SOC maps, story feels flat, game&apos;s still buggy as hell, faction wars are barely working, nights in game were reworked to be darker yet still there&apos;s no option to sleep through them etc. Gameplay feels badly balanced as well, last part of the game is basically one long corridor with tedious and unnecesarily hard battles (enemies are tossing grenades in large numbers with perfect accuracy, INCREDIBLY annoying). All of this makes the game feel rushed and/or half-assed. Shame, because it&apos;s often beautiful and atmospheric like the first one. Well, at least Call of Pripyat is better :&gt;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=741749">Expand</a></span>

Yes the world looks younger and more cleaner, but the only thing that&apos;s changed is the quality of the game. Please just play or re-play the first and confuse yourself trying to understand it, or play this and be disgusted with it after about and hour. 2 for new world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=421796">Expand</a></span>

So let me explain a scenario that enlightens you about the nature of the firefights in this game (half of the game, with the other half being walking). You quick save right before you make your attack on two enemies sitting down beside a campfire back facing you. You shoot one in the head, this makes him decide to stand up. As you shoot him in the head point blank a few more times his friend has started filling you with lead at a rapid rate. After emptying the whole clip into this one guys forehead he may or may not die, but I guarantee you will die from this experience, many times. And you know the great thing about this is? (notice the sarcasm plz) Even though you quick saved with your enemies completely unaware of your presence when you quick load they are alerted, and sometimes not even in the same position! Its ridiculous. You can empty a whole clip from about 100 yrds into a bad guy with single shot firing and not even kill him. Yet somehow they can shoot you from 400 yrds and take half your health each shot. If you want to be frustrated I suggest many other things instead of spending $5 on this game. Here are some suggestions. Buy 2 decks of cards and try to stack them all into a pyramid. Get five ones turned into change and throw it all into a pond that freezes over in the winter, then when it freezes cut a hole in the ice and try to swim to the bottom and collect it all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=742728">Expand</a></span>

The worst aspect of clear sky are the bugs, it took 2 patches before it was even playable and even then constant saving was a must, several quests got broken and I was unable to complete them even though I fulfilled the necessary requirements, luckily none of the main quests broke and I was able to make it through the game on my 3rd attempt, I also excperienced a high number of desktop crashes. I Think the fact that I attempted to play the game through 3 times is testament to some of the game&apos;s better features, it still has the same great atmosphere of the first game and the new areas of the zone are pretty cool, I especially liked the swamps level. The faction war system when it&apos;s working makes for a more dynamic game environment. I like the fact that it&apos;s more difficult to make money as it makes some of the smaller quests more relevant, I also like the fact that artifacts are more difficult to find. All in all I did enjoy this game but it should never have been released in such an unfinnished state, it still manages to knock spots off Far Cry 2 though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=419433">Expand</a></span>

Nearly everything else is inferior to the first, and it makes this game feel like a generic FPS with the RPG necessity to grind for resources. Unless you&apos;re a graphics whore, literally no reason to get this over the original.</span>

Don&apos;t waste your money on this excuse for a game! It is a horrible unplayable mess which breaks some the cardinal rules of games: 1) Long, borgin, unskipable cut scenes. 2) Patches break your save games . 3) Friendly NPCs have infinite mass and push you inside walls when you are trying to take cover, and the only way to get them to stop doing that is to kill them. This game is a terrible masochistic experience which will leave you angry and disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=83803">Expand</a></span>

UI and HUD are very ugly and confusing. Didn&apos;t even know what I was looking at. 3. Random and frequent crashing. No warning, no error messages. Randomly crashes straight to desktop. 4. NPCs are just plain annoying. Combined with their heavily accented voices and constant nagging when you&apos;re near them, it makes for a very frustrating environment. Plus they talk too much. 5. There is no way to skip time. If you hate exploring at night, deal with it. 6. Overall, everything feels cheap and everything is complicated and tedious. This game is similar to Fallout 3 but nowhere near as good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=740539">Expand</a></span>

This game was abosolutely fantastic and had a great potential but an abundance of crashes and errors plagued me. First entering the Garbage made me crash, then after walking around Dark Valley some the game would crash with a consistency of once every minute. Tryed download Complete mod and it made the game not start. Figured out that problem and eventually it started crashing again at Limansk. The upgrade trees for assualt rifles was pretty easy to choose(100%accuracy is much better compared to 100%rate of fire, wasting away your precious bullets). I disliked how Bloodsuckers were made. Invincible while invisible which basically meant you had to wait for it to hit you before you could kill it. But after getting Complete and without crashes for maybe 75% of the single player, made this game fun to the max. Faction system, artifacts weren&apos;t a common thing to find, upgrading your weapons, and a more controled quest system, made this game wonderous and I would have given it a perfect score if it was coded and fixed better then it was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724461">Expand</a></span>

I love too play it. Upgrading your gear, looking for artifacts, joining factions... all that is awesome! but damage system IS TERRIBLE. even accuracy fix didnt help (even made it wors because now enemies never miss). WHAT THE HELL?! I have to hit a guy TEN TIMES using a most powerfull shotgun in the game to kill him?!!/1/1!??!?!/?!ONE!!?/?! Not that I am using shotguns all the times and I cant use any other gun, that was just an example When you hit for example a bandit so he starts to bend or crouch or grab his arm, he is invincible for the time of animation. moreover you have to empty whole clip into his body to kill him. In SoC you had to hit Monolith in Exo-skeleton JUST two times with colt to kill him. here I have to waste 5 clips to make him bleed... I didnt experience any bugs with or without any patches... the game is short... too short, even with all side quests and all that stuff. Story is kinda boring though. For me both those games were made in completly wrong way... it should be a game that has something more to its title that jus a Zone, artifacts nd stlakers. It should be less FPS and more RPG. like sit by the fire and talk to friends... tell them what happened to you today. clean your weapon (all assult rifles and sniper rifles should be removed leaving only shotguns (for hunting) and pistols (for killing yourself or someone else) it should be focused more on artifact finding and LIVING IN/WITH THE ZONE (that is very important) that is what book was about.... that is what game should be about...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=83869">Expand</a></span>

If you are a gun fanatic you will drool over the weapon upgrade system! have 5 of the same gun model that all have a very distinctive and different feels that are used for drastically different situations! The shooter mechanics are brilliant and gunplay is challenging, buy this game if you want to truly experience a post-apocalyptic world, just turn the lights off, the sound up and lose yourself to the zone!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=1801412">Expand</a></span>

I was an avid fan of the first, and I never beat the story (got close, but bugs stopped me). My favorite thing about stalker is that there was a world that almost seemed alive, thanks to their A-Life system. If you liked surviving in the original stalker, clearing out mutant populations, &quot;befriending&quot; random stalkers at small outposts, then I believe you will also be impressed, like I am. I actually like the concept of faction wars, and enjoy the stalkers traveling in squads to take positions. Also, some things were made more believable, like the weapons, they have a more (dare I say) COD4 feeling to them. There are too many things I want to write because I&apos;m so exited by this game, but I dare not speak on them yet when I haven&apos;t played for more then 5 hrs. Get the game, it&apos;s worth it even for the first hour of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=417242">Expand</a></span>

Its a great game and Big Jim has not gotten far if he didn&apos;t find new guns. Old guns will be there, if they didn&apos;t pass a 100 years or something... And, Yea.. stalker is made of mods :P I will buy Far Cry 2, but it will not be the same.</span>

The AI is as bad as everyone says, u can see the AI script in game, u can see how everytime an enemy comes to a possible cover spot he&apos;ll jump right over it no matter what, even if it proves to be more of a disadvantage. You can see how in the pitch black, 100 yds away, through 3 bushes, an enemy will put pinpoint accurate shots into you, with weapons that couldn&apos;t hit hit the broadside of a barn. Sure when our saviors like the Oblivion Lost team come by, we&apos;ll have a pretty sweet game, but that&apos;s tehir work not GSC&apos;s or Deepsilvers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=417435">Expand</a></span>

If you liked Shadow of Chernobyl for the tactical gunplay as well as the atmosphere you will love Clear Sky. It&apos;s a game where using grenades is NOT an option, and often sneaking around back an enemy base while your faction attacks from the front is the only way to punch through a hardened defense. The tension and unease from SOC returns in spades as well here - but it&apos;s definitely not the main emphasis. You simply can&apos;t play this game like Crysis or COD4 and if you go in with that mentality you are going to be reaching for the quickload button often. Weapon modification and repair is a stroke of genius, and it makes the grind of collecting money and artifacts worthwhile. Ripping through army personal with an upgraded slug-throwing pump action shotgun is just a joy to behold. Overall Clear Sky is less of a work of art than Shadow of Chernobyl and puts more emphasis on survival than horror but for those that enjoy a challenge it might be the better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=417209">Expand</a></span>

Yes the dialogue is spoken with a broken Russian accent, but surprise, the game is set in Russia, so it adds to the realism. The action is much faster than the first STALKER, the interface is better, the UI is more responsive, and the music is fantastic (tip- enable &quot;Dynamic Music&quot; in the sound options and you&apos;ll love the battle music). In a way, &quot;Clear Sky&quot; is what &quot;Shadow of Chernobyl&quot; should have been. It&apos;s a night and day improvement in all aspects of the game, and Clear Sky has beat all my expectations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=417343">Expand</a></span>

No CD-KEY included, as there is a major print debacle (Google is your friend), but was no problem to play single player. Graphics are quite good, though the performance hit on my machine (relatively high-end gaming rig) is too great for the offering. Tweaking everything just right will yield a somewhat balanced eye-pleasing and playable experience (right now, with v-sync, i&apos;m averaging 30 FPS and dropping to 20 FPS under dire situations). Gameplay is near identical to the first one, as far as combat goes, but the RPG elements have been improved as well as the upgradability aspects. Having not played more than a few hours, I will leave the rest for everyone else to decide! If you loved or even just liked the first one, be sure to at least give this a chance. Remember that critics are becoming tougher and tougher as the overall quality of all games is growing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=416624">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing &quot;Clear Sky&quot; for about 12 hours now........ Wow, the graphics are great, story seems to be quite good... I&apos;ve spent most of my time exploring the 1st map area - Swamps?.. finding goodies, shooting bad guys and ramping up my gear. The main difference I have found is that it is easier to go from place to place via guides, upgrading weapons, armour is also easier as there is a clear distinction between traders and weapons techs that makes the whole issue of upgrades a lot easier to do than in the original. So far looks very promising The only minor issue that can be frustrating is trying to figure out why you are doing things i.e. receiving a message about a camp being attacked not long after the beginning when you have no idea where it is, as your guide has dumped you in the middle of the swamp. You only get to figure it out once you realize you need to use the map interface on the PDA to figure out directions. I suspect this is the only confusing aspect until you make the mental leap on how to work it all works, still I didn&apos;t need the agro. This game appears to be nice and gritty like the original. Bad guy AI appears to be quite a step up from the original. If you like strategy, sneaking, having to make choices before you get into a situation, you will like this game. The hours just seem to fly by.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=416730">Expand</a></span>

You can make it as long or as short as you want. Tons of side quests and the faction wars make it interesting as well. The end is underwhelming compared to Shadow of Chernobyl but it serves the purpose of filling in the blanks just fine.</span>

Things feel much more alive and going, unlike SHOC. 2. The new &quot;artifact finding&quot;. While in the first game, artifacts were tossed out in the open, sometimes not even near anomalies, now you must get out a detector to see where they are. Because of the danger of trekking through the anomaly fields, the artifacts are now much more valuable, some reaching 30,000 ru. I think the least amount is 4000, compared to the 1000 of the original game. This is definitely more fun, and It&apos;s exciting to see what new artifact you have found. 3. It&apos;s more buggy. Buggy as hell, sometimes. Crashes, inescapable blowouts, etc. You will need to patch this game! 4. Point of no return. Stupid as ever. Even further from the end of the game, there&apos;s still about 2-3 hours of fighting after it if you take your time, and, also- there&apos;s tons of gear after it, so you can&apos;t get them and make moolah. 5. Grenades are still basically worthless 6. Money is much harder to get, whereas in SHOC at the end I had about 300,000 ru, I&apos;ve only gotten to about 30,000 in CS. 7. Much harder. While SHOC wasn&apos;t that hard even on master, CS on master is extremely challenging, you going down in about 2 shots from the always-accurate shots of your foes 8. Factions- you can now join with more factions 9. You can now upgrade and repair your weapons, allowing you to keep your good gun with you for eternity (with enough moneyto fix it, of course) 10. Graphics look better in most cases 11. Time changes more noticeably now. No way to skip time, though, meaning you&apos;ll be stuck in the dead of night 12. Creepier. I got pretty freaked when running through the red forest in the dead of night 13. Guns are mostly the same, with some new ones (Martha (92fs) is more common now) along with a couple changes to weapon names, reloading sequences, and new sounds, not much has changed in the weapon&apos;s section. Note- you can now affix a silencer to many more of your guns, only a couple pistols and other weapons will not accept them (possibly because of upgrading?). HUD changes. You no longer see yourself with the suit on, and have to hover the cursor over items to see the descritpion- you can&apos;t click them. I&apos;ve heard that there was no stamina bar, and you&apos;d have to go to your inventory to see it. (numerous patches fix this, i think-because it didn&apos;t happen to me) Also, there&apos;s no ranking system, encyclopedia, or monster body parts when you check someone&apos;s inventory out. New monsters/changes/faction - CS makes use of new monsters and changes, along with some new factions, including the new swamp thing ( weird bloodsucker thingy), The Clear Sky faction, and the fact that poltergeists are almost impossible to kill. Well, that&apos;s it. In my opinion, CS was a worthy follow up to SHOC. In some ways it was better, in some ways worse. It&apos;s worth the time to get it, though :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=742309">Expand</a></span>

I find myself going to a new location and a pulse or what ever you call it is comming and i have 15 seconds to find a non existing hiding place. I&apos;ve been killed by people you only see after you are dead. I have gotten to a location where all my weapons dissapear and only come back after you run up to an enemy and get your butt shot off. If you are lucky enough to kill him the weapon dissapears untill you get someone else to shoot at you. I am up to date on patch&apos;s and i have a top of the line pc, so i&apos;ll elimate those. So i think i&apos;ll look for the game on eBay for cheap, delete the Steam one and start over. Would also be nice if you could get help when near freindly forces. Seems they just want to stand around and let you do all the fighting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=422018">Expand</a></span>

Having cleared out the final bandit base for the 10th time and have them instantly recapture it as soon as I leave the area becomes pretty irritating after a while not to mention the ridiculous amount of bugs and random crashes. The entire atmosphere of the game has shifted to a more action oriented gunplay type, and while the mutants are now more satisfyingly deadly there are never enough of them and the fact that almost every game entity appears on your pda map really ruin the classic you really stepped-in-it-this-time moments. While in a sense this game is more immersive than the first, the extremely limited faction system and the common bugs spoil much of the fun you can have. Basically this game will fully deserve this 9 only if it ever gets patched to cut out the bugs, and hopefully add some more unique loot to upgrade.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=417494">Expand</a></span>

With what is out there now, especially the Stalker Complete mods, the game is absolutely amazing.  All the bugs are fixed, the graphics, sound, lighting, and just about everything else are beautiful.  I love the soundtrack for this game as well (except the beginning Clear Sky base song).  I never had any of the bugs or quest/script errors others are mentioning.  If you own a high end PC, cranking this up with the full dynamic lighting can be one of the most immersive experiences of all time.  Weather mods add beautiful mornings and sunsets, amazing cloud formations and colors, and terrifying thunder storms.  If you play this game at all, I highly recommend modding it first.  The Complete mod by ArtistPavel is easy to install (.exe file) and is comprehensive and doesn&apos;t change any of the core gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=1735947">Expand</a></span>

I even felt surprised at how GSC Game World managed to add something so different from their previous title to the same world, without messing it up. That, along with fixing a big part of that buggy game-play from SoC, was what amazed me at first, when I played through the swamps. I guess what I felt about the game at that point was: &quot;This is going to be really good!&quot; However, it turned out not to be so. That feeling quickly turned into &quot;Whoa, that was fast, leaving this place, I wonder when I&apos;ll get back here&quot;, ever since I left the swamps. Too bad for me though, cause I never did! It seems that you barely ever have any time to explore the world, since you&apos;re always headed for the next mission, often because someone is calling out for help; they taught you not to ignore those calls way in the beginning, and that along with my experience from playing SoC, where every choice you make matters, I haven&apos;t ignored a single one. This resulted in me being paced to the next part of the main quest, rather than exploring the world. I can&apos;t even tell you whether it&apos;s even worth exploring!<br><br>What else is, the storytelling; it&apos;s REALLY bad. The whole story was basically neglected. There are holes in the story between SoC and this game the size that you could drive a truck right through them! It doesn&apos;t even seem to be an attempt to be mystical; it  really just seems to have been forgotten. I don&apos;t want to spoil it for any of you who might actually play it, but the ending isn&apos;t any better. So, all that, along with a ton of other relatively small issues (they would be big in other games), my conclusion comes to this: The game most of all seems like a spin-off from Shadow of Chernobyl, an attempt to get some easy money out from the players who like the first title. The story is not worth much, and  neither is much of the rest of the game, if you play it after having tried the original, in which case all I would say is good about it, is the fact that it feels a lot like the original game in some ways, however, the lack of an even decent story overshadows it. GSC Game World really had a big shot at filling out a bunch of [u]very[u/] interesting holes in the original story, but they failed miserably in doing so. If you miss SoC so much, that you just need to go back, this won&apos;t be much to find, unless you can live with the disappointing story. In that case, the slightly improved graphics and features (PDA, Upgrade-system, Faction-wars) might make up for some of it. Thank you for reading through this. It was done in a very short time, but I don&apos;t feel like I owe it to this game, sadly, what a big chance wasted...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=2264504">Expand</a></span>

It was so bad that I&apos;m just now writing a review about for the first time since I played it 4 months ago. My reason for writing this review so long after I played is because I don&apos;t want other people to know the horror of playing this game, please, save yourself from doing so. What breaks Clear Sky is the amount of bugs it has. The shooting mechanics are also terrible, you can hit a bandit (the weakest human opponents in the game) with 5 shotgun shells from 20 feet away and they will be fine, the recoil is ridiculous and the damage is pathetic, even with he upgrade system for weapons it&apos;s still terrible. Yet another problem that really bugged me was the fact that all the NPC&apos;s in the game are voice acted by no more than 2 different voice actors, sometimes you&apos;ll come across a group of friendly stalkers that are all speaking in the same voice and saying the exact same thing over and over again. Other people who give this game negative reviews say that the graphics are the only good thing about it, well that is true but the game is so poorly optimized that you could have a top-notch gaming PC and still get under 25 fps on max settings. Overall, Clear Sky is nothing compared to it&apos;s perfect predecessor Shadow of Chernobyl. I strongly recommend that you do not even consider playing this game until you have played SoC or at least Call of Pripyat first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=2532812">Expand</a></span>

To rate this game I&apos;m going to start at 5 and add or remove 1 or 2 points depending on how well that aspect is done. First off the gameworld of the Chernobyl is very important to the game. But it wasn&apos;t as well executed as in it&apos;s predecessor: they added some new zones and modified most of them. Some of the new zones like the swamps look like mush, just really bland textures, but a new zone like the red forest is awesome and eerie. So in all the game world is pretty much the same, new zones, some are good and some are bad. So for the gameworld I will give +0 for being pretty much the same. Next well talk about the atmosphere: atmosphere really set SOC apart, and honestly this game is a let down. The only thing this game improves on in atmosphere is a day-night cycle. It still has eerie zones and places but i was only frightened in one part of the game. So this game just doesn&apos;t have the same spooky haunting atmosphere. So fro atmosphere i will give -2 because it is such a let down. Next well talk about another important aspect the weapons and combat. So in my opinion this game improves on the combat by adding new weapons and armoured suits. They have a new repair and mod system which is a godsend  Some of my complaints with the weapons is that I think enemies sometimes take too many rounds to kill and also the weapon sounds are poor. So for combat and weapons I will give a +1. Next well talk about storyline, the storyline is done well it takes place before the previous games events and has you (Scar) following a group trying to penetrate to the power plant. The storyline is on-par with the first game without giving too much away i&apos;ll give it +1 because its pretty good. Backtracking a little the graphics have never been he strong suit of the S.T.A.l.K.E.R but this game has bland and boring textures and poor graphics, though it is a wasteland so you have to expect a bit bland graphics. So for graphics I will give it -1. Next well talk about a new faction war feature that i think is awesome. Being able to chose your faction and receiving their free gear for conquering their enemies is kickass. It is so awesome to wait at night time with a SVD with a night optic and knock off enemy squads, I think its a really cool and unique gameplay experience. Ill give it +2 for being a really awesome new  feature. And last but not least we have the game from a technical standpoint, unfortunetly this game is littered with bugs. None of them game breaking but just frustrating so I&apos;ll give it -1 from a technical standpoint. Finally a quick side note, I greatly reccomend the complete mod, it fixes all of the game problems, but this isn&apos;t a mod review. So in conclusion I give the game a 5 out of ten. Sadly it&apos;s a little mediocre and doesn&apos;t live up to its predecessor but still a fun but flawed so if your a fan of the series its a-must play, but if your not I would just leave this one alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=3041981">Expand</a></span>

Well...this is a brutal game. You will find yourself constantly lost in reeds, wandering through deadly swamp full of enemies and with weapons that are hopelessly inadequate, even upgraded. There&apos;s no direction to the game, no feel of having a goal, and even on the easiest level, your enemies WILL consistently kill you with headshots from 200 yards, through reeds and bushes, as you crouch behind a tree, helpless and waiting to die, and reload, and die again. Bad game. Supposed &apos;mods&apos; to improve game loaded with spyware.

<br>Not a bad game, but the weapon upgrade system was not good, and the game was overall buggy.

<br>The graphics was nice, but the level design was simply terrific.</span>

But this is a beta - not a finished game - at least not by an self-respecting company. Stick with Stalker and the Oblivion Lost mod and you will have a far better experience than this game. 5 because it has possibilities - but WAIT until under $20. VERY frustrating number of bugs/broken mechanics. Some people seem to be &quot;lucking&quot; into clean plays - but they are the minority (don&apos;t take my word for it - visit the forums). Avoid rewarding these developers/producers with your hard earned cash for such a bug-fest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=417412">Expand</a></span>

The weapons are all the same save for the new upgrade system, the gameplay is mostly the same except the AI&apos;s a bit better in my experience. The only problem is that I haven&apos;t gotten to play through the whole game due to the issues I&apos;ve had with it: Securom protection once AGAIN stops a game from playing right after i get done installing it off the cd/dvd. I HATE having to get a no-cd crack for a game that I purchased. My computer exceeds the minimum requirements by a great deal, but I wind up having to nuke the graphics settings and I still get terrible FPS- so it looks basically like SOC with choppy framerates. When I finish the painstaking &quot;swamp level&quot; at the start of the game (without doing any side quests i might add because it was boring as hell) I found a guide who promised to take me to Cordon- then nothing. No teleport, no message. And due to the game&apos;s new system of requiring a guide to get anywhere, I&apos;m stranded in the swamps. If you can get past the technical issues, gamers should still buy this game instead of stalker: SOC, seeing as it improves most aspects. It&apos;s just a matter of time until they get the bugs patched and the mods start getting made. Also multiplayer&apos;s terrible- surprise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=418032">Expand</a></span>

While it does feel like a more varied free-roam game, the enviroment is a lot less interesting compared to CoP. The amount of other stalkers also brings the atmosphere down since you can see them in just about everywhere. The story isin&apos;t interesting and it feels like an excuse of saying hello to every faction in the game. It would have been a lot better to just focus on few groups in the story missions or something else instead of what it&apos;s now. The combat lacks in good weapons. From the few weapons I used, everyone of them were as accurate as a hippo trying to shoot a gun for the very first time. It&apos;s just bad design choice to purposefully let weapons be as inaccurate as in this game.
<br>
<br>If you want to visit Chernobyl, I recommend a lot more of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat. The atmosphere is a lot better, the story doesn&apos;t feel like an excuse and the combat is a lot better. This game is still enjoyable but it&apos;s more like prototype version of CoP.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=2707224">Expand</a></span>

<br>Except some improvements in the rendering engine (mostly lighting) and the interface (HUD and Inventory), the gameplay is mostly the same, so you won&apos;t be lost in this new opus.
<br>
<br>The most important element of gameplay provided here is the Mechanic guy, who can repair and upgrade your equipment (armor, weapons). Being able to customize your gear early really add to the game.
<br>
<br>In spite of this, I encountered a huge difficulty wall after cleaning the &quot;swamp&quot;. After emerging from a huge pipe, I&apos;m confronted with about 20 soldiers and a huge machinegun. This was a halt for me and I never succeeded in exploring what the game had to offer.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t like it because I played leisurely in easy mode (that was hard enough for me). I would have accepted it after like 4 to 5h of play, like in Shadow of Tchernobyl, when you emerge inside the soldier camp !
<br>
<br>So in spite of its qualities, I really cannot recommend this game who doesn&apos;t want to be played even in easy mode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=5574467">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game has the amazing atmosphere of the original stalker game. It also shares many of the same locations and as a result there&apos;s continuity and familiarity with &apos;Shadow of Chernobyl&apos;.
<br>
<br>The difficulty has arguably increased, particularly aided by a changed bartering system whereby you get virtually nothing for the items you wish to sell (artifacts the exception) It&apos;s harder to make a quick buck and upgrade equipment, but I&apos;d suggest this is a wise move, as in Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat you  could make a fortune by picking weapons up from the ground and sell them to the Stalker standing a foot away, who, because of the AI, never thought to pick them up himself
<br>The artifact system is hugely improved. No longer do you simply find 6 high value ones sitting in the middle of the road for you without any danger to you at all; now, artifacts are invisible until very near proximity, and you use a detector to point you, by trial and error, to the treasure.  This important change makes finding artifacts far more rewarding.
<br>
<br>However, we must get to the bad:
<br>The game is riddled with crippling bugs. LImansk is a complete mess of a location and is guaranteed to crash your system - forcing the player to reload many times trying increasingly bizarre strategies to prevent the crash. I gave up without completion.
<br>My second try was going oh so well, until I got myself into a bad spot where I ended up sleeping through an emission in a partially covered building. The game never recovered, as the game never recognised the end of the emission and as a result most npc characters never went back to normal behaviour.
<br>
<br>Having to give up twice was disappointing and makes it impossible to rate the game highly - enjoy it while it lasts! Fans of the Series, will still find something to enjoy here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=4566676">Expand</a></span>

Great atmosphere and all the things we loved on the first game are still here. Just don&apos;t forget to install Clear Skies Complete Mod. It certainly makes the game much better. Awesome back then and still is today. Highly recommended!</span>

<br>
<br>They added fast travel (teleportation), but it is prohibitively expensive.  For the first half of the game you sprint for 10 seconds, stand still for 10 seconds to recover stamina, then sprint again.  Distances also seemed greater than Shadow of Chernobyl.
<br>
<br>They added the option to upgrade armor and guns, but more upgrades makes repairing them cost more, and again, it is too expensive.
<br>
<br>Health packs weigh less but the weight limit is still too restricting until you get stamina improvements.
<br>
<br>Factions were added which you can join and fight for/against and reap rewards.  However there are defense missions that pop up one second and before you can run to the area you need to defend the mission fails.
<br>
<br>Improvements without drawbacks:
<br>The camera doesn&apos;t shake as much.
<br>Gun accuracy is better.
<br>
<br>The story is not as good as Shadow of Chernobyl, but the overall gameplay is better.
<br>
<br>Cost $3.33 and played about 15 hours, not recommended for the above flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=7412757">Expand</a></span>

<br>CS is very annoying at the beginning of it. You make one mistake and you will die very easily (radiation and renegades). You will have to quick save like every 10 seconds. Later part when you get better gear, it becomes actually quite satisfying to play. I don&apos;t still really understand the stamina-meter. When games becomes too near reality, it is just stupid. Running for 20 sec and standing still to wait other 20 sec to get your stamina back is some very fantastic bulls***. Especially in game where you have to get money by looting all around in quite big maps. There is also this one part where Bandits rob you, and you will never get your money back.
<br>
<br>Clear Sky could have been great game if it didn&apos;t suffered from large amount of bugs and other things that will annoy player. It has nice reformations: you can join to factions and upgrade your weapons etc. 6 points is still best I can give to it as it is with recent patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=3170777">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>UPDATE: got to the garbage where everyone says &quot;you get robbed by bandits and lost all of your money you have saved and cannot get it back!&quot; i am seriously surprised no one thought to do this or has done it. BUT you do not walk up to the bandits, actually if you save after you do anything meaningful then you simply re-load once you get robbed and shoot the bandits instead of walking up to them. problem solved, you save all that money you lost. when i did it, i lost 3300. shot the bandits, kept my cash and in the next area, hidden valley if anyone remembers? i just made over 15k by doing missions and looting all the dead people. so i dont see how it was that hard for you to have gotten all your money back that you lost unless you were litterally spending nothing and saved over 20k. so stop being losers and think outside the box for once. clear sky kinda lets you shoot everybody so just do that when you come across bandits. morons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=5421067">Expand</a></span>

The game has many similarities with its predecessor, like the map, the inventory, the immersive atmosphere and the way you progress through the game by fulfilling missions. Unfortunately some things have become worse: with the randomized weapon ballistics it&apos;s very hard to score a hit; the game crashes regularly and it has performance issues like frame rate drops. Also the last mission is too difficult. Highly recommend if you loved &apos;Shadow of Chernobyl&apos;, but that one was clearly better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=6236248">Expand</a></span>

I thought &quot;What the hell&quot; and I bought the next installment S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky.
<br>
<br>So after I&apos;ve beat S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear sky.. I came to finally write a review. and what can I say? I was not impressed at all compared to SoC. CS was a big step backwards instead of a big step forward... I had fun, don&apos;t get me wrong... but there was many times where I was just pissed off because the game was just generally broken and boring in some cases.
<br>
<br>Firstly the side missions/fraction war missions are buggy as hell. I mostly blame this on the AI respectively because squads in your fraction move up to capture a point... but sometimes they absolutely refuse to push forward for no reason. It&apos;s the main reason why I cannot capture Freedom base because squads would circle around the area but they would never attack. I did play with one mod (no respawn mod for fractions) because I wanted to make the fraction wars mean something... so it&apos;s never about fighting forever but you can fully win a war and you can exterminate the fraction which made it a lot more exciting to destroy fractions. and not to mention that you have to pick up every reward in a fraction base which doesn&apos;t help make it exciting.
<br>
<br>Secondly the end game once again failed hard... because it&apos;s the same rushed BS that we&apos;ve seen in SoC but somehow... GSC made it worse, they seem to throw random events to make the ending seem longer and worthwhile (for e.g they would spawn Monolith in the Chernobyl NPP just to waste your time.) It felt like a FPS shooter like call of duty than the game I&apos;ve been playing for the previous 23 hours before the end game. and the story doesn&apos;t really help make the ending seem worthwhile. (which I will explain later.)
<br>
<br>Finally the last problem is the story for CS...they seriously try hard for a connection in SoC and because of this it actually contradicts SoC&apos;s story (from strelok&apos;s flashbacks) into a different story we don&apos;t care about in the end. And in the end strelok get captured from Scar&apos;s hand which actually destroys one of the flashbacks completely. (E.G the wish granter dream) the writers were trying hard to connect Strelok into CS but it doesn&apos;t work... if they had a new and original idea.. it would make this game a lot better.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is ok... I only played vanilla version (with Fraction AI no spawn mod.) and many people recommend the complete mod for CS... personally if you really want to get to S.T.A.L.K.E.R lore and buy CS I would highly recommend the Complete mod for this game. I&apos;ve seen footage and it&apos;s a major improvement to the vanilla game.. . it&apos;s not worth the time to deal with crappy side missions and broken AI for fraction wars. S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky honestly deserves a 3/10... but it gets a 5/10 because I still had fun playing the game 75% of the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-clear-sky/user-reviews?user_review_id=6470273">Expand</a></span>
