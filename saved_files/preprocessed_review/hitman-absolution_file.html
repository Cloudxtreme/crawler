I did not really like the way stealth mechanism worked in the game (It was really difficult not to get caught by some guard all the time, and once they noticed you it was difficult not to get engaged in a fight with everyone.) I did not like the way maps were &apos;cut up&apos; to smaler sections (I wish there would be bigger maps the player could explore... Like in the previous games.) The player can&apos;t choose weapons or other equipment before starting a mission.The game has a console port feel to it (push &apos;q&apos; button repeatedly to choke out someone.) Overall not a bad game but they mainstreamed it for wider audiences. I give it a 6/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2785864">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is totally broken  dumbed down, its not even hitman anymore, everything we loved it for was removed, only some barely working rudiments was left. It is yet another Conviction, but worse, everything you hated in Conviction, Saboteur, Assassin&apos;s Creed and Kane  Lynch in terms of Stealth and gunplay is here, concentrated in extreme doses that may kill you. Also lensflare madness, started by Kane  Lynch 2 and continued by Syndicate is here, head of 47 shines like supernova explosion to blind you from truth  THIS GAME IS UTTER TRASH. It not just abandoned old Hitman gameplay, its simply broken everywhere and doesnt work, and its so primitive and generic. Let me list you few of many game design flaws: 1) Saves doesnt work, once you restart checkpoints every NPC  object will be respawned, your stats would be reset to state of beginning of level, so you better to restart level completely and dont die or exit until you finish it. 2) Disguise doesnt work, its connected to stupid INSTINCT MANA that could be gained by killing and hiding bodies, or not gained at all on professional modes. Without using instinct, which magically removes suspicion, your cover will be blown in 5-10 second from 30 meters. So you are forced to use instinct in any mode, but cant on pro modes, and without instinct there you would not be even able to blend into area. It only barely working on easiest mode. 3) Pro modes and especially PURIST  broken and rushed addition, game was not designed with these modes in mind, these modes not balanced at all, they simply locking features for retards, without even thinking that game designed that way so it cant be played without INSTINCT, and without thinking to compensate somehow lack of these features. It cant be played on PRO mode if you want to use disguise, blown covers makes game really frustrating, and pushing you to reastart, which will lead you to flaw 1  broken saves. On pro mode you will have only option to use covers Conviction style. 4) 80% of game is linear stealth cover shooter, only about 20% of levels reminds old Hitman games sandbox, but they all made using generic objects and repetitive pattern, lacking about 80% features you had in previous game, so its simply boring, primitive and most likely you will screw up trying to go Silent Assassin way. 5) AI is deaf and blind, totally dumb, glitching a lot. They dont see and dont hear anything except for you in disguise or killing. 6) You cant select inventory for levels and only limited to very few objects you can find on level. Most of unlocks and tools useless and can be only used in contracts mode. 7) Due of nature of stupid prerendered cut-scenes, where 47 appears only in his suit or any pre-defined suit, once cut-scene over you will loose your disguise and default suit will magically appear on you, same happens with guns, you enter the room dressed one way, but after cut scene you dressed another way. Really stupid, even cheapest games from 90th era never had such a flaw, Hitman 1 was better than this. 8) Scoring makes no sense, its not what it used to be in previous game. You are encouraged to do not stealthy things and some stealthy things not awarded at all, other non stealthy things not punished. 9) Level design is very bad, it may look good it terms of art, but its really bad in terms of gameplay logic. Every possible guard have always dumpster nearby to hide their bodies, how handy... for retards, very few, like 3-5 objects that allows you kill somehow are available per level, generic dumpsters, fuseboxes, pits, balconies, there is no unique content that we saw in Blood Money or previous Hitman games, every gameplay object is just a copy-pasted repetitive trash. 10) Whole instinct gameplay is retarded and must be removed from game, but instead it was not even removed from purist mode. 11) UI is huge, ugly and was designed by captain obvious, why in the world you need to have giant icon of equipped weapon or disguise if you can just look at hitman&apos;s and see his weapon and suit? 12) You cant peek through keyholes (surely, u now have magic wallhack cheat to replace that) 13) You cant even close doors, they only closed automatically 14) Worst thing  most of your assassination targets are killed in FREAKING CUTSCENES, or not, actually most of time you will see cutscene where BEST KILLER IN THE WORLD, FAILING TO KILL HIS TARGET 15) Story may look like good one, but in fact its typical set of hollywood cliches and yet another plagiarism with nonsense ending. 16) Realism was lost completely, no briefcase, weapons spawns of Hitman ass, ammo picked up by legs. There are more issues, i cant compact them in 5000 chars limit. This game is near 5 of 10, but since it called Hitman, and since its not Himan at all, only 0 of 10.

Gameplay has been dumbed down like we have seen in countless other modern installments of popular franchises and we seldom see any improvement from the original games that made the series. The first thing I noticed is the game crashes on average about once every 5 minutes on my GTX670, which is certainly not a good introduction to a full price release. Controlling Agent 47 when locked behind cover is a chore, as you cannot move him when your camera is at a certain angle, feeling like you are snagged on something. For a stealth game such as Hitman, the checkpoint system is nothing short of disgusting. Reloading a checkpoint causes all of the enemies that you have previously dispatched, including the ones prior to the checkpoint to respawn, resulting in the need to sometimes start the level all over again. The AI is absolutely terrible, after reloading a checkpoint and everything respawning, I was caught in a gun fight with a few guys in front of me. The AI behind me, clearly hearing the gunshots, become totally confused and make no attempt to surround me whatsoever, instead just standing at their posts. Visuals are fairly nice, though commenting on graphics has no place in a review, the gameplay comes first. If you are new stealth junkie to the series, go and play dishonored, if you are a fan of the Hitman series like myself, avert your eyes and forget that this ever happened.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2797997">Expand</a></span>

I just hated it. After 3 hours playing in hard and trying to do it &quot;as it has to be done&quot;, i just decided to run to the end killing everyone in my way, just to end it. And i know i&apos;m not the only one. I played the 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 Hitman, have it in CDs, have it on steam too, have the DVD of the movie that i also saw in a cinema. I pre-purchased Hitman absolution the day i could and i played the sniper challenge to get all i could in it and 3 millions points : I AM A HITMAN FAN AND I AM ANGRY !!!
<br>I actually played more to the sniper challenge (13 hours) than to the real game (12 hours).
<br>I can detail but v00d00m4n did it very well, 100% of what he says is correct.
<br>I will add that i feel abused : that is not what the sniper challenge was promising us. The sniper challenge was showing diferent ways to kill some targets, to hide them, to unlock weapons for the actual game (so in the inventory right? Nope, there is Absolutely no inventory in hitman 5...).
<br>And it was obviously a reference to the first Hitman 1 mission which was a snipe mission, telling us that there would be some snipe missions in hitman 5. Nope.
<br>I give 2 for the sniper challenge, the nice graphisms (even if they could have been darker), and the knife throwing system (even if it really make the game easier, it make sense).
<br>And because i don&apos;t like to be that negative, i will now write what would have been nice :
<br>- the story : it has never been important in the Hitman serie. But since it was the main concern of the developers, it should have been better. We have to protect a girl that as been created like us. It is a bad plot (indeed &quot;inspired&quot; from leon the killer movie), but let say we keep it. I would have like to see good reasons to do that : a nice cinematic showing 47 and her taking good time together watching a movie, playing a game or something. A cinematic that shows what she can do, at the very begining : that would explain better why 47 want to keep an eye on her, as a student killer or as a threat for him. The best would have been to be able to play her like we can play catwoman in batman, supposing she would have had other &quot;powers&quot; than 47 (women disguises for a start).
<br>HITMAN SHOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE A PROFESSIONNAL KILLER AND NOT A STUPID NOOB
<br>Spoiler : in the game story, they are actually 2 times at least when the bad guy can kill hitman after a stupid cinematic where hitman is awefully bad. And he just doesn&apos;t... When running out of a place, hitman uses the elevator. And if the elevator doesn&apos;t work, he repairs it with pieces strangely sprayed all over the building. PLEASE TAKE THE STAIRS!!!!
<br>- the gameplay : the disguise system is 90% of time a handicap compared to keep your own clothes. The idea was not that bad : if a small town cop sees a cop that he doesn&apos;t know, he will be suspicious. That make sense in some cases, but do all the CHICAGO policemens know each other? And the plummers? The AI should have been programmed mission by mission, differently, and with a briefing : &quot;be careful 47, this is a small town where most people know each other&quot;; or &quot;Note that a lot of people come for a short time in that hotel, you should be able to walk free in most of it&apos;s parts&quot;
<br>And there could have been a way to talk, to try to lie to people before they start shooting at you. At least a 3 sentences choice, find the one the guy can believe in and let you go (or leave witout harm). And not for every NPC but some of them. And in real life, some people stop asking questions with a litle tip. That could have been easy to put in the game, if we had got some money like in Blood Money. That would have been an easy but expensive way to go in a place. Again, not for every NPC, just some of them. And who can be bought and who will do his job whatever the price is something that the 47 instinct could have told. &quot;This guy looks like a dealer, i can probably buy him.&quot;
<br>- there should have been an inventory like in blood money rewarding you : good work = money = the gun uppgrade you want. Being a professionnal killer without a silent gun sucks. - the close fighting should have been thought differently. this aze space system sucks. I would have liked different attacks to choose : fist in the face, kick in the legs and so on. This is not a priority, but it sucks to be a professionnal killer that can&apos;t fight properly. - the linear action sucks and should have been avoided at any cost, even with a focus on the story. I could have liked a Mass Effect like system where my actions would have impacted the story. I would have liked to be able to guide Victoria in a way or the other : get a normal life or become like 47.
<br>- there HAD TO BE a snipe mission in addition to the sniper challenge. And no, i won&apos;t buy a DLC for that.
<br>Not enough space here. Just don&apos;t expect more from hitman absolution than a bad sneak/shoot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2799114">Expand</a></span>

The game will hold your hands through from the beginning to the end and it is designed for a literally dumb audience. With the press of a button you can use wallhack and see where all the gaurds are about to go, and you instantly have hints within the corridoor shooter levels where literally everything is scripted. If you expect a true Hitman title then you will most likely be dissapointed, though.
<br>
<br>Absolution shines in graphics, improved stealth system, animations, lightning sound, and a few other features. But it falls short in many other areas and it literally throws much of what makes a hitman game a hitman game - out of the window - while it embrace and directly copy and paste features and even partly formulas from batman AA, splinter cell conviction, and even Red Dead Redemption
<br>with its &apos;draw gun&apos; minigame and other games. The storyline is uninteresting, uninspired, contains a lot of childish and rather idiotic characters telling a lot of clich&#xE9; lines. (exmple: Dexter Blake, the great villian, had a masterplan to sell genetically superior kid assasins for 10m bucks each.)
<br>The levels in the game is often very small and streamlined and you often have to sneak in pre-defined, corridoor-like paths. Weapon, dumpsters, gaurds, cover - all of it is place at convinient places. More focus on stealth and kills, and almost no focus on strategy and creativity. The type of gameplay has more in common with Splinter Cell Conviction than Hitman. Disguise system is broken. Gaurds can see through walls at times. Your cover gets blown all the time because everyone - and I mean everyone - for some reason raises suspicion against you. You can&apos;t choose what type of equipment and weapons you want to use. You can&apos;t pick locks anymore. You can&apos;t look through keyholes. You can&apos;t open or close doors. You can&apos;t save the game manually. Sniper rifles and other weapons are magically drawn out  from thin air. Weapons and dumpsters are placed at very obvious places. Gameplay is extremely linear and offers almost no challange. In terms of innovation this game does not impress me. They&apos;ve copied and pasted features from other games, such as xrayvision (Batman Arkham Asylum), draw-grun function (RDR) and many aspects from Splinter Cell. They abandone the unique hitman formula and made it to another generic game. This game shines in the visuals, but lacks in many other ways, and its pathetic to see how much it lacks in innovation compared to previous titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2791975">Expand</a></span>

First, 47 actually has MAGIC POWERS now, he can see enemies through walls, remove their suspicion levels and do other tricks, and it actually requires MANA (cleverly dubbed &quot;Instinct&quot;) to do it. Agent 47 is Corvo now. But that&apos;s not the main problem. The main problem is that checkpoints don&apos;t work at all since a lot of the stuff that you&apos;ve done is simply reset. How are you supposed to construct a precise plan when every single mistake means that you have to restart the entire goddamn level or start killing left and right, which, as you might notice, is the exact opposite of what you&apos;re supposed to do in Hitman. It seems that you simply can&apos;t play this game without improvising and that&apos;s something that 47 should never ever have to do. If you have any love for our bald assassin, skip this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2794964">Expand</a></span>

Gone are the sprawling sandbox style killing grounds of Blood Money -  they have been replaced with tiny linear corridors where your goal very rarely even involves taking out a target.   The story is embarrassingly bad and full of more holes than a wheel of swiss cheese,  yet IO seems intent on forcing you to absorb it. Each of Absolutions mission objectives is focused on advancing to the next pre-rendered cutscene.   I could also mention the **** quick time event driven combat, the broken disguise system where enemies will recognize you from 15 meters away even if you&apos;re wearing a mask and have your back turned to them,  and the total lack of  weapon / equipment selection prior to a mission.    If you liked Blood money,  stay far away from this  It&apos;ll break your heart.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2783508">Expand</a></span>

It feels like I&apos;m playing Splinter Cell Chaos Theory on expert without quicksave. Which means you have to repeat things over and over until you do it right, and most of the time you are waiting behind cover for something to play out. The strong points of Hitman were: fluidity, flexibility, exploration. Now it&apos;s about going through linear levels, with a LOT of repetition because of the lack of quicksaves (sure, saves were limited in higher difficulties on the old game, but I could choose when I wanted it). Today I was playing a level, and I repeated like 15 time the same easy, but long segment because I had a checkpoint before it. If I could choose, I would save it just before I started the hard part. But instead, I gor so bored I turned on the TV to watch while I waited for the same scenes to play out over and over again. And that kills exploration. It kills the spirit of the game, which was to blend in, walk around like a boss, like a predator, only analyzing how to catch the prey and then act on your plan. Also, stop making 47 be hunted. It breaks the game. The disguise system is awesome, but the fact that missions are often linear with loads of people wearing the same disguise as you means you have to hide all the time. So most of the time, disguise is almost useless. Also, not having a silenced pistol is a real pain for a game where you have to sneak all the time - it takes way too long for you to get it back. Anyway... Hitman is about being set loose in a &quot;playground&quot; where you have to figure out how to infiltrate and kill targets without anyone seeing. Sneaking is something to be done only a fraction of the time, usually just before a kill: certainly not all of the time. They took that away and took a lot of the fun with it. That said, I did give it a 7, so it&apos;s a respectable game. It&apos;s got a few improvements: the fact that taking out all witnesses means other people don&apos;t know what you did; the new objects/weapons and attacks; the graphics; the awesome throwing knife kill, the instinct targeting system, the contracts system. The game also has some nice missions (most of them toward the end), but frankly, I&apos;m pretty disappointed. This was a major step back in the key aspects. Bring back the old game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2802865">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Here&apos;s the problem - the game tries to shoehorn it&apos;s story in everywhere, and in so doing, ruins the Hitman genre. You can&apos;t choose your kit at the start of a mission - you aren&apos;t with the Agency - so your starting gun every mission is always some POS unsilenced pistol. Want a sniper rifle? Hope the level designer left you one - often it&apos;s in the perfect sniping spot too, so you don&apos;t have to use brain cells finding one yourself. You can&apos;t carry weapons over from mission to mission, either. This Killed it for me.
<br>
<br>Levels are small, cramped, and linear, often culminating in you opening a Door -  it&apos;s cutscene promotion. You can spend all day being as stealthy as possible, dealing with a total lack of autosaves, and in the cutscene you SCREW UP THE HIT - The devs want you to play a story, not Hitman. Disguising well runs off &quot;Instinct&quot;. You get more instinct by killing people. Hitman Absolution puts you in some crappy cycle of killing people you don&apos;t have to, and losing points for doing so (they kept that), to get the &quot;Instinct&quot; you need to disguise well. Dumb.
<br>
<br>But you need to do this because the guard AI is hyper-suspicious of similarly dressed people now. Often, you&apos;ll have the guard disguise and find yourself sneaking and action rolling from cover to corner - in plain view of guards - just so they don&apos;t look at you too closely. Walking anywhere near them blows your cover, but they don&apos;t care about a similarly dressed person action rolling around lol. There&apos;s still a few AI bugs - I&apos;ve been spotted through walls, thus having to restart the whole level because there&apos;s no autosave feature, even on PC. When you do reach one of the few checkpoints in the game, even they are dumbed down - the game forgets who you killed, what you have, guards respawn and bodies disappear - it&apos;s the worst checkpoint ever.
<br>
<br>The graphics are a nice improvement. Hitman 4: Blood Money was a fantastic game - you did all the planning, all the killing, the level design was huge and open, you picked your guns and thus your strategy, you could autosave before a difficult part (and that cut down a lot of repetition).  Whoever designed Absolution decided these were all negatives - a story does the planning; a cutscene does the killing - sometimes, because the story has people survive; the level design is narrow and linear to promote a single, definite path; you don&apos;t pick your guns - the designers give you only what you need, often in the place you&apos;d use them anyway (goodbye Silverballers); and whoever designed the save system should be shot repeatedly and thrown off a balcony, because the autosaves are gone and what remains is a broken shell of a checkpoint system as we know it today. Hitman: Absolution is a stealthy shooter with nice graphics. But it&apos;s definitely not Hitman - it&apos;s been dumbed down so much that what&apos;s left is the bald guy and the title. In all honesty, if you liked the &quot;plan your own kill&quot; part of the genre, fire up Blood Money again - it&apos;s not so dated that your eyes crawl, and it&apos;s the essence of what a good Hitman game is. I just wish someone told the developers of Absolution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2794598">Expand</a></span>

Hitman was never good because of flashy kills, big drama or fancy graphics. What made this game stand out was the sandbox-like environment where you have to use analytical thinking and make the circumstances work for you. What I had the unpleasure to experience with Absolution was quite different.</span>

All I wanted was a sequel for Blood Money and instead got a failed experiment of mixing Hitman and Splinter Cell: Conviction. The open-world choices of Hitman games going back a decade are now replaced with a mediocre story and a game on rails. I wish I didn&apos;t get this on Steam so I could return it.</span>

There really has been only 1 mission out of 5 that you actually get to do a hit. First mission you play for like 45 minutes so you can get to the target and a cutscene cuts in (excuse the pun) and you watch while he actually kills the target. That pretty much has been the most anti-climatic mission end in the whole series, and possibly in gaming lol.
<br>
<br>Since the disguise system is abysmal, the levels are pretty linear, the game feels more like a stealth puzzle rather than a sandbox hitman game. You just can&apos;t improvise and do a hit that it is your own... not that the levels are actual hits mind you. First lvl cutscene hits, second lvl is the only true hit, third level you play to get to a shaft, fourth level is about running on rails from the cops, and so on and so forth.
<br>
<br>Next no weapons selection before the level which makes sense since the levels are so linear it wouldn&apos;t make sense to let you bring something that will break said linearity.
<br>
<br>In essence, you do no true hits, highly linear, bad disguese system, bad save system. All in all it is a pretty frustrating puzzle game where you have to replay long stretches for the smallest mistake.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2780693">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is not a Hitman game anymore, it&apos;s rather Splitman Cell: Absoviction, full of linear sneaking levels instead of open world assasinations, quick time events replacing real gameplay and of course the great mechanic of killing multiple enemies with a single mouse click.
<br>
<br>This is not a bad game, if it weren&apos;t part of the Hitman series I would rate it much higher, but since it has to compare itself to the brilliant Hitman: Blood Money, this is only a 5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2776680">Expand</a></span>

For example, when you select your weapons or items they just appear in 47&apos;s hands without drawing them. This is definitely not acceptable for a game with such reputation.
<br>I would describe it as a very disappointing game, especially for fans.</span>

<br>Three missions in, I&apos;m baffled by the linearity. Seeing so many cutscenes in the middle of the action takes a great toll on the satisfaction. The gameplay design is contradictory, with Instinct draining really fast, being used for arbitrary things and being almost impossible to refill on higher difficulties. In retrospect, it was a terrible idea to make every person wearing the same clothes as you able to see right through your disguise. I defended it before, and it may add to the realism (you know, since people working for the same security agency might know their colleagues), but it also makes disguises damn near useless. I&apos;m not commenting on the level design, since the levels might open up later on, but so far, it&apos;s looking grim, and maybe they should have just omitted the console release entirely and just created bigger levels, without dividing them.
<br>Oh, and there is no excuse for the inclusion of a checkpoint system.
<br>
<br>Overall, I wonder just how much feedback from hardcore fans they actually listened to. I&apos;m afraid it cannot have been too much. It&apos;s okay, and I guess I&apos;m still gonna have fun with it, but it lives a very bitter aftertaste, because I can already tell from the start that a lot of bad design decisions were made - It&apos;s not the Hitman 5 it could have been.

After six years of waiting 47&apos;s back and I&apos;m crawling through the linear tutorial mission as always! Wow, the guards AI is fine!&quot; etc. I was waiting for the real game to start. For now, I&apos;ve edended up in orphanage and I got to turn on four electrical switches. This is the goal of the level, switches. Ghost-like, urban legend killer is now forced to pull switches or open doors on a ratcage-like levels, that makes absolutely no sense! There is no freeform gameplay anymore, you are, literally, forced to do the thing that developers tells you to do. At the Purist difficulty, there&apos;s even more of absurdity: you got ONLY ONE way through mission that really works. There&apos;s no Hitman anymore. I just wish the Real 47 will come and kill that bald bandaged clown disguising as him in Absolution. The most awful fact is that you can see all the buried potential of the game. Levels are cutted to parts with doors with NO loading, which signs that the game once WAS open-ended Hitman that we once liked. As the Hitman game, this piece of poo gets 0 from me. As the Deus Ex HR with bald guy instead of Adam Jensen it gets 6 points. P.S.: Actually IOI already released Jensen suit as DLC, what an irony.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2782938">Expand</a></span>

I won&apos;t by any game of Square Enix untill there would be public excuses, public sacks, and a normal version of hitman.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2780444">Expand</a></span>

This game is a great stealth action shooter with an engaging story and amazing graphics. But as a hitman game, it is not up to par. Some of the biggest gripes I had were for one, no longer  are you spending money earned from missions to upgrade and expand your arsenal, but now you are picking up things as you go. No more poison or mines always at your disposal, now you must improvise. Now this isn&apos;t terrible because it goes with the theme of, &quot;hitman is on the run from everything and he has nothing to help him&quot; blah blah blah. Which brings me to my next point. In Blood Money, you entered a massive level and went throughout it to creatively kill your targets, then leave the same way causing no alarm. Now you are going from point A to point B in a much more linear fashion. Now even though I have all these complaints, if you are looking for a nice stealth action game,  (and don&apos;t worry, being a silent assassin bad ass is still possible) with a fantastic story and stellar graphics, this game should defiantly be worth a purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2776472">Expand</a></span>

The previous 4 installments of the game series followed the same pattern, and there was no reason why the 5th shouldn&apos;t do the same. (Un)fortunately, it turned out to be quite different.
<br>
<br>(-, +)First off, there&apos;s the linear gameplay. You no longer play in one big area, but rather small areas, which are led by checkpoints. The areas are, however, fully packed with opportunities to kill your targets, but in most areas you don&apos;t have targets at all. It usually contains 2-3 areas you have to pass through before you get to your target area, and after you&apos;ve found a satisfying way to end your target, there&apos;s a 3-4 areas to go through so you can escape. In many of these areas there are tight corridors which only have a few ways of approach, sometimes with only one plausible solution. (-, +)The checkpoints in the game removes a lot of the Hitman feeling instantenously. One of the key aspects to the Hitman series was to explore the world and keep your head calm, lest you blow your cover and everything is over. Now you can just reload the checkpoint as if nothing happened. There&apos;s now room for imperfection. It&apos;s a good way to explore the world though, as if you get caught sneaking in an area off-limits, you can always reload and try again.
<br>
<br>(--)Now, as for weapons I was just plain disappointed. One thing I liked about the previous games was to smuggle my weapons inside places. Now you can hide a huge shotgun inside your jacket as if this was GTA, and no guards check you for weapons. It feels as if the weapons are kind of stuck onto you, instead of something you could lose any moment. You also don&apos;t get to buy guns or upgrades before a mission, nor choose between an arsenal like in the previous games, atleast not in the story mode. You always gotta start from scratch when you enter a new mission. There&apos;s a decent selection of weapons, though, and the introduction of environmental weapons like your average vase is a good one.
<br>
<br>(+, -) Cutscenes seem like a welcome addition to the game, except for a few cases where they take over the gameplay completely. Sometimes you just want to do something else than 47 decides for you, which can give you a headache. Still, it adds up to the dark and deadly feeling of Hitman, instead of weird half-assed animations.
<br>
<br>(++) The story has an interesting turn, and without spoiling anything, it shows a different side of 47. Although you no longer kill for money, you have another goal, which 47 can very much relate to. You also feel as if you come to a conclusion to how 47&apos;s life has been, which is a welcome addition as the previous games have kept that between the lines, mostly.
<br>
<br>(+++) The graphics are superb, atleast when you max out. You get the dark, gloomy feeling of being a killer, and the Hitman series have never looked so real. 47 has officially gotten a high-resolution face, and my doesn&apos;t he look like a true killer. Without doubt amazing, and it makes the world in the game look very alive and real.
<br>
<br>(++) The sounds were indeed very good aswell, without doubt another thing that makes the gameworld feel alive. Varied speech for NPCs, good voice actors, good integration with AI, and good sound effects made the game&apos;s sounds very realistic.
<br>
<br>In short, Hitman: Absolution is not a bad game, but it didn&apos;t blow my socks off, either. It seems a bit new, which is good for some and bad for others. I wouldn&apos;t mind playing in bigger areas and rely on saves if I needed a checkpoint. The only things that will make me remember this game are the stunning visuals and the enthrilling story. Things that we liked in Codename 47, Silent Assassin, Contracts and Blood Money may and may not be gone, but all in all, Hitman: Absolution is a game well worth playing. Just don&apos;t expect the world.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 9/10
<br>Gameplay: 6/10
<br>Story: 8/10
<br>Audio: 8/10
<br>Other annoying crap (things existing in previous Hitman games that were not present for unknown reasons: 4/10
<br>
<br>Overall score: 7/10
<br>
<br>Recommended. Good replayability with Contracts mode, not so much storywise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2776348">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s too linear and you dont have freedom like in previous hitman games. Also the new disguise-system is pretty **** - enemies blow your cover in 2-3 seconds thats not fun. Of cause they brought a bunch of new features and improvements: graphics are very nicely, the glacier2 engine is also a lot better than glacier1. Also the new contracts mode provides additional gameplay and especially with friends it is really fun. But all in all IO turned the classical tactical hitman into a pure action game. As a hitman game it sucks but it is a nicely done action game. My review: 8 out of 10 points (if i had reviewed it as a hitman game it would have got only 4/10 points).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2786489">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Shooting mechanics are pretty good, and it&apos;s the most amazing feeling to blow someone away with a shotgun when stealth is no longer an option
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>
<br>- Fairly graphically demanding (I&apos;m running 30 fps on medium with a Radeon 6850, which isn&apos;t bad),  but cutscenes and loading when respawning is so laggy that it drops to 1 fps. - Can&apos;t select equipment before your mission (so even though I spent 15 hours in the Sniper Challenge unlocking everything, it isn&apos;t available in the story missions)
<br>- There is a slight feel of &quot;console port&quot; (but this maybe just because of my mediocre FPS rate)
<br>- Large equipment can be concealed? This is a step back from Blood Money, where you had to hold anything bigger than a sub machine gun or drop it I&apos;ll add more stuff to the review as I complete the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2779661">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A story much deeper and more intense than in previous installments, a technical section and amazing gameplay that offers a number of options like few games can.
<br>
<br>Notably, the great work of optimizing the PC version.
<br>
<br>Definitely the best game of murder so far.</span>

Subdue a target discetely then take his clothes and attempt to walk straight through?  But what if they notice you, what then, shall you proceed to use instinct to blend in and move away or perhaps find an alternate route?  If you&apos;re caught, what then will you do, melee quitely and hope you&apos;re note widely discovered, fake surrender and take him as a human shield and blast your way out, or perhaps you skip the fake surrender and go straight for guns blazing?  That&apos;s not even half of what you could do either, there are just so many more options in this sequel than the others.  Sure, it doesn&apos;t have as many &quot;simulation&quot; features such as the inability to hide heavy 2 handed weapons on you, or having animations manually put your guns away along with other small features, but it trades those in for smoother gun control, more gameplay options, with a more complex melee system that works out for the better.  One thing I would say that detracts, which I believe was intentional, was that if you put two bodies into a locker/closet together, you can see just before the doors close that they are positioned purposely in a way so as to make it look like they are having standing &quot;doggystyle&quot; sex, something which I think is a small detractor because the comedy feels so out of place and random that it doesn&apos;t blend well.  If it wasn&apos;t intentional, which I doubt, I would very much like it to be fixed, for atmosphere&apos;s sake in a game such as this which has such a serious tone.
<br>
<br>The AI has been given a major overhaul, truly reacting to each and every thing you do in the environment, reacting accordingly to it as well, although with a few minor hickups and glitches that aren&apos;t all too noticeable.  It&apos;s hard to go in depth about the AI because of how diverse and complex it is, given the multitude of situations that they react differently in each and every time.  One thing I do like though, is now other people in the environment may notice you or become suspicious if you&apos;re wearing a certain disguise.
<br>
<br>Finally, the story.  The characters are all unique in their mannerisms, voices, and look, each with their own feel and flavor to them.  Their voice acting is all great and manages to make them feel alive and animated.
<br>
<br>One flaw that was fatal in the game for me, detracting it an entire point, was the checkpoint system.  This checkpoint system doesn&apos;t save your progress, it simply records your character up to that point and places you in that position, let me explain.  Say you clear a room of guys, then you get a checkpoint.  You die, naturally, and come back to it, and now all of the guys you just got through killing in the previous room before the checkpoint are back.  This I felt detracted greatly from the sense of accomplishment if you pull off a very smooth gunfight sequence, only to find out all your efforts were in vain after dieing past the next checkpoint.  A good amount of the levels are sectioned off though, so the checkpoint system seems to work in a way that doesn&apos;t hamper the player in those parts, but in the larger sandbox maps, it becomes very frustrating.
<br>
<br>Finally, there is contracts mode, which enables you to cutsomize and create your very own hits and share them with the community.  This is something that I wouldn&apos;t of expected to come from a game such as this, and works so well in so many ways as to be entirely unique, and hopefully becomes a permanent addition to the series from now on.
<br>
<br>Overall this is a fantastic game with tons of content and as much polish as possible for the date they had set, very few bugs of any kind have been encountered and the everything seems to work as it should.  Hats off to the developers for making such a fantastic game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2779069">Expand</a></span>

Many people have performance issues (like crashing to desktop, bugs, deleted save files, and the game crashing during cinematics) with no patches able to really fix these problems yet.  The disguise system is better in some aspects and far worse in others compared to the old system. A way in which it&apos;s better is the sheer number of disguises available but it&apos;s worse in that if you try DISGUISE yourself and don&apos;t have any instinct, people will damn near instantly detect/become suspicious of you (and it&apos;s worse on higher difficulties), rather than the old system where it was more or less based on doing strange/out of character actions.  The point shooting aspect is kind of cool if you feel like playing this more like an action game, though useless otherwise. The contracts mode is a fun addition which adds more replay value to the game.
<br>There are still many ways to approach missions, though certain missions have WAY more freedom than others.  As the game currently stands it&apos;s fun but unstable for many people including myself, and wouldn&apos;t recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2881914">Expand</a></span>

This game starts off with various missions with multiple outcomes and planning, but this quickly changes.  Later levels have minimal variations and it just becomes a sneaking game where you try to pick people off one at a time.  I remember the iconic missions of the first Hitman where you dress as a chef and poison the food then watch the target choke to death.  It&apos;s unbelievable that wearing a uniform does almost nothing and you are still recognized as an enemy.  This fact alone depletes half the style of the game. This game does not feel like a Hitman game at all and is just a sneak around and pick people off style game which provides limited entertainment and minimal replayability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2911104">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Horrible game mechanics, horribly linear, horrible story that is boring and makes no sense, every single boss kill is incredibly anticlimactic, this game is absolutely horrible, from beginning to end.
<br>
<br>Not to mention misleading the consumer by releasing trailers and demos that have almost nothing to do with the actual game.</span>

More linear maps, few actually assassination-missions, a checkpoint system that discourages the hitman-sandbox gamestyle, a checkpoint system that doesnt save the gameworld, the new disguise system that turns the gameplay into cover based stealth, and you cant customize your loadout anymore. However as a cover-based stealth game with some hitman elements the game is quite average. The stealth works alright, the checkpoint-system is still awful, the visuals are great, the crowds looks great, there are some cool-looking maps, there are still several ways to complete your goals, the story is not all that good but the game is quite atmospheric. Stay away from this game if you are looking for the good old sandbox-style perfect-murder hitman gameplay. If you are looking for a stealth game with a twist then pick the game up for a cheap price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2921454">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Absolution suffers from the same condition that many television series do - it suffers when it tries to be about the characters and not their work. Absolution tries to introduce a more personal aspect of the game, showing how Mr 47 is not just an emotionless killer-for-hire but is in fact a human - this is the girls first mistake, as it is jarring and unpleasant to have the totally professional Mr 47 be risking life to do something out of character.
<br>
<br>Secondly, opposed to the large, open level design of previous games, in which 47 had a huge sandbox to play in and plan out elaborate assassinations, now you have levels that are broken up into smaller, linear sub-levels, making it feel less like Hitman and more like a generic sneaking game.
<br>In previous games, assassination contracts felt interesting and engaging. The people 47 was hired to kill were mostly scum who deserved to die, and you would get into the mindset of &quot;Killing scum, AND getting paid for it? Awesome!&quot; Now, most of the people you have to kill are just people who are in your way.
<br>
<br>For anyone who has never played a Hitman game before, Absolution may score an 8/10, but for anyone who has, I&apos;d say it&apos;s a 6 out of ten. It is still technically Hitman, but it&apos;s not the Hitman you remember, and it will probably not be the Hitman you were hoping for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2921031">Expand</a></span>

Is it as good as Hitman Blood Money?  No it isn&apos;t, but that doesn&apos;t mean this is a complete failure.  They made some mistakes with level design, the levels are a lot more closed off and linear than past games.  For example you walk through a door which takes you to the next section of the mission, but there is no going back - its like entering a new level, the &quot;open world&quot; feel of it is totally removed.
<br>
<br>Weapon load-outs before the mission starts are gone, no more planning ahead how you want to kill your target, if you want to carry your sniper rifle in the briefcase and LOOK for a vantage point to strike from.  No, instead the one of the few levels that does give us a sniper rifle in it, it is available in the only room on the map, and the only one that has a clear vantage point to the target.  That is not acceptable, the levels should not be designed with sniper rifles in them already.
<br>
<br>The disguise mechanic is flat out broken and is painful to use without getting spotted, the whole idea of Hitman is you should be able to sneak in and out unnoticed using disguises - instead what they have done is messed up the disguises so much that you always get spotted, the result is instead of walking around trying to blend in you have to sneak around like an idiot hiding from everyone.
<br>
<br>This all said some levels are gems, and are more like the old Hitman games we all loved, and the disguise mechanic works well, the thing is it almost feels like some levels they nailed it, and others were as if they were designed by people who hadn&apos;t a clue how to make a Hitman game.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is good, its modernised which is necessary, on the next game I would like to see the faults in the level design fixed, I would like to see the briefcase brought back with sniper rifle, and I would like weapon loadouts at the start if the mission to return as well as fixed disguises.  Please Square Enix, get rid of the &quot;Instinct&quot; thing, its crap.. the batman vision is useless and not necessary, I didn&apos;t use it at all when I played, it just wasn&apos;t useful.  Bring back the map and ability to look through doors, if you bring back the map then you can have bigger levels.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a lot of negative points in this review, true, but ultimately it is not a bad game and is worth playing - simply because, it is still Hitman, and it is refreshing to have a new Hitman game after so many years.  I just hope in the next one they listen to their fans and fix some of the problems for the next game.
<br>
<br>If you like Hitman, play this game... it may not be as good as the past Hitman games, but it is as close to a Hitman game as you&apos;re going to get right now, and it plays quite well when it works</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2917401">Expand</a></span>

You still have different approaches but you can&apos;t plan any of them and often have to choose one at random because the consequences are unclear. In one mission you can choose to disguise yourself as an electrician or try to sneak in around the back but you have no way of knowing what the difference is so you choose randomly. You can&apos;t bring your own weapons or gear either, so the game comes up with the most stupid excuses to place sniper rifles and other useful things on site for you to find. It doesn&apos;t make sense.
<br>
<br>The world feels alive and each character has their own story, which is cool, but in the end your role is merely that of a spectator and not a protagonist. You&apos;re there to watch in awe how cool the world looks, not to play in it. Such a shame - great potential, awful execution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=4054611">Expand</a></span>

Objective markers, clearly marked pathways. These things pretty much are anathema to the previous hitman titles. As others have said this feels more like a splinter cell title, which isn&apos;t a bad thing it&apos;s just not what it said on the tin.</span>

It removes the core of Hitman, that is planning to perfection on how to kill your targets. It&apos;s gone in this game, save a few levels.
<br>
<br>However, the game has great game mechanics. Had these been implemented into bigger maps and a less pretentious storyline, it would have worked. Other than the Instinct feature, the game benefited from it&apos;s great controls.
<br>
<br>It isn&apos;t without it&apos;s faults though. The disguise system is horrendously imbalanced and doesn&apos;t help you at all. Considering it&apos;s a core feature of the Hitman series, this hits hard.
<br>
<br>Though the game has it&apos;s moments. Levels like, King of Chinatown, Terminus Hotel, Hunter and Hunted, Streets of Hope, and Blackwater Park are brilliant, and are some of the best in the series. Although, the other levels are completely unplayable, since the player will have no ambition to grudge through them and their linear design void of player choice.
<br>
<br>If you see this game on a Steam Sale, I&apos;d say you should buy it to see just what it&apos;s about. That doesn&apos;t change the fact that it&apos;s a huge disappointment in the series after Blood Money.
<br>You&apos;re better off purchasing the HD Collection if you&apos;re a console player.
<br>
<br>This game had huge potential IO. Fix it with the next game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3096670">Expand</a></span>

But as a fan of Hitman Blood Money, I can say it does detract from the direction of its predecessor and fails on this regard. In previous installments, I would work hard to gather all the guns and use them on replays just for sheer fun. This no longer happens on single player as the unlocks can be only used in contracts mode. I don&apos;t like this. Bring back the customizable weapons for single player! I&apos;d give it a 6 but it is still a good game so it gets a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3188251">Expand</a></span>

The most notable thing in Hitman: Absolution is that this non-linearity has been pretty much removed. With the combinations of small, chopped up levels that &apos;follow up&apos; on each other, there is too much room for error, the game has become too simple, too linear and is entirely not suited for a second playthrough, not even on another difficulty. The first story playthrough is enjoyable and at times classic Hitman stuff we love to see, but that is where this game abruptly ends. It has no replay value because of the simplicity of its level design and the lack of original Silent Assassin hits (they exist, but are sometimes nothing more than flipping a single switch or making a headshot with the TRG).

On the other hand  graphics are great, story is good. Its like old Hitman mixed with Call Of Duty. They tried to make it more for the big crowd of players at the cost of the Hitmans soul. Its still a Hitman, but not like you remember him.</span>

<br>
<br>No more world-wide contracts  no more assassinations and briefing. Instead, we were &quot;gifted&quot; with an uninspiring and boring story filled with a low quality drama, and  with a cartoonish cowboy  as an antagonist.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m holding myself not to rate this  failure in shape of game  a ZERO   and i won&apos;t do so just because of the engine, the well-polished graphics, the killing and shooting system and  last but not least, the  game&apos;s length.
<br>
<br>All those factors make the game enjoyable for the newcomers to the series;  all of whom, comprehensibly, doesn&apos;t give a   if the devs KILLED the Hitman Series or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3731802">Expand</a></span>

<br>+Nice Graphics/Animations
<br>+Nice voice acting
<br>+Dragging corps with the fiber wire
<br>
<br>(-The game isn&apos;t made by the same devs)
<br>That says a lot. Nothing more to say about this.
<br>
<br>(-Bad Story/Cliche Characters)
<br>The story isn&apos;t that bad. The problem is that it was obviously made for a Movie, not a game.
<br>They made a good 3D movie and butchered it with bad gameplay. The Story broke the gameplay of the whole franchise so in the end, it&apos;s worst than better.
<br>Most protagonists and antagonists simply doesn&apos;t fit well in the Hitman lore and feels absurde. (Blake, Birdie, Sanchez, Sexy Nuns...)
<br>All that comes with the devs team changing and the AAA title mash-up in a lot of ways.
<br>Heck, I would say that they mashed-up AAA game Titles with AAA movie titles.
<br>
<br>(-James Seth Lynch)
<br>The proof that Absolutio Devs cares more about kayne &amp; Lynch than Hitman.
<br>
<br>(-Adam Jensen&apos;s DLC)
<br>Another Proof with J.S. Lynch that the game is a big and bad AAA titles mash-up.
<br>
<br>(-Abusive use of swears.)
<br>It&apos;s not that big of a deal, but the first time we encounter Blake Dexter, he says the &quot;F&quot; word 12 times.
<br>
(-Bad &quot;Over-the-shoulder&quot; view.)
Every other Hitman games were TPS and weren&apos;t using this bad and stupid POV that block Half your screen. H2:SA was on console so it&apos;s not a matter of &quot;consolisation&quot; but a matter of dumbing down everything for the CoD/Mass Effect/Etc audience. Obviously.

(-No map / Instinct / Small levels / Checkpoint system / )
There wouldn&apos;t be any Checkpoint save system if it was a real Hitman game. And as many said, when they reload back to a checkpoint, every enemies are back and put you in bad situations. The save system is broken. The whole game is broken. Everytime something is changed to the worst, it brings something else down with it.

Instinct because No Map
No Map Because the levels are small
Checkpoints because the level are small again.
In overall, the level design is crap.

(-Stupid and useless scoring system)
Makes you feel punished for trying to have fun.

(-Can&apos;t close doors/No look through keyholes/Turn on switch)
Why? Because of bad AI scripting and bad level design, again, probably!

(-No weapon selection)
Even if 47 isn&apos;t with the agency anymore, what exactly stops 47 from having his weapons from the last level. As 47, If I wasn&apos;t with the agency anymore, I would dig myself a hole and make my own stach of items.

(-No Sniper Case/Magic pockets)
Something that was there since the very first hitman game has been removed for no good reason.

(-Quick time events)
Casualisation.

(-Can&apos;t kill most targets)
What&apos;s the point of being a Hitman if you don,t kill your targets? There&apos;s none.

(-Escaping levels)
Again, am I supposed to feel like a hitman or something? Because it doesn&apos;t feel like it.

(-Stupid cutscenes / &quot;One of a Kind&quot; mission)
The &quot;One of a kind&quot; mission let you play something that should&apos;ve been a cutscene while Target kills are done within cutscenes. This is plain and simply stupid.

(-Stupid Gun Game to get your ballers back)
Bad gameplay design, bad story line.

(-Garbage Bins everywhere)
Obviously, it&apos;s for the casual no-brainers with one cell in the brain. Unable to hide a body if there isn&apos;t 50 garbage bin around you.

(-Total disregard by the compagny for the real fans)
Trying to milk a franchise isn&apos;t a good way to please the fans. At all.

The game is bad as a stealth game and is even worst as an Hitman game.
It&apos;s a total disrespect to the fans.

47 is dead and trolls dance on his corps.
A sad time for loyal Hitman fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3923383">Expand</a></span>

It is a decent action-stealth game with some good moments and is worth playing through but as a Hitman game I mostly can&apos;t stand it. It just feels like Agent 47 got assimilated into the barely indistinguishable pool of action-stealth games. Having played and loved the Hitman series since day 1 on its original PC platform, many of the gameplay systems and input styles in Absolution have the stink of console development all over them. The usage of quick-time events and button hitting just for the sake of it made me think &quot;this is so annoying and stupid, why the hell is is this in a Hitman game?&quot; at least every 30 minutes. The levels are broken up into small linear sections instead of big playgrounds; there is no big inventory full of items and weapons to work with; no customized weapon lovin&apos; for the missions; no briefcase and sniper rifle; the disguise  detection system feels like a contrived third-wheel; no regard for the magical concealment of long guns; there&apos;s plenty more but no need to pile on here. There are indeed improvements to some important systems such as movement, shooting, body concealment/disposal, distraction options, and throwing things. Sound, graphics, framerate, stability and controls are all very good. It&apos;s just that...as a Hitman game...Absolution is a huge disappointment after Blood Money  which I still play 6 years and hundreds of hours later. They traded some of the deepest and most distinctive elements of being Agent 47 for console game pacing and lots of cutscenes to tell a crap story. If these tradeoffs turn out to be permanent for the series, then Agent 47 just jumped the shark. Still, even with all the Hitman-series-related disappointments, Absolution a good game on its own and you should play it and think for yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2955903">Expand</a></span>

<br>Everything that was achieved</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">As a long-time Hitman fan I was really looking forward to Hitman: Absolution. It has been one of the BIGGEST disappointments in my life as a gamer. Actually, right now, I cannot think of a bigger disappointment. The last Splinter Cell was bad as hell, but I knew that for a fact before and am not a big Splinter Cell fan, so it didn&apos;t touch me as bad.
<br>Everything that was achieved gameplay-wise with Blood Money has literally been kicked in the balls so hard it couldn&apos;t move and was then left to die in the desert.
<br>
<br>The biggest problems are the linear levels, the USELESS disguises, a checkpoint system with no manual save option and the absence of a map but instead the introduction of &quot;Instinct&quot;, some lame supernatural power that 47 suddenly possesses that makes him see through walls and also into the future as he predicts enemies&apos; paths. Gone are the times where you had to stand by, take your time and learn about your enemy. You simply hold down [CTRL] now.
<br>Linearity is the biggest level-design problem that literally kills the entire game. The first level after the tutorial was actually pretty OK for a first level, although a little small  and still nothing compared to the awesomeness of the vineyard level in Blood Money  but still, it was OK and I was having hopes that all the bad things I heard before about the game being &quot;casualized&quot; were a bit too much. But beginning with the second level, the game is a downhill roller-coaster.
<br>I have not finished the game. I couldn&apos;t bear it. The levels got too worse. I started with the 2nd highest difficulty because a few months back I read somewhere that the devs claimed to have added those features for &quot;newcomers&quot; to the Hitman franchise, and that hardcore Hitman players could deactivate those, similar to Deus Ex 3 (actually a f*in awesome game), where it actually worked. But with that choice, I killed all fun. You have to LEARN the specific mechanics of this game, that have nothing to do with any Hitman game before it. The problem on a higher &quot;difficulty&quot; is that interactive spots will not be highlighted with &quot;instinct&quot;-vision  and still, there is no f*in map that could show those spots (I mean stuff like specific items or interactive objects in the world that would help you get to your objective, marked with an exclamation mark on the map before). At first I couldn&apos;t get through some sort of stupid library level, dumbed down the difficulty level so I could see the spots by activating &quot;instinct&quot; and after that, the level got beatable. Still, everything about this was against any logic in any Hitman game ever.
<br>Another level highlight includes being chased by a helicopter that shoots at you (remember 47 doing stuff like that?). In one specific scene, you have to crouch (pressing C or [CTRL] once), then lean against boxes (pressing another button once) and then LITERALLY just keep pressing A and E  A to move to the left side of the screen and E to keep scampering from box to box. All the while, the helicopter keeps shooting through windows and destroys all the boxes. You can feel how this scene was supposed to be thrilling and intense, but the helicopter didn&apos;t even hit 47 once. The ONLY point of this scene, gameplay-wise, is to hold down A and keep tapping E.
<br>A few levels down, I was so filled with disappointment and also rage about my destroyed memories about the adventures I had with 47, that I HAD to uninstall it.
<br>
<br>This list of problems is in NO way complete, but I don&apos;t want to keep writing forever. Those are just the things I kept in mind.
<br>I actually registered on this page just to write this review, to somehow channel my anger and letdown. I give Hitman: Absolution a 2/10 for three reasons: the graphics were pretty goddamn good, it remembered me about all the fun I had with 47 in the past (by showing me the exact opposite) and it made sure I will play the GODLIKE Blood Money again soon.
<br>
<br>On a side note: it is sad. It is sad how games are being casualized for the sake of &quot;opening up to a bigger audience&quot;. We&apos;ve seen it with so many franchises in the past years, one of the more memorable being the new Splinter Cell. I hope that enough other gamers will wake up to this and boycott this, when necessary.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3191904">Expand</a></span>

Now they have done like all the other big gaming companies; make drastic changes, and massive U-turn of gameplay (D3, CNC4 S3). Big gaming companies must realize, that change the essential gaming mechanics, when the game is as big as it is, is a very severe move. The things we loved from the OLD Hitmans (Codename 47, Hitman 2); &quot;Professional hits&quot; (Not running away from cops), loadouts and disguises that meant something. In Blood Money, we did get all that, PLUS a noterity system, resulting in even more consequences in your actions you make. This made the game even more exciting, as you could get caught, or you could be a &quot;silent assasin&quot;. In Absolution, we get a kind of &quot;bourne&quot; feeling, as he is running away from cops all the time, no loadouts, and not so many actual professional &quot;hits&quot;.  They have made a new disguise mechanism, which is pretty annoying sometimes and pretty much pretty hard, and frustrating when playing on a more hard difficulty. They made the missions linear, as there are not many ways to kill your target. They made more cutscenes, which makes it more COD-FPS-MOVIE like, as we have not seen in the earlier releases of Hitman. They have changed the game so drastically, that it doesn&apos;t deserve the Hitman title. And im not even refering to graphics, because i am only basing my score on the gameplay. Because what makes a good game, is the gameplay. I hope for a new title, which could be Blood Money 2, as we want a cold-killer hitman and his professional hits, NOT a Hitman with feelings and sympathy. If you know the Lore of hitman, you know that is not him.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2798101">Expand</a></span>

I am kind of embarrased by this game. Graphics are good but there are some problems with game itself. Like you cant equip weapons of your choice in Story mode one only Revolver and fiberwire. We can use weapons in Contracts but whats the point of playing online when we cant fight against each other.you can kill the person by punching on head but it takes a lot of bullets to kill.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2867290">Expand</a></span>

I bought Absolution on Steam as soon as it came out, because I had faith that it would be a Hitman game (or at least something close). I wish I could go back in time and warn myself, not so that I could save my money, but just so that I wouldn&apos;t be one of the many gamers who actually rewarded the people responsible for this enormous stab in the back. The fact that the developers had the audacity to call this &quot;Hitman&quot; and the fact that so many people seem to love it is about the most depressing and disturbing thing I could have possibly imagined. As a massive fan of all four previous Hitman games, I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that Absolution betrays virtually everything that made Hitman so special. Instead of amazingly open-ended self-contained missions, complete freedom of exploration and experimentation, careful planning and execution, and everything else that (until now) has made Hitman so great, we get a linear, typical, mainstream, and utterly forgettable pile of garbage with the worst story of any game I&apos;ve ever played. Even 47 himself acts nothing like the real 47, even losing his signature look after the first two missions. But the most depressing thing of all is, because so many people seem to love Absolution, I think it&apos;s safe to say that Blood Money will be the last Hitman game. I had to give Absolution a 0/10 not because it&apos;s the worst game ever made, but simply because it pretends to be a Hitman game. To any true Hitman fan reading this review, please don&apos;t make the same mistake I did. Save your money for a real game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2803163">Expand</a></span>

I admit. I wanted Blood Money with new graphics and new missions. I wanted larger areas, more weapons, more accident setups. Even excuses you can say to guards, depending of your knowledge of the level, mention that the shower is broken upstairs, that&apos;s why you are in a restricted area to fix it, social engineering, additional ways to sneak, maybe even hack computers and technology devices, like spies, carry new and ingeniously hidden weapons on your person.
<br>
<br>What did I get? A dumb-down arcade version of one of my favorite game. A broken disguise system, a ridiculously unrealistic  instinct system, which would get you banned in most online games. I never wanted easy. I wanted to walk around a level, explore it, save a certain points to try things over and over to perfection, than replay the level and attempt to complete it as a silent assassin.

<br>the good : Great mechanics the new engine feels a lot smoother then previous ones
<br>Nice idea adding the ability to estimate your enemy&apos;s location with the &quot;Hitman Sense&quot;
<br>The Bad: There is a lot to say here ,First of all and this is the most important part the inability to choose your equipment prior to your mission and plan in advance what kind of game you want to be playing turns this game from hitman to just another pretty shooter , shows me the developers are not listening to their audience
<br>the fact that you give us a cool new way of interaction doesnt make this part the main part of the game and infact the single player feels as though its the &quot;no so important&quot; part of the game the AI is either too smart or too dumb (depending on what level you play)
<br>the weapons don&apos;t feel like the cool assassin&apos;s weapons they where in hitman
<br>and since you cant choose them they simply feel forced on you shooting someone directly in the head before he even notices you (like i could do in blood money) like a true weapons expert is really difficult
<br>as a true hitman lover i have to say i HATE this game
<br>the only similarity between it and the hitman series is the Main character and even there it starts to feel like they are trying to make him less of an expert assassin and more like a mortal man learning his way around the world - its been done before and its pointless
<br>maybe they are trying to introduce a new character to the series (i hope not) but this is a really bad way of doing it
<br>all in all im giving it a 5 simply because i do not want to kill the review completely im going to stop ranting now (i have a lot of bad things to say)
<br>the only thing i want to say is : THIS IS NOT A HITMAN GAME</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2806093">Expand</a></span>

Hitman is now the next game stealth game franchise to be over influenced by the modern gaming audience. I hope the developers understand that to make the game good, they don&apos;t have to make it appeal to every single gamer that exists, because that seems what the minds behind Hitman Absolution have attempted, with disastrous results. Regarding the story, this game seems to force you into an at best, satisfactory story, that no one asked for, because that&apos;s not what made the Hitman franchise previously great, it was its gameplay, that the dovelopers thought required a major overhaul for some unknown reason. This has caused ALL the gameplay aspects that was loved by the Hitman community to be removed, and morphed into a Splinter Cell Conviction atmosphere. You are at war with yourself while playing this game because of the combination of Splinter Cell gameplay, with Hitman objectives. It&apos;s as if this game is promoting you to kill everyone in your way, because there are no consequences for it. It has no effect on the aftermath of the mission nor the game&apos;s storyline itself. And if you have the will to attempt the stealthy approach, be prepared for a very frustrating chore, due to the broken disguise system. It&apos;s understandable that a handful of mechanics in a small town know each other well to recognise someone new. This would also be fair for difficulty, as they would detect you more rapidly as the difficulty level increases, but as there are a few of them, circumventing them may be a challenge, but not an impossible task. However it&apos;s completely unrealistic that every policeman in a major metropolitan city by the thousands, would be able to recognise every single fellow cop from memory, and be able to spot an imposter from 30 metres away. Speaking of realism, the inventory system has been made even more poor and unjustified than that of Blood Money. In Absolution, when you have all filled slots you are carrying: 4 pistols, Fibre Wire, A melee object of varied size, An assault rifle, A bunch of c4, and a sniper rifle. Ironically, the dovelopers have called this change to the inventory system another &quot;realistic addition to the game&quot; along with the disguise system. Another thing that&apos;s most about this game is that most of the missions have no targets. This drastically changes the source of the motivation to continue playing this game. In Blood Money, the motivation was to kill the target, which every level had at least one, in innovative and unique ways, all while trying to achieve the challenging, but greatly sattisfying Silent Assassin rating. Whereas in Absolution, the motivation has shifted to pursuing the story, and when the story is not even that satisfying itself, it makes completing the game rather challenging. Fortunately though, the true strive for Silent Assassin still is retained in the new Contracts multiplayer mode. Allowing players to choose targets out of the segments of Absolution&apos;s levels grants that strive for the perfect kill that has been lost in the story, and is perhaps Absolution&apos;s only redeeming factor. Overall, Hitman Absolution is a mess hidden behind shiny graphics. Since graphicsalone don&apos;t make a good game, we can see the mess itself. This game that should not have undergone the complete overhaul it had gone through. Everything that had the potential to make this game great was right in front of the dovelopers, the previous games of the franchise, yet they somehow decided that they should morph Hitman into a Splinter Cell shooter game. Also, if IO Interactive decide to further pursue this series, please don&apos;t dig the grave of the Hitman franchise deeper by covering it up with more Splinter Cell like games. However if you plan to reanimate the true core principles of Hitman in an upcoming game, go for it. Just remember the gameplay of Blood Money, and hopefully you&apos;ll get it right. This game gets a 4/10 because the story is satisfactory, not completely satisfying, earning it a 1/2. The gameplay, Hitman&apos;s most important component has unfortunately undergone a major change for the worse. Everything from the inventory system to the disguise mechanic is completely broken, giving it 0/2. This game excels in the Contracts multiplayer, as it maintains the core principles of a Hitman game, earning it 2/2. Absolution fails to motivate you to continue in the story to the point where it is just a faint question, resulting you to look up spoilers on the Internet, and you will not be surprised, because there is no major plot twist, but it does make you strive to be the best in the multiplayer, earning 1/2. Finally, Hitman Absolution spits on everything that has made the franchise great, and most likely ruins any chance of it being pursued in the future, giving it 0/2. This ultimately results in Hitman Absolution getting a total of 4/10, unfortunately, the honest truth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2863568">Expand</a></span>

First, I feel the Instinct mode it&apos;s a better alternative than the overview map of the older games. They put in the option to increase difficulty to shut it off, which is good. One big let down for me, is there is no save system in the game, just a stupid check point system which really awful.  In reality, only your position in the area is saved, though, not who you killed or anything else it seems.  I found out that if you get guns in one area and then go to the next area, you lose everything you just got.  There is not selection of guns when you start a new part either, and gone is the briefcase-- the sniper rifle just appears out of the thin air-- just terrible.  That other NPCs you dress like are most suspicious of you sounds like a good idea, but it completely ruins the game because you have to constantly use instinct to try to avoid being detected or sneak passed them anyway. Because of this, you will probably just end up killing a bunch of people, and find yourself not really giving much care about using disguises...I found myself staying in my suit and just sneaking around, and using cover...which really got kind of boring.   The game tells you that turning your back to someone will stop them from being suspicious usually, but that rarely worked for me. You can use certain places to &apos;hide&apos; when someone is getting suspicious, but these places are too few. The AI didn&apos;t seem like it was very consistent either. Sometimes I would play through an area and everyone was suspicious of me all the time, and other times I&apos;d play through the same way, and it was like I was just blending in without effort. The storyline is pretty good, the voice acting is good, and the graphics are good.  The lighting seemed a little &apos;off&apos;- perhaps it was the overuse of reflective surfaces that gives the world a sort of washed-out look sometimes. Some areas didn&apos;t seem like they offered many different ways to complete them, unlike other Hitman games where it seemed like there were many ways to complete an assassination (which kept you coming back and playing it over to try to figure out all the possible ways)-- here it seems like there might be 2 to 4 ways at most, and that is about it.  It feels like a very linear game, instead of the classic sandbox style game Hitman has always been. The world you play in is not very interactive at all-- most of the objects are just for decoration and 47 can&apos;t mess with much or rig things up to have &apos;accidents&apos; happen-- the choices seem limited, and very shallow. Many of the areas are not very large, and most buildings can&apos;t be accessed to explore. The Contracts feature was a bit of a let down. Instead of creating some unique locations for the Contracts, they just used the same areas and same people from the storyline-- hardly any real effort was put into it.  Basically, Contracts is just a a boring &apos;social&apos; element they added to the game, which feels more like an after-thought rather than something planned from the beginning. I am hoping that there will be DLC that will expand this game-- not just guns, suites and disguise packs either, and some patches to fix it up. In the end Hitman: Absolution is nothing but a mediocre game, that is good for a couple of play throughs at most.  Well, if you can tolerate the check point system, the poor AI performance, the lack of options and linear game play, and the disappointment of approaching your target, only to watch 47 kill them in a cut scene. I can see myself playing through it again maybe one more time, and trying a few more things out. But ultimately it will end up being deleted from my local Steam library in the very near future.  Maybe some DLC will resurrect it from the Steam Cloud and I can play it once more, or perhaps the game will get the Steam Workshop on PC, and provide hours of replay with mods and user created content, and improvements. I highly doubt that will happen though...still one can dream of better days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2805655">Expand</a></span>

<br>&quot;This is truly one of the most definitive Hitman experiences out there, there are so many more options compared to the previous games&quot;
<br>-  All the spirit of the hitman series is gone. Each map of this game is a path which leads you to a cut-scene full of ridiculous clich&#xE9;s. &quot;there is contracts mode, which enables you to customize and create your very own hits and share them with the community.&quot;
<br>- Are you kidding me?! The contracts mode consists of killing someone in a level already made by the developers and not customizable at all.
<br>
<br>&quot;It&apos;s hard to go in depth about the AI because of how diverse and complex it is, given the multitude of situations that they react differently in each and every time.&quot;
<br>- Wow, I laughed at this one. The AI always react the same way! They can notice you even if you wearing a disguise, 30 m away and shows your back! They added this stupid system where you have to press Ctrl to make the disguise work seriously! And when you&apos;re out of &quot;adrenaline&quot; or whatever they call it, you have to kill to be able to disguise yourself again.....
<br>
<br>I really feel like we did not play the same game, bud389. I give a 2 because the graphics are fine, that is all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2929678">Expand</a></span>

Small maps and the introduction of sub-levels and checkpoints makes the game feel very linear. Not to mention the awful instinct system that allows you to see enemies and points of interest through walls and is required to make your disguises work. And enemies are too easily fooled by simply throwing a randomly acquired object in their vicinity as a distraction.
<br>
<br>Many of the levels simply involve getting from one side of the map to the other (usually a door, staircase or elevator) without any assassination target. It&apos;s more Splinter Cell than Hitman. What happened to the large sand-box maps of the previous game (Blood Money) that made it so enjoyable, challenging and replayable?
<br>
<br>But for me, the biggest failure is the attempt to drive the game by a strong (but poorly written/very disjointed) narrative, rather than simply having a series of missions loosely connected by an underlying story arch (as in Blood Money). I want to be a Hitman, not Sam Fisher on the run.
<br>
<br>That said the graphics are gorgeous and some of the maps are very immersive and the attention to detail is impressive (eg walking through a crowd and being able to listen into multiple conversations going on around you). I also like the fact that enemies don&apos;t simply shoot on sight if you&apos;re caught trespassing, they will now approach and attempt to arrest you (and you can fake surrender). And the challenge system and contracts mode can be good (but not necessarily wholesome) fun and add some replayability to the game. Though I miss the ability to customise my loadout for the story missions.
<br>
<br>I would rate this game 7/10. Lot&apos;s of potential, but ultimately let down by too much tweaking and dumbing down after the very successful formula that was Blood Money. A wasted opportunity really, let&apos;s hope the next installment is better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2796390">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll find too many things that&apos;ll make you go: &quot;Wait a minute, this is ridiculous and even I could have come up with a smarter, better solution to that problem than the one I&apos;m presented with.&quot; Maybe (hopefully) future patches will adjust at least some of the big issues.

Because I don&apos;t want another heart broken fan of this series. Now let me tell something about the game, in the game there is a shiny bald guy, who was once very famous for being not detected under disguise but it this game he is too familiar to everyone  that even under mask people are able to detect him from a mile away, That ruined the whole thing. Game story is linear. Its previous sandbox type game play is completely lost. All you can do that is try to sneak in (which is not a practical solution for this game) but  most of the time you have to bang you enemy just like typical third person shooter. So the bottom line is its a heart breaking disappointment for the fan of this series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2865056">Expand</a></span>

EVERYTHING that was good about Blood Money has been removed (i.e. customizable gear, sandbox style gameplay, funny kill animations... just to name a few).  And apparently rolling from behind one couch to another and crawling through air ducts is more realistic than a disguise actually working? Or is it more fun? The answer to those questions is NO, at least for me. I stopped playing when at some point I was wearing some chipmunk suit that covered 47&apos;s face, and was still being recognized from across the map. I play without disguises and you end up listening one long, boring NPC conversation after another.  I just needed to make sure I add another 0 score for this game, which is why  I signed up for this site.  It bothered me that people are rating this game positively. I pre-ordered the game because I was in denial that the developers could screw up the franchise too bad after Blood Money, and I wanted to support the developers. Oops! Won&apos;t make that mistake again.  In fact, anybody involved in this atrocity deserves to be blacklisted from game design, and a job in general, and their kids should starve to death.  If I can stop just one person from buying this piece of crap, then I&apos;ve done something good with my life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3018136">Expand</a></span>

No, this isn&apos;t a Hitman game, those aren&apos;t painfully linear with silly unlock systems and scavenger hunts. No, no, I&apos;m sure you must be wrong, this is definitely a Splinter Cell game. It&apos;s a really good Splinter Cell game too. It would make for a pretty poor Hitman game though...</span>

<br>It is safe to say I have played all of the hitman games by now. I will say for a fact this is not a hitman game. There are tons of elements that Hitman:  Blood Money introduced that were stripped in absolution and that made the hitman franchise &quot;fun&quot;. Its fair to say everyone was expecting a Blood Money 2, but not everyone was willing to compromise for anything less. There are gamers out there who because they are influenced or drawn by the media will select absolution because of the Hollywood style action or the mainstream hype that brought them to the game. And then there are gamers who played the series and have  fundamental passion for playing over and over again the addictive and challenging sandboxes.    The problem with Absolution: There are no sandboxes. In fact, all the maps are linear. Each map forces the player to move forward in one direction without having the chance of going back and re-experience the same level.  Each map is a build up of smaller maps which are all joined together by checkpoints. So by having checkpoints, the developers have destroyed the one peice of formula that made hitman a sucess. A Sandbox. (start taking notes square enix)The developers have also made the gameplay into a &quot;duck and covering&quot; system, where the player is forced to hide and go seek  wall after wall, hiding in terror instead of hiding with Absolution. By doing this the player is unable to get any proper &quot;hits,&quot; has to use non-refillable instinct in order for a disguise to work, and above all loses points for attempting to kill anyone other than the target. Square Enix has demolished anything that was memorable or likeable about the hitman series and has suggested it all be shoved down a gumball machine for the player to experience. It is too bad that Eidos found its best interest for SE to take over, but im sure this game will please very much the mainstream audience as it was designed to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-absolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2789434">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>What a disappointing game. Disguises won&apos;t  work only when you use your &apos;instinct&apos;. How do you get instinct? By killing and hiding bodies. Contradiction in terms... There might be multiple ways of finishing levels but you can&apos;t experiment as there is no save option. When you fail, you will have to restart all over again including all the cut-scenes etc. Why did they have to destroy this franchise?</span>
