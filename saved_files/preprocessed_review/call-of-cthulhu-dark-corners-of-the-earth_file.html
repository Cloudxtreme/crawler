Puzzles unintuitive or strangely easy (you are done and do not realize it); shooter erratic and with an infinite amount of respawns; stealth with unreadable patrols to almost render this nice possibility unfeseable; etc. Anyway in most cases the game pulls through and no matter how frustrating it could become, and how close to real insanity it may push you towards, you very soon forget and forgive, since it has the virtue of truly making you curious of what is yonder the next, very dark, corner.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=411643">Expand</a></span>

The story is really what drives the game; without it there would be little value to it. I kept playing through all the bugs and difficult sequences just to find out what happens to Jack. After finishing the game I am more interested in reading H.P. Lovecraft than playing another Lovecraft based game. Be warned this game is one of the more difficult out there. Many long portions are played over and over again due to save system. The save system is designed to make the game more intense, but in the end it make it more tiresome than anything. I ran into one big glitch while fighting the Great Ones on the ship. The Great Ones would stop coming, but all my shipmates would continue firing at nothing. For some reason the game would not go to the next portion. I had to restore to a saved game from just as I got on the ship to resolve the problem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=392323">Expand</a></span>

The main character is influenced by the things he sees, and he gets (annoyingly sometimes) dizzy, hears voices, etc., as he &quot;loses sanity&quot;. Find a quiet place to hide and you calm back down, so its generally not a problem, per se. The developers kept the screen clean, so there is no HUD or crosshair. You aim weapons with the metal sites that have become more popular recently (e.g., STALKER, COD4). The plot pulls from many different Lovecraft stories, but perhaps follows the Shadow over Insmouth most closely. If you are looking for a game that has a story to it, I highly recommend this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=407624">Expand</a></span>

I expecialy liked the fact that they didn&apos;t add the crosshair, it really adds to the immersion and difficulty. But I don&apos;t think that anyone would play this game because of the shooting part (btw you only get your first gun after about 40% of the game). The game really shines when you don&apos;t have any weapons and must use stealth and your wits to outsmart your opponents. It also isn&apos;t a game to play if you want to blow up some steam, because it also includes some &quot;brain&quot; because of the many puzzles you&apos;ll have to solve.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3822101">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are on par with Call of Duty and there was nothing wrong with those or the fun to be had in that game. Don&apos;t get hung up on that. This is NOT a shooter, this is an adventure game, so if you want non-stop zombie killing this isn&apos;t the place to go. The game is creepy and does capture Lovecraft (almost). This isn&apos;t the early Alone in the Dark style...this is more horror movie based than fantasy. What bothers me, like Call of Duty did, is that the game appears &quot;wide open&quot; but in reality is restricted and has a &quot;stiffness&quot; to it where you need to stay near the path the game presents. The one other thing that bothers me like Call of Duty is that I get headaches from this graphic engine for some reason...no problems in any other first person games, just this style. I liked a lot of the atmosphere that was put into the game and it is fascinating at times with some of the creatures that appear. Having no HUD does make you feel like you are inside of the game world and when I got to Innsmouth and saw a guy peeing in an alley and another digging through the trash, that really suprised me and shows the depth these guys put into the game. Still it is difficult trudging at times through the game and I doubt I could feel motivated to sit all day and play; some of the &quot;fun&quot; is missing for me. Lovecraft stories aren&apos;t really about &quot;fun&quot; though, they are about the fantastic vs. puny humans. Yet at times I felt like this was more slaughterhouse than exploration of the quantum-occult wolrd that Lovecraft was best at telling. I give it a 7 (10 means perfection to me, which I think few games are)...not bad but the game needed a little something more to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=388060">Expand</a></span>

Usually I can ignore bugs and compensate to deal with tiny issues, but this game was full of (as much as I hate this term) game breaking bugs. First off: CRASHES GALORE! I have never seen a game crash this much, even when it was patched. You can&apos;t alt+tab and come back or it crashes. I know this because of the many times I had to (regrettably) look at a guide for the game because what you were supposed to do was so incredibly unclear and ridiculous that I had no other option. A random crowbar the same color as the texture it&apos;s sitting on in a random location that is necessary to progress? Check. A conveniently carved out hole in the middle of a solid wooden crate for you to crawl through to get behind an enemy gunner? Check. The final blow for me was at the first appearance of a real monster: a Shoggoth. Straight out of Lovecraft, terrifying as hell, aaaaand bugged. To pass it, the monster must attack you with it&apos;s tendril, which is supposed to stick in place so you can run past the spot it was blocking. Instead, half of the time it will one shot you, the other half it won&apos;t stick, it&apos;ll just go back to the default position instantly and get you stuck. After 3 days of constant frustration, this is where I quit. The shooting is also absolutely horrendous (I felt like I was playing the first Medal of Honor game, but worse), and unfair (instant death by headshot is incredibly common and unpreventable). The only good thing about this game was the horror elements; The sanity effects, the eerie mood, the sounds, everything was pure Lovecraft and it was fantastic. Sadly, I never got to experience it in full, because between every 5 minute horror sequence was 2 hours of frustrating, buggy shooting and nonsense. So disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=2070344">Expand</a></span>

The art design seems great and the inspirationg from HP Lovecraft is awesome, but this game is just not any good.

I really enjoyed this story and the mood set by the game, in fact for the first four hours the game was freaking me out. All hell started to break loose in the game.... there are many difficult sequences that end in death and require reloading....but as I was in it for the game-story-environment so I held in there. I leaned heavily on a walk-through to get through the game - but I could never finish it.... the last sequence was just to hard ! ! !

<br>
<br>Many people have discussed the game&apos;s instability and bugs, particularly on newer systems. This is all true, but the game&apos;s most major problem is poor design, pure and simple. The game commits numerous cardinal sins of game design that make the whole experience a frustrating mess for the player.
<br>
<br>When the game works, as it does occasionally, it is extremely eerie and atmospheric. In particular, the hotel escape is an excellent recreation of a sequence from Lovecraft&apos;s writing. Some of the gameplay choices, such as the sanity system, are also quite daring. Unfortunately, the game&apos;s moments of brilliance are all too few and do not make up for its horrendous failings.
<br>
<br>Additionally once you acquire weapons the game attempts to become Half-Life, but without Valve&apos;s finesse. The shooting destroys the game&apos;s tension and the dialogue and design also seem to go downhill from this point. That parallel is not accidental by the way - if you know Half-Life, you will see some *very* similar areas and puzzles in COC.
<br>
<br>Here are some of the major flaws with this game that will make you tear your hair out:
<br>
<br>&gt; Poor level design: A non-intuitive mess that will leave you wandering around levels aimlessly for hours. For instance, doors that you have previously tried and were locked will suddenly become open-able after you complete a seemingly unrelated task (e.g. turning the gas on in the next room).
<br>
<br>&gt; Poor game design: Jumps that can only be completed from a precise angle. Objects that take five clicks to be picked up and added to your inventory. Traps that require in-human micro-second timing to avoid and are instantly fatal.
<br>
<br>&gt; Poor puzzle design: Puzzles frequently require items to solve them. That sounds simple, but the game doesn&apos;t tell you what items you need, or even that what you are looking at is a puzzle at all. For instance, you might come across a heavy grate. If you have missed the crowbar earlier in the level (easily done thanks to poor level design and muddy textures) then you cannot open the grate. You will simply think this route is a dead-end and have no idea you need to find a crowbar, unless you read an FAQ. It&apos;s even possible to progress to a point where you cannot backtrack to get an item you need, making the puzzle unsolvable!
<br>
<br>To illustrate just how appalling these design problems are, here&apos;s an example of a typical COC experience. At one point in the game I spent about two hours trying to move past a street with several enemies in it. I tried sneaking. I tried fighting. Nothing worked. The reason? One of the enemies was invulnerable. Deliberately. This was how the designers chose to stop the player progressing in that direction. Instead of blocking off the street, they created an invulnerable enemy that looked like any other. As a result, many players will literally be throwing themselves against a brick wall. It turned out that I needed to pick up a certain object earlier in the level and then progress through a different area - but there was nothing to tell me this - no hint that I needed the item and no sign that the other route was the correct one. Welcome to COC!
<br>
<br>Add to these issues a waypoint saving feature that forces you to replay large sections when you die, unexpected game crashes and plenty of unavoidable &quot;instant death&quot; moments and you have a recipe for pain and frustration that will test your sanity more than your character&apos;s.
<br>
<br>All this leaves you facing two major irritations. One is that you will simply become lost, not knowing where to go or what to do next, and wander aimlessly until you stumble on the way forward by chance. The second is that you will know what you need to do, but the game&apos;s poor control systems will not allow you to do it. For example, you may need to crawl under a broken fan with split-second timing that takes 7-8 attempts - and each attempt requires you to reload and replay through the entire previous area.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: COC is not a diamond in the rough. It is a diamond in the septic tank, and I wish anyone who wants to try it the best of luck digging it out. If you are eager for the plot, watch a play-through on YouTube. Avoid this game at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4341796">Expand</a></span>

This would have enabled players to pick one of four characters and carry out their own investigation independently or team up with the others. A multiplayer version of the game would have allowed for on-line deathmatch battles in specifically designed levels. A lot of other features, such as high environment interactivity, were also scrapped due to budget and time constraints and problems with the level design. Multi-player would have drawn a larger interest from the PVP/PVE crowd who don&apos;t like single player games to enjoy with their friends. A larger RPG element and environment interactivity, along with editing tools would have created a community continuously willing to improve game play, graphics and providing new content to explore. This game has neither element. It&apos;s heavily scripted and very linear, with only one path through the chapters from start to finish. Lots of good things can be said, its scary, eerie and creepy. The sound quality is nice. Lovecraft&apos;s work in it. The graphics look nice. It has a small fan base to patch it well enough for playability, relative to other games currently available.  The vanilla version is buggier than Virginia, USA in the summertime.  The learning tutorial is non-existent, so you simply have to dive into the key mapping to know what you are doing. It&apos;s not the next best thing to propel the thriller/horror based video game genre to a whole new level.  I am sad that Bethesda Softworks had anything to do with its release, because it&apos;s nothing like Skyrim or Fallout.  It&apos;s Bethesda &apos;light&apos;. No light deserves to be in a Cthulhu game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=2605352">Expand</a></span>

First off, the sanity level was completely useless most of the time. At first it was entertaining, but then you realize that most of the shocking imagery that you must avoid to keep your sanity detracts from the over all feeling of horror. You find yourself walking by corpses, not looking at them, and that actually makes the whole scenario seem not as intense, not that I am a sicko and like to stare at mutilated corpses. I just feel that instead of the screen going crazy and the character killing himself, I feel that I myself would feel freaked out enough. Not to mention, this character has every single phobia in the book. He is afraid of heights, which is annoying because there are some parts where you need to look down to figure out on how to get back down to ground level. He has claustrophobia, which is a pain because you have to travel through vents. Had this been toned down in some areas and peaked in some areas, it would have been more enjoyable and freaky, rather then terribly annoying. The game is also easier to play on the x-box, being that the aiming is much easier. On the computer, the aiming is much harder, and very annoying. The ironsights aiming in other games, such as Red Orchestra, are far superior. It seemed as if I was playtesting a basic, earlier version of the game, in which all the bugs were not worked out yet. Trying to shift your aim slightly is near impossible, not to mention you cannot aim to great when leaning around corners, something that is possible, and I have done it while playing paintball. It can be done. The stealth would be better if you could move faster, instead of crawling slowly, and the stealth is near impossible at points because the game is so linear that you find yourself trying to hide while you and an enemy are both in a very tight hallway. It is much easier to overcome the whole idea of not killing every creature in a survival horror, which makes you not feel as fearful, being that you just blew away everything you are supposed to be afraid of (Food for Thought: Wouldn&apos;t killing everything affect your sanity more then looking down a ladder that goes down about ten feet? Wouldn&apos;t that kind of make you a gun toting psychopath? Especially if you beat them to death with Gordan Freeman&apos;s crowbar?) Many people complain that the NPC&apos;s are morons, and not the greatest fighters, even when armed, but this actually makes sense, don&apos;t you think? This is not some well trained army that you are fighting, just a bunch of idiot hicks. However, I did not think there be would be much gunfighting, more like shooting hordes of insane monsters with needle teeth and curved claws. And now, THE DAMN WALKING!!! What the hell?! There are man times where all you can do is hope that you are lucky and that you be able to run, ahem, WALK out of that collapsing building or away from the monster that can kill you with one hit. I could not beat the game until I read on how to hack the game and turn up the movement speed. Seriously, I think that is the only way to beat this game. The no HUD thing is pretty cool, as well as the health system (medkits only contain medical supplies such as splints, stitches, bandages, morphine, etc. which must be applied to a specific wound; your arm gets cut, bandage of stitch it, broken leg, limp to a safe spot and use a splint), but the game is far from realistic. First, why the hell can you not pick up guns from dead enemies?! How many times can I break my arm in a day?! I thought the damage through the whole game would accumulate or something, but now, once stick a splint on a broken limb, it magically is fixed and good as new, which is ridiculous. And back to the game be linear: it is annoying, and if you manage to do something very small yet outside the script, the whole game just freaks out. The game is loaded with an insane amount of other bugs, which can severely limit your experience. If this was a mod, I would be very surprised and more approving that a small independent team managed to make this on almost no budget. However, this was supposed to be a professional and well made game, and it simply wasn&apos;t. This is a game for people who are not associated with any of Lovercraft&apos;s work (because even so-so fans would s*** themselves at some of the more insane happenings later in the game) and want to have more of a semi interactive horror movie experience. That&apos;s how I think of it, as a movie, not a game at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=400332">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are good for its time of release (but if you&#x2019;re using a newer graphics card you might want to read up on installation) however the light effects are in summary &#x201C;dark and light&#x201D; this ruins a few of the stealth elements when there&#x2019;s a light on and your staring eye to eye with an enemy that doesn&#x2019;t notice you 2m in front of him. The gameplay is hit or miss depending on the level, the stealth and shooting is fine but without a sprint options all the chase scenes look like a corny silent film chase. Once you get the crowbar/guns it goes from being a Lovecraft survival horror game to Half Life in 1920&#x2019;s New England, start off with the crowbar  companions the die off all the time  government conspiracy with alien portals  better weapons  industrial facility  stationary claw/arm monster  alien sea world vs. alien space world  alien tech  final boss that&#x2019;s both easy and a letdown.
<br>
<br>Also there&#x2019;s a game breaking glitch at the boat level when you need to shoot the island&#x2019;s sages on PC with new graphics cards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3396707">Expand</a></span>

I was immediately encouraged by the look and eerie feel of everything the lighting ,sound, intriguing story, all seemed to work real well. Then I waited and kept waiting for some action to start.... waited some more... through horrendously long cinematics. Then ohh cool some action starts but wait.... I have no way to defend myself, not even my bare fists. oh well I ll just run from the fishmen for know I m sure I ll find a knife or stick or something soon..... I gave up when I was a third of the way through the game still without any means to make all this running and hiding more fun, though at least they load you up on bullets for the oh so non existent guns. All I can imagine is that some fairly talented game designers worked on the graphic / story portion, and a crack team of baboons was put in charge of the actual gamplay / control portion of it all. Don t get me wrong I enjoy a solid story immersed within a game, it definitely makes a game worth playing. But when it makes the thing so linear I feel more like I m watching a movie than playing a game... well thats just not enjoyable. Far and above worst game I&apos;ve ever played!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=395980">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Since I read all Lovecraft novels as a teenager, and I appreciate today both first-person shooters and adventure games, this one started with the exciting promise of a truly horrific adventure game.
<br>
<br>The first 2 hours of the game put me in the mood, with some thrilling and engaging moments in the retired city of Innsmouth. Unfortunately, I reached the &quot;wake-up-in-the-hotel-at-night-and-get-the-hell-out-of-here&quot; sequence in which I had to perform an escape with a non-human level of cold blood and accuracy.
<br>
<br>At first I told myself &quot;Now, that&apos;s pressure! These guys aren&apos;t joking!&quot; but after a dozen of attempts (assorted with the pain of viewing the preliminary cinematic) I ended up thinking it was a mix between sadism and sabotage.
<br>
<br>In a wicked way, the developers prefered to humiliate me instead of challenge me. Maybe some players do have the necessary level of insanity to pass this point, but this kind of test is not for me. The sad thing being that I could consider myself the target audience.
<br>
<br>So if you&apos;re a masochist gamer looking for a game that can torture you, this one is probably a great start.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4954997">Expand</a></span>

Lovecraft&apos;s works. The player is a private investigator tasked with investigating a disappearance in the village of Innsmouth, which would be familiar to fans of Lovecraft.<br><br>The game is heavily focused on the horror aspect - for the first long time you&apos;re not armed and merely have to explore or avoid the locals, which makes for a mighty frightening experience. The game operates with a madness-counter of sorts, and the more mentally stressful things you see or experience the more this counter will rise. The result is some heavy blurring of vision and such, which is a very cool and very unwelcome effect in some challenging situation.<br><br>The story is captivating and stays true to Lovecraftian horror - the main character commits suicide in the opening scene after which the game jumps back six months and accounts the events that led up to the suicide. The game has no HUD but rather communicates though sound, post processing and such, which adds a lot to the feel of the game.<br><br>There are flaws in the game though. Whereas the first couple of acts have a very high quality the quality drops around the middle of the game. The story makes less sense, the environments are less inspiring and you get the impression that it&apos;s added merely increase game time. The quality rises again near the end though and delivers a satisfying conclusion after some of the more mediocre parts. The game operates with save points, so you will find yourself doing the difficult parts of the game over and over. Also it won&apos;t run on some video cards (google it before you buy it). This is a problem that won&apos;t ever be fixed as the developer is not in business any more.<br><br>Definitely one of the better games I&apos;ve played in the genre, and one of the only ones I think captured the spirits of Lovecraft&apos;s works.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=2333462">Expand</a></span>

If you think &apos;survival horror&apos; means blowing away as many zombies as you can, this game is not for you. If you like the idea of getting into a good horror novel, or immersing yourself in a great movie that sucks you in. This game is what you want. It is an immersive story about horror and fear. It is about the realistic fragility of man when faced with things he cannot understand. It&apos;s about true heroism. The heroism where you are terrified but still tentatively move foward. It&apos;s about stange goings on in a strange town, a dark, dank town, falling down at the edges. Otherwordly and yet of this world. You will meet horric monsters and see horrific things, but you will also meet brave, ordinary people trying to survive in the town of Innesmouth. You will replay sections like you used to in the golden days of gaming. You will not be led by the nose and run through the game in one go via saves every 30 seconds. You have the tension of finding the save location just like in real life you will find it tension filled to find a safe place to hide. The save is just that. A rare &apos;safe place&apos;. This is the only game I have ever played where you have to run away from vastly more powerful entities, This the only game I have played where I really felt naked without a gun and yet was required to deal with the world for a long time without one. I was immersed in a game that denied me an on-screen HUD and gave my character vertigo and mental problems to make all jumps and high ledges an adventure, and being around horrific situations very mind altering (as it would!). These frailities make the character very believable and adds to the immersion. Don&apos;t buy this game because it&apos;s a great shooter, or a great sneak-em-up. Buy it because you want to support mature, adult gaming, great storytelling and ingenious innovations in gaming. I give it a solid 9.00 for all the great things this game IS, and not the small things it ISN&apos;T,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=390891">Expand</a></span>

Turn out the lights, leave a door to your back, and play for a few hours. It really is a creepy dark and forboding game with a great storyline.</span>

What works:</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This is the same review I made for the Xbox version of the game, which is the one that people should play. The PC version is plagued by bugs, some of which utterly critical. Crashes are frequent. The game itself can not be recommended on this platform (tested on Windows XP SP3).
<br>
<br>An overall very interesting and worth being played game. Especially for H.P. Lovecraft fans.
<br>
<br>What works:
<br>
<br>- A number of ideas: the sanity factor, the screen without HUD
<br>- The use of Lovecraft material for creating the game
<br>- The overall atmosphere of dread and isolation
<br>- The puzzles: they are often very well made and fairly engaging
<br>- The decision of relying on aiming down the sight (no in game crosshair)
<br>- The damage system being divided into 3 categories (bandage, splint, suture, antidote)
<br>
<br>What doesn&apos;t work:
<br>
<br>- The graphic is sometimes too blurry and muddy, making difficult to not only spot some items but even simple orientation
<br>- Respawn (I loathe it as game concept)
<br>- Lack of polish (it is obvious that corners have been cut and the ambition of the project reduced greatly from how originally anticipated)
<br>
<br>What is so-so:
<br>
<br>- The level design is most of the times very good and well focused (best chapters: Chapter 2 - Attack Of The Fuccing Fishmen, Chapter 3 - Jail Break and Chapter 7 - Dangerous Voyage) but sometimes there is an annoying lack of feedback about the need of backtracking (without much of a valid reason) while some other levels are much less spot on (Chapter 5 and Chapter 11 come to mind)
<br>- The AI: sometimes the enemies are in front of me but don&apos;t see me for some strange reason
<br>- Voice acting (some are good, wrong choice of tone for the protagonist who sounds too matter-of-face in most situations)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4383242">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It does have a lot of bugs with windows 7. You can&apos;t alt-tab, or it will crash. Sometimes something important just flat out won&apos;t work. I was in a chase scene and a vital ladder was just impossible to climb. It ruins the immersion quite a bit repeating a chase just because a ladder did not work. That being said, it is still a lot of fun. Without the bugs I would have given a 9. I would love to see a remade version of this that was actually made for PC.
<br>
<br>I do think some of the negative reviews are a bit ridiculous in that they complain about gameplay. This game is mainly about being immersed in the horror story. It is a good thing that they kept everything else fairly basic. You aren&apos;t playing some black-ops sniper with perfect aim, mysterious auto-respawn powers, and no back story. And there is a dedicated cut-scene skip button... the people who are complaining about that simply haven&apos;t looked in key bindings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3637722">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The atmosphere, the audio, just incredible. All through the first chapter of the game it dares you deeper and deeper into it&apos;s dark story and is one of the most unnerving video games I&apos;ve played in the longest time. The gameplay in the first chapter is a First person clues to find, people to talk to investigation, teasing you with ammunition boxes scattered around the levels having the player eagerly anticipate when they&apos;ll finally get to use their first weapon. This, unfortunately is the worst element of the game. The gunplay,
<br>
<br>Once the player is given his/her first gun there is a heavy focus on it&apos;s gunplay, it incredibly awkward to aim and hit enemies and when you FINALLY accomplish killing said enemy another will regenerate in his place, meaning a lot of wasted ammo and no sigh of relief knowing that there&apos;s one less brute to deal with. There&apos;s a stealth mechanic but it&apos;s buggy,
<br>
<br>This game had so much potential, buckets of it.  It&apos;s atmosphere is perfect, it&apos;s story progression is great, I&apos;d say if it had ditched the gunplay/action sequences altogether and focused more on it&apos;s puzzle solving /clue finding it&apos;d deserve a 7.5. but because of it&apos;s bug ridden and awful gunplay experience it gets a solid 6/10 from me.
<br>
<br>Oh, and the graphics are just fine, perfect for the game&apos;s mood.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4951443">Expand</a></span>

Those who have played it, they know what I&apos;m talking about. But first the good things.
<br>
<br>The plot of Call of Cthulhu is fascinating, intricate and with dark and rotten tones. Unlike Eternal Darkness, which is simply inspired by the stories of Lovecraft, Call of Cthulhu is based on the stories of Lovecraft. It is important to remember that I am not a big reader, but the atmosphere recreated in the game with the town of Innsmouth, its citizens strange, the gray and dull haze that covers it, donated it a weird and gloomy aspect as it should be. History is full of surprises, with themes ranging from the madness to evil, from spirituality to the connection with other worlds, and I really enjoyed the ending despite not being easy to interpret.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay, Call of Cthulhu is clearly a first-person shooter, even if it has some interesting mechanics: like every classic fps there is no automatic health regeneration system, and medikit must be used with caution to treat wounds through a complex system of medical care, and this thing I liked because it increases the challenge of the game. The feedback of weapons is quite good and there is also a stealth mode, however simple it may be. Another thing that the Call of Cthulhu has in common with Eternal Darkness is the sanity of the character. However while in Eternal Darkness mental health was indicated by a green bar, in this game there is no indication: when the character gets crazy, you see it on screen because the images are distorted, and the sounds become blurred up to flip the experience of the game ... and leading to game-over. It is something that while playing really bothers you, but in a good way, you really seems to get crazy. The puzzles are interesting, but some frustrating and, in my opinion inconsistent. However, generally speaking it is a game with a great gameplay, fun and balanced.
<br>
<br>From a technical standpoint Call of Cthulhu has an appreciable graphic, although it could be better. But what really ruined the game is the realization from the point of view of programming: I have no idea who has ported the game on PC, from Xbox version, but whoever did it, it did it so bad, ridiculous and indecent. The game is full of bugs of all kinds, of which at least 3 can prevent to finish the game. And I had to try in every way, so patiently, checking on the Internet, to go over these bugs. A scandal. Absurd. I came to a point where I did not want to finish the game anymore. But fortunately I finished it.
<br>
<br>So what can I say? Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a great game, a great survival horror, fun, with a unique and successful atmosphere. However the bad technical realization made it almost unplayable, and it is something I can not ignore. It is a game that I suggest to play, but you must have patience, you&apos;ve been warned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=5247986">Expand</a></span>
