There is however no denying that the game gets extremely repetitive, that the gameplay is unvaried, that the cars drives like **** that the world is small and shallow, that the narrative is lacking, that the action is unsatisfying, that the graphics feels old and dated, that the mission design is a joke, that the AI is a joke and that the game is short (8 hours long). The game is not beyond saving though and at the very least its playable. I had a alright time with it and if you find the game for a cheap buck and you are a sucker for gangster sandbox games you could do worse. I just feel sad for the people who bought this budget-title for full-price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-godfather-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2742889">Expand</a></span>

Not only are the graphics from at least 2 generations behind current standards (comparable with GTA San Andreas), but the game is also, as is typical of all EA releases these days, completely unstable. I ensured I had the latest drivers from nVidia, and running a Quad core @ 3.0ghz, an 8800gtx and 4gb of RAM (average PC these days) and the game crashed to desktop after about 15 minutes, with my system reporting it as a driver issue. In the past 3 or 4 months I have purchased numerous games, and out of those, every single EA game has come packaged with issues. It seems EA games have become too big, and are focusing on quantity of release over quality. The other theory would be them focusing on console releases which leave developers with minimal time to attempt to focus on porting. As for the game itself, it is way behind the pack. The Don control was a nice idea, yet badly implemented and was put together in a shabby way. The cars handle very badly, and the AI of your henchmen are a disgrace. The gameplay is extremely repetetive and although enjoyable the first few times you take over a business, it quickly becomes boring. If you are waiting for a game of this style, then I&apos;d wait for Mafia 2 (whenever it is actually released), and in the meantime maybe give even The Wheelman a try. At least that game is optimized for the PC, runs well and is more fun, even if not perfect, it&apos;s better than this pile of dog poop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-godfather-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=423335">Expand</a></span>

He is an example of the people that are sucking the life and community out of video games by overlooking the point in front of him and bashing something that is irrelevant to the topic of conversation (aka NERD RAGE WAHHH). Anyway, GF2 is an enjoyable game. GTA IV is better graphic-wise, but in terms of sheer enjoyability, GF2 is above it. Mobface is back and has been upgraded, but is somewhat sparse when compared to other games with character customization. The added teamwork and business management focuses are a welcome touch as well. The three locales where the user can interact with could be a bit larger, though. All in all, a short game, but an enjoyable one that also has multiplayer features (I have yet to try it, but I hear that it is alright from my friends).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-godfather-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=423326">Expand</a></span>

They should have remade everything from scratch but instead we have the same average looking graphics, repetitive side missions. Decent gameplay, the gunplay is your standard fair but the improvements here is being able to overview the city what stores and businesses can provide something for the family and new made men to recruit into the family. The melee combat is a bit better than before which adds a series of combo&apos;s. While this sounds good what lets it all down is the game is ridiculously easy. Theres health potions that fall from every enemy you kill and your health regenerates. You can take over the city on your own you don&apos;t even need any made men to come with you...
<br>Multiplayer is terrible. Its wasted potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-godfather-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2910475">Expand</a></span>

The story is average, the man you played as in the first game is being shot dead during the cuba revolution. You take the role as Dominic, the man who takes over the family. The graphics is still good if you play it in 1080p or above, the textures are sometimes actually better than games from 2010. But... the game is rather short and the cool feeling from the first game is missing. The atmosphere is nowhere near the first game, it doesn&apos;t feel like I&apos;m driving in New York because it&apos;s smaller than little italy in the first game. I get no 60&apos;s feeling either, it feels like a modern GTA game with old &quot;fake&quot; cars.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I&apos;ll give it 10 to raise the metascore a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-godfather-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5276491">Expand</a></span>
