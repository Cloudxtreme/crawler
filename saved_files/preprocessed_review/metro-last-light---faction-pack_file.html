The most criticized element of Metro has always been it&apos;s linear gameplay. This Kshatriya Mission addresses exactly that and gives us Metro fans an opportunity to explore and endure the dangers of the metro universe at our own freewill. It takes the Linear experience that Metro offers and gives you an amazing, yet condensed, sandbox version. For 5 bucks, this experience is amazing, and is a must buy for anyone who owns Metro LL and always wondered what it would like to be able to explore the tunnels without a mandatory guide.
<br>This DLC also throws in 2 other missions that were not in depth enough, or large enough, to release alone. I feel like they are just bonus content with them being a mere linear stealth mission and the other a heavy artillery horde defense mission. I feel that these two missions have brought the DLC a lot of negative attention and that if they would not have been included as extra content, in what is really a 5 dollar Metro sandbox experience, that the DLC would have received more positive reviews.
<br>
<br>10/10 from me. Kshatriya makes the heart of this DLC and is more than worthy of 5 bucks. I am not going to rate the DLC down just because it gave us two extra bonus missions of less than superior quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light---faction-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427024">Expand</a></span>

You get 3 varied missions, one as each faction. One has you facing the classic communist human wave attack as the Nazis, another has you sneaking through a level with silenced weapons as a communist, and the last bring a whole new take on Metro missions. As a Ranger, you are put in an area with no money and bare bones supplies. You go out into the area and collect items, kill enemies, and loot in order to get money. Bring that back to the beginning of the level and you can buy weapons, suits, ammo, etc. It was really refreshing and thoroughly enjoyed the DLC. Recommended for any Metro fan itching for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-last-light---faction-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=4195665">Expand</a></span>

Go out to the world, gather stuff and sell them. You make money, upgrade your gear, suit, ammo and others. It&apos;s almost like an non-linear RPG fps. It&apos;s quite long. But since I enjoyed it so much, it&apos;s never long enough. Damn fine piece of work this is!</span>
