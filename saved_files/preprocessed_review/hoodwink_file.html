The problem is everything else, the interface is annoying, imprecise and unclear, the animations are average and the minigames are uninspired and difficult to complete only because of the bad interface. However as I said the story is excellent and a testament to the fact that despite the fact everything else was difficult I always wanted to find out what would happen next and I still do. If these guys can fix the tech problems then this game will be great and its worth playing just for the story and wonderful world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hoodwink/user-reviews?user_review_id=2521315">Expand</a></span>

<br>Michael</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Simply walking around the world of Hoodwink is a chore- the walk cursor only appears intermittently, forcing you to click in several areas until you find the path that has been laid out by the developers... which is usually broken up by interactive  objects, so you have to inch closer to them until the camera scrolls and you can click on the space of road directly after them.
<br>
<br>Michael walks rather slowly, but double-clicking will activate his running mode. Unfortunately our hero has a tendency to rubber-band back and forth on certain screens when running, taking longer to cover ground than simply walking. Some exits, such as the exit to the main plaza, are not actually marked. In almost every other room, hovering the cursor over exits immediately morphs the cursor into a door, letting you know there is an exit-- this is not the case for the exit to the plaza, which is a nondescript-looking  landing that only displays the regular walking icon.
<br>
<br>Movement alone, however, is not the only obstacle the player must surmount. Hotspot recognition is extremely finicky, which is aggravated by very poor puzzle design. Developers nowadays must walk a thin line between avoiding the heights of insanity we&apos;ve seen in some adventure game puzzles of ages past (use an inflatable rubber duck to rescue a key from a canal? The Longest Journey, I&apos;m looking at you...) and avoiding serving everything to the player on a silver platter. Sadly, Hoodwink does serve things on a silver platter. An example of this is the first quest you come upon: As soon as you have escaped from Detective Pyre&apos;s  office, you decide to talk to your hippie friend (Saffron) for advice on how to pull off your proposal. Her advice? You need to get some chocolates, make yourself smell good, and get your paws on a bouquet of roses.
<br>
<br>How difficult is it to achieve these goals? Not difficult at all. In fact, all you need to do is go up one floor, stroll around, and just pick things up as you find them. Two items require you to interact with one character and one element of the environment respectively, and the chocolates require you to find a certain individual in the plaza (and, of course, figure out where that exit is...)  and that&apos;s it, the challenge is pretty much nonexistent. Later puzzles, such as the one involving a lantern, feel like filler to pad out the experience more than anything else and really don&apos;t flow well at all.  Puzzles are not necessarily the backbone of adventure games- characters and settings are- but when you have them, they need to reinforce the experience instead of detracting from it.
<br>
<br>These glaring issues are a real shame, because the world of Hoodwink is fascinating. Although not explored at length, the quirky society with its odd denizens and rather black sense of humor do beg for your attention, and you&apos;ll be wanting to see more of it by the time the curtain comes down.
<br>
<br>The graphics are eccentrically unique, a blend of gritty dystopian and cartoony playfulness realized in cel-shaded 3D. Characters do make an impression with their personalities:  a second-chancer robot who thinks he still has a stomach, a trash can who is trying to commit suicide by jumping into an incinerator, the anachronistically flower-powered Saffron, and of course your fianc&#xE9;e- the game has more than its share of excellent characterization, and this is the area where it truly shines. The universe is also positively bizarre- if anthropomorphic detectives and brain-carrying robots weren&apos;t enough, mutations have also affected flowers: Saffron&apos;s supply room is populated by a large carnivorous plant that guards over a crowd of dancing, anthropomorphic roses. Some good throwaway comedy lines can be  heard in crowd scenes - but their impact is lessened  when heard for the tenth time, repeated by different voice actors (a slight d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu of Oblivion&apos;s rather schizophrenic voice acting.) Perhaps one of my favorite lines comes from UniCorp&apos;s boys in blue, constantly and cheerfully reminding passersby that &quot;Unlawfulness will be met with courteous and lethal response!&quot;
<br>
<br>The music is more of a mixed bag- although the sparse soundtrack is stylistically appropriate to match the future-dystopia-meets-noir theme, traclks seem to be triggered at random and after long periods of silence with no discernible rhyme or reason: At one point a tune sprung up in the middle of a lengthy conversation with Saffron, and at least two themes were playing simultaneously when I entered her supply room.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hoodwink/user-reviews?user_review_id=2555754">Expand</a></span>
