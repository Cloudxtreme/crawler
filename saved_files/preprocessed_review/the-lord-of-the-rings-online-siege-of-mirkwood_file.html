The public landing to mirkwood itself was incredible. You could feel the intensity and the chaos of war. Kudos to the sound and music team for further selling the atmosphere!</span>

Now that it&apos;s out a lot of those feelings have been proved true. First off, SoM finishes off Volume II; Volume II, for those that do not know, was Mines of Moria. Essentially you have to buy a $20 &quot;expansion&quot; just to finish the first expansion. Convinced of its worth so far? SoM takes the level cap to 65 in one additional region to the game. The region itself is simliar in size to any other Shadows of Angmar Book patch that came out free years ago; so essentially we paid for a Book patch. The real additions to the game was the skirmish system. While Turbine has more than been okay with stabbing the lore in the face in the past (Runekeepers, goat mounts), it was no different here when they started adding war camps out in remote areas, on top of which offering instanced skirmishes at battlegrounds where battles never took place. Despite that minor inconvenience, the skirmish system makes up for the one fatal flaw that LotRo has been facing; a dying population. All the group content that was needed to get goodies to advance your character can now be received through the skirmish system all by your lonesome. This is great for new players--bad for everyone else that had to suck it up and spend countless days of time and money just to earn said items. The level cap increased to 65. The only reason I can figure out why is so that Turbine could annoy everyone. With the increase of the level cap means that there are &quot;better&quot; items to be had now. The carrot and the stick if you will. The only trouble is that they purposely weakened all the hard-earned gear you earned post-SoM just so there would be a definite incentive to grind for gear that&apos;s five levels over yours. This is felt especially with the legendary item system; deconstructing any item below LV61 yields an XP rune that you cannot use for the new LIs in Mirkwood. They are intentionally wanting you to go back to the grind. Unfortunately the aim to that goal was to give the taste of progress in this pseudo-expansion, when all it does is bring attention to the lack of content within this so-called expansion this year. With only a whopping two Book updates in 2009 (as opposed to the four they released in 2008) comes a sad outlook for the future of LotRo. Turbine seemed more interested in dragging out the process of getting to the end of this road in Mordor by needlessly dragging us off to a part of the books that had nothing to do with the epic storyline. All in all disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-siege-of-mirkwood/user-reviews?user_review_id=741320">Expand</a></span>
