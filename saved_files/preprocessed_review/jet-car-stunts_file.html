This is not really a racer but more like Trials where you are practicing your way to get through to the end in a good time.

Not for the easily frustrated.  Runs well on Vita and loads up fast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jet-car-stunts/user-reviews?user_review_id=4575323">Expand</a></span>
