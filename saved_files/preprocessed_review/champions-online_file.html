Why they decided to continue Champions Online and completely shut down CoH completely baffles me, I guess the microtransaction model was already in place for Champions so it seemed more profitable.  Regardless, I&apos;ve lost all respect for the company for selling out like that.
<br>
<br>Basically the game is your standard free to play microtransaction bullcrap that plagues the market today.  Some of the ploys they use to get money are laughable.  For instance, when you build your first character, there will be items included in things such as a Halloween pack and a dryad pack that allow you to select them without having an indicator by their name that you have to purchase them (even though there are other items that are selectable such as Ancient Armor cosmetics, which clearly state they must be purchased) - so basically it tricks you into thinking those items are selectable and available for your character, then once you are done finishing your character it pops up a dialogue saying you have items that must be purchased otherwise they will not show in game, because it turns out (shock) that you have to pay for things like the halloween pack and dryad pack... what an absolutely scummy way of trying to trick users into paying.  On top of that the character creation is just a huge step down from CoH, half the items when you put in certain combos and certain scalings (common ones I might add) have awful looking graphical glitches like a shoulder pad having your shoulder pop right through it and show visibly from the outside.  On top of that, when you get into the actual game, it&apos;s cell shaded (even though the character creation screen WAS NOT) and you basically get a character that doesn&apos;t even look like what you created.
<br>
<br>In general the cel shaded graphics look like ass, and it is also a huge step backward from the already gorgeous game with 10 year old graphics - CoH.
<br>
<br>There are also less than half the choices for unique and cool skill sets that CoH had, which is ridiculous.  The only melee classes are weapon classes, so forget the cool things such as claws and spikes.
<br>
<br>Combat is awful, and leveling up is dumbed down, basically they made this game for people that don&apos;t want to worry about building a character rpg style, and just want to play some mindless arcade-like game.
<br>
<br>The game has half the character and passion the original game had, it&apos;s really sad to see this is what is left of the once glorious CoH.
<br>
<br>If you want to play a free-to-play mmo with superheros (or any mmo with superheros for that matter) the DC Online game is the only way to go.  It&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s better in every way shape and form than this lackluster game &quot;Champions Online&quot; is.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t waste your time with this game, it&apos;s trash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4198972">Expand</a></span>

They are doing very well with pumping out constant fixes with any problem they find. The Combat system is amazing and NOT turn-based, rather then being gear and rotation based like WoW, It actually takes skill to excel in PvE and PvP. The Charater Customization i obviously great. truthfully it&apos;s just fun and its a good change from repetitive MMOs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=86140">Expand</a></span>

Customability of your character&apos;s looks and powers is its strength but with regards to the powers, thats also one of its weaknesses when a player can make so many mistakes and have to waste time to fix them or start from scratch. Game world&apos;s missions are very thin at some critical levels. Teaming and in game socialization (the Multi of a multi player online game) are thin to non existant. Crafting and game economy are cumbersome, over complicated, and price wise out of the typical gamer&apos;s reach. Game uses not just zoning but mini zoning(mutiple versions of a zone when numbers become too high) so the feel is even less numbers of people(this is good and bad). Overall, this is a Beta version of a game that should have remained Beta for quite a while longer(Cryptic dragged their heels making this game across 3 different publisher(Marvel/Microsoft and now Atari). Since Cryptic is infamous for turning out sloppy work, Im not confident that they will improve and maintain this game up to quality MMO standards. If you want a Sandbox(customize playing/creating) heroe game this is your few weeks to a month worth of fun. If you are looking for a Super Hero MMO with solid pve pvp crafting econ etc Give this one a miss.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84660">Expand</a></span>

I find that this game is a decent cross between World of Warcraft (vanilla or Burning crusade wow, not wrath or cata) and CoH/CoV. The Bad: There are issues where I am getting killed in two hits on a single map, and it only gets worse the higher you level. Healers are far too overpowered and will not die nor will their team die in pvp. Problem is, there is only 1 healer in any given match on 1 team, not any others.<br><br>The teleport power is by far the only power to use if you want to go into pvp as it makes you untargetable for quite a while and allows you to zip around the map and avoid death. A healer with teleport is basically an unstoppable win. You cant get a single kill in the game at that point.<br><br>The zombie game mode is ok but the problem is, it counts towards your win/loss and I have yet to see a win. This is a massive design flaw.<br><br>There is also a bug where if you are the last to die in a PvP match you end up dying in the game world. This causes star loss which cuts your DPS and healing ability down quite a bit.<br><br>The customer service is basically nothing, it makes EA and Blizzard customer service look decent. They will send you a randomly generated response without reading a single thing.<br><br>There are also random lag spikes (yes, it means ping) which causes pings to go above 2k. Problem is at 2k ping when you are already in combat, you die.<br><br>The good: The game can run on almost any computer (mine is not too bad, I can run any game released today) but it is beneficial if you have a friend or family member who has a bad comp. But this also means it gets rated down on the graphics end (1 point off the total score honestly in this review).<br><br>The game play and controls are fluid as well, the missions are repetitive but they throw in lots of unique NPC types to keep you entertained. The adventure packs are also decent, but only if you want to spend money on the game itself.<br><br>Also the character customization is possibly one of the best in any mmo you will find, I think it has slightly more customization options than perfect world and that game is insane for it.<br><br>Bottom line: It is a decent game, tons of character creation options, decent game play which keeps you entertained in many ways, but extremely broken PvP which the dev&apos;s refuse to fix. If you like PvE give the game a shot, if you like PvP you will be yanking your hair out at some of the stupid situations the dev&apos;s put in the game which are completely unavoidable if you refuse to not play PvP<br><br>Graphics: 4 out of 10<br>Sound: 3 out of 10<br>Gameplay: 6 out of 10 (due to pvp being BROKEN)<br>Longevity: 8 out of 10<br>Controls: 9 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1696616">Expand</a></span>

I am a lifetime subscriber to CO.  Had you asked me to review the game prior to the On Alert update, I couldn&apos;t&apos;ve recommended it enough.<br><br>But the On Alert update has come and gone since then, and there&apos;s no sugarcoating it: it is terrible.<br><br>Where before you had a game in the vein of City of Heroes ( no surprise there, Cryptic developed CoH as well before moving on to the Champions IP ) which was full of flavour, interesting stories and characters, it&apos;s all been either clawed back, removed entirely, or rewritten into something bland, samey, and uninteresting.<br><br>So what changed in On Alert?<br><br>Before, when you started the game, you had a lot of story options as to how to progress in the game, because there were two hubs you could participate in: the &quot;Millenium City&quot; missions in its gang-themed &quot;Westside&quot; - sort of a much wackier Batman area - or the more &quot;realistic&quot; stuff in Canada whose beginning game content centers around the occult release of a powerful spirit (and then perplexingly has you fighting terrorists after this crisis arc with no given way that the two arcs tie together)<br><br>Now you can&apos;t touch Canada&apos;s missions at all until you&apos;re level 15 (of 40).  You have a good several hours worth of grind in West Side (or the Alerts) at the beginning of the game, and even at that, a lot of the content in West Side has been cut down or otherwise trimmed down.<br><br>Speaking of things that were trimmed down in the On Alert update, the crafting system is no more.  Where before you had a system that had a lot of wacky, zany, and generally-interesting items each with a little bit of flavour text usually pertaining to the game world, now every item in the world follows the same template.  No, you didn&apos;t misread, every item in the world uses the same sterile six templates.  It gets very old very fast and both greatly reduces immersion in the game world and the sense of reward you get from these items.<br><br>Where before the grind was passable because it was guised with interesting stories with often interesting bad guys, they have all been watered down lately.  The series&apos; front page supervillain Doctor Destroyer, for example, gets sidelined by the games other - usually much less interesting - bad guys.  Without spoiling anything - the two main &apos;end game&apos; confrontations don&apos;t even give him a nod.<br><br>The Alerts are the focus of the update of course, it being named On Alert and all ... and they are a mess.  Some of them are fine if extremely repetitive - but others are balanced about as well as plate on a stick in the middle of an earthquake in a windstorm, which is to say, not very much.  To give one example, some of the alerts have you fighting series whipping-boy &quot;Kevin Poe&quot; - who is now anything but a whipping boy.  Even with a high damage team, you&apos;re going to struggle to even put a dent in him by the time the two minutes you&apos;re given are up, because he has a classic example of the Computer Cheating: he has a power called Personal Force Field, which in the PC iteration is a little annoying but not overpowered, but because of how ridiculously Cryptic amps up the Supervillain stats and such to present a challenge since their AI is so terrible, there is almost no way you&apos;re going to take down that superviallins shield in the given time, let alone his health.  Don&apos;t get me started on Draconis, who combines this shield with powerful crowd control abilities, which are also amped up.<br><br>Even if the game was otherwise perfect, this removing of the game&apos;s story and flavour has effectively ruined it for me.  But it&apos;s also bugged to tomorrow and back with the update.  Bad guys constantly clip out of the level geometry during alerts, preventing you from succeeding during them.  And also in the old content, such as the Demonflame adventure pack - again preventing you from succeeding in it.  The game constantly drops my keybindings.  The game will often wait until after you&apos;re dead to apply healing items - consuming the item but doing you no good, being dead and all.  The voiceovers added by the review, when they added the update are terrible - but only when they work, which isn&apos;t often.<br><br>On Alert is a mess.  Don&apos;t get this game.  Don&apos;t support it with c-store purchases, which will be made a waste of money by them being made available freely in the game anyways (the 90s superhero set for example was available in the c-store for 320 cryptic points, and is now freely available in game).  Don&apos;t support it with subscriptions, which they won&apos;t respect anyways.  Wait until they fix it - but don&apos;t hold your breath.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2326342">Expand</a></span>

The game play is fast and action oriented, the new alert system puts you in the action instantly, the characters are customizable with character points in addition to powers, you can create your own nemesis which appears in the world.

If you care to play a concept character you WILL be feeble compared to a character who only picked powers based on usefulness: ie my level 10 TK blades could kill foes my level 18 Martial arts character would die to. Melee is far inferior in every way compared to ranged to the point it should have been called &quot;Blasters Online-also with some ignorant melee.&quot; Whole power sets are nearly useless in PvP AND PvE! The character creator everyone keeps praising is a step backwards from the one in City of Heroes, often times you pick a costume piece only to have an error message appear. I only visited 3 zones in the time i played(out of 5) and those zones seems very sloppy and piece-meal. There isn&apos;t a single landmark or interesting location in the whole dang game that i know of, and the novelty of cowboy robots wears off after about 5 seconds... Another fault I found was that unless you have graphic settings turned to MAX at character creation you don&apos;t actually have any idea what you like like as certain textures and layers of pattern only appear at max settings! I could go on and on people(travel power balance, developer responses, horrible trade skills, auction house, bank,customer service and outright thievery of money) it would be hard to find a positive thing about this game. Avoid at all costs, and if you must play don&apos;t give them your credit card info!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85761">Expand</a></span>

During the last year there has been many changes made to champions with to major balance passes carried out on powers one on melee based powers that greatly improved how melee based characters perform and another on pets which again has greatly improved there use and made them into viable power selections. with both these passes the developers have showing a willingness to listen to the player base beyond anything I&apos;ve seen in any other game even going so far as to delay the pet specific parts of a patch so that they could do further work on the pet powers based on feedback they had received on the public test server.<br><br>This same willingness to listen and delay releases also extends to content where they delayed the latest adventure pack daemon flame so that they could further polish it based on feedback they had received from the previous adventure pack serpents lantern.<br><br>Of course where Champions really shines is the character creation and open power selection which allows a great deal of freedom in your characters creation.  Best of all costume unlocks are now global so if you get a costume part on a character that would doesn&apos;t soot them but would look really great on one of your other characters its no problem to load that character up head to the tailor and select that cool new costume part .<br><br>All in all champions Online is well worth picking up and giving it a try best of all the box can now be picked up for a low price and you get a full month of play time included.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1394014">Expand</a></span>

Since it&apos;s free on Steam I&apos;d recommend you give it a try, maybe you&apos;ll like it, maybe you won&apos;t, but you haven&apos;t lost anything in trying it for yourself. For a game that&apos;s free it,s good, it might even be great, but it&apos;s not the kind of game I&apos;d be glad I payed for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1704739">Expand</a></span>

When the game was purchased by Perfect World Entertainment, it really started to go down hill. They didn&apos;t really make anything new. They mostly locked off everything and tried to sell us back what we originally already had. Forced character deletions, repurchasing powers and costumes we already owned, and an ever restricting character creation for new accounts. New accounts are left with barely 10% of the costume options they once used to have and its still shrinking. I understand the model behind Free-2-Play, but this is just overkill and the customers suffer. I hate to say it, but let this turd die to teach them a lesson.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2698417">Expand</a></span>

Champions Online is an amazing product. From the box itself you can feel this game is going to be special. The character creation is amazing. You can create the superheroe you&apos;ve always envisioned, tweaking it to the smallest detail. You can tweak proportions, colors, accesories, mood, stance, etc, etc, etc. It is by far the best character creation out there. All the time you feel like you are in control of the way your character is looking. When you are satisfied with your character you start the tutorial. You may think that it would be boring but the way they set it up it&apos;s pretty fun. You learn to get around in the middle of an alien invasion. So you dive into the action right from the start. The controls are pretty simple and very intuitive. You have access to all the information you need very easily and you don&apos;t waste time looking for stuff. There are plenty of missions to go around, there is a lot of content to keep yourself busy. Regarding the graphics, they are perfect for the style of the game. Looks like you are playing and living in a comic book. The characters have a lot of detail in their costumes, they look amazing. The fx in the game, specially the character powers look great. For everyone that likes comic books and superheroes this is the game to have. You truly feel like you are the superheroe the world was waiting for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84326">Expand</a></span>

The fact that character choices in power selection can make or break your characters solo and group viability is hard for some to grasp and is often the main complaint on the forums.</span>

I didn&apos;t like CoH&apos;s combat system.. but they definitely did a good job with this game. the glitches are mostly visual and haven&apos;t affected gameplay so far. and the charcacter creator is the best I&apos;ve EVER seen!!!</span>

                                        <span> I&apos;m so disappointed at this game. They took a great concept and beautiful gameplay (experienced during beta and headstart) and remade it into a boring grindfeast, I recommend you stay away, because this isn&apos;t a fun game anymore. Its a chore. And an tedious one at that.</span>

I know an MMO does not work the same as other single player games. I have played plenty of MMOs on this Rig and none of them have given me any problems.

There are bugs, but the game is playable, and the bugs are being worked on quickly. Does the game really deserve a 10? Well, no, probably not, but neither does it deserve the 1s and 2s it has received. I&apos;d be happy to see it end with a score of 8.5 or so.</span>

This game either needs serious patches, or just take off the monthly fees. Don&apos;t waste you money.

There are a grand total of 5 zones, and you absolutely HAVE to do every single quest in them if you want to get to level 40. There is absolutely ZERO replayability. Game lacks any semblance of balance and you will die constantly if you don&apos;t take Regeneration.</span>

There are a lot of liftetime subscribers who bought this game on hype alone, so take people&apos;s comments with a grain of salt as they are financially invested in this game succeeding. Three huge faults with this game: 1. The develpoers make it a habit to jerk their community around. Just do a few searches on champions online and you will see what i&apos;m talking about. never seen a developer botch a game this bad with such shady dealings. it&apos;s a debacle and unacceptable. 2. the powers are extremely unbalanced. the game promises limitless customizablity, but its too bad that many of the powers are terrible and its really difficult to decypher how the stats work with a given power. this wouldnt be so bad if the devs didn&apos;t make it so hard to re-spec and allowed for people to experiment a little. 3. it&apos;s just not that fun. hardly anyone ever groups together. the community is flooded with elitist lifetime subscribers who are now forever biased cryptic suck-ups because they are so invested in this product&apos;s success even though it is undeniably bad. There is some good to it, hence the 4 rating, but not enough to recommend. Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere. This one is a disaster waiting to happen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84676">Expand</a></span>

With many criticisms being levelled at easily fixable and changeable problems which will inevitably being smoothed out. Champions offers a fun combat system, excellent customisation and and a solid core game. It time time of writing it has only been out 2 or so weeks so OF COURSE It has little content. It&apos;s an mmo, it only expands as time goes on. Recent patches have done well for stability. The levelling curve is consistent, and it is constantly entertaining. The one reason, I believe, some people disagree with game mechanics is because they simply cannot mindlessly spam buttons like in many other MMOs - your character requires thought. In all, this game is enjoyable alternative to the mainstream MMO and I for one are expecting decent things in the future. I heartlity recommend you check it out once the game has fully stabilised.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84810">Expand</a></span>

The other reason why theres no real incentive to get to level, is that if you are level 30+ and you join a PvP instance, you automatically get leveled to 40 as well as everybody else. The gear you acquire through missions is only really 15% effective, your build is where you generate the most damage/healing/buff to stats bonus and thats difficult to change due to an extremely pricey Retcon system which only allows you go back a few steps before costs rise rapidly. All in all I am only playing this game now, because I bought the reduced rate 6 month sub before release, If i was paying monthly, i would probably not have gone past the first free month since this game lacks content (level gaps), which is not fun at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84840">Expand</a></span>

If your coming from WoW, where everything is spoon fed to you very obviously, and you only have 1 path to take, then champions online with its &apos;you can do anything&apos; approach leaves people wondering what the heck is going on. Granted, there are not a lot of sign posts in champions to tell you where to go and what to do , and this is a flaw certainly. But the game as a whole is really robust, and in a word fun. It&apos;s just a bit of a learning curve. And aparently some peoeple dont like having to make choices. (holy crap did you see that gamespy review? LOL) This game is about playing the way you want to play, choosing ANY of the powers in the game for your character, and looking ANY way you want to look.

In fact the developers at Cryptic brag about innovation and freedom of design. As an Ultima Online player 13 years ago I found more diversity and innovation in that old relic. I left WoW to get away from grinding and that feeling that I wasn&apos;t playing as much as working. Champions Online sold itself as a hop on and play at your own pace type of game. I pre-ordered and played in the beta and headstart. The game was laid back and just let you have fun. Release day came and a game changing patch was dropped, it seems Cryptic wanted to be taken seriously by &apos;hardcore&apos; MMO&apos;s and so they ramped up the difficulty and nerfed every character. Day 1 - the grind begins. Agonizing. It&apos;s Sept 22/09 as I am writing this and I have decided to cancel my subscription and wait for either a full turn around in game direction or for something new to catch my eye. Here&apos;s where the most troubling issues begin. I click my account page and click on the link to cancel my subscription. I get a &apos;404&apos; type page saying that the page doesn&apos;t exist and that an evil villian must have taken it. So I check out the forum and find a developer post stating that anyone experiencing this problem should PM him(which is very odd because his signature says his PM box is broken and to twitter him. yes they use twitter for game updates) I send the gentleman a message stating that I am unable to unsubscribe because the link is invalid. 10 minutes later I refresh the forum to see if I had a reply... I now have a message saying that I am banned from the forum and that the ban will expire... get this... at 6PM on the day that my credit card will be charged for a 6 month subscription. There must be a mistake, right? I go to the champions mainpage and find that I am also banned there. I cannot access my account page at all. This is nonsense. I call the 800 number and speak with a rep only saying that I would like to cancel my subscription. I am told she cannot process that request because I was banned. The rep informed me that the ToS states that refunds will not be given to anyone who is banned for whatever reason. Flabbergasted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84997">Expand</a></span>

I had seen the game change and applaud the developers for their ability to create an amazing world. However, on launch day an appalling number of poor decisions were made including constant nerfs to powers. Most of the powers hit with nerfs were identified in beta as needing so changed so why wait until launch? With all of the power changes they didn&apos;t anticipate the players&apos; reaction and had to create a retconning system that allowed full retcons. Again, poor decision-making. They also nerfed xp gains which resulted in a significant leveling gap so it is not unusual to have your hero stuck at about level 31. For an mmo it has one of the worst social toolsets including making it a nuisance to team up with others. The game doesn&apos;t seem to have a general consensus on what it wants to be and how hard it should be leaving some players feeling like it is still in beta. Like I said, I have seen the game change and grow and was looking forward to some stability. I didn&apos;t get that. Maybe in 6 months I will take another look at the game, but I canceled my subscription for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85042">Expand</a></span>

The game is deep in complexity, there is plenty to figure out and explore. The UI is basic and not overly complicated to figure out. Creating new characters and figuring out powerful and fun power builds is a meta game all in itself. The combat/travel/crafting animations are well done. The zones are huge, and about half way through the nemesis creation spices things up a bit. Content and feature (free) expansion are coming in October. It is heavily instanced, but it is handled gracefully by labeling where your supergroup/team/friends are in the instance list. Because of its instanced design, there&apos;s only 1 realm, so you get to play the game with everyone else and don&apos;t get stuck on separate servers. The playername@forumname design allows for getting the character name you want. Its well worth the box purchase to play this game. There are fun and challenging instanced encounters like Dr. Destroyer&apos;s Robot Factory full of scripted encounters and puzzles. That said, there are some new MMO problems that this game has, and it will take a few patches to get things working better. Reduced respec costs just went live, so now recovering from a bad build is very viable. The UI can be sluggish to respond. There is no macro or addon support. What remains to be seen is what the game at level 40 is like and how Cryptic will respond to player feedback. If you like a super hero themed mmo that is ust plain fun to play, then this may be the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85038">Expand</a></span>

Aspiring &quot;Champions&quot; will likely make poor choices on powers they choose as they learn through trial and error. Unfortunately is is near impossible to undo power choices once made as the cost is too high. Players will likely run through the starting zone several times to find the right damage/defense build. Considering there is only ONE starting area, the game quickly loses it&apos;s appeal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85086">Expand</a></span>

With fast combat, pretty graphics, and enough to do to keep players who like solo play entertained until well into the later levels. it&apos;s a pretty good game considering it just came online. What&apos;s screwed this game around (not to mention it players), is Cryptic. Simply put, they&apos;re idiots. Banning entirely unoffensive names and words, abusing their ToS to get the most money out of people and replying to help requests with arrogant crap. If they even reply at all that is. The constant nerfs and imbalanced powers sets means that themed characters are gimps, and either you have specific powers, or you&apos;re going to have a LOT of trouble. I really wanted to like this game, a newer and better City of Heroes was what I was hoping for here. But it&apos;s more like WoW, minus the content, balance, customer service and PvP worth doing. Seriously suggest that people don&apos;t play this, not because the game is bad, but because when people with qualms about abusing bans to get the most of you money have your credit card details...

If you take the time during the actual tutorial to read the information given out at mission providers instead of just clicking and going to the waypoint, you will learn quite a lot about the various aspects of the game. As to the game being too easy? Well I can only assume these players who claim so didn&apos;t get past level 20, as at this stage the game becomes really quite hard and in some cases extremely hard when it comes to some of the instanced solo missions. As for the game being solo only? Well yes, for the first 10-15 levels this is the case. However, after that there are more &quot;group based&quot; missions which were beefed up when the game recieved it&apos;s first patch which coincided with the official release date. Later in the game there are group based instances (Evil lairs) with named bosses that as in other MMOs drop valuable loot, and are redoable. The character creation is a dream come true for anyone who really likes to try and be different, and there are masses of unlocks, which yes, may be character restricted and not account wide, but so what? There are also hundreds of extras, like pets, which are mini versions of the many different NPC&apos;s in the game. As for microtransactions mentioned by another reviewer - there are no items you can &quot;buy&quot; that cannot be gained from playing the game, with exception to the planned extra character slots. Overall, I&apos;ve been playing this game since Closed beta thru till now, and the game&apos;s so called &quot;classless&quot; base still throws up new ways to tinker with how I want my characters to be. The game (as of 9-9-09) is still effectively less than two weeks old. Sure it has it&apos;s faults, and some areas feel a little rough around the edges and some that feel downright unfinished, but I don&apos;t know of ANY game in this genre that was any different, in fact, I&apos;ve played pretty much every recent (post WOW) MMO and beta tested in most of them too (AoC, WaR, Aion to name but a few) and none of them feel as good to play as CO. It needs work - i&apos;m sure it will improve on many aspects - and yes, they are in the middle of creating an online manual that actually explains things better. Definately one to try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84511">Expand</a></span>

At times you will click and hold a maintain power only to have it register as a tap power and get minimal effect from it. 6. 5 zones. 5 Freaking zones? Thats it? Although they have said they are adding another zone soon. 7. Crafting is elementary and seems to have been thrown together in a hurry. It does have some good things going for it... 1. Combat is cool and pretty fluid, except for the UI issues. 2. Character generator is really good, but hard to navigate at times. 3. Can choose any power from and powerset you want. 4.

Broken public quests and random rewards from the ones that do work. Huge lack of world content with only 4 large zones.

I played a demo of Champions Online a while back and thought &quot;hey, this is kinda fun, but lacking in some regards. Maybe in a few months when its more established (like most other MMO&apos;s) it&apos;ll be even better.&quot; So I gave it that wait that MMO&apos;s deserve to get the bugs and stuff out of them. I&apos;ve played CoH and CO and I can honestly tell you that there is no difference between them. I bought the game through steam when it was 10$ and I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t pay more for it. The game isn&apos;t bad - its just obviously not for me. It has its strong points - the character creator is amazing, the graphics are intriguing, and the grouping system is very okay, but not super especially when compared to WoW, the current MMO king. The main problem I had when playing this game is that I simply did not feel like I was a super hero. Look you can fly! I can do that in Aion. And thats as super as I felt was when I was flying. I noticed alot of people making angel characters and to them, I say go buy Aion instead. So, in a nutshell, it was definitely worth the 10$ I spent to try it out due to the fact that its a blast to make a character and the fact that the game is very accessible and somewhat fun. However, I wouldn&apos;t pay retail due to the fact that after a while it gets dull after a while after the charm wears off and there is no real feeling of being a superhero. If you want to feel like a superhero, play Arkham Asylum. If you want to fly around, play Aion. If you want to play an MMO, play WoW. And finally, if you want to play a GOOD MMO, play EVE. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=743051">Expand</a></span>

I love it! One thing to note it can be really hard or way too easy to level a character. A lot has to do with what &quot;power set/s&quot; your start with and choose as you level. Think of each power set as a branch in a research tree. Staying in only one or two branches lets you pick up high end powers, but you can pick from other branches as well if you feel the need (and meet the prereqs). Added to the unbeliveable character generator, and you can pretty much make what ever hero you want. That&apos;s one place where the game doesn&apos;t really fail so much as stumble a bit. You really need to: 1. Research.... a lot. Like anything where you have limitless options, it&apos;s easy to make mistakes and not know why. There are a number of forum posts, a wiki (still in the building stage). One guy has even built a java based level/power set tool that will help guide you. 2. Have a solid idea on what type of character you want. Sounds easier then it is, but with so many choices if you don&apos;t have an soild mental roadmap when you start you can end up regreting it. 3. Try to limit how many power sets you draw from. There are some pretty sweet ablities the supernatural set has a passive power that to be honest needs a nerf. It&apos;s just too good a self heal buff. But if you &quot;cherry pick&quot; too much you can find yourself lacking at higher levels. 4. Test your powers before you leave the powerhouse (power vendor area). You can drop any before you leave, once you leave it costs you to drop it. Then test again in the questing areas. It&apos;s a total pita if you realize you need to change something you took 10 levels ago. So if you don&apos;t see a tangible result, try something else instead of leaving it as is. 5. Learning how to effectively use the combat system is very important. Unlike any other MMO I&apos;ve played this is the closest to a real time system. This is even better then the one in AoC which was supposed to be RT, but as you reached higher levels became another &quot;press the button&quot; system. In CoL you have a much more indepth system, and knowing what to do and when to do it is very important. As well many powersets will use the system differently, so you really need to take that into account before you enter in to combat. Now as for the bugs some people have mentioned. There are some bugs of course but they don&apos;t really produce a unplayable game. In fact for how new this game is it&apos;s quite stable, and none of the bugs I&apos;ve so far encountered has reduced my enjoyment by any great degree. I&apos;ve played a lot of MMO&apos;s any there is always some nimrods who think it should be a complete final game right from the start. This is an evolving world, and from what I&apos;ve seen so far it&apos;s going to be a great one eventually. I mean I played WoW right from the start, and I&apos;ve actually died sitting in the Inn in IF. Seems the server thought I was in Blasted or something. Bugs are normal and to be expected, and none of the bugs in CoL are deal breakers. As for the quests, there are quite a lot of varied quests. so don&apos;t let the nimrods make you think it&apos;s a grindfest because it isn&apos;t. Again this is a work in progress, so expect it to only get better. Is it a perfect game. Not at all, in fact there are still a number of issues that need to be addressed Such as: Other then extra XP a better loot, there is really no reason you have to group up. This great if you want to solo, but makes finding a PUG harder. The economy and crafting aren&apos;t really there in any major way. You don&apos;t have to really grind for reasourses you get too many as it is just from breaking down loot. There&apos;s really nothing you can craft that is any better then what you loot or get from turning in quests. In fact unlike other MMO&apos;s it&apos;s the talior in stead of the auctioner that everyone crowds around Finally I strongly suggest giving it a try your self before making up your mind. It has so much to offer it&apos;s fantastic. As well the whole world is a bit light hearted, and there&apos;s a lot of little extras thrown in to make you chuckle. For example as a Canadian, it was reall funny to see Bob and Doug Mackenzie as quest vendors, laughed my @ss off on that one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=740566">Expand</a></span>

There are still some things to be worked out, but I&apos;m impressed. The balance issues aren&apos;t nearly as bad as some would have you believe (if you&apos;re dying to level 4 mobs you probably shouldn&apos;t be playing any video games) and Cryptic seems to be trying to fix the major ones asap (to the point of making a lot of people who use the OP builds very angry - most negative reviews I&apos;ve read on other sites come from this group). The game itself feels like a console action-RPG. Something like the old Spiderman games as an MMO. You can build any type of character you want. Personally, I just throw characters together based on what I think looks cool and I haven&apos;t felt like any of my characters are particularly weak at all. The main thing you have to learn to be able to compete at all is how and when to block. It&apos;s not that hard, but most people who think the game is particularly hard simply don&apos;t block or don&apos;t know when to block (I&apos;ve run into them in game, where they think one of my characters is OP because of how many enemies I fight at once, but then when I watch them fight they NEVER block). The main thing I don&apos;t care for much in the game is the pvp. I&apos;ve only participated in two styles of pvp matches. One is more or less a team deathmatch in a small circular room with a cage in the center, the other is a free for all death match on the streets. The street BG is the better concept for me (the cage match is too narrowly focused), but the free for all kills it. If you have a character that fills any kind of support role, you may as well not bother going in. It ends up being a fight where everyone is trying to kill the person who&apos;s being ganged up on while trying to avoid notice themselves. The other minor complaint I might have is that for many people the zones don&apos;t stand out a lot. I thought they were pretty cool, standard comic book fare, but a friend of mine got bored with Canada and pretty much just quit playing before I could even start. It does help to keep in mind that the zones you start in may not be the ones you finish in. For instance, when you start Canada is being assaulted by forces creating a blizzard. The blizzard limits how far away from the base you can go. If you stick with it, you&apos;ll eventually stop the blizzard and have much larger access. It works something like the phasing in wotlk, but it&apos;s zone-wide (you go from a canada during the storm zone to a canada after the storm zone). If you like comic books and you like the general game style of something like The Force Unleashed, you&apos;ll probably like Champions Online (just remember to block!). If you&apos;re huge into pvp, you&apos;re probably better off somewhere else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=86086">Expand</a></span>

Good luck if you planned on being an offensive character while leveling up!
<br>
<br>The other issue that just arose and which made me cancel my sub and un-install, was when it dawned on me that Cryptic is capitalizing on subscribers to the fullest degree by making in-game balance of re-specs cost a fortune (would take months to save for one respec), yet they give you the option to pay just over a months game subscription fee on 1000 cryptic points to buy 1 full respec which would normally cost 850G (alot of resources atm), in-game.
<br>
<br>The result is that they devalue their players in-games efforts, the real life subscription and initial game purchases by putting in vital micro transactions.

I&apos;ve read through most of the reviews, and while the low scores often mention City of Heroes, the high scores don&apos;t. It&apos;s all about expectations. I, along with many others, played City of Heroes for years. Five years, myself, only stopping when Champions was nearly out. I waited over a year to play Champions, hoping for the equivalent to a sequel to City of Heroes, only to be extremely disappointed. While City of Heroes relied heavily on grouping, forming teams or even Task Forces to accomplish great things with other players over the course of hours, Champions made teaming almost pointless, so no one did it. It probably comes all the way down to character building, since in Heroes you needed one of each archetype for a solid team. Here, however, people choose any powers they want, making a team just a random group of characters just as effective (if not less) than one solo hero. The game itself was horrendously linear. In Heroes, you meet one contact, then another and another, choosing most yourself, then learning about Task Forces and other challenges later. In Champions, each zone was a completely linear experience, grinding through the same few contacts until you accomplish what you&apos;re there to do, then you leave for the next zone. There is almost no variety, no choices at all. For a MMO, linear game play with one month&apos;s worth of content is unthinkable. Plus no point in teaming, because characters are not broken into categories like Healer, Tank, or Blaster to give each person a role in combat. If you are familiar with City of Heroes and enjoyed it, this will be a crushing disappointment. If you have never tried a superhero MMO before and have no expectations, you might like this. It seems like everyone either loves it or hates it, separated only be expectations from what I&apos;ve seen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=738012">Expand</a></span>

Cryptic is doing an amazing job an fixing new bugs, fast maintenance times, adding new features, even working on a free expansion. Cryptic should be role models for developers like sony who offer little to no customer satisfaction. The game itself is the most addicting game I have played since the original everquest.</span>

As for UI lag....I&apos;ve never experienced any....for detailed data on power enhancements...they have clickable text that says &quot;show advanced data&quot; or something to that effect. Teaming is as easy as right-clicking someones character in the world or name in the chatbox and selecting invite to team. My highest level character so far is only 22...but I haven&apos;t had to do an OUNCE of grinding to get there...in fact...I&apos;m still overwhelmed with quests...now don&apos;t get me wrong....it most certainly has it&apos;s bugs and overpowered power sets...but ffs....the game has only been out for 2 weeks...and cryptic is really putting a lot of work into fixing all the problems. And before I get any hate from WoW fanboys I DO have an 80 dk and a 64 warlock, as well as a 24 hunter, 21 belf pally, and a multitude of 1-12&apos;s, I&apos;ve done my share of H VoA&apos;s and WG bg&apos;s (I will admit....wintergrasp is hella fun, lol) I&apos;m not saying that I&apos;ll quit WoW either....but CO is DEFINITELY going to hold me over until Cataclysm comes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84664">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s been a long time for me since I last enjoyed a game to the point of daydreaming about it. I&apos;ve played a lot of MMOs over the past 10 years (EQ, CoH, EQ2, Vanguard, LoTRO, WoW) and only a few really held my attention (I&apos;m talking over 4 years). Those being EQ and EQ2. I already know after only 3 weeks of play that this game will join the ranks of those games, but not because it&apos;s like those games. But because it is an entirely different kind of MMO... Leveling/Playstyle It isn&apos;t a grind fest; it progresses at just the right speed. In EverQuest leveling just a single level took days or even weeks sometimes. In World of Warcraft I reached level 40 in a week. I&apos;d say Champions finds a middle ground. I expect to hit level cap (level 40) in about 2 months of play. While this may sound like an extremely short play time for a game that should take years to fully enjoy, you have missed the point here. I have already made 5 other characters I want to play to max level and I&apos;ve daydreamed hundreds of other characters I want to make. The game is going to be entirely different every time I play through it because I can choose to build a character using ANY power in the game! So I can make a teleporting cat-like ninja that uses quick and deadly double blade attacks to kill enemies before they even have a chance to fight back, or see me. Or I can make a character that is a brain enclosed in a robotic body with only one &quot;eye&quot; that uses &quot;mind bullets&quot; and has a tendency to start fires everywhere he floats. Yes he floats instead of walks. Walking is for normal heroes. Not for Super Heroes. This game is very different from any MMOs before it. Grouping The teaming is fun as heck, but you don&apos;t need to have specific classes to form a viable group like in other MMOs. No need to wait for a Tank/DPS/Healer for a group to kick ass. Don&apos;t take that to mean the combat is so easy that you don&apos;t need people to pay attention and pull their weight. The super villains and large group dungeons need everyone in the group on their toes to succeed. Content I&apos;m loving the content so far. The first 8 levels are deeply enjoyable, but doing the same old quests over again could be a problem on my next play through. At level 27 I&apos;ve done EVERY quest I&apos;ve seen available, even the ones that are grayed out. On my next character I might get bored by doing the same quests again, but Cryptic has foreseen this problem. In a few months they are going to have a major game update that adds a ton of new content, a new power set, and lots of other goodies. Hopefully I won&apos;t have to repeat any content, but I probably will do it all again anyway. I&apos;m a bit OCD... The escort missions are the most fun for me. You never know what crazy thing the person you need to guard will do next. &quot;Is he going into that group of 10 henchmen? Oh crap, he is! ATTACK! Hey who&apos;s that shooting missiles at the enemy? Oh it&apos;s the guy I was supposed to be &apos;protecting&apos;!&quot; And the names and actual dialog for the missions is the funniest thing I&apos;ve ever read. Almost all mission names are spoofs of pop culture references! Like this one quest: &quot;The Ordeal of Oceanica 408: Defeat ice demons and rescue crash survivors.&quot; The names of the passengers? J.J. Shepard, John, Cathy, Finn and Furley. The content is full of laugh-inducing quests, dialog and missions. Customization Champions owns all other games in the customization arena. Period. The character creator is limitless in options, and you gain new items to deck out your character with as you complete quests and earn special items and you can even purchase new exclusive costume pieces with perk points. The customization goes even one step further. You can customize most of your powers color and also where the power emits from. I love my flaming &quot;mind bullets&quot;! Graphics The graphics are simply stunning. I get lost in the graphics sometimes. It&apos;s just so damn pretty. Its not realistic (and I don&apos;t want it to be), but more modern comic book looking. Also it doesn&apos;t take an uber rig to run the game. If you drop the graphics down a little it will run on very low end computers. In fact I&apos;m going to try to run it on my EEE PC soon. Developer One thing I really like about this game so far isn&apos;t actually part of the playable content. The development company, Cryptic Studios, so far has amazed me the most. They have responded to every objection I try to find with this game within 24 hours of it coming to my attention. It&apos;s like they are reading my mind and have a group of super-human programmers and developers waiting for the next issue I find. There are a bunch of people griping about how the first day patch messed up the game, but I don&apos;t understand what they are smoking. I agreed with every change they made. The henchmen weren&apos;t even a challenge before the patch. You could kill them with nothing more then your starting energy builder (auto attack)! I&apos;m still able to pwn groups of 15+ henchmen, but its through smart tactics and proper fighting techniques. Champions Online isn&apos;t a game you play on your cell phone! For early start players they offered Lifetime Subscription until the release of the game, but then unexpectedly took it away because they were selling to many. A lot of fans on the forums protested the change of plans and within a day they reversed their decision and offered it as promised until the release of the game. I can&apos;t remember the last time a company admitted they were wrong and then took steps to correct their mistake! And more importantly this company has actively listened to the posts on their forums and actually RESPONDS to questions and requests! This is a rare thing to see in a developer, or any company. Overall, I&apos;m loving this game. Champions Online gets a 10 because it&apos;s extremely fun, offers TONs of re-playability, has great graphics, is mostly free of bugs and has one of the best (almost super-human) development teams I&apos;ve ever seen backing it with fast, regular bug fixes and promising, new content in the near future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84767">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, there isn&apos;t enough of it so you&apos;ll reach dead spots. Given that mobs reward tiny amounts of XP, you&apos;re in for some grindy hell levels if you want to see 40. So even if you manage to choose the &quot;right&quot; powers, you&apos;re still up against a brick wall. If there were three weeks worth of real entertainment in this game it might be worth a buy but honestly, there&apos;s not even that. Maybe it&apos;ll be better in a year but I would not recommend it right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85004">Expand</a></span>

While appreciating a game is highly subjective in terms of personal preference, breaking down CO reveals an extremely functional mmo. Firstly, the graphics engine is efficient and the worlds are brilliantly detailed. Consider zones akin in size to GTA4, except you can pick up almost any visible object and throw it at your foe; bottles, tables, cars, tanks, toilets.. you get the idea. The physics are spot on, and the character animation is above average. Audibly quite appealing, although nothing spectacular. The music tracks are perfect for the fun and comical or often intense enviorments and transitions are smooth. Weapon sounds are satisfying; npc scripting is humorous and often cheesy. I haven&#xE2;??t had a video game make me consistently laugh out loud in years. I&#xE2;??m reminded of the glory days of Sierra with the brilliant tongue-in-cheek humor. In terms of features generally specific to MMO&apos;s, Cryptic have covered basically every area. Account-based mail and friend system; mission system is intuitive and it is EXTREMELY difficult to not find something to do. There are public/open quests, where you can hop in at any time (akin to Warhammer albeit much more immersive and enjoyable) More than that, I often find myself killing mobs because it can be just that fun. While I&apos;m yet to reach the level hardcap, the public raid content I&apos;ve enjoyed up to 30 is extremely fun very replayable. I look forward to the same events on different characters. PVP is accessible at any level, hell you can start at one if you want, but it takes barely 30 mins to finish the simple tutorial zone and hit level 5+. There is an average wait time of 0 minutes when queing for hero games due to the localized server. While there are excellent scenarios (think TF2) and rewards/xp gain, there are imbalances in the power system. Obviously there are some skills which are far suited to PVE than PVP, as the case with a lot of MMOs, but the game is barely 2 weeks old, and it is being patched almost every day. Judging from the good changes they have made in this short time, Cryptic are well aware of the state of their game, and take PVP balance as a high priority. It&apos;s nice to note that when they have modified the skillsets, they have given every player a free complete respec. Bugs? I&apos;ve crashed twice so far, three other people I play with have never crashed. If you are crashing, there&apos;s probably a fix on the forums you haven&apos;t found. There are practically zero visual, audio or core anomalies to be found I&#xE2;??m concerned about what a person has played before this if they consider it a grindfest. The quests take probably 2-3 minutes on average to complete. By that i mean the entire process; pick up the quest, get to the area, do required task (which are numerous and fun, not just KILL &#xE2;??x&#xE2;?? this many times) and get back to the NPC to turn in. I can&#xE2;??t honestly tell you have long it takes to level, because I&#xE2;??m generally having so much fun blowing things up, summoning zombies, grinding flesh with a chainsaw or flipping about the screen with any of the amazing travelling abilities (you can fly, teleport, tunnel, swing, jump about with rocket boots or ride a giant chunk of ground &#xE2;?? like a piece of pavement, turf or snow depending on what you were standing on) Also, in regards to its &#xE2;??terrible control system&#xE2;??, Cryptic have been ingenious enough to include this amazing Control Options menu. Fancy that! Grouping is literally as simple asking in zone chat. Which, it turns out, is pretty simple. I&#xE2;??ll end by pointing out the highly advanced character creation system, which gives you literally billions of options to create the hero of your choice. You can be a zombie pirate, a robot cowboy, a telekinetic hippy, a gun-toting lizard, a horny demon, an armoured mecha-suit, an evil doctor or even a freakn leprechaun. It&#xE2;??s more than possible to recreate any of your favourite super-heroes, and there&#xE2;??s more than likely a set of skills which match. If you want to enjoy an extremely fun, highly expandable and very reasonably polished mmo that doesn&#xE2;??t require full-time hours to reach the content you desire, give CO a try. Warning; Attention span is required.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85011">Expand</a></span>

The character and power customization have allowed me to put together the superhero I always wished I could be. The game certainly has some flaws, but because they are patching them over time, I definitely consider this game a 10.</span>

Due a poor launch characterized by constant changing, nerfing and re-nerfing (and, on occasion, re-re-nerfing) the game is not in what you would call a stable state. Documentation is laughably out of date, omitting entire classes of powersets. Even the tooltips for powers are frequently incorrect. Content-wise, there is very little content; there are only five zones which become overly-familiar and boring as you crisscross them in search of enough content to level. Sadly, this search will often be in vain during the last ten levels of the game. Now add to this mess extreme overmoderation of the playerbase. Various inoffensive words are bannable for uttering (a note to the cautious: do not abbreviate the word &quot;roleplayer&quot; if you value your account!) and certain intentionally repeatable content is bannable for repeating. This is a game that needs much love, balancing, and content to be worth the time or money. There is a kernel of a good game here, let&apos;s hope they nurture it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85044">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m at level 21 and was surprised to see that the PvP map changed to multi level map. Free for all PvP is also available. Tactics is important despite what people say, just far more involved since power is so varied. There is no specific class for a character. You can bridge multiple frameworks to create exactly what you want. Only annoying thing is that framework is somewhat unbalanced and there are some bugs. However, compared to how broken any other MMORPGs were at its launch, yes that includes your beloved WoW as well, it has been relatively problem free. As far as MMO goes, it refreshing change that does not require sado-masochistic grinding that people seems to enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85155">Expand</a></span>

This game has obviously been pushed out the door and it shows everywhere. Public quests not working, NPC&apos;s stuck in walls, AI problems, unbalanced powers, graphical artifacts, auction house not working properly, LFG tool, while basic, still not functional. Its horrible. Also the game claims to have reinvented the combat system, it has not. In CO defense though, combat does feel fast and more like an action game than typical MMO turn based combat. The downside is that it is incredibly repetitive, combine that with the most boring quests you can come up with and a handful of (mostly bugged) extremely small instances and you have a game that is not going to last long. Also, this company, Cryptic, has no problems changing their game without even notifying their own fanbase. On day one for example, they completely overhauled the game for the worse, making characters weak, not having enough content to even get to max level etc. And when you hit 40, there is little endgame. you can get a few dailies etc but nothing feels epic. the only epic thing i experienced at endgame was that i picked up a level 42 item, while the cap is 40, so i must be good at it somehow. Anyway, spend your money elsewhere, as this game is nothing more than a hollow, bugged, empty Beta product, with very little content. (a single player game like oblivion has more).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85224">Expand</a></span>

Overall, a decent combat system, but the game just feels lifeless and dull.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84368">Expand</a></span>

Combat is extremely fun and quick, Graphics capture the Comic book feel perfectly, and enough Character Customisation options to make sure that every character is unique. PvE is definately a strong point of this game with plenty of group and solo content.</span>

The bumps game in the pre-game issues with people not getting in or outside-game issues such as people not getting their alotted items/content on-time. As far as the game goes, I&apos;ve got to say I love it. I like Age of Conan. I wanted to love Warhammer Age of Reckoning (didn&apos;t so much), WoW is and always will be near and dear to my heart, EQ2 was a great time for me as was SWG initially and subsequently well after teh CU debacle. I&apos;ve also been all over City of Heroes/Villains. So where would I place CO in there? I&apos;d have to say right behind WoW at this point. 1. WoW 2. Champions Online 3. Eve Online 4. Everquest 2 5. Anarchy Online.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84491">Expand</a></span>

This isn&apos;t the game for you. I feel like much more of a superhero as a Hunter in WoW. Also, you have to subscribe to even get your 30 free days...you can cancel your subscription after activation, though -- and you won&apos;t be charged. Hopefully, they keep doing major patches &amp; balances every few days like they have been doing -- that way, in a few months, it&apos;ll be playable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84634">Expand</a></span>

Travel is fun, the instance dungeons seem well designed. Both solo and multiplayer seem fun, though I wish it were easier to group. I understand they are going to tweek the grouping ui. I would probably get more into the story of the game if it were not presented as a bunch of tiny font monologues from the NPC that offer you missions. They should have used the chat bubbles or something to give it a real comic bookie feel. Still a great game. I see a lot of potential and I think that it has a good group of developers that are going to try and improve it a lot over the coming months.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84785">Expand</a></span>

There&#xE2;??s not a select few powers you have to choose or else you&#xE2;??ll get owned, people that complain about this suck at games, it&#xE2;??s not hard. Great graphics, character creator, power editor, pretty good mission ideas, team combat isn&#xE2;??t broken, loot system is cool and it has a very nice and involving crafting system as well. Don&#xE2;??t get me wrong there are still bugs, balance issues etc. But it&#xE2;??s an MMO (and it&#xE2;??s at LAUCH) so over time these things will be fixed and there will be addition content and powers added. Don&#xE2;??t let people who can&#xE2;??t handle a different style of MMO that actually makes you think scare you away from trying this game out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84790">Expand</a></span>

I understand there is more to add, but so far this game is very very fun (alot of recent mmos have missed this vital aspect). Customisation junkies and alt making addicts will be in heaven with this game.</span>

Yes, Cryptic made lots of changes to the game, but they were very needed to keep people interested and to keep the gameplay balanced. Just because your broken, overpowered super-power got FIXED and you think it was nerfed only shows that you&apos;re just crying because now you have to work for your experience. This game has all of the cool features of WoW and many other really cool things that are unique! So much flexibility in the powers system alone! Not to mention the immersion of the Nemesis stuff!

It starts off very well, character creation great, lots of choice, but as countless others have said, you need to dedicate hours of research in the forums to have a clue what powers to choose, and if you choose the wrong ones you are scr*w*d. I chose very good powers, and have had none of the difficulties people have encountere, but it&apos;s luck. And in the latest of one nerf patch after another they have kicked many of my powers in the teeth. It&apos;s irritating in an MMO to live in so much flux. And they made an ENORMOUS mistake. I repeat, ENORMOUS by pricing retcons/respecs so high. Fools. Graphics are great. Missions are OK, a little generics. Atmosphere is fun enough... I say this is a game you buy, play the free month, then forget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=84993">Expand</a></span>

It requires a little more use of &quot;brain power&quot; and what you have available to your character to survive at points, and i find that interesting. If you go in expecting to just pewpew and win, you may be disappointed.</span>

Multiple content gaps at various level brackets.  Many broken missions.  Economy is virtually non existant. In game grouping and socialization is also virtually non existant.  Reports of bugs or game breaking issues are being ignored on the test server and patches going live and then requiring multiple mini patches to fix after complaints pour in on the servers.  Developer responses to players in patch notes and other forms are patronizing, arrogant, or worst of all ignorant to the mechnics and statistics of their own game. Advertised product is not what is actually presented in game. And the list goes on.  If you want a sandbox to make pretty characters and piddle around for a few hours with some mix matching of powers to mess around with then this will keep you happy for  a few hours to a month. If you&apos;re looking for an MMO, this game is more of a beta single player shallow action rpg than anything.  Cryptic didnt learn from their mistakes with City of Heroes/Villains, their fiasco with the original version of Champions under the titling of Marvel Universe Online(which Microsoft and Marvel ditched due to Cryptic incompetence prompting Cryptic to sell city of heroes/villains so they could stay afloat etc etc.    Give this game an unfortunate wide berth.   Im sorely disappointed and regretting I bought it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85047">Expand</a></span>

However, it really just got better and better for me. I&apos;ve enjoyed the small amount of PvP i&apos;ve played, but i&apos;ve REALLY enjoyed just playing through the quest, up to creating my Nemesis and so on and so forth. You just feel like a Superhero in a world that needs Superheros. I have to recommend it, as the combat is fresh and fun, the character customization is great, and i haven&apos;t had to grind through the first 27 levels - and still have a HEAP of quests left. I also can&apos;t stress how the combat is actually FUN, something i haven&apos;t experienced since Guild Wars and their limit on 8 abilities at one time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=85265">Expand</a></span>

The PnP version was one of my favorite RPG&apos;s ever so when I got a chance to join in I was ready to sell every thing I owned just to get involved in the development of the game.
<br>
<br>I happened to get in on the Alpha and thought things were looking really awesome for the game. I had played City of Heroes from beta to close also and thought things were going to be different. When the beta was done I convinced seven of my friends from CoH to join CO, which we all bought the lifetime membership.
<br>
<br>We played it for a few months and as nerf after nerf came about we all started to fade from playing. They had completely ruined a good game and it never came to be as good as CoH. In fact, it wasn&apos;t even half as good as CoH, even with all the problems CoH had until the end.
<br>
<br>CO became a kiddie game. It was a game where people worried about getting a special set of wings or a special aura and maybe a rare vanity pet (which did nothing to help you in battle).
<br>
<br>The monetary system never worked and was actually better in the beginning but now was absolutely worthless. Crafting was ridiculous and ended up being worse the WoW leaving you to kill thousands of one mob just to get enough of one drop to make an item which was actually worthless.
<br>
<br>The game play itself went down hill and powers became weaker, convoluted and misplaced. It no longer felt like being a hero but more like a store mannequin, with how good did you look today? They threw in vehicles and other crap which just brought the game down more.
<br>
<br>The worst MMORPG I&apos;ve ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4718733">Expand</a></span>

The world and characters aren&apos;t follow the golden age design without ever having any of the personality beyond &apos;I am heroically good!&apos; and &apos;I&apos;m evil, mwahaha!&apos; while the gameplay itself doesn&apos;t seem to know what it&apos;s trying to be.
<br>Worst of all, the game&apos;s a balance mess. Jack Emmert&apos;s complete inability to balance player and enemy abilities is in full effect here, leaving only a small handful of workable powers and others which are next to useless in comparison.
<br>Champions Online&apos;s character creator is still a fantastically powerful tool that can allow you to create almost anything (though you can&apos;t really escape the goofy feeling of the art design), but beyond that there&apos;s nothing to recommend, besides an example of what not to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5233855">Expand</a></span>

However, the quests in it are mostly the same, plus the leveling takes a lot of time. I&apos;m normally not a fan of fast leveling, but I really urged to get to the next level, and it felt like I was spending an eternity. All of those bad things aside, I think Champions Online to be a great game, but it just needs to work on its gameplay. I admit however, that the pvp and the pve are great. It&apos;s just the quests that bother me. Conclusion: Champions online is a good game, but it has a few issues. I, however, still recommend it to people who like to play a hero based MMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1707597">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only negativ fact is the sound. The sound and music seems to me very strange. Okay 8now</span>

The very cartoony style of this game is what makes it special, and considering it&apos;s free to play, let&apos;s not be picky.
<br>
<br>Hours of fun with friends, lots of missions too, and you can without any problem enjoy yourself without spending money on it. The different ways of travelling are a nice detail (flying, running, jumping..), and the customization of your character is well developed.
<br>
<br>It is indeed highly suggested to not invest money in this, as you can&apos;t do a lot more once you&apos;ve bought it. More slots, a nicer cape, and some special quests, that&apos;s all. The cap level at 40 is pretty low, you get bored pretty fast after that.
<br>
<br>Conclusion : It&apos;s free and fun, have a go !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/champions-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4294682">Expand</a></span>
