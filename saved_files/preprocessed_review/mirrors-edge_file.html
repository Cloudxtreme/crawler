<br>I just spent 30 minutes running in circle, being chased by armed guards, unable to figure out where am I supposed to go. I suppose I could keep trying, if I knew how to fight them. At least my copy of the game has a glitch: the tutorial mission stuck&apos;s at a certain point, keeps me trying over and over again the wall-jump thing and forces me to just start the story with no idea how to play properly.
<br>The soundtrack is one of the best I&apos;ve heard and overall atmosphere is very very nice.
<br>I bet the game will kick ass on consoles, presumably without the tutorial-problem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=3150546">Expand</a></span>

Mirror&apos;s Edge did just that. The game offered a first person prospective adventure with a focus on agility and speed.
<br>
<br>Far too many &quot;run and gun&quot; FPS games lead us through a parking garage or a warehouse, all the while throwing waves of repetitive enemies at us. You kill them all (maybe with the aid of a well placed explosive barrel or two), and move on to the next area. Stealth games have also flooded the market, rewarding the player for silent take downs. Mirror&apos;s Edge takes both gaming staples, combines them, adds some acrobatics, and puts the emphasis on speed instead of killing.
<br>
<br>In Mirror&apos;s Edge you play the role of a Runner; an urban courier who delivers packages by sprinting across city blocks and jumping from roof top to roof top. The game mechanics allow you to scale walls (by timing your jumps), fall great distances (as long as you are precise with your roll when you land), and use obstacles to help increase your momentum. You can stop to fight enemies along the way, but you&apos;re not a one man army, and can be killed with only a few shots. The game rewards you for finding safer and faster routes through an area rather than trying to take the enemy out head on.
<br>
<br>The controls give the player a sense that there isn&apos;t anywhere in the environment that is unreachable. The first time you build up enough speed to chain a roll into wall run and jump to hurdle over a railing, all without stopping, you&apos;ll really understand the strength of this game. The fluidity of movement is unmatched by anything else in the FPS market. Add to that a gorgeous environment, extremely well done sound, and a great story and you&apos;ve got a game that is impossible to forget. At about five hours for the campaign Mirror&apos;s Edge doesn&apos;t drone on long enough for the parkour elements to wear thin, but it seem a little short. Price accordingly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1425720">Expand</a></span>

It challenges your gamer mettle. The feeling of overcoming those challenges is very rewarding. The game even manages to go out on a heartwarming note despite its ho-hum cliched dystopian setting. The complaints of length are accurate but we all know that while the value of most games is measured in time and how many gameplay hours you squeeze out of them, few others transcend that and are instead measured by the quality of the experience.

Even though the story is generally bad and nonsensical, the gaming experience is what makes Mirror&apos;s Edge stand-out.</span>

Some parts were really fun, like a lot of the rooftop parts. There&apos;s not much replay value besides trying to find quicker paths. Even if you do find a cleverly hidden route, you&apos;ll end up meeting back with the main path within 10 seconds.</span>

I played it first on the XBox, and absolutely fell in love with the running, the puzzles, and the art style, but always felt the controls a bit sluggish. This PC version fixes that, and more, with better visuals, accurate K&amp;M controls, and the same elements that made the console version great. Despite what GameSpy said, this is not a shoddy port. Sure, the interface is unchanged from the console version, so that suffers a bit, and sure it&apos;s locked to the 16:9 aspect ratio, but it seems well optimized, and I haven&apos;t seen any of the tearing issues they talked about. Performance: 45-60fps V-sync normal, 30 when things get busy, 1920x1200, 2x AA, Highest graphics and textures, and PhysX enabled on Core2Due e8500, 4GB 800Mhz, SLI GeForce 9600GTs, Audigy 2, Windows 7 beta and Vista Some people, including me, have had problems with no sound on the cutscenes, especially in Windows 7. Install Creative Alchemy if you have a creative card, and add Mirror&apos;s Edge with sub folder &quot;Binaries&quot;. Fixes that!

Mirror&apos;s Edge moves quickly, and as the blurb says, there is a real flow to the game. The free running main character Faith zips through the urban landscape in truly spectacular fashion. I have only one complaint: the time for a first complete play-through was between three and four hours. When I saw the end credits I thought to myself, &quot;This is it?!&quot; The game ended before I could even really snag the interface completely. But other than the length, I had zero issues. I felt so into the character, and every move felt like it should in real life, right down to the way Faith swung over railings. The first-person aspect of the game worried me when I saw it at first, but EA really did a good job on making the visuals feel like you were viewing them right through your own eyes. And unlike many other first-person games, you can look down and see yourself. The fantastic story really completes the experience, and lets you immerse yourself in the game. If only it hadn&apos;t ended so soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=421318">Expand</a></span>

Well maybe more like a fast paced first person action game since hand to hand or gun combat is rare. You are encouraged to find your path away from trouble by running through roof tops and the sensation is very intense as of course you try to avoid falling. No other game in memory has ever provided this type of experience in gaming. Heights are believable and add a lot of suspense. Running through roof tops while being chased gives you a feeling like no other game to this day has. Graphics are great and te game runs very well.

Its not perfect, but I give it a 10 nonetheless because it gave me a real fresh gameplay. The idea, the design, the protagonists blend into something that has got a identity of its own. I can&apos;t help myself I just love faith and I DO wanna see part 2 and 3. Thanks DICE!</span>

A very fun, exciting, and original 6-hour experience. Though short, at $20 (or less on sale) this game is well worth it. The game has breathtaking visuals and the feeling of stringing together a bunch of parkour moves is exhilarating. I actually enjoyed the combat, since I understood that it wasn&apos;t meant to be like a regular FPS, though I actually did find the guns fun to use, though their use was limited. Disarming an enemy could be a bit finicky, but wasn&apos;t a game-breaker. Hopefully in the sequel they will provide even more breathtaking environments, as well as a greater variety of parkour and melee combat moves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=740935">Expand</a></span>

I literally sweat (through my palms mostly!) when I play this game.. The graphics are breathtaking, the animations beautiful. The music is perfect. I haven&apos;t completed it yet, but I&apos;m loving every minute. Well done developers.</span>

The controls are easy to learn and when you get the hang of it you will be fullfilled to make some fast combos. The story is also quite nice, and the comic style of the cutscenes is also a plus. The main character has some charisma. I hope to see more of Mirror&apos;s Edge in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=422515">Expand</a></span>

I still felt however, that Mirror&apos;s Edge could have been so much more with a few tweaks. First, as others have said, the combat can be frustrating, as can the map layouts occasionally (when you can&apos;t find the exit to the next section). I&apos;d really like to see a quicksave, as opposed to checkpoint saves, as doing the same path 25 times only to fall on the last obstacle before the next checkpoint really gets old. Finally, I feel like the story could have used better writers, and nearly all the voice actors could have been replaced (Faith was the only major character who didn&apos;t sound like she was reading off a cue card). Ultimately, though the foundations are there for game-of-the-year material, it just needs a little more work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=84053">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is near perfect and the FPS platform style realy got my atention. The controlls are easy to understand. The only reason a gave it a nine and not a ten is because it is too short, and the story has room for inprovment. Even though it&apos;s short, the time trials will keep you playing for hours more. The bigest problem is that some players simply won&apos;t like the game style. I happen to love the way everything connects but some will find it to hard and will not have fun playing through the levels. If this game seems like something for you, get it. you won&apos;t regret it. But it seems like a game that will just get you frustrated, then rent it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=421255">Expand</a></span>

Sure the length of the game is not ideal but on the other hand it could easily fall to stereotype if it would have been any longer. It&apos;s a shame that such a wonderful game is beeing sold so lousily. I don&apos;t want to have any more copies of Call of Duty until the rest of my life. This is a kind of project that causes the evolution of gaming.

The immersion was fantastic, the graphics are interesting and different and the style is great, and the gameplay was, for the most part, great. A big part of my initial frustration with this game, though, was that learning curve was pretty steep. It took me about three or four hours of play to really grasp the movement and combat. However, once I learned I began to have so much fun. It is incredibly satisfying to run through an entire level without pausing or to take down four SWAT officers easily and swiftly. I do have a few minor quibbles in addition to the learning curve: one, I agree that the flash-style cutscenes were a mistake. It breaks the immersion and I think the graphics engine could have handled cutscenes easily. Two, I had multiple problems with the game not registering my grabs onto ledges or pipes...I don&apos;t know what I am doing wrong, but when Faith is right next to a pipe and leans over towards it, jumps, literally clips through the pipe but STILL manages to miss it, and falls to her death I became extremely frustrated. All in all I say this game was a success. There are frustrations to be sure but I wish more developers put out interesting, immersive titles such as this one. I want to reiterate what others have said and state that this game is definitely not for everyone, but if you are willing to spend a bit of time learning then I think you will be very, very happy. I am very glad I bought it and I really hope they put out more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=421353">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Good things:
<br>--------------------
<br>-Frantic acrobatic maneuvers and free running ( it feels so good when you overcome a number of obstacles in a row and doing it from the first person perspective makes it even more exciting )
<br>
<br>-Game Mechanics ( Runner vision, slow-mo and  Disarming moves all add to the game and integrate seamlessly into the experience enhancing it ) 
<br>
-Graphics ( Top notch, it feels very unique specially with the smart use of bold basic colors, and being able to see your feet and body while running and jumping does make it feel more immersive, also the cut scenes while done in a different style are nice and stylish ) 
<br>
The Bad:
<br>------------
<br>-Weapons ( handling the guns is a little cranky but it is forgivable since you rarely have to use guns and of course Faith isn&apos;t trained on using them ) 
<br>
-It&apos;s quite short .. damn it .. i want more XD

Beautiful game, and can play organically like flowing water or clunky like a brick wall.  After you get used to it, running gets really rewarding when you take guesses as to where to go and make all the right moves.  Minimal gun play makes it tense and more of a survival game.

<br>GRAPHICS: (8/10)   The bold colors against mostly white buildings is a good look, and, as with cel-shading, it makes the graphics hold up fairly well years later.  The use of red to highlight pathways also works really well.
<br>CONTROL: (6/10)    No problems, but I use a joystick for pc games, not a keyboard.
<br>GAMEPLAY: (8/10)    Mirror&apos;s edge is one of my favorite platforming games, and by far the best of the more realistic parkour simulators (The Assasin&apos;s Creed games don&apos;t even COUNT as &quot;platformers&quot; since they don&apos;t have a true jump button, you just hold down the action button and run and the game jumps for you).  It would have been rated higher except the game isn&apos;t varied enough.  It would have been nice to have levels where you are actually chasing other parkour characters, or are being chased by characters you have to outrun, but instead every level is just a get-from-A-to-B deal with the only variations being in the placement of obstacles like armed police-guards and platforms.  It was fun enough for me to replay the whole thing twice more already, but I hope the sequel takes some cues from the wilder mario games and adds some new platforming challenges (rather than turning it into a shooter).
<br>GAME PLAYTHROUGH LENGTH:  6-8 hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=3175540">Expand</a></span>

<br>Never has a game given me such conflicted feelings. In many ways MIRROR&#x2019;S EDGE is a great game, but in a few, significant others, it sucks big time. Firstly, it&#x2019;s yet another buggy, console port, which is becoming par for the course, sadly, for us PC gamers. Despite this, however, the visuals are good apart from the character models, which are below normal PC game standards. But the most important aspect of the game is the gameplay. When you&#x2019;re free-running through the city it&#x2019;s a true joy to play. The recreation of parkour techniques is remarkable and DICE have created a truly immersive experience. But then you&#x2019;re forced to fight, and that&#x2019;s where the game fails miserably. The combat in this game is the worst I&#x2019;ve ever encountered. It&#x2019;s so bad at times that there isn&#x2019;t room in a short review to detail the failings, suffice it to say it&#x2019;s maddening, especially when you&#x2019;re forced to replay a particularly tricky section because you have insufficient control of Faith when in combat, or because she transforms from a nimble athlete into a trudging hippo as soon as she picks up a gun. And yet, even though I wanted to throw my PC out the window many times while playing ME, I&#x2019;m so glad I stuck with it because, at it&#x2019;s best MIRROR&#x2019;S EDGE is an inspired example of what computer gaming can offer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171741">Expand</a></span>

Other than that, graphics and graphic designs are still pleasant. It&apos;s also very original, unique and well achieved gameplay (watch the gameplay video for proof). I would especially recommend this game if you&apos;ve always wanted an FPS version of Tomb Raider or Assassin&apos;s Creed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1551078">Expand</a></span>

Any second you gain, any shortcut you find, any improvement over past runs you make feel very rewarding. And Mirror&apos;s Edge is, indeed, a racing game!!! It is a game that you&apos;re supposed to play over and over, through speed runs, time trials or even new playthroughs, to become the fastest runner you can be. You don&apos;t play it for the story, you don&apos;t play it for exploration, you don&apos;t play it as a casual game, you play it to beat it in less time than in your previous playthrough. Keeping momentum for as long as possible is difficult, and you won&apos;t be able to do it on your first play through (which will involve a lot of trial and error), but once you know where to go you can focus on it and then you&apos;re on for one amazing and unforgettable experience. Give it a shot!!! People complain that shooting and fighting is clunky - I agree with that, but this is not a game where you should stop to fight or shoot, you are a runner and you should keep running.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=2847432">Expand</a></span>

The concept of the game is also so unique as most mainstream games are all fps&apos;s.

Higher FoV, better framerates, higher resolution, more detailed textures with minimal pop-in, more vivid colours (which are an a big part of this game&apos;s artistic style), PhysX, better lighting and shadows and of course, anti-aliasing which, certainly the console versions were lacking but really needed to smooth out those rough edges. The controls are also far superior and more fluent. Having played it on console, I couldn&apos;t imagine how it could be better on PC but the default button layout is absolutely perfect, and the precision of the mouse and sensitivity adjustments give you much greater control- very useful for trying to get good times in time trials.

I was amazed by how beautiful they managed to make the game look and feel. Being in a city landscape, you also don&apos;t really see many jagged edges on game objects, such as buildings with the proper hardware, in other words, the game engine runs very smoothly. In some instances I was caught at the edge of my seat trying to flee from the scene, or get out alive. The mechanics of the game are also very well balanced. The only down side to this game, is that the characters didn&apos;t have a huge amount of depth, nor did the main story&apos;s reasoning. The relationship between the main character and her sister was felt, but other characters didin&apos;t have the same kind of outward depth to them. The storyline was purposely setup so that the gamer jumps into the story what feels like half way into the main story line. I really hope we get an part two of this game to elaboate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=2665383">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>An amazing game.
<br>It was rather underrated in many places, but honestly, I belive this game is one of the most original and fun games I&apos;ve yet to play.
<br>The story is very interesting, the world is beautiful and colourful, the soundtrack is wonderful  and the gameplay is very fun and refreshing.
<br>Problem is it was too short for me :P</span>

No time to think or look around.  Just run someplace that looks good - jump and plummet to your death or get shot.  Next time run a different direction.  After several deaths you may figure out where you need to go and how to get there.  No fun.</span>

<br>there are also some other bugs like being locked into scope vision when using a sniper rifle and faith not always grabbing on ledges.
<br>although minor issues,can be really annoying and pulls you right out of the immersion.
<br>but thats really all the issues is have with this game.
<br>The Good things the game does,it does really well.
<br>like the graphics,never before i&apos;ve seen realism and artistic graphics clash together like this.
<br>Music is very fitting most of the time too. and the running and jumping mechanics work well most of the time. the story is also integral to the events that unfold while you play, and is generally wel executed.
<br>all in all, its a enjoyable experience</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1485360">Expand</a></span>

The story is ok but the gameplay is excellent  for pc which some disagree (obviously not pc gamers who can adapt to certain controls) if you think the pc controls are difficult or oddly placed, no offence, but stick to your console system. The graphics are good, the music is good (not really music but more a theme of trying to get away). This game is just fun, especially for the price, its kinda like a first person prince of persia or assassins creed, but mainly focuses on the climbing and running aspect. The combat is minimal but there are times you have to take down a few soldiers which i found fun since its all about timing and trying to get them 1 on 1. Great game and i reccomend it to anyone who likes these kinda games, spend a minute and look at a youtube gameplay video to see if its for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=2082830">Expand</a></span>

I would give this absolute masterpiece a 10 if it weren&apos;t for the shooting parts which seemed forced onto the developers by out-of-touch executives. The odd handgun is fine but there really is no need for a SAW in a game like this. At least the player is handicapped when using the larger weapons.<br><br>Things which should be taken into account if DICE were to improve upon a sequel or prequel - Less emphasis on guns than there already is, and an open city to go wherever you wanted would turn this from a stunning masterpiece to a ground breaking masterpiece.<br><br>Well done DICE, this is a game amongst games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1989766">Expand</a></span>

On the negative side, the campaign is a bit short, and they haven&apos;t released any level editors so using custom maps is not that easy. Also, the game isn&apos;t very tough (on the PC at least). Even hard mode without a reticle or runner vision is fairly easy to finish without firing a single shot (except for the one part where you&apos;re forced to in order to progress).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1559439">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are amazing even when they colored the buildings a little too simple. The sound works and the musics are great too. The overall gameplay is good, but you&apos;ll get confused later on. The chase sequences are great and it&apos;s very intense, though you&apos;ll experience some trial-and-error if you can&apos;t find the right object to jump over. The bad thing is that the story isn&apos;t interesting, especially when they use a 2D animation in some cut scenes. The combat only used sometimes.

I would&apos;ve paid $20 or more if I&apos;d known it was so good. No console port problems. Outstanding graphics - very stylized, atmospheric, and with meticulous attention to detail. PhysX provides nice detail that helps breathe life into the city. The sound design was flawless. I encountered no glitches, except for getting stuck in one place I wasn&apos;t supposed to jump through. The relatively short length was good for me, as I have a lot of games to get through these days. I was reminded of Portal at times. This is primarily a puzzle game, but the combat that&apos;s in there is pretty satisfying too. Some parts were a bit frustrating but once I learned to look sideways during a wallrun I was all set. The story wasn&apos;t anything epic but honestly it was better than stories from many other otherwise good games, and it was illustrated nicely and it fit with the rest of the game. I enjoyed this game a lot more than the Half-Life 2 episodes that took more time and money.

One of the best qualities this game has it shares with Half-Life 2.  That is, the fact that the entirety of the game is an adrenaline rush.  From beginning to end (if you play on the hardest difficulty :D) you are filled with either exhilaration or vertigo.  I would never have conceived of doing a parkour platformer in first person, yet here we are. (Although everybody else was already here since, once again, I am years late in my review :) )  And EA Dice did an incredible job at it.  The graphical style is clean, colorful, and easy to navigate visually.  The control mechanics are fluid on PC (something that never seems to be true with a console port).  And the story is good, while the voice acting is top notch.  ( I also loved the cutscenes with their slight anime/graphic novel style).  Every month or so I keep coming back to this game, remembering and reliving it with delight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=2152535">Expand</a></span>

I was simply unable to stop playing this game till I seen last lane of titles. Sadly it took only one day, but still - game is awesome. Sadly no MP or user-friendly SDK to create own levels. As for online trials - there is alot of cheaters there.</span>

But really, I never found myself stuck in any one place for more than a few minutes; it really isn&apos;t hard to pull most of the stunts. It just takes practice and some patience, which is nothing wrong in my opinion. Other than that, this game is simply gorgeous and you really feel engaged(I have never felt so immersed in a videogame before). It feels as if you are really running on top of those rooftops and the runner&apos;s actions are smooth and graceful. Every movement feels totally credible and authentic, which engages the player even more. I also love how you don&apos;t have to rely on weapons to progress through the game (as a note, the weapon mechanics really aren&apos;t that bad as others say; I found aiming and disarming foes pretty simple. It just takes some normal practice. . .) This game reminds me alot of the old-school platform games but with an arcade feel to it. If you really miss those good-old Japanese/anime games, then you really need to give this one a try; you&apos;ll feel as if you&apos;re back on your original playstation. The story is also great; the cartoon cutscenes totally match the anime feel, and I found the plot to be pretty profound and complex even though the game is rather short. But, if you really pay attention to the story, it really has some sense and interest to it, and it evokes some human compassion (unlike most games today which concentrate on pure human bloodshed). My only criticism really comes with the end. I found it a bit too adrupt, even though it&apos;s very touching. Others would criticize that the game is too short. True, the game is &quot;short&quot;, but it&apos;s really not a flaw. If you really want to explore every nook and cranny in the game, you can probably squeeze 20-30 hours. Most ppl will play it for 10 hours which I think is great, because at one point, you need to finish playing the game, so why not earlier than later? Most people have other things to do in their lives, and so, I would rather play a game that is short and profound than one that is long and empty (*cough* Oblivion) What matters is the quality, and this game is all about that. Mirror&apos;s Edge is really underrated and underappreciated. It has some potentially annoying flaws, but really, it&apos;s all forgiveable. Now, go make all your roof-jumping fantasies come true and try the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=745363">Expand</a></span>

While it is also the only game i&apos;ve ever played like it. It&apos;s fun... sometimes and rewarding even less of the time! It&apos;s quite hard from the camera angle to actually get what the character is doing all the time. Which makes improvement in a particular area of the gameplay just pure chance. Be prepared to get stuck on area&apos;s and be frustrated. Good innovation, poor execution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=742628">Expand</a></span>

One of my favorite parts of the game are the chases and they are very expertly paced throughout the game enough so that your excitement is always pretty high but not frustratingly so it gives you time to enjoy the striking visuals. My least favorite part of the game is the story which says a lot about the game because even that was not strictly &quot;bad&quot;. I loved how they spread flavor throughout the world that gave you more information about the space you were working in, it&apos;s just that at the end I was left wishing that there was something a little better. All in all this was a superb game and with it being priced around 20 dollars now there should be nothing stopping you from giving it a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=741439">Expand</a></span>

I loved having the feeling of running between buildings and being able to do things that only happen in our dreams. I loved the controls, I just modified the controls to fit my style of play and there was no problems. It is a very graphically beautiful. The action in the game is fun because you can disarm your enemies which is alot of fun to do. There is a slow-mo part of the characters abilities were she can slow time down to be able to see movements of the enemies to be able to disarm them.  The story was alot of fun to follow and the cut scenes looked like you were watching a good looking cartoon. This game is a thinking game and you have a couple of routes you can go to overcome  particular parts of the game. When you fall off of a building you really do have that sensation that you are falling so it is pretty nerve racking to fall. If you time the jump wrong and barley miss the ledge to grab onto it then its a scary feeling. I really appreciated the &quot;Hint&quot; button that they incorporated into the game, it really helps you to stay on track and not get lost. The guns in the game are intense and fun to shoot after you steal them from an enemy. This game was a blast to play, just make sure when you play it that you aren&apos;t afraid of heights because you will get the vertigo feeling. This is a great game, well worth the money. If you love living on the edge this is the game for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1383611">Expand</a></span>

I recently received it as a birthday present and was surprised by an actual innovative and unique game experience, something I would have thought EA and DICE incapable of. The game is exceedingly stylish and flows well, though I can see why some complained of disorientation and even nausea- it might well have been better off as a third-person game. I love the animated cutscenes and the use of stark color contrasts, and Faith herself I think is one of the more competent female protagonists I&apos;ve seen- the game does not draw attention to her being female. She simply is. The game strikes a precise balance of style and believabillity. While I will be the last guy to emphasize the importance of realism in a &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; videogame, Mirror&apos;s Edge does feel &quot;possible&quot;, given how awesome parkour actually is, which I think enhances the experience at some level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=6508002">Expand</a></span>

And also a little frustrating, because it is not always instantly obvious where you have to go, especially when the game mechanic hinders your way and you think &quot;OK, this must be wrong way&quot; but actually it was the right choice. Happened a few times. Also the fact that you better should (or actually have to) run from everyone, instead of taking down at least one or two police men to get you some space, was quite disturbing. But in the end the most boring part was the repetitiveness of the levels. Running mostly on top of roofs, every level looks actually the same and the game does not much to alternate your experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=2537586">Expand</a></span>

And the feeling. God, it feels so smooth and free. Well, until you fall off because Faith resisted to jump. Or because you thought that you may go this way but NO, you cannot. You die Thats probably the worst aspect of the game: its omnipresent linearity.. I mean, you see a roof which doesn&#xC2;&#xB4;t lead you anywhere, but its near so why don&#xC2;&#xB4;t explore it? Well, because, even if the hight isn&#xC2;&#xB4;t to high, you die. Not cool. Also, there is ONE way to the exit. One. No side ways.  Thats not that bad, because the ways are obvious enough, most of the times. Hints are ok, even if not useful at every time. I mean, what does it help me to know where the exit is, if i don&#xC2;&#xB4;t know how to reach it? Ok, but enough nagging. Because mostly, this game is butter. I mentioned the controls already, sometimes you just fall of because you apparently didn&#xC2;&#xB4;t hit the button hard enough. But lets forget about that for a moment. Because most of the time, you just slide trough the beautiful clean world. The story is helping I think, because its no big mind bordering stuff. Honestly, you can forget about that completely. All you have to do is running and jumping. And man, thats just smooth. You navigate Faith from cut-scene to cut-scene. Doesn&#xC2;&#xB4;t sound challenging? Well, perhaps it isn&#xC2;&#xB4;t. And jumping and running are not that great variety of actions. But the good looking surroundings with different aims (more jumping or running) makes up for that. At the end all I can say is: It isn&#xC2;&#xB4;t the best game I&#xC2;&#xB4;e ever played. But it was definitely worth the feeling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=2328211">Expand</a></span>

EA and DICE should at least be praised for trying something new in an industry that is stagnating due to chronic risk-aversion, but these new ideas really should at least be vetted before they get into development. As a result, we have a game which is flawed on a very fundamental level.<br><br>The gameplay is where Mirror&apos;s Edge falls apart, and on quite a spectacular level to boot. The game entirely relies upon &quot;leap of faith&quot; gameplay, and you know what that means. Your character will die many, many painful deaths. While chase sequences with armed security guards do add a sense of urgency and tension, these chases fall apart on two levels. Firstly, the guards couldn&apos;t hit the side of a barn with a shotgun - which is necessary, as otherwise the chases would end before they start with you lying in a pool of your own blood. Secondly, there are many sequences where you have no choice but to engage guards in hand-to-hand combat, which brings me to the second major gameplay failing of Mirror&apos;s Edge. Granted, melee combat is a tricky thing to implement in a first-person perspective game, but I honestly cannot recall a sloppier implementation in recent memory. You may very well find yourself passing some of these combat sequences out of sheer luck rather than through any skill on your part.<br><br>As for the visuals, well, they certainly are unique, but in a bad way. I can&apos;t remember the last time I found myself squinting at my monitor. Some sections were quite literally painful for me to look at. My impression of the overall aesthetic design was that it was sterile, verging on the utterly lifeless. To me it feels like a horrible fusion of &quot;real-world&quot; and cel-shading which just doesn&apos;t work.<br><br>In conclusion, the only good thing to have come out of Mirror&apos;s Edge is a lawsuit which may very well end nearly two decades of persistent copyright trolling by Tim Langdell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1640789">Expand</a></span>
