Or Oblivion. Or pretty much any RPG that has been released (for PC or consoles) in the last 8-or-so years. I lost interest in gaming a long while back, after a marriage, kids and work took up all of my time. I bought a new computer last week, and figured I&apos;d take a look on Metacritic and see which RPGs were well-received -- I used to love the genre, and have played many of the classics (Wizardry series up to 7, Ultima Underworld, Betrayal at Krondor, etc.) and figured that I&apos;d pick up a title to play for an hour or two in the evenings before bed. After considering a few, I decided on Risen and purchased it from an online retailer. I had no idea what I was in for! I have scarcely done anything but sit in my computer chair, jaw gaping for the last 4 days. This game is just incredible... the world is so fully realized it&apos;s almost shocking. People go about their daily lives, the days and nights cycle and weather changes, the world has very lived-in feel and a real sense of history. It is so easy to get lost in it, especially due to all of the distractions that the game offers you: collecting animal trophies, crafting swords and jewelery, mining... the list goes on and on. Should you decide to focus on the main quest line, the plot is gripping and voice acting accomplished. The game has a sense of moral ambiguity throughout that&apos;s very mature and thoughtful. There is no right and wrong side -- you are left only with your own morals and instincts to decide your friends and foes. Also, characters are multi-dimensional and not always as they appear... you will often serve as a tool for someone else&apos;s ulterior motives unless you&apos;re wise enough to catch on and refuse. I am, perhaps, not the best judge of graphics since I&apos;ve been out of the loop for a while, but i&apos;d argue that Risen is indisputably gorgeous. Beams of rust-orange light poke through the swaying trees at sunset, water flows convincingly around rocks and down falls, nights are inky blackness, broken only by your torch, which casts realistic shadows from everything around you. Just wow. Don&apos;t let yourself miss this game, it is really truly a classic and has single-handedly rejuvenated my interest in video games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=738128">Expand</a></span>

I just can&apos;t stand the combat, which is very frustrating. Your opponent gets guaranteed hits, but the reflex-based combat system implies that your mouse clicking skills will suffice. So the combat tries to be action-rpg because your coordination with the mouse is important and not so much your player&apos;s stats (as opposed to DA:O where &apos;stats&apos; are everything). Even the simplest creatures seem to have more HP than you do and will take many hits to kill. Also the world is chock full of hostiles at every turn, just amplifying how frustrating the game can get when each fight seems rigged to be unfair. When you engage a hostile, you can&apos;t defend and attack (mele) at the same time, so you MUST release the shield and strike. And in this 1/20th of a second window where you release your shield and click to attack, your opponent gets a random chance at a guaranteed hit and you are forced to quaff a heal pot (which are hard to find early on). You can NOT hold the shield up and hit with the weapon at the same time. Other people who seem to have not noticed that the combat is unfair say it&apos;s fine, but they just haven&apos;t noticed the game is cheating in combat. Also the game forces you to do menial tasks to progress in the game like farm a farmer&apos;s field. Things like this serve the story, but absolutely are not fun to do. So from that perspective story is primary in this game, and RPG elements secondary. It&apos;s an adventure game with RPG elements, but as far as game progression, you must do many of the quests. What I like about the game is that the world is indeed as PB says, detail rich. The world is immersive. Everything is skillfully made. Time of day is very well done. I wish I could stand this game more so that I could see more of what it has to offer, because the scenery is very nice. I&apos;ve also heard there are some big dungeons to explore and I&apos;d love to see those. Oh well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=740141">Expand</a></span>

For people tried of the &apos;Diablo&apos; style of action-rpg that dominates the shelves, Risen will be a wonderful breath of fresh air. This isn&apos;t a game where every five minutes you&apos;ll be levelling up, nor will you be constantly finding brand new weapons and armor to swap out. Until you start to get some better equipment and training, each battle will be dangerous and rewarding. After Gothic 3 I was skeptical of buying Risen, I cannot believe I almost passed up what has rapidly become one of the most compelling RPG&apos;s I&apos;ve played since Mass Effect. As far as decisions make in the game, I love how the idea of good and bad isn&apos;t so distinct, rather it focuses on what side you&apos;ll take and what lines you&apos;ll tread there. Sure you apprehend the thief, but do you choose to let him go or turn him in? And if you do, which side are your ambitions aligned towards? Graphically speaking I find the game absolutely beautiful. I love how dark is dark in this game, carrying a torch through the jungle in a rainstorm as the shadows of trees and bushes dance around is a compelling visual experience. The acoustic ambiance is nothing shy of excellent either, this game is a visual and aural feast. Combat, one of the things widely criticized is in my opinion pretty good. With the sole exception of a minor targetting problem, I&apos;ve never felt like the system was unintuitive, boring or difficult. Combat IS difficult, but not because of the system in place. Rather use of tactics and timing are paramount and can lead to some pretty satisfying kills. At one point I had performed an overhead strike only to kill three gnomes with the same hit, which is not common mind you, but shows how the system is versitile. Also, unlike other casual RPG&apos;s, there are no -easy- enemies in this game. Until you get some good armor, training and weapons, even the earliest enemies will still be dangerous, you just get better at killing them. Most importantly I&apos;ve had no technical issues and it runs fine on my Sony Vaio FW485J/B at max graphical settings. I&apos;m running the steam version of the game. Now, the game does have a few hiccups in dealing with falling, drowning, and the occassional targetting mishap in combat. But none which get in the way to make the game unplayable or less enjoyable. All in all, I love this game. LOVE IT. Anyone rating it poorly most likely simply do not like the design or difficulty of it. Any true hardcore or old school RPGers will feel completely at home here, and like me, have been waiting for this game for a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=85683">Expand</a></span>

Any game where spamming the left click button almost guarantees you defeat in battle is a welcome change. A serious or even semi-serious RPGer should find this game well worth their time and money. I had a few very minor grahical glitches (steam version) and the end could perhaps have been better, but this game is full of entertainment and I highly recommend it, especially if the you are disillusioned with the direction of other so-called RPGs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=1530863">Expand</a></span>

It features a beautiful, detailed and living world (except on the 360) and the best combat system ever made for a role-playing game. One that actually requires skill and where every fight is a challenge. The game&apos;s main flaw is its chapters. While the 1st and 3rd chapter are insanely well made and I literally finished them without exiting the game, I was disappointed that the 2nd and 4th chapter could not quite keep up with the other two. The game is probably the best RPG to come out since Gothic 2 and KotoR and definitely worth getting. And with an add-on to make up for the weaker chapters and a few flaws (which are so small I cannot recall them atm) may even be the best RPG ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=740503">Expand</a></span>

That said, I really enjoyed the overall design of the Island and really the most entertaining part of this game is just wandering around getting in trouble and accidentally coming across awesome treasure. I didn&apos;t think the story was all that great but I honestly didn&apos;t care. The game&apos;s characters are all somehow memorable and you&apos;ll be surprised how often you hear an NPC referenced and you know exactly where that person is on the island. I was planning on getting this to tide me over until Dragon Age releases in a few weeks but I got so addicted that I finished this damn game already!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=86147">Expand</a></span>

The upside of that is of course the good old Gothic feel. This game is difficult. The enemies are really dangerous, and your skill and your character&apos;s, will determine the outcome of combat. For some, this will be a let down, but for the rest of us, it heightens the feeling of accomplishment. As with any quest-based RPG, there are some glitches with the quests, but all-in-all I feel that it works out very nicely. A negative point is the horribly stereotype view of women, but to be perfectly fair, most role playing games on PC tend to be massively sexist.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=740961">Expand</a></span>

There are a few minor technical issues and I&apos;ve experienced a couple of annoying CTD&apos;s but this hasn&apos;t affected my enjoyment of the game too badly, I also feel that performance could be a little bit better. The graphics and world design are superb, despite the reletively small size of the island and limited number of major settlements there is still a great deal to discover in this game. The AI is of a reasonable standard and I find combat quite enjoyable, one thing that is a little annoying is the fact that NPC&apos;s etc. aren&apos;t drawn until reletively close to the player character and the fade in is quite noticeable. Voice acting on the whole is pretty reasonable and the story itself is quite interesting . There&apos;s a wide range of different quests and a good amount of different skills that your character can learn ranging from cooking to smithing weapons. Overall I&apos;m really impressed with this game even though it has a few irritating technical issues, one of the better games to appear on the PC this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=738668">Expand</a></span>

This is hands down the best combat system ever in any RPG anywhere; it is extraordinarily challenging without being gimmicky.  No matter how strong you are, if you get lazy, a pack of wolves will eat you b/c they will use good AI and surround you so that one distracts you while another eats you.  Progress is slow but steady and you can design the character you want.  With perseverance, luck and skill, you *might* beat something relatively much stronger than you and then reap your xp and treasure rewards out of proportion to your level which is my favorite thing about well designed RPGs as they reward courage and creativity.  But mostly likely you will be reloading a lot! (as you should).  And don&apos;t even think about the toughest creatures until you are truly advanced.<br><br>The graphics while a bit dated but beautiful render cilnky skeletons and icky giant moths; even the wolves have menacing yellow eyes and sping tingling growls.  And the real star is the gorgeous FarCry-esque seascapes, with hidden paths and easter eggs everywhere.  Even after 25 hours I still was surprised to suddenly realize an area I knew really well, actually bent back across the mountain to something else I knew... speaking of which, the map design is brilliant.  There are shortcuts all over but you won&apos;t be able to use them until you are powerful enough to be where you should be because the monsters guarding them are either very tough or numerous - so it&apos;s not gimmicky at all, just well thought out and immersive.  Honestly, I should rate this game a 9 b/c the combat was a bit tricky in the beginning and the quest system definitely needs a lot more help in figuring out, both of which sent me to the walkthroughs more than once.  But if you don&apos;t mind doing that once in a while this game is a 10.  Otherwise, it&apos;s still a 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=1383513">Expand</a></span>

Love the AI of the NPCs (.e.g f you stand somewhere high and be a douchebag like me taking crossbow shots at random people, they don&apos;t just come up to the building butting their heads on the wall, but actually climb up to come and get you lol). I think a good combination of a bit of hack and slash with solid rpg. BIG THUMBS UP!</span>

I used to try playing gothic 1and 2 but never get into them, because of their weird interface and controls. but I actually liked Risen. the interface is intuitive and easy to handle. the controls are better than gothic games. you just use left mouse button to attack, right button to block and space to jump which makes it quite easy to get into battle and of course this game is hard, so at lower level, you&apos;d better not get involved with some high level monsters or persons. In this game you have to learn skills from certain NPCs and they will charge you gold for that which is quite realistic. I suggest start with talking to various NPCs and get some easy fetch quests first. The exploration in this game is fun and level design is well-done though the characters&apos; animations are very awkward. story wise it&apos;s not impressive however this game has several factions, when you joined one, the quests from other factions will be locked so there are some replay values here. overall if you want to find some realistic open-world RPGs, Risen is a good start but just keep in mind the world in Risen is dangerous even at the beginning if you used to a easy run like in oblivion you will be pissed :).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=1795060">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll have alot of trouble if you just button mash. The drawback of the game is that I had some very irritating bugs when I played - missing quest triggers, etc. On the whole a very fun game for RPG fans.</span>

Very rough around the edges upon closer inspection but not in a game-breaking manner.  Ultimately what this game lacked entirely was character.  No goofy cast of recurring characters like in the Gothic series.  Just a series of faceless plot devices.  An amusing game that is great need of some good storytelling, humor, drama, tragedy, something.  Nevertheless, Risen is a rich game that is fun to play from beginning to end which is more than I can say for most games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765316">Expand</a></span>

<br>its the only game that i feel im really living in that world. i played 30 hours without sleep the first time i played. Try it for yourself, its really better than any other rpg if you have patience.

<br>i played both the PC and xbox 360 version. the xbox 360 version is not beautiful VS PC, but its still the same game.

<br>
<br>What&apos;s Not :
<br>-The combat system. I was really sick of the combat mechanics and the ability of your hero to get stun locked by the 33rd hour of my playtime. Mages might be different, melee and ranged suck.
<br>-Lacklustre story. Its literally one giant fetch quests which can be broken down into smaller fetch quests. You&apos;ll always have to find 5 samples of item A or 6 samples of item B in order to progress the story.
<br>-The Quest system is kinda broken.
<br>
<br>Bottom Line  Buy this game IN A SALE if you love rpgs. I suppose people who love the gothic series would buy this game at any price.

The gameplay is quite good. Combat requires you to dodge, parry , and you cant just keep clicking the mouse and expect to win. Which is a good thing. However controls could be bit more accurate and fluid, but they arent bad, nor are the controls a major issue. Skill system COULD use few more skills, like a shield skill for an example, and the skill system doesnt have anything revolutionary in it, but it is sufficient and pretty solid. Improving skills requires you to get training and PAY for it. It fits the overall game quite well, even though it might seem unforgiving to people accustomed to easier games, its not a bad thing. Atleast the game doesnt pamper you too much. Writing is sufficiently coherent and well written, but it isnt amazing nor will it win any prizes for it. Also the voice overs could be better, at times they dont sound all that good , but otherwise sounds are again, good. UI is well done, and there is really nothing to complain here. Overall, its a good action RPG, but it isnt great nor a isntant classic. It manages to be actually challenging and entertaining, and is worth buying if you like WRPGs. It reminds me of better days , days where games werent pleasant strolls with no challenge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=85358">Expand</a></span>

I loved Gothic 1 and 2 (BOTH of which are much better games than Oblivion - Oblivion just looked prettier) but Gothic 3 was completely broken. Risen is what Gothic 3 should have been. The engine is unbelievably smooth, even on my 2 year old rig with all the settings on high - no pauses before combat, and no loading or unloading when entering / leaving dungeons. The world looks great. There&apos;s lots to do and collect. Everything just works simply - see something highlighted? Left click to pick it up. Middle click to toggle combat. Right click to block. It just seems to do everything right. Looking forward to playing this for a LONG time because, unlike Oblivion, everything in a piranha bytes game is hand designed, no computer generated lego-block dungeons here - therefore, you never know what you will find, or where a dungeon will take you. On a technical note, even the shaders are spot on this time... none of the weird artifacts they had in G3, everything looks wonderful and performs flawlessly, no crashes or freezes or even slowdowns... THANK YOU piranha bytes!! Glad to have you back !!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=85418">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Five minutes ago I completed this game, of almost 5 days of intense playing, I just could not stop! All the way through the game I was amazed by the freedom, the many path and of course the story. I liked the gameplay itself so much, that I want a Risen 2! - NOW! Seriously, try out this game, even if you don&apos;t play RPG, it&apos;s definitely worth it. I give it a BIG 9 of 10.</span>

Only thing wrong I found is the combat controls for optimum combat are set too fast for me (but I&apos;m useless at beat-em ups etc). Didn&apos;t really matter though since you can still have very fun and tactical combat without them (it&apos;s not that big a deal).

The graphics are pretty good (for the year it was made anyway), music and sound are well-done, and the voice acting is good too. It&apos;s a shame then that the combat is so insanely, brutally punishing as to prevent you from enjoying it. The combat may get better as the game goes on, but the 5 or so hours of this game that I could stomach saw the combat devolving into nothing more than holding down block until the enemy attacks twice, then attacking 2-3 times rapidly before blocking again. It was idiotic. Couple that with how it is entirely impossible to kite one enemy away from a large group, causing you to get swarmed by 5 enemies at once, and you had better get familiar with the load game screen. This is not fun. Everything seemed so interesting that it was really a shame it was kept out of reach. It&apos;s like when you were a child, and older kids would hold things in the air out of your reach and taunt you. Eventually you learn to punch them in the stomach, and go do something else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=2811749">Expand</a></span>

After the undercooked Gothic 3 failed to impress, Piranha Bytes left the series, went back to the drawing board and came up with a next gen spiritual successor to Gothic 2 called Risen. It&apos;s just as hardcore and unforgiving as the Gothic titles, but also keeps the same immaculate attention to detail, deep leveling system and immersive game world. The combat system is a significant improvement over the mindless click-fest that was Gothic 3, and much more streamlined than the clunky system from 1+2, without sacrificing the complexity. The wide-open gameworld, the most dearly loved feature of the franchise, is back with a vengance. You can roam freely throughout the massive island without a single loading screen, indoor and out. Almost every quest has multiple ways to complete it, based on your moral compass or your character&apos;s skills. Every NPC is killable, and even four beginning-to-end playthroughs could not possibly be enough to see the many paths that are open to you throughout the game. As for the graphics, the environments are lush and gorgeous, but the character models are simply passable. I hardly noticed, however, since everything else about the game engine is top-notch and the world is filled with believable, organic exteriors and interiors. To sum it up, Risen is a godsend; a hardcore western RPG bursting with content. This may not be for everyone, but it&apos;s hands-down the best game I&apos;ve played in years. If you love RPG&apos;s and are sick of the hand-holding, spoon-feeding games crowding the market lately, don&apos;t let this one fly under your radar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=85541">Expand</a></span>

I prefer this type of game on the PC, I&apos;m not a console gamer anymore, but I couldn&apos;t imagine it being any worse than morrowind or oblivion console versions. This game, spawned of the Gothic series, is tough to start if you don&apos;t know how the series rolls. Gothic III and Risen, while they have their moments, seem to be lacking a little of the humorous edge Gothic II had. Also, I thought Gothic II had a much more compelling social environment aside from the humor factor. Don&apos;t get me wrong, though. The humor and compelling environment are still prevailent, it&apos;s just not delivered as well in my opinion. Risen is still a triple A title!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=85662">Expand</a></span>

Those who criticise the combat or leveling system have almost certainly not invested enough time in the game. This is game design by the old rules, back when you were rewarded for your time and commitment with depth and complexity. Piranha Bytes&apos; are basically the Anti-Bethesda, whose games consistently present you with skin-deep gimmickery and utterly fail to deliver on their apparent ambition. This is a combat system that you have to learn as much as your character does, and a leveling system that rewards you with a genuine feeling of progression rather than just a page full of big numbers and an increased dice roll. All skills are useful and compelling, crafting and pickpocketing are just as meaningful as combat and magic. Lastly, it is one of the most consistently diverse and designed games I have played. The technology may not be the most cutting edge, but the attention to detail in all aspects of the game&apos;s design manage never to break the atmosphere. Even the english translation and voice work have come on leaps and bounds from their earlier work, and borders on genuinely compelling more often than not :-) If I had to describe this game in a single word, it would be &quot;Solid&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=85826">Expand</a></span>

Of course it has some drawbacks, but you don`t notice them while playing. It is the third RPG me played after Deus Ex and Kotor 1-2, so Risen can compete with them.</span>

Alchemy is nice - picking all those plants, looking for special ones in hidden places. This isn&apos;t something optional if you want to make your character considerably tougher. RP setting is great - I liked Don&apos;s Camp a lot, with the bad, tough guys. How they try to frame inquisition as the *real* bad ones, and how it turns out, when you meet them, to be quite nice guys. Sights are great - ocean, forests, sky - are very beautiful. Music is very, very nice. Miscellaneous: Climbing rocks and trying to get to previously unreachable places using Acrobatics skill is cool; girls are pretty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=738164">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are a bit more &quot;European&quot; which mean they are more real and gritty than cartoony and colorful like Oblivion. Overall, this game is excellent - especially in that the main quest portrays a power struggle and you cannot remain neutral ... I have played pretty much every RPG that comes out and would put this as well worth the buy. Is it one I will return to again and again? No. I may play through twice and then it will be over - but it is an enjoyable RPG and I am glad I bought it. If you like RPGs, and if you enjoy the Gothic series, this is by far the most accessible one yet and is a lot of fun to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=85729">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However I was hit by two things that slowed the game down badly.
<br>
<br>Early on, my recommendation letter was not accompanied with directions where to take it. I wandered for at least eight hours, before I searched online and found where to go.
<br>
<br>Secondly my close combat was hindered by my inability to advance my sword fighting stats. I was regularly locked in battles with lizard warrior foes that took me hours and hours and hours to defeat. Shame. [Plus the disgusting noise the lizards make  urghh. It&apos;s like the sound of regurgitation and snarling mixed.]
<br>
<br>Another of my grumbles, is that at least quarter of Risen, is spent in the dark. Medieval torches did little to help, and you have to drop them to battle, as your&apos;re using two hands.
<br>
<br>Many seem to complain that Risen is slow, and I found it exceptionally difficult in places. However if you&apos;re patient, and don&apos;t get hit by bugs you have masses of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=3374893">Expand</a></span>

<br>By the way, I like Risen. It&apos;s a nice game with gloomy atmosphere, very cool fight system and German humour. I think, fight system in Risen is best among Piranha Bytes&apos; games. So, there are many interest quests in first half of game. But after completing first chapters storyline is becomes very boring and annoying. Problems with story are the main disadvantage of Risen.
<br>Anyway, I like Risen for its atmosphere. Dark colours in swamps or bright sun lights in mountains in combination with beautiful music from Kai Rosenkranz create an unforgettable experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=2865447">Expand</a></span>

So I was looking forward Risen, hoping they would correct previous mistakes. And at the beginning I really enjoyed it - good optymalisation, nice graphics models, interesting plot. But it soon turned out that gameplay is dull, side quests almost don&apos;t exist, the map is huge however, there&apos;s nothing interesting to see except hordes of boring mobs. Main quests were all about annihilating more and more mobs to get milion pieces of very powerful artifact, and later another and another. But during my whole &apos;adventure&apos; with Risen it didn&apos;t really bother me, because I was waiting for some development of plot when suddenly...the game ended. I was laughing whole day because I think it took me the same time I would need to get to the 3rd chapter of G2 for example. For me - better than G3, but still average.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=742941">Expand</a></span>

Or games that were around as hardcore as those games, because there is no quest marker like in oblivion or some other **** rpg. Here you have to figure out yourself and thats what makes this experience so satisfying. The combat is great, it actually takes skill. It may be difficult at first but once you get used to it it starts to get fun. I love how people go about their daily life doing what they need to ITS GREAT. Dont miss this game, if you do its a grea tloss on your side of you&apos;re a big fan of RPG&apos;s.

JUST THINK ABOUT SOMETHING NEW, PB! I played this game, almost the same, in 2001 when Gothic 1 had had realesed, and again when G2 and Night of the Raven came out, and once more in 2006. Just cut this out. But I leave that graphic and gameplay issues... Don&apos;t care, after all i wanted a great story in this game, which will memorize me great moments from G1 and NotR. But no. The beginning is SO, so BAD, with sucky &quot;training missions&quot;, when i felt like an idiot, when the game had showed me how to jump or pick up an object. Later is a little better, i had been played almost 10 hours with joy, a great moment when I&apos;ve entered with Mendoza into volcano, lizardmen showed up and... OH NOEAS, betrayer Mendoza! Fire Titan! GO, you nameless fella, with tragic voice actor! BECOMA LORD OF THE TITANS and gather 5 pieces of my SUPERDUPER ARMOR and beat the bastard! No, that&apos;s not a good and epic story. Sorry PB, you made 3 almost same games with much better stories.

<br>Some people might not like that character advancement is at the whim of story-unlocked trainers (e.g. to even start learning magic skills, it can take up to 10 hours to get to the trainers and pass their initiation trials), but I see this as a bonus. It adds to the immersion quite a bit (access to magic is strictly controlled by The Order), and unlike Morrowind/Oblivion, it&apos;s a lot harder to build an overpowered min/maxed character.
<br>

It has the most attention to detail I&apos;ve ever seen in an open-world RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=3434774">Expand</a></span>

It has decent graphics, quite innovative attempt as for fighting and pretty looking open world which is neither too huge nor too small. We start off on the beach, after surviving a shipwreck, in an unknown island. Then we learn about the island and it&apos;s problems, and we get pulled into the story... Which is, I must say, so-so. There are too many similarities to Gothic series in the story, so it was a little bother to me. For someone who didn&apos;t play Gothic, it shouldn&apos;t really be a problem. As I said, the story is linear but we get the possibility to join one of two factions. We don&apos;t create our character, and neither we choose it&apos;s class. But it&apos;s up to us how do we want to develop skill-wise. With each level we earn skill points which we are able to exchange for strength, dexterity or other useful skills like brewing potions or smithing. Overall, it&apos;s really a game one can enjoy. Mostly for the gameplay. Side quests aren&apos;t really anything special, and main story line isn&apos;t all that fun, but it could be worse. I really think the gameplay makes up for it. As I said, fighting is really fun. It&apos;s partially about tactics, but mostly about our reflex, dodging and attacking at the right time... The more we boost up one fighting style the more various things we are able to do, like parrying an attack, then doing a counter attack.. or combos. We can play as a mage too, obviously. Overall, I think it&apos;s really a good solid RPG. It&apos;s all that Gothic 3 should be but wasn&apos;t. The game seemed a bit short in my opinion though. Doing everything what was possible, including killing almost every single evil creature on the island, it took me 25 hours to finish the game. Oh, and I won&apos;t spoil but the last boss fight should have been better. As for difficulty, I think it&apos;s just right. It may seem a bit difficult for some people, but mostly because most of the new games are terribly easy. Pros: -Innovative fighting. -Nice open world. -Decent graphics. Cons: -Story could be better. -Too many things seemed like in Gothic series... I could give many examples but I&apos;ll just throw one. A port city to which ships aren&apos;t able to come right now. This alone made me think &quot;Again?&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=2306600">Expand</a></span>

The world was full of atmosphere -- environments were detailed and varied. I think the developers were lacking in character design, as they reused models for NPCs and even then the models weren&apos;t the best, but that just points more focus towards an enchanting environment. The player character&apos;s smart-a** attitude made me happy, and I&apos;m glad they gave him voice-over (unlike, say, in DA:O). Bottom line: despite imperfections that prevent me from calling it &quot;great,&quot; Risen was fun to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=2356260">Expand</a></span>

No AA,low res textures everywhere.And it&apos;s not just the textures,character models are unappealing and have very little variety.Combat system sucks,there&apos;s not a lot of startegy into it.Enemies are way to OP.Normally a little more challange is OK,but with this piece of sh*t combat system it&apos;s just plain frustrating.The story sounded promising,but I couldn&apos;t bare with this game long enough to get into it,because of the dialog.My god,the dialog is so boring.The voice actors sound like they&apos;re going to fall asleep.The quest log is the most useless pice of sh*t I have ever seen. Classic WoW had a more useful quest helper than this,at least there you could find the approximate position of the quest target by reading the actual log.Here it just shows a simple objective and highlights the f*cking quest giver.Not the objective,the quest giver.I get where they were going with this,trying to make a more hardcore RPG,but it just doesn&apos;t work.It&apos;s tedious and unsatisfying.Maybe this isn&apos;t such a fair judgement,because  I only endured 2 hours of this game.Perhaps it picks up afterwards,but I can&apos;t see how with the horrible combat system and visuals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=3476177">Expand</a></span>

Little to no tutorial in the beginning, no explanation of game mechanics, and most importantly when you die you just&#x2026; lay there? It doesn&apos;t drop you back to your last save, it gives you no on-screen prompts, it simply leaves you there wondering what to do next (this is the FIRST time I have ever played a game that, upon death, you are not prompted with at least a direction to reload a past save, I actually had to tab out and search to make sure this wasn&apos;t a glitch).
<br>
<br>If this is all supposed to be to amplify the sense of immersion into the game world, it&#x2019;s not doing a very good job at all. If I were dead, I highly doubt I&#x2019;d just stay there hovering over my corpse panning around uselessly, so the more likely answer is that designers were more concerned with making bank than ensuring their finished product had the information necessary to play. Barely five minutes into the game and I&#x2019;m tempted to simply shrug it off and uninstall; why would I put my time and effort into something that clearly had no effort put into it where I am concerned? For the sake of not judging too quickly (though already, the first impression I&#x2019;ve had is that this game was a waste of my money), I will continue to try to play&#x2026; but I don&#x2019;t see myself writing a comprehensive review on this particular title.
<br>
<br>Edit:
<br>
<br>Ten minutes later, and I&#x2019;ve quit and uninstalled. I have never been more dissatisfied with a game, or more specifically with it&#x2019;s complete lack of consideration for introduction to gameplay. Players are expected to somehow know beforehand (or stop playing the game to go through the menu and search) key bindings and core mechanics beyond WASD. On-screen &#x2018;tutorials&#x2019; consist of a single, font-only floating text direction on what to do once something has already happened. There are no prompts to explain how to equip or ready your weapon unless you happen upon one specific area that triggers a particular &#x2018;cut-scene&#x2019; of dialogue from your companion (and even then, the mapped key was non-functional and I had to remap it to another key for it to function properly). This game is not just raw, it is unprofessional in that those who chose it&#x2019;s introductory mechanics must have believed what they were thinking was going to  by magic or osmosis  be what every single other person that chose to play their game would be thinking. Fighting mechanics, if you can call them that, are chunky and awkward, in where a player may be facing their enemy and swing their weapon, but the character will turn and swing in a different direction. On six separate occasions, versus three different mob types, this problem persisted until I finally decided it was practically insulting to myself and my computer to have this game taking up space on my hard-drive. I would give this game a 2/10, the 2 being only for the graphics, as this was the only portion of the game that seemed to get any attention. Would not recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=3348258">Expand</a></span>

Piranha Byte&apos;s brand of RPG will die like &apos;Might and Magic&apos; for its chronic inability to advance, improve or develop their creation.

Far too many lizard people in far to similar dungeons and a very low quest density make the end a lot less enjoyable than the rest of the game. It still gets an 8, a very low 8 at that, from me because I had a good deal of fun with it.</span>

The actual presentation could have been so much better the dialogue is in a boring font and the dialogue options are very plainly done. The world itself may be big but it is also dull, lifeless and just to damn plain . Many people complain about the combat being very hard, how is simply clicking for attacks and holding in for block difficult it&apos;s just about timing although it feels as though the enemies attack at random which might make it feel hard, there is not much technique involved and ends up being more shallow than Fable&apos;s combat. I don&apos;t know much about the story at all but the intro did nothing for me and basically just showed how the main character got stranded. I applaud this game for trying to be a hardcore RPG which it does some what succeed with but overall it falls flat and if you&apos;ve played oblivion or mass effect than this game will just be plain boring. 5/10.

This game is exactly like the Gothic games, except in slightly better graphics. Tedious menial tasks such as harvesting, collecting, and finding n number of some item are back again. No story hook whatsoever. It&apos;s just a random island your character finds himself in after being washed ashore. To add to this, the character&apos;s walking speed is very slow and the map isn&apos;t detailed enough and shows no landmarks, making exploration a real chore.
<br>
<br>There are a lot of items to find and the combat is semi-decent, but nothing in this game really stands out. Everything has been done before by other RPGs and done better.
<br>
<br>Some of the dialogue is not bad and can be kind of witty, but some of the voice acting isn&apos;t all that great, especially the main character, who hardly puts any emotion in anything he says, and this is coming from someone who is rarely ever picky about voice acting in games.
<br>
<br>Some NPC and enemy A.I. is a bit strange too. I got into the arrogant guard captain&apos;s house and stole stuff from his treasure chest right in front of him and he did not bust an eyelid. I then took a mug of beer from his table and he got all pissy at me all of a sudden. Another enemy was doing a decent job stopping a few feet away from me, letting me shoot them with a bow, then to chase me for a few steps, and to repeat the same procedure till he was dead.
<br>
<br>If you liked Gothic games, you&apos;ll probably like this one too, but it&apos;s way too slow paced for me personally. The most fun I got from this was when I decided to stop doing any quests and to simply mess around. Piranha Bytes just keep rehashing the same old boring formula in every single game, and until they make something new and different, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be buying any more of their games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=5176250">Expand</a></span>

Good RP factor, you can decide how or if you are going to complete quest, sometimes NPC joint to help you with your quest. Nice craftsman skills of creating weapons, jewellery, potions and scripts  cooking they are not so deep as in MMO games, but they are decent and make game more complex. The only problem is combat system enemies seams to be stronger than you and seams to be unfairly advanced in combat (quicker attack and block). Also I am not  big fan of combat systems that are not purely states based in RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/risen/user-reviews?user_review_id=2930478">Expand</a></span>
