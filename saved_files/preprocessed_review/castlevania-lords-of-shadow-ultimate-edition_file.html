<br>I&apos;ve bought this game on the Xbox360 and immediately thought the PC version was needed, the game has an amazing story backed up with a variety of game-play elements though the soundtrack gets a bit old and the fixed camera gets in the way...
<br>
<br>On PC; The good and the Bad.
<br>The Good
<br>Resolutions going as high as possible, in this case, 4k downscale; will explain...
<br>Optimization in this game is amazing, Vsync is vital since I got over 100 FPS average
<br>Graphically Amazing, with high resolution and Frame-rate this game pleases the eye quite a bit.
<br>Now, The BAD
<br>720p, No AA Cutscenes, Not all cutscenes are this bad, Like Batman Arkham Asylum, you&apos;ll be reminded how this game looked like on a console.
<br>Keyboard Controls are horrible, Luckily, If you are a Smart PC gamer, you&apos;ll have a controller for games like these
<br>Anti-Aliasing is FXAA only, I use 4k Downscale as a method of a better Anti-Aliasing since FXAA is Crap.
<br>No Metal Gear stuff, Useless, but I did like the headband, it was replaced with expanded vampire wargames...
<br>
<br>The Verdict: Still holds up, Mods will come to fix some issues, they are already trying to get better AA modes via Nvidia Inpector or Sweetfx</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3474468">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game controls well enough with the mouse and keyboard if you modify the default bindings. I use wasd plus mouse left (attack), mouse right (area attack), middle mouse (secondary weapon), 1 and 2 for triggering the magic, f and h for collecting the orbs, alt for dodge, space for jump.
<br>
<br>The game features plenty of content (about 20 hours) with an interesting story, diverse environments with rewards for exploration, challenging gameplay, platforming and puzzle sections and an experience system (unlock new skills).
<br>
<br>Note: The game features a fixed camera. This doesn&apos;t bother me buy it may be a problem for some.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3466754">Expand</a></span>

<br>Perhaps the best thing about the PC version is the game runs at 60fps as opposed to the 15fps (or that it seemed like) on the 360 version.

<br>I play this with a 360 gamepad hooked up to my PC (as I do with most of my PC games) so I hear mouse/keyboard support is pretty rough, but honestly, that&apos;s none of my concern.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3468287">Expand</a></span>

People complaining about bad graphics? PLEASE...this game has pretty good graphics with steady FPS...they must have a ancient computer. Now the flaws of this game ARE inherent in that the graphics do appear to be slightly worse in cut scenes but game play wise is pretty much the same as the console. The game does bear flaws that could&apos;ve been improved such as the silly energy absorbing should have been automatic and its true the controls could have been done better but they are workable. Overall this game is decent, the fixed camera is there for a reason but is also one of the inherent flaws of the game and can annoy your experience. I do like this game but it does not deserve a empty score or a perfect one. All things considered, it is a mediocre game with a frustrating camera, decent kb/m controls for a port, and slightly reduced graphics which are STILL pretty high end.

<br>In response to pcgamer 83&apos;s review: the graphics are completely fine. The textures are of a high resolution (far higher than they could be on a current-gen console).
<br>
<br>With regards to the controls: I use a gamepad (either an Xbox gamepad or one from logitech). If you are any sort of &quot;serious&quot; pc gamer, you&apos;ll have a spare gamepad (I know that it&apos;s a pain, but some games simply play a lot better). The controls are *excellent* with a gamepad. They are perfectly fine (but require some memorization), if you use a keyboard.
<br>
<br>Regarding the game being &quot;the worst port&quot; he&apos;s ever seen: Give me a break. The game hasn&apos;t crashed *once*, for me. It supports 3D vision (which shows dedication on the part of the developer). It runs at a *contstant* 60 fps (really 120 fps) on my machine--this shows optimization was a priority.
<br>
<br>It is *sometimes* annoying that the camera is fixed, but the positioning is thoughtful (and, frankly, this is an extremely minor issue for me).
<br>
<br>The game has deep gameplay, a thoughtful and mature storyline, good pacing, excellent visuals (they really are *exceptional* for a PC port, and they are *fantastic* if one considers that the game was originally released 3 years ago on consoles).
<br>
<br>To determine if you&apos;ll love the game (as I do): briefly view the game on youtube and play the demo. If you think you&apos;ll like it, you&apos;ll probably love it. I am new to the Castlevania series, I&apos;ll be considering the sequel, as a result of playing this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3465339">Expand</a></span>

However Castlevania is perfect game and PC port is really good. Graphic is amazing and fight system is much better then DMC or GoW fight systems. Best part of game is story.

<br>
<br>My only gripe about this game? I wish the deadzone between running and walking was greater. There are times I want to bathe in the atmosphere of this world by simply walking through it, but the original developers never added that to the mix. I hope to find a mod solution for this in the future because running through some of these environments is a crime.
<br>
<br>Keep releasing top quality ports like this one and I&apos;m sure to invest in Lords Of Shadow 2 on PC as my day 1 purchase choice.

<br>Truly looks more like a nextgen game on PC... flat out beautiful. Even the controls feel more fluid and responsive. Guess this game really shows PC is the way it&apos;s meant to be played all along.
<br>
<br>The game is just phenomenal, story, characters, gameplay action. Apparently Konami has never heard of DLC.... just the standalone game by itself is very lengthy, and just keeps getting better as it plays out. Likely the best Castlevania game in the series.
<br>
<br>Can&apos;t beat it for $30... especially when they pretty much gave $200 worth of game in this package.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3453748">Expand</a></span>

The game experience is disastrous from the beginning to the end. Fixed cam is not acceptable in a 2013 video game, especially on modern PCs which are way stronger than consoles. I really can&apos;t understand why they postponed the game to mid 2013, because it has no improvement over the original Castlevania apart from 1080p visuals, but they remain awful to see because characters are badly made, environments are pixelous and not well shaped, low res textures are a non-sense considering the time to port the game on PC! I don&apos;t realize why pc users have to be punished like this. I would declare worst pc game of the year so far.

<br>- It really could have better graphics, cause for PC standards are lame.
<br>
<br>In conclusion it&apos;s a must have, although it have a downside on graphic side, overall performance is good so don&apos;t cry over spilled milk and play it to the end.
<br>
<br>I really hope it doesn&apos;t get the same bad rep given to Lament of Innocence on PS2, if you want a good game with solid Combo system, don&apos;t miss it.
<br>
<br>If you just understand the game&apos;s mechanic, then you need a smash button game, try Dinasty Warrior.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3480775">Expand</a></span>

You can&apos;t simply add a free camera to a title which was originally designed on consoles. Porting a game doesn&apos;t mean writing the game from scratch just adjusting it for the target platform (adding better textures, small fixes etc.)
<br>
<br>As far as the game is concerned I have to say that in my opinion this is one of the best and most polished console ports I&apos;ve seen. The graphics are really well redone in order to provide better and sharper textures which will at some points leave room for doubts that this game is a console port. Cinematics are directly reused but that&apos;s a) understandable for a console port and b) really not a big problem since the 720p quality doesn&apos;t degrade too much on 1080p displays. Sound design and music are hard to explain in this game. You have to hear the sheer epicness of some of the themes to believe it.
<br>
<br>One thing that really shines with this title are the puzzles. They might not be everybody&apos;s favorite but solving them in my opinion provides a bit of diversity compared to simply bashing the enemies all over again. Also some of the boos fighting mechanics are very well done  the last boss was really well done. Game&apos;s lengths is also commendable   at least 20+ hours of playtime for an average player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3501620">Expand</a></span>

Absolutely not. So why am I giving this game a 9? Because it is absolutely fun to play. The soundtrack is one of the best ones you will hear for the video game industry, and it really immerses you into the story that unfolds before you eyes. Sir Patrick Stewart is your narrator as you guide your hero through many levels. The game is linear, but the areas look gorgeous on the master race pc.
<br>
<br>One thing I recommend to truly enjoy this game is to use a controller as the combos will probably give you arthritis by the end of this 20 hour journey. I loved it and can&apos;t wait for the 2nd one. Again, the soundtrack and environments are a must listen/see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3498387">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The biggest negatives I have is the uneven difficulty in sections. Some areas are a cake walk and you feel like a true hero and slayer of bad and evil things, yet other times its nearly impossible to proceed when its an easy section.  The second is the fixed camera angle.  While tolerable it can be irritating and it MUST be changed in LofS2.
<br>
<br>Regardless its a good game and I look forward to continuing with LofS2 when it comes out this winter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3522136">Expand</a></span>

If I were to rate it, it would get between 8.5 and 9 out of 10. I&apos;m making this review 10/10 because of the lack of justified reviews for 0 and idiots saying the game looks outdated/pixelated/whatever junk comes out their mouth. Is the game 100% unplayable? No. Minimum I&apos;d expect would be 5/10 because people&apos;s tastes of games vary. Anything lower is just garbage coming from another PC fanboy who doesn&apos;t know anything about computers, wishes he knows about computers, and blames consoles for everything negative in his substandard life.
<br>
<br>This is a port to PC but is it bad? No. The majority of these negative reviews don&apos;t even mention real issues. If the story ties well with the second game that is about to be released, then the cross reference could actually make this game extremely good. At the moment, it is at least a 7/10 for story for most players. Graphics.. if it&apos;s an issue, then I&apos;d say you need to get some therapy. As for gameplay, it balances out between action, puzzles and platforming so you don&apos;t get the feeling of repetitiveness and this is a major plus. Ability upgrades are more situational to how you play and if you don&apos;t replay the stages to farm up points, you&apos;ll need to spend them wisely. The combat is fairly simple and if you&apos;ve played God of War, you should feel comfortable to play on hard difficulty of your first run.
<br>
<br>A lot of the negative reviews (below 5) came from people who basically pirated the game or basement trolls. Anyone who has remotely played the game would agree that the art was well done and anyone who payed for it would have known that it was meant to be played on a gamepad and would be prepared for compromises when playing on a keyboard and mouse.
<br>
<br>All third person slasher games suffer from keyboard and mouse and it gets tedious because you can&apos;t move the character freely with kb/m but that also applies to every other game. The only advantages the kb/m have over a gamepad are more keys and precision for point and click games  MMORPG, RTS and shooting games. Gameplay that is focused on direction and positioning will always be better on the gamepad/joystick. Try playing the following game types on keyboard and mouse: aerial combat, car racing games, sports games, any hack&amp;slash games, 3D platformers  it will be at a massive disadvantage without the joystick.
<br>
<br>To the people complaining about low resolution textures and outdated graphics, I don&apos;t know if I should feel bad for you. You want good graphics? Go on hiking trip at some tropical island, realism right there in your face. Real water, real trees, real rocks, real sunlight affects, real sand, and real sounds of nature. After your trip, you&apos;ll see that games even at this stage are nowhere near realistic and stop making bs excuses comparing this game with other games. Tomb Raider, Crysis 3 and BF4 look nowhere near &quot;real&quot; and these are 2013 titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3898358">Expand</a></span>

I can absolutely understand that many people were very unhappy with the resurrection DLC because they had to pay extra bugs for something that is short and really difficult. But hey  as someone who started gaming in the 80s  I love this endboss! Adrenalin is still running through my veins and it really feels like meeting and old friend.
<br>The fight-system is really well done and the graphics, especially the bosses look really great. The only absolutely negative element that I have to mention is that your character is constantly blocked by invisible walls from the environment, but maybe they improve that part with LOS2?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3809620">Expand</a></span>

However, once I bought a gamepad, this game truly transformed... not having camera control became a plus as controlling camera seperately using gamepad is truly a chore and gamepad control is sooo incredibly smooth and responsive, its amazing. From then on, the music, atmosphere and how the protagonist transform over time into the epic character he is throughout the castlevania series dragged me deeper and deeper into the lore and story of the game. By the end of the game, I just wanted more... more of the story, the emotions, the excitement, the immersion... I wanted so much more of this that I pre-ordered the sequel. If you enjoy an epic, emotional story that leads to a story and lore of epic proportion (and you enjoyed other similar games such as Darksiders), this is a must buy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3988707">Expand</a></span>

<br>Some give 0 out of 10 just cause there&apos;s a crappy texture on a wooden log hidden somewhere in a corner of a map? I mean really, how much more ridiculous can you get? Don&apos;t know about the rest but i buy games to actually play them, not enjoy the environment... yes it is nice to have good graphics but complaining about some small details is just stupid. Mad about controlls? Buy a god damn xbox controller, i mean it IS originally a console game... i played many games on PC with xbox controller cause it is really better and more interesting that way.
<br>Oh well it&apos;s impossible to make everyone happy anyway...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3488464">Expand</a></span>

<br>It have a great gameplay and  story, different from the classic games but at the same time it feel like something new that really need the Castlevania series.</span>

<br>Or more small thing like balancing on a beam with top view, how the hell you should do it, how? I Feel like Dev&apos;s also  notice this  and just slap &quot;Hold a button to not fall&quot; on it.
<br>
<br>The whole fighting system is really boring, and you feel like it forced you to play in specific way, not giving you any freedom at all.(Compare to DMC3-4)
<br>
<br>However there was few good decisions like ability to skip or see solution for puzzles, or story readed by Sir Patrick Stewart.
<br>
<br>The overall game providing very frustrating experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3824910">Expand</a></span>

Graphics aren&apos;t the best, but the amount of detail put in the levels and level design really make up for this. The areas are just beautiful. Combat is very action-packed and I like it just fine. Unlockable skills make combat feel fresh every time. Perfect story, with some major plot twists that I really enjoyed. The storytelling is done just wonderfully. The game is very dark (as in dark-fantasy), which I just love.
<br>
<br>There isn&apos;t much I don&apos;t like about this game. I only have two gripes with this game: the controls and the camera. The VERY FIRST THING you MUST do when you launch the game is CHANGE THE KEY-BINDINGS. I can&apos;t stress this enough. This game is a console-port, but the controls aren&apos;t that bad once you change them to be more PC-friendly. After configuring the key-bindings, the controls aren&apos;t an issue (although some puzzles are a bit wacky; one even showed Xbox buttons instead of keyboard buttons!). Second, the camera. This is more of a personal preference, but I do not like the camera very much. It&apos;s fine most of the time, but I find it simply odd other times. Third-person, with the ability to look around, would have suited this game much better, but they would have to change the game quite a bit to make this work, so the camera is not much of an issue for me.
<br>
<br>I love this game, and I simply cannot wait for Lords of Shadow 2. I haven&apos;t played any previous Castlevania titles, but I think that&apos;s about to change after playing this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3630284">Expand</a></span>

Shoddy controls and unclear cues make moving around levels and fighting bosses frustrating. The game tries to have in depth combat but it boils down to, whip whip dodge.  Frustrating camera angles plague game play as well making boss fights a pain as well.

<br>It&apos;s fun to play, the combat can be challenging and rewarding and the controls are responsive and easy to learn (maybe one less key to absorb energy would have been nice) and work pretty well on a PC keyboard. The platforming is kinda boring and just a waste of time, there&apos;s no challenge in it, you basically just follow a rail The combat has lots of skills and combos, maybe too many, but you&apos;ll end up using always the same moves to be on the safe side; you&apos;ll almost never use 90% of the combos and skills, there&apos;s no incentive to do it and it&apos;s just an useless added danger.
<br>But the biggest, worst, most unforgivable flaw is the camera. It&apos;s bad. It&apos;s very bad. It keeps switching angle while you&apos;re moving, making you go back or toward places you didn&apos;t intend to go to. It keeps enemies out of the screen. A few times it kept the main character out of the screen... during a platform puzzle. It&apos;s a terrible, terrible camera and I&apos;m amazed at how it could pass the QA testing.
<br>
<br>All in all though, it&apos;s a pretty good and fun game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4282521">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics deserve special mention. I switched from the PS3 version to the PC because of the arresting visuals  a combination of extraordinary art design and beautiful rendering. Even when, true to the title, the game took its inevitable dark turn, the onscreen result somehow transcended the grim-dark scenery typical of dark fantasy.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t recommend it enough. It&apos;s the rare game I&apos;ve completed despite owning most big -A- games and I don&apos;t even playing anything in the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3625696">Expand</a></span>

Good for watching, maybe, but playing it is a chore.
<br>
<br>The combat is rather bad due a to a very shallow moveset which gives you ten weak attacks executed in various combos and only a couple strong ones which either require a combo before them or consume lots of magic and don&apos;t really make much of a difference. Add to that a fixed camera with no target lock and you&apos;re left tapping X again and again and AGAIN because landing something bigger isn&apos;t worth the effort and risk. Enemies also get a lot of unblockable attacks they promptly use outside of your camera view. Timed blocks and dodges, again, give you no significant advantage. Grabs, throws, disarms, using the environment? Nope, not in this game.
<br>
<br>The other big part of the game is puzzles. While they might be challenging occasionally there&apos;s always a scroll nearby that allows you to bypass them for the price of losing the experience reward. And half of those puzzles don&apos;t even make sense in context. They are puzzles for the sake of puzzles. You must make all the flippers in a pachinko-style automaton green BECAUSE REASONS!
<br>
<br>Also the game does a LOT of handholding. You have to come near EVERY extra-strong door and examine it so the game can condescendingly explain that the door is extra strong and you&apos;ll need some outside means of opening it. Only after that the outside means will be available to you. Any significant object or action will immediately get a camera focused on them for a good five seconds while the character is still being hit by the enemies off-screen. If you press a button while interacting with some mechanism you WILL watch the mechanism do whatever you requested until you are allowed to exit the interaction and be on your way.
<br>
<br>Every level also has a challenge. Only unlocked AFTER you beat it. You know, FOR REPLAYABILITY!
<br>
<br>Broken game flow, dull combat, bland level design with a fixed camera and no mobility (insurmountable waist-high fences everywhere) and irrelevant puzzles make this an exercise in frustration rather than an enjoyable game.
<br>
<br>Great graphics, though. Almost as god as in... Any other game with a budget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3904066">Expand</a></span>

<br>I don&apos;t know why so many are angry, that was a good port to PC.

<br>The graphics are ok, is not perfect but some times surprise. No problem with resolution or cut scenes, that is a huge lie! I&apos;m playing in full hd without problem.
<br>The story is amazing, i just cant wait for the LoS 2.
<br>
<br>And about the camera and &quot;invisible walls&quot; problem. Is the same at video games. What wrong with you guys? Is just the way that game was made. A game deserves 0 just because you don&apos;t like fixed camera? So poor Resident Evil 2, don&apos;t it?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3761314">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Lords of Shadow, whilst gorgeous, nicely voice acted, and fairly atmospheric (if you don&apos;t mind yourself some rather cheesy clich&#xE9;) misses out on most of what makes 2d castlevania so great.
<br>
<br>Rather than clever level design, the fixed ingame camera is method by which secrets are hidden, often they&apos;re deliberately placed in the far foreground of an area so they&apos;ll be in plain sight of the main character, but hidden to the player. It also means combat (which is already pretty repetitive and dull) can be made more difficult by the fact that some of the enemies will run offscreen into the foreground when they begin their attacks.
<br>
<br>Climbing segments are far too frequent, totally linear, and very obviously artificial, (there&apos;s always one perfect path composed of glowing ledges and whippable rings up any cliff, structure, or building that the game wants you to traverse) and length is padded to a tedious degree with constant sidequests and pointless distractions. &quot;Retrieve 3 keys from 3 guardians before you can progress&quot; &quot;A chupacabras has stolen all your spells and items, play hide and seek with it for 10 minutes before you can continue.&quot; &quot;Slowly wind this crank to open the exit to the room. Oh no! Enemies have spawned. Fight them off so you can wind the crank unaccosted.&quot; All of these events will happen 3-4 times, some of them (opening doors) maybe as much as a dozen occurrences.

<br>Usually Castlevania games are all about using your abilities to explore branching paths. Here though, whilst it looks like there are many paths to explore, it&apos;s just an illusion. What look to be interesting ledges, paths and side tracks are all just part of the scenery and can&apos;t be accessed, even when you have abilities that should allow it. (Invisible walls keep you hemmed in constantly, you couldn&apos;t even run off a cliff if you tried to for most of the game.) and the few areas you might discover early on are fenced off by arbitrary obstacles, not allowing you to pass until you&apos;ve beaten chapter X and unlocked the Y ability. In classic Castlevania those areas will lead to whole new sections, items, abilities, weapons and secrets, in Lords of Shadow, all it leads to are 1 of three pickups that will increase your life, light or dark magic by a miniscule amount.
<br>
<br>Big whoop.
<br>
<br>Buy it for some nice graphics and if it&apos;s super cheap. Don&apos;t expect it to make the transition from 2d to 3d like Metroid Prime managed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3528475">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s very poorly optimised for the PC and is practically not playable with mouse and keyboard. So steer clear if you don&apos;t own a gamepad. But even if you do: I really can&apos;t recommend it wholeheartedly.</span>

I have been playing the game for long to test its features but it has no involvement appeal, it is monotonous and repetitive, resulting bland and boring for most the time. From the technical side, it is outdated and it doesn&apos;t take advantage of the latest video graphics cards for pc, having some horrible textures, no existing bump mapping, ruined antialiasing and very uncomfortable keyboard commands. The game has no appeal and i see no reason to buy it for pc.

<br>I kept hearing how great the graphics were---and there are some beautiful views--but far more common are repetitive BROWN textures.  A lot of the backdrops merge into a BROWN soup, making it hard to see ledges and such. The combat is God of War minus the creativity, and double the repetitiveness.  There are weird combat difficulty spikes where I was hitting baddies for so long  I thought the game was bugged.  Nope, I just had to hit them even longer.
<br>
<br>The one bright spot is the Titan battles, which are Shadow of the Colossus &quot;climb and stab&quot; style take-downs of giant creatures.  Fun, but nothing new here.   I&apos;m still waiting for someone to do some real, current-gen innovation for this mechanic.
<br>Overall this game plays like it was made in the late 90&apos;s, and looks like it&apos;s from around 2003.  I do not get the high scores it&apos;s receiving.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3469452">Expand</a></span>

The fighting and platforming sections feel like they were transplanted directly from a console game 15 years ago  there&apos;s not a single thing creative or unique.  The camera is so bad that the monsters your hero is fighting are frequently off-screen with no way to turn and face them.  The enormous length of the game might be a wonderful bonus if the game were at all worth playing  instead, it feels like work to get from one level to the next.  Nearly every level has one or more hero upgrades that are inaccessible on the first play-through, which is a slap in the face to those of us who are unlikely to even slog through the game the first time.  Definitely rent this one for a console before spending more than the cost of a three-day  rental to own it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3462042">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The combat feels awkward, theres no need for gabriels fancy combos when you can do just fine with standard button mashing. There are too many so called &quot;riddles&quot; which you can solve easily, the game needs way more action. Whatever, my review will be voted down by some fanboys anyway.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>
<br>Bad:
<br>Bad animations
<br>Bad controls
<br>Bad story
<br>Bad Camera
<br>Outdated combat system
<br>Useless combos
<br>Useless magic abilities
<br>
<br>Good:
<br>Pretty pre-rendered backgrounds (lol)
<br>great bosses</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3472471">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>some users say insane things like with the settings at max it looks next gen  maybe if you suffering from schizophrenia or dementia but for every one else it looks like a game from 6 years ago  low rez textures things overall look to clean  now days things have dirt and imperfections so people know there are at least 1024 textures on them .
<br>
<br>controls are horrible and at this point you would be better off with any other 3d action game or 3rd person shooter  go play metal gear solid 5 or devil may cry or even the new tomb raider and forget about this sub par junk
<br>
<br>even if the pc got this 2 years ago it would have been a bad game and some would still cover for the developer even if they didnt pay for that version of the game  but no one reads all the reviews for anything so i doubt anything past the score i gave maters</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3461952">Expand</a></span>

I am a firm believer in that frustration makes games worthless and unplayable, when something that shouldn&apos;t be hard is hard there is a problem. I created a metacritic account just because I wanted to get the word out there about the horrible mechanics of this game. We all know about the atrocious fixed camera, but also there&apos;s an issue with the synchronization of combo moves and completing circle commands. It should not be so hard to push a button when the circles line up to do finishing moves or dodge something. after 20 minutes of the game I was so frustrated and I wanted to throw my Microsoft controller halfway across the room, which is something I haven&apos;t experienced in years. Please avoid this game if your looking for something more smooth and a better gameplay experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3464618">Expand</a></span>

<br>After 3 years from the original release, the graphx hold up quite well but some of the mechanics could be more user-friendly. This is one of my favourite games of this gen.</span>

Platforming was ok until last few chapters then I guess the developers decided to go full sado and torture us with some of the worst platforming levels ever and qte&apos;s are the worst. I actually had to put the gamepad down on the table and then keep hitting the button with a lot of force (almost broke my fingers). Very unresponsive. I almost gave up at certain parts but managed to finish it FINALLY. Tried playing the dlc but gave up when I reached the part with moving saws, I said to myself thats it I had enough of this BS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4194857">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Enviroment: The boards in this game are quite beautiful. You can tell the a lot of care has gone into the story and the environments in this game. Ranging from snow capped mountains and frozen lakes to swamp-filled forests and the famous breath-taking Dracula Castle.

Castlevania LOS is an action packed adventure with an extremely dark story, a richly detailed world, and a memorable cast of characters and enemies. This is the best thing to happen to the series since Super Castlevania IV.
<br>
<br>First I want to talk about the production value of the game. This isn&apos;t some last minute game designed to take peoples money because it bears the name of a well established, critically acclaimed series. This game features voice acting from some of Hollywood&apos;s best talent. Robert Carlyle, Natascha McElhone and Sir Patrick Stewart all lend their voice too help immerse you in the experience. The games soundtrack was composed using a 120 piece orchestra, which ended up winning numerous awards. The beautiful level design gives players the feeling they are traversing massive landscapes despite the game being very linear. Sometimes you will find yourself standing still and admiring the gorgeous attention to detail in every level.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is similar to other action adventure games of the same genre (Dante&apos;s Inferno, God of War and Devil May Cry). You will be traversing mountain cliffs, swinging from ancient castles, solving puzzles, collecting upgrades, and of course, slaying countless demons and vampires. The combos in this game are very simple and easy to learn. Some games tend to go overboard with complicated combos but not LOS. They keep the combos simple enough so you don&#x2019;t have to constantly pause the game and check the menu to remember what the combos are. The gameplay has just the right pacing too. Some games you will find yourself mindlessly slaying hordes of enemies to the point of boredom or exhaustion. The game developers know just when to give you those subtle breaks after short but intense fights.
<br>
<br>Like other action games of this type, it features RPG like mechanics. You gain XP from every kill, which you can spend on unlocking certain skills and combos. This simply sense of progression helps add some depth to the game. Also, if you feel like it, you can back track to certain levels to gain life upgrades or magic upgrades in case you missed them the first time through. Almost every level contains some sort of puzzle for you too solve. Most are fairly easy to solve and don&apos;t disrupt the pacing of the game. However, there are a couple of puzzles in the game that had me turning to a wiki for help&#x2026;
<br>
<br>Castlevania LOS does have a couple of weaknesses though. The first one I want to address is the camera. You have no control over the camera in this game. It does an OK job for the most part but in certain areas, it can cause you to unintentionally end your quest in a hurry. I understand not giving you full 360 degree control (due to the linear level design) but being able to at least switch the angle would have been nice. My other big issue with this LOS is the amount of quick time events in the game&#x2026;and there are tons! Some even completely blindside you during boss fights which cause you to start the fight over again if you fail to mash the button on time. The only way you could possibly have a chance to react is through trial and error. It&#x2019;s a real shame they went this route. My last complaint is more PC specific. I really would have liked too have seen more adjustable graphics options in the PC port. Your given a choice of like 4 or 5 options which only add lighting effects and anti-aliasing. On that note, some of the textures could have been a little reworked. Some textures up close look a little bland.
<br>
<br>Very few action games of this genre have this amount of polish and production value. It has that dark and gothic atmosphere that Castlevania fans have been craving. If you have a chance to play this on an Xbox or Playstation, I recommend it. The PC port is not bad but could have been better. All things considered, Lords of Shadow will be a timeless classic for any Castlevania fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3741476">Expand</a></span>

<br>+A lot of skills to use
<br>+Riding enemies is a really cool feature
<br>+Finishing moves are awesome
<br>
<br>Now to the bad part:
<br>-Very linear
<br>-The game tries to force you to play each level a dozen times
<br>-- You get told what the level&apos;s challange is AFTER you finish it
<br>-- You can&apos;t access certain items without another item which you get much later in the story
<br>-- The hidden &quot;heart/magic containers&quot; sometimes are hidden at incredible stupid spots, where even though levels are liniar they seem impossible to find
<br>-Fights are repetitive. Even though you have a lot of skills you most often will simply attack twice, dodge. Rinse &amp; repeat until you got enough energy for your strongest attack, use it. Rinse and repeat. THis remains the most efficient strategy for the whole game.
<br>
<br>Taking everything into account:
<br>Though I really liked the map design, visuals and story I sometimes found it hard to keep playing since I got frustrated by the game trying to force me to replay former stages.
<br>Even though everything looks different (great map design) I felt I was playing the same all over.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s so linear, that you have to treat it like a Telltale game.
<br>Play it for the story and the great designed stages.
<br>See it as a book or a movie, not as the action game it is supposed to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3987261">Expand</a></span>

Compared to its console counterparts, the PC version is significantly more stunning. More importantly, it plays smoothly. So Mercury Steam did a good job on the PC port. The Castlevania series is so fragmented these day I gave up on following it. But LOS brings everything into focus. It provides a story brimming in lore and full of mystical characters while providing the origin story for Dracula.
<br>The production values for LOS are high. Environments are rich in detail. Character animations are fluid. Combat is varied and exciting. The music is superb. Virtually nothing was overlooked to establish the game&apos;s tone: hopeful yet futile. Darkness lurks around every corner. Overall, Mercury Steam made a great contribution to the franchise and rebooted it successfully. Unlike Team Ninja&apos;s reboot of Metroid: The Other M. Team Ninja all but destroyed the Metroid series and made Samus Aaron into an entitled snotty brat.
<br>So why the controversy? Well, the cameras are terrible. The immobile cameras are the biggest drawback to the game. This renders the game unplayable for some and is the sole reason for the game&apos;s lower than expected scores. Too often, obstacles and platforms will be off screen or just barely visible. In combat, enemies can charge from out of view. Without the ability to rotate the camera, players really lose out. Controls aren&apos;t always responsive while platforming either. I expected the platforming sections to rival Alice: Return to Madness. But LOS is much stiffer and clunkier. Occasionally buttons have to be pressed repeatedly to perform actions. Some puzzles can be frustrating because the timing has to be too perfect. This can upset even the most patient gamer. Fortunately, this isn&apos;t the case in combat. Another minor annoyance is the screen juddering. While standing still, the camera bounces. This is an &quot;effect&quot; added by the developers. It&apos;s annoying and I&apos;m surprised they didn&apos;t remove it in the PC port. However, the effect vanishes while moving.
<br>The other gripe is the game&apos;s linear design. This backfired only because of the precedents set by Super Metroid and Castleviana: Symphony of the Night. But ultimately this is a matter preference. I honestly think the developers wanted to push the story forward. I wasn&apos;t bothered by LOS&apos;s linearity, especially since it will easily provide 10 hours of play in single tour. However, I concede that the platforming becomes repetitive and the uneven pacing can be a turn off. But the environments and enemies are varied enough to prevent the feeling of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu. The ability to travel back to any completed level and replay it to uncover secrets and unlock more skills is a huge bonus. Who wouldn&apos;t want to replay a boss after beefing up their character a bit?Sadly, the game&apos;s linearity really holds back the main character&apos;s full potential. Upgrades are underutilized and the main character feels weak.
<br>Something unexpected is the game&apos;s autosave system. It saves often, so gamers will never be to far from where they fell. But the best part is how the system will save during a boss fights. Since bosses have multiple stages, players don&apos;t have to reengage the stages they defeated. This is awesome and underappreciated.
<br>Castlevania LOS is a fresh take on the series. But it definitely lacks platforming. If players can look past the awkward camera angles, they will find a lot to love about this game. Simply put, the game has true depth despite its linearity. And as I pointed out with Metroid: The Other M, not all reboots are successful. The major drawbacks are the immobile cameras, ocassionally stiff controls, and awkward platforming. These problems hold back what could have been one of the best Castlevania games ever. For those on the fence, wait for a Steam sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4038086">Expand</a></span>

Seriously I fell in love with this game. The art style is absolutely FANTASTIC. The graphics of this game made me feel like I was watching a lord of the rings movie. BOSS fights are TOP NOTCH and as for story it has that epic feeling of adventure. This game has also a lot of variation in terms of gameplay like puzzles, hack and slash sections, platforming and even in one section you have to play a chess game with a demon girl. The only problems I found about this game are some small bugs, some camera issues (cause camera is fixed and sometimes gets in the way) and there are some levels that are week in relation to other and feel out of place. Also some puzzles are hard to solve due to unresponsive controls because the camera gets in the way and your character is not controlled as it&#x2019;s supposed to. In conclusion I have to say that this game is one of my favorite 2013 games and I highly recommend it.
<br>
<br>PROS: The art style and graphics are top notch, nice story,nice music, boss fights are awesome, lots of content and a lengthy campaign  the two expansions (22 hrs total)
<br>
<br>CONS: Camera issues, some bugs, fighting can sometimes be repetitive; some levels are week and feel like fillers, Some control issues may frustrate you.
<br>
<br>Final score: 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3758766">Expand</a></span>

<br>In this game you will climb our down the walls, use your chain in some type of movements who looks like God of War, kill and ride some monsters, and when you fight some bosses, had to climb in then and pressing some buttons at time.

(i kill the same after 3chapters now) and combat isnt that awesome. fixed camera-angles and repetiv gameplay do the rest. my first review after 3 hours was quite euphoric, but the tension leaves as fast as she comes.</span>

This game stands out as one of the better. Though it seems some die hard fans of the &quot;Metroidvania&quot; styled Castlevanias that appeal to the Weeaboos out there who gush over SotN every chance they get disagree. However this game has huge amounts of appeal. The graphics are wonderful aside from a clip or awkward model movement from time to time, the story is very basic revenge spree and all that. However it is in the growth of your character not only in game but within the story that keeps you interested in what will happen next. Being a dedicated gamer that I am, I played through on the most difficulty setting right away. The starting to this game can be frustrating and annoying if you play on the hardest difficulty at first. Though after the first section of the game you become a power house making ever fight more smooth as you become attuned to the combat and as the overall strength of Gabriel grows. This leads us up to the ending, without giving away spoilers; is wonderful and is an amazing reboot to the series. This game has rather awkward platforming sections from time to time and the controls are not mirroring other games so if you are use to other games controls you may sometimes drop yourself down a pit. As far as combat goes remembering to parry and block is needed in the first section of the game unless you plan of check pointing half a dozen times. Although the beginning of this game left the dry taste of salt in my mouth, a refreshing beverage of power ups and ability boosts kept me wanting to play. Knowing that right around the corner I could find the next move to that made taking down that tough enemy just that much easier. There is plenty to do in this game once you have completed the main story, each short section is cut into segments of a chapter and can be replayed to find all the secrets and other interesting content. Packed with lore and not only 15-20 hours of gameplay this game keeps you interested deeply if you are a big Castlevania fan. Don&apos;t let fan boys of the back tracking flashy Metroid clone games that get puked out onto the portable consoles fool you. This is by far one of the best 3d Castlevanias, each moment in this game feels like such a waste to just rush through even though the feeling of epicness may come off as forced from time to time, I still found myself loving each boss fight. Overall this game is a must have, any platform, ignore the Fan boys that mock 3d Castlevanias. Lords of Shadow is an excellent experience for not only the casual gamers but the hardcore gamers alike.   (Other mentions: Great voice acting, original designs, great background, great loading transition, probably the best &quot;pause&quot; menu I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure to use, perfect uses of the &quot;bloom&quot; lighting,  and vampires... real ones.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3902464">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>REVIEW: I heard all the complaints about the fixed camera and decided I needed to play the demo before buying this game. After playing the demo, I was intrigued by the look and feel of the game and grabbed it on sale. The demo, however does not well capture the game, as both the best and worst parts are left out.
<br>This game has a number of beautiful environments and stages, the best of which are compelling even many years after the original release. There are a large number of enemies, which are bound together by a similar &#x201C;feel&#x201D; in the way they look. On the other hand, there were way more bare-breasted women than I thought necessary, and in my opinion, this reduced the aesthetic of the game (this is the &#x201C;nudity&#x201D; that probably got the game the mature rating). The story is interesting, and the surprise ending nicely ties the loose threads together. I did have a problem with the large number of new plot elements that Konami introduced in the epilogue, however&#x2014;this mostly seemed to be about hooking people into a sequel, rather than actually tying into all the story that went before.
<br>
<br>The game also has clever puzzles, which are all solveable, though if you get stuck you can forfeit the experience points to skip them, which is a nice option.
<br>
<br>This game is about more than story, looks, and puzzles, however, and this is where it fails out. The problems with combat and the fixed camera are interrelated&#x2014;because the camera is fixed, combat areas need to be tiny so that you can see everything. However, cramped fighting means that most of your combos are useless: they take too long to use or they leave you exposed to enemies. That means that you will use one of about three fast combos, dodge/roll to the other side of the small fighting area, and repeat&#x2014;which gets stale long before the end of the game. Furthermore, the camera makes some platforming sequences awkward, especially portions where you have to walk along a balance beam at a weird angle. Being able to tilt the camera would have improved this, even if it remained fixed. As it is, the beams are annoying with a controller, but they would be impossible with keyboard/mouse.
<br>
<br>If you are interested in the art and story, you might be better off watching somebody else on YouTube; with the repetitive combat and poor platforming that compose 85% of this game I can&#x2019;t recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4801299">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well, game have nice graphic and story, it is not bad, but not a castlevania, just commercial usage of brand.</span>

This game I played for 5 hours every night for a week, losing much sleep, but having so much fun.
<br>
<br>It has a great sense of style and sense of progression.  The character Gabriel Belmont really builds up to be a strong fighter.  The control is very smooth, each time after you level up and buys new ability, you can develop a new longer combo.  The game encourages you to play earlier chapter to discover more collectible and you can relish in defeating earlier enemy with ease and style.  By the end of the game, when I acquired the Ultimate Light and Shadow Magic, fighting the last boss was easy on Normal difficulty because magic is unlimited and I have maxed out all the stat.
<br>
<br>The game always save your experience point so you don&#x2019;t feel like you wasted time even if you are dead.  This also allows farming for points.  You also don&#x2019;t feel you need to be stingy with using the items because this is not a survivor game.  Chapter VI, Part III: Castle Hall, when you finish the rune puzzle and it turns night, the vampires do end after a few waves. If you stand and kill all of the vampires, the last one seems to drop a full load of EVERY item (daggers, holy water, faeries, and crystals.  You get about 50 experience points per vampire, and there is a magic fountain there so you can easily use up your item and magic to kill all enemy in just 3 minutes, you can then go to the game menu, &#x201C;Restart on Last Check Point&#x201D; and fight them again.  You can get as much experience as you want.  If you can afford to wait though, go to Chapter VI, Part IV: Refectory, the boss Evil Butcher, there is a 30 second QuickTime prompt event before you kill him, and you get 1,000 points for doing that.  You can definitely max on all the skills and relics by doing this.
<br>
<br>The visual is amazing, there is hand drawn black and white bestiary and storybook like intro in each chapter, and then when you play the game there is the animated cut scene.   There is the QuickTime sequence / prompt event where you have to push the attack button when the circle shrinks down smaller than the indicator circle.   This was very confusing for me at first because I am used to smashing button when the prompt comes up.  In fact, in the first sequence where I ride the horse to escape the goblins I keep getting knocked down.  I also recommend you lose the prompt event sometimes because some of the Gabriel&#x2019;s death animation is pretty amazing.  This is especially true when you fight Carmilla the Vampire Queen&#x2019;s true form, Dark lord of the Vampires (BOSS), the animation there is really long and you would never find out if you win at the prompt.
<br>
<br>The game has the blatant steal from Shadow of Colossus where you have to climb on a Titan and attach each of the spot on its body, and the Titan will attempt to throw you off.   It is quite exciting.
<br>Patrick Stewart of the Star Trek Enterprise / Captain Picard fame is one of the main story character Zobek .  He narrates all the intro level descriptions / stories.  The first time I heard him I was very impressed by his acting and happy that this game has a big budget to hire good actors.
<br>
<br>On the downside, the game does have some repetitive points, and the DLC which continues from the end of the game, it is very difficult and repetitive even on the normal setting.  In the DLC you help Laura the vampire daughter with The Forgotten big evil boss that is trapped under the castle.  Gabriel chooses actions which leads him to become the man he is in Lords of Darkness 2.  You also see the trailer for the 2nd game if you wait after the game credit ends.
<br>
<br>If you just want a fun run through, it will take 20 hours, if you go back and get all the crystal and collectibles and challenges, it will take about 40 hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4026307">Expand</a></span>

EVERY single large enemy uses annoying aerial shockwave attack. Every small enemy can be grabbed and qte-killed. The camera is horrible but manageable.

<br>
<br>STORY
<br>
<br>You&apos;re wife&apos;s dead &amp; you&apos;re emo. Patrick Stalwart shows up &amp; says, &quot;We can bring your wife back by making you into a god!&quot; So you go around killing things until it happens, I assume.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY
<br>
<br>You Mash X when there&apos;s a single target &amp; Y when there&apos;s multiple targets while dodging or jumping over attacks. You can block but you might as well just dodge. You get the power to absorb magic orbs &amp; add &quot;Light Magic&quot; to your attacks which only serves to give you lifesteal. Also, why don&apos;t the orbs just absorb when I get close? Why do I have to hold a button down to absorb them? That adds absolutely nothing to the gameplay &amp; just leaves you open during combat.
<br>
<br>The camera is so god awful. Enemies will attack you off camera by leaping at you or throwing bombs &amp; the auto targeting is so bad that you&apos;ll constantly miss when you throw knives. Don&apos;t even get me started on the QTE&apos;s which only serve to break up the already boring combat &amp; make it even more boring.
<br>
<br>Then the way the areas are designed are just straight lines with small off paths that lead to either an upgrade or to something that could have been put on the main path like a Regeneration Fountain. There was one path that almost the same as the other path with the exception of an item being hidden on it. Why? What is the point of making the paths lead to the exact same place if the only difference is one has an upgrade? That&apos;s blatantly punishing players who choose the path without the upgrade forcing them to replay the level just to find it. It&apos;s padding at it&apos;s absolute worst.
<br>
<br>To make matters worse every level I played has or is a tutorial. Level 1? Combat tutorial. Level 2? Jumping tutorial. Level 3? New item tutorial. Level 4? Boss tutorial. Level 5? Magic tutorial. Level 6? Poison effect tutorial. ENOUGH WITH THE TUTORIALS!
<br>
<br>OVERALL
<br>
<br>I do not like this game. In fact, with the two hours I spent playing about half or more of that was in cutscenes &amp; replaying levels to find an item I missed. And every time I replayed a level all I could think was, &quot;What is the point of this? Why is this in the game? Why is that in the game? This isn&apos;t fun. It adds nothing to the game. This only serves to extend the level to make it seem longer than it actually is!&quot;
<br>
<br>Like, holy hell this game is bad &amp; I barely played it. Very Positive? I refuse to believe that. The game feels like a checklist of what NOT to do in a video game &amp; I only played it for around 2 hours! If you can&apos;t find enjoyment in the first 2 hours of playing then it&apos;s not a good game.
<br>
<br>The game starts you off in a tutorial that leads to another tutorial that leads to another tutorial that leads to another tutorial, Then I got to chapter 2 &amp; guess what? More tutorials! Screw this, I&apos;m done! Wake me up when Konami decides to stop treating gamers like mentally challenged piggy banks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6336427">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m at the third episode and it&apos;s getting worse, it&apos;s a hard game but for all those bad reasons.

<br>
<br>+ Beautiful graphics
<br>+ Interesting story
<br>+ Exciting  orchestral soundtrack
<br>+ Good combat mechanics
<br>+ Nice puzzles
<br>
<br>- Locked camera
<br>- Story loses focus on important characters
<br>
<br>Nice game in overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6681833">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Amazing journey. May not have the most impressive start, actually I liked it on second try few months after I abandoned it after first try, but I am glad that I came back. Amazing atmosphere and design, great storyline and characters, tons of content, sometimes challenging. This is more than just a game, its an art. One of those very few games that really got me seriously involved.</span>

<br>Also I would recommend it for those who can play it without judging from its name.
<br>
<br>I you like Narnia, God of War, cliche vampire and creature design play this one!
<br>Don&apos;t waste your money and time with the second one.
<br>BTW, great port!</span>
