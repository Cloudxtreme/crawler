Chivalry is an excellent game concept, but suffers many flaws that scare away all but the most dedicated gamers who are willing to suffer through its problems to play the satisfying and mechanically-deep game that lies beneath. Rather than fixing Chivalry&apos;s problems, they abandoned the game and re-used the same concept to make Mirage. The problem is, Mirage as a game does nothing to welcome these complex mechanics, choosing to water down the formula instead. If Chivalry never existed, I&apos;d probably give Mirage a 7/10 and say &quot;has potential!&quot; but I cannot recommend Mirage to even a single person when Chivalry exists and is the superior game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirage-arcane-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=7345038">Expand</a></span>

I played the alpha which was fun and the full release does not disappoint. The servers had been low for the first month but w the first free weekend and the steam sale the servers are starting to snowball w more ppl already. At first it did seem that it was chiv w spells but the more I actually play the game and try the different classes the more I realize it&apos;s so much more . Yes chiv is classic but imo this game is actually better in a lot of ways. Unreal engine 4 is slick and responsive with great physics. The special abilities are fun and when you start to chain them together you will notice a depth in gameplay that they give that chivalry doesn&apos;t have. The movement/dodging is much better then chiv. The graphics obviously are. As well as the teamwork. I&apos;ve noticed a lot more ppl seems to be sticking together and backing each other up. I personally like the colorful/vibrant art style. Give it up to the developers for making a different game then chiv in the art style as well as the gameplay. This game will blow up and become a classic over time. Lol at the hipster haters giving 0 out of 10. They won&apos;t stop this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirage-arcane-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=7379502">Expand</a></span>
