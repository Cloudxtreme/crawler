The story sucks big time, characters are incredibly implausible, puzzles and mini-games are boring (except for the &quot;statue-rocking&quot; game, which was both boring and infuriatingly hard), graphics are not pretty and customizable main menu pointless.</span>

For everyone else (or if you paid more), beware of the major deficiencies in this game: 1) Story is ludicrously bad, and not funny bad, just bad. 2) game engine is old and dated for 2012, which would be OK if they used it nicely with interesting environments, but they don&apos;t, almost never. 3) Characters are bland, need a sidekick for better dialogue for the whole game. 4) Music is OK, background forgettable, but OK. 5) Dialogue audio is hugely inconsistent, speaking is all over the place in tonality in the same sentences. I would like to see point-and-click games continue, when done well they are good. This game is not helping the genre, confirming why it is dying out as a breed.
