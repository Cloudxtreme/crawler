<br>
<br>It&apos;s basically a boss rush hidden away in a empty overworld, each boss has a simple pattern to learn and you can kill them in one hit, that quickly means that as soon as you figure out how a boss works (It doesn&apos;t take long at all, bosses have at most three attack patterns) the challenge is gone, you can kill it without even thinking about it, so in the end, each boss lasts 1-20 seconds. 18 bosses in the game. It lasted me 45 minutes my first playthrough and there&apos;s no incentive other than improving my time to play through it again.
<br>
<br>As for any extras, there&apos;s different unlockable modes after you beat the game, Hard Mode (Speeds up some of the bosses, again, once you know the pattern, all you have to do is speed yourself up, it&apos;s not hard) Iron Mode (The typical &quot;one life&quot; thing they put into &quot;hardcore&quot; games) and No Roll mode (AKA: The only mode that makes a difference to gameplay)
<br>
<br>So, in the end, it&apos;s an extremely short boss rush, the game likes to think otherwise however and doesn&apos;t reload outside the boss on death for some reason, the overworld itself isn&apos;t needed in the slightest (there were a few &quot;puzzles&quot; but nothing you won&apos;t figure out in a few seconds) and there isn&apos;t an actual boss rush &quot;mode&quot;, what were they thinking!?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/titan-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=5193325">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But unique does not mean good.
<br>
<br>The heart and soul of this game is wandering around the game world taking out titans. Each of them has their own arena, and there are 19 of them in total.
<br>
<br>This sounds like a boss rush. But it really isn&#x2019;t. The reason is that the gameplay mechanics of this game are very strange.
<br>
<br>As a 2D game, you run around laterally. You really only have two abilities &#x2013; the ability to roll and the ability to shoot your arrow. Note that is arrow, singular &#x2013; you shoot ONE arrow. If you miss with it, you need to retrieve it to shoot again. This means either walking over it, or holding down the fire button to draw it back to you. Drawing back your bow to fire or summoning your arrow back both immobilize you as long as you&#x2019;re doing it, and firing your arrow is not instantaneous and can be done with varying amounts of power.
<br>
<br>Your character dies in one hit; if anything hits you, you die. The only things which don&#x2019;t instantly kill you are a poison cloud (which kills you after a couple seconds) and some spores (which mess with the gameplay interface, and will kill you if you walk through too many of them). Both of these things appear in exactly one titan fight. Otherwise, if you get hit, you&#x2019;re dead.
<br>
<br>When you die, you respawn at a nearby checkpoint. Note that this is not actually in the room with the titan, and in some areas, you actually have to do a fair bit of walking to get back to the titan  &#x2013; not a ridiculous amount, but there are definitely a few areas where this is a bit wearing.
<br>
<br>The main reason why this game is so weird is that the titans themselves are very weak &#x2013; they are really, really, really good at killing you, but most of the titans can be killed with a single shot from your bow. This means that many of the titans, once you figure out how to beat them, can be killed in under 30 seconds &#x2013; and many can actually be killed in under 10 seconds.
<br>
<br>The problem is that you probably won&#x2019;t do this the first time. You&#x2019;re likely to die. A lot. I died 218 times on my way through this game. Almost all of your time spent playing this game is time spent dying.
<br>
<br>The game, then, is basically you setting up for the perfect shot, and then executing on it successfully once to win the encounter.
<br>
<br>Some of the titans do require a bit more doing than this &#x2013; some of them require multiple shots to kill in various capacities. Ironically, most of these titans are actually easier than many of the one-shot titans simply because they tend to be less lethal, and therefore, easier to fight. One of the first titans you fight is an ooze which splits repeatedly, and it is one of the easier titans despite requiring by far the largest number of shots of any titan in the game. It is also one of the only titans which actually feels like a &#x201C;boss fight&#x201D;. However, most of the rest of these titans are just about executing on a short series of things, usually 2 shots, or some sequence you must do to expose the boss&#x2019;s weak spot.
<br>
<br>The net effect of all this is that, rather than feeling like you&#x2019;re beating down a bunch of badass bosses, instead it feels like you&#x2019;re facing off with a bunch of heavily twitch-based scenarios &#x2013; almost all of the fights are not about figuring out what you need to do (this is generally obvious), but actually executing on it. The few bosses which are harder to figure out what to do against tend to be the most frustrating, as you don&#x2019;t even know if you&#x2019;re &#x201C;doing it right&#x201D; until something you try actually works.
<br>
<br>Because so many of these fights can be over so quickly, really it is basically banging yourself against the wall that is the titan until you get your one perfect shot, at which point you win and it is off to the next one. This can make some parts of the game feel very short indeed &#x2013; if you quickly kill a titan, it feels very ephemeral.
<br>
<br>And the reality is there isn&#x2019;t anything else here for you. There are the nineteen titans, and that&#x2019;s it. That basically means that this is a game which fundamentally contains 19 pieces of content, and all of the gameplay is centered around beating these 19 mostly twitch-based pieces of content.
<br>
<br>After that, you&#x2019;re done with the game forever and never need to touch it again &#x2013; and probably don&#x2019;t want to, as the titans really don&#x2019;t feel that satisfying to fight. Rather than being impressive enemies, they&#x2019;re just twitch challenges. The only one that really felt all that exciting to me was the very final (secret) boss, who was pretty fun to look at and by far the most visually interesting foe in the game.
<br>
<br>There is no real story to speak of &#x2013; there are maybe three or so vague hints throughout the game, but you really have absolutely no idea whatsoever why it is you&#x2019;re doing the thing you&#x2019;re doing. Nor does the game make you care.

<br>After you face the first 4 bosses that the demo contains, you&apos;ve already seen nearly everything the game has to offer in terms of mechanics. It&apos;s a bit sad considering there are 20 bosses.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll die a bunch of times on some bosses but only because the game forces you to stand still while aiming and shooting your arrow, like in the old Resident Evil games, and this makes it very frustrating in a fast 2D action game, especially when the bosses are very agile and jumpy, leading to a ton of cheap deaths.
<br>
<br>Nice proof of concept, lousy game. Also a shameful use of the &quot;Souls&quot; in the title to make it seem like this is a 2D Dark Souls, nope, since all the bosses here are all basically variations on Bed of Chaos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/titan-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=5198982">Expand</a></span>

<br>First the good:

1. The art style is good, the pixel graphic is good, good use more various landscape tho.

2. Boss design is interesting, at least the idea behind it.

3. Glyph system. Looks like the game is trying creating a language system that resembles to some glyph. I like the idea, it&apos;s really cool.

4. Music is decent.

<br>
<br>4. Music is decent.
<br>
<br>Then, the bad:
<br>
<br>1. No story, this is intended alright. So I will make do.
<br>
<br>2. The game is too hard the a bad checkpoint system.
<br>Being hard isn&apos;t a problem, but the problem is the checkpoint system. If this is a game where you die a lot you need to be able to jump right back in. Instead of spawning at the beginning and run through the star. And what&apos;s more disgusting is that in order to run faster people usually roll, but you can&apos;t roll at the stair, you will be bounced back. This is a notorious design choice that force player to spend more time between the boss fight. You might die 10 seconds after the fight starts and spending 30 seconds running to the door.
<br>
<br>3. Unresponsive combat system.
<br>If you wanna make something like dark soul, the you need to have a very fluid combat system where everything is responsive. But you won&apos;t find it here. Running is slow, rolling has a long cool down which force you to move very slowly. If that wasn&apos;t enough, it&apos;s going to take time for you to charge the bow before you can shoot it, and you can&apos;t move while doing that. Oh did I mention you only have one arrow? So you are gonna have to pick it back every time after you shoot. By either running to get it or by calling then back. If you call the arrow back, it&apos;s still going to take a long time, longer than the charge time even depending on the distance, and of course you cannot move during the calling process. And the screen zoom in a little and DARKEN YOUR VISION making it more difficult to see things. I completely don&apos;t get the point of it. This mechanism basically discourage player from using the arrow. But arrow is the only thing that you can do damage with. You are basically forced to stop again and again, having your vision impaired, and don&apos;t have time to maneuver (the mechanic won&apos;t allow you either, it&apos;s extremely restricted).
<br>
<br>4. No aim assist.
<br>You heard me right, even this is not a fps, it is still a shooter, when you are in such a restricted space and time every shot counts, however the boss moves like wind and you just can&apos;t catch it. It might be fine if you are using a mouse on a PC. But for console it&apos;s pretty much say good bye. The joy stick just doesn&apos;t allow pin point accuracy in that short amount of time. And you are gonna end up missing shots a lot. And you are going to have to call the arrow back while not moving and not seen things. Then you get killed. Wonderful isn&apos;t it?
<br>
<br>5. Too short. Too little content.
<br>I haven&apos;t finish this thing yet but as I heard there are about 20 battles in total, let&apos;s include all hidden/secret ones (if any) and that makes it 30 (I doubt it). Remember, boss battle ONLY. No story, no level, no mobs, just rooms and bosses. And a checkpoint that brings you to the very beginning of the staircase.
<br>
<br>Basically it&apos;s 30 battles, that&apos;s it. Which probably translates into 5 hour worth of game play.You might spend some longer time on this, but not because you enjoy it, rather, because you kept dying a lot and you have no choice, those time doesn&apos;t translate into enjoyment.
<br>
<br>6. No progression, no reward.
<br>When you finally defeat a boss. Guess what? You got nothing, no rewards, no skill, no nothing. Just a cheap blow up animation.
<br>
<br>Can you imagine that? You are fighting a boss where the boss is moving like a rocket and you can only run at a fairly slow speed and can do some evasive maneuver by rolling around, which has a cool down. Want to shoot the boss? Well you need to charge for a second before you can shoot it, and spending more time calling the arrow back, during which process you cannot move and can see little things. And the shot probably end up missing the target a lot. You are just getting smashed by the boss again and again because you cannot move fast enough, or just cannot move at all. After you die you respawn at the beginning of the staircase and has to run to the door all over again, and it discourage your rolling action by bouncing you back. After many tries you might have eventually defeat a boss. NO REWARDS. NO NOTHING. Just 30 of this same torturing experience and then you are done.
<br>
<br>The games is hard because the combat system is flawed. It discourage evasive maneuver where the game needs it the most. Either the developer don&apos;t know how to design or they intended on punishing players for mistakes not by the player, but the system.
<br>
<br>My verdict.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think this is a game with interesting design, beautiful arts. But with no story and a flawed combat system that punish player for mistakes they didn&apos;t make. And it is tedious and repetitious. This is coming from me who has a CS who is also a game developer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/titan-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=5194789">Expand</a></span>

As you might recall from my last review, Keebles, I struggle with too much of a challenge and lack the patience to keep one&#x2019;s controller intact after many cheap deaths. However, I was taken in by the sweet pixelly graphics of Titan Souls.
<br>
<br>The game opens with your little guy wandering around in a temple area, with just his bow and single arrow to defend against some pretty nasty enemies. I initially started out using keyboard controls, but quickly found that to be both frustrating and physically painful, so I spent an extremely irritating amount of time figuring out which console gamepad I could use. After several failed attempts, I managed to get my PS4 controller working with Steam and away I went.
<br>
<br>The first enemy I fought was a bouncing blob with a heart inside. It was clear I needed to release the heart from the blob, and then shoot it, but of course, it wasn&#x2019;t that easy. Each time you shot the blob, it divided (and became more aggressive), and so you then had to contend with multiple enemies. After several shots, you could end up with a large amount of small (and fast) bouncing blobs each leaving slime trails to trap you. If you were hit by a blob, you were instantly dead. I spent far too long yelling at my screen about this, and nearly got to the point of giving up, but I persevered and it eventually paid off. And I must say: the satisfaction you get from destroying your first enemy after dying so many times was so worth it.
<br>
<br>Feeling like I was getting the hang of it, I moved on to the next enemy, which was a brain inside a block of ice. Again, this was a very aggressive enemy (sensing a theme here). A flame would regularly spurt from the centre of the room, and due to playing many RPGs in my life, I instinctively knew that I needed to shoot my arrow through the flame to hit the enemy&#x2019;s ice shield, thus leaving the brain unprotected. I took out this enemy in short order and derived great satisfaction from absorbing its soul.
<br>
<br>The final boss of the level was a stone golem with two very smashy fists. One fist would pursue you, while the other protected a jewel in the golem&#x2019;s chest. Some fancy ducking and weaving is necessary before expertly (or luckily, in my case) timing your shot just as the fists swap places. For some reason I thought that was the end of the game and I was considering it a bit of a rip-off, until I realised that no, there are more levels to play &#x2013; the game has a total of 20 bosses, in fact. The doors to the first level opened, and in I went, stepping on a floorplate, to be lifted to a new area &#x2013; one with far more places to explore and pixelly scenery to admire, including a range of different environments (I explored a snow area with a stark beauty).
<br>
<br>Despite my frustration at the difficulty of Titan Souls, I do understand that&#x2019;s a big part of its appeal to many gamers. After 80 minutes of gameplay, my death count was 62, so that&#x2019;s probably a good indicator of what to expect. The game requires patience and practice, and if you stick with it, you&#x2019;ll be rewarded with a satisfying payoff. I would definitely insist you play with a gamepad because the keyboard controls are just not responsive and fine enough for some of the fast dodging and shooting you need to do. The gamepad gives you greater range of movement and your tendons will thank you later. The graphics are sweet and nostalgic, and the lilting piano score is subtle and ambient. Little touches like wind swirls, and trees swaying give a nice amount of movement to the scenery. Don&#x2019;t forget to take a dip if you come across a body of water.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/titan-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=5396976">Expand</a></span>

<br>There is no **** No Trash enemies, no wasted time. It has a wonderful soundtrack and incredible game mechanics and it has a beautiful art style. From the beginning it doesn&apos;t choke out your interest with a fake garbage story and soulless characters. You control a kid with one arrow and you simply fight Titans. Avoid their attacks and kill them by attacking their weak point.
<br>
<br>This is a challenging game. If you have respect for games like Super Meat Boy and Hotline Miami, then you must play this game. It is incredible. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/titan-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=5191609">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sin duda el juego es sencillo, ruedas, corres, tirar una flecha m&#xE1;gica (tu &#xFA;nica flecha) para intentar matar al enemigo de un golpe, y si no lo consigues la recoges nuevamente (andando sobre ella o &quot;llam&#xE1;ndola&quot;), en enfrentamientos de &quot;igual condici&#xF3;n&quot; ya que ambos mor&#xED;s de un golpe. Su mec&#xE1;nica es sencilla, y cumple.
<br>
<br>Lo mas bonito sin lugar a discusi&#xF3;n es su apartado gr&#xE1;fico/art&#xED;stico, es (bajo mi punto de vista) su gran reclamo, y no decepciona para nada.
<br>
<br>Respecto a la dificultad, salvo alg&#xFA;n Titan especifico que me ha dado alg&#xFA;n problema, el juego es bastante f&#xE1;cil.
<br>
<br>Los dos apartados donde creo que falla el juego son dos. El primero, y el m&#xE1;s hablado por la mayor&#xED;a de los an&#xE1;lisis es la posici&#xF3;n donde te deja el juego al morir frente a un Titan. El tener que recorrer ese tramo de camino cansa bastante, y si, aunque suelen ser cortos, repetirlos no es del agrado de nadie. El segundo fallo es la historia, no cuentan nada y tampoco generan ning&#xFA;n tipo de inter&#xE9;s para intentar averiguar nada, ya que lo &#xFA;nico que puedes encontrar es rebuscando algunos grabados donde especular sobre est&#xE1;.
<br>
<br>Me es complicado recomendar o no este juego, ya que estoy entre la espada y la pared. Por un lado veo algo interesante y bonito, pero por otro lado veo algo que podr&#xED;a ser mucho mas de lo que es, con una duraci&#xF3;n corta y peque&#xF1;os fallos que que se juntan para dejar una mancha bastante visible.
<br>
<br>Mi recomendaci&#xF3;n es que os inform&#xE9;is bastante bien sobre este juego antes de adquirirlo, y sobre todo que si ten&#xE9;is la oportunidad, una oferta no viene mal. La votaci&#xF3;n final es &quot;no&quot; por que yo mismo no lo recomendar&#xED;a a un grupo de amigos, si no a personas en especifico que se que les podr&#xED;a interesar algo as&#xED;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/titan-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=7082446">Expand</a></span>

Titan Souls is a Top-Down Action game in the styling of Shadow of the Colossus and, to a lesser extent, Dark Souls developed by Acid Nerve.  The premise of the game is that you have 1 arrow, and everything (Including you) dies in 1 hit.  You have to explore a vast (Though empty) overworld, finding and slaying bosses.  Each boss is a fun and creative puzzle.  For instance, the final boss of the first area covers his weak spot with his hands, so he can&apos;t be hit by your arrow.  He takes his hands off, however, to drop his fists on you.  You have to shoot him while he&apos;s switching hands to hit you with.  The engine feels smooth, the controls (On controller at least) feel great, and the bosses are all unique and fun to figure out.  The soundtrack is wonderful, and so is the graphic design.  However, this game is an example of quality over quantity, as the game is around 2 or 3 hours long, and can be completed in under 15 minutes if you don&apos;t die.  I&apos;m ok with 2 or 3 hour campaigns on $3 games, but with Titan Souls running for the full $15, I can&apos;t find it in my heart to recommend this game unless it&apos;s on at least a 50% sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/titan-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=7377539">Expand</a></span>
