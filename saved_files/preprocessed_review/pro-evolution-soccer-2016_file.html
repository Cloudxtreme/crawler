Don&apos;t be conned by the screenshots or details published on Steam as these were taken from the far superior PS4 version using a completely new build of the Fox Engine - something the PC version is NOT running on.
<br>
<br>The engine used in the PC version is exactly the same as PES 2015 and to add further insult to injury; it just just an enhanced build from the 2012 edition published back in 2011. Graphically, it shows as the visuals are extremely drab and the textures are quite frankly appalling. Compared to the PS4 release; not only is it significantly worse; it&apos;s actually embarrassing to play the game in this state. The user interface which is probably the only feature that has been significantly overhauled is even more cumbersome and annoying than in previous titles and is the final nail in the coffin on a pitiful product.
<br>
<br>If you can get past the humiliation of playing on a piss poor PS3 port in 2015 after paying full price; you&apos;ll actually enjoy the experience but even the most hardened Pro Evo veterans will find this joke hard to take. EA Sports did the same on PC with FIFA 14 by releasing an old gen port but at least they were honest about the situation months beforehand. The fact this is full price is just insulting and that the squads haven&apos;t even been updated on many teams from the current transfer window suggests you&apos;re better off obtaining a refund and just going back to Pro Evolution Soccer 2015 instead. Shameful performance from CONami.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5489263">Expand</a></span>

The AI is a complete cheat, all the moves of your team and opponent&apos;s are controlled by AI, giving you a bit of influence only. Sometimes you won&apos;t be even able to move for a second or two, only for the opponents to steal the ball. Talking about stealing the ball, if you have never seen a player taking the ball from behind your player, from between ur player&apos;s legs while you&apos;re running, then you&apos;re in for a treat. That&apos;s how you&apos;ll get cheated a lot. Close control? forget it! 4 players closing you from 4 directions and nowhere to move without losing the ball. Goalkeepers don&apos;t exist, just don&apos;t even think there are any. They will literally let the ball through from the center of the pitch. Defense is always trying to offside trap, so they are constantly chasing the counter attackers hitting at your door! The opponents are also always contr-attacking only. There&apos;s no variety in the game at all. It&apos;s a waste of money and time. It&apos;s still unfixed, and now they announced PES 2017, which I will give a wide miss. Konami is no more for me, and so is PES.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6534444">Expand</a></span>

AI is just a crap - 0 tactics, 0 positioning, 0 follow. Graphics - no comment here... Overall - overpriced game which is basically a **** port form PS3. I give 3 because I like BAL mode a bit and soundtrack is quite good in my opinion.</span>

Now tried the PES 16 on PC, it is very good gameplay, but the graphics are really insult to PC players, not much of a difference against the 13 version I played last. Shame on Konami, Fifa has quite good gameplay this year and the graphics are far superior...do you really want all your PC fans to go away??</span>

<br>Scripting like in fifa to cater noobs and make them buy coins so they have a false sense off progression.
<br>Players dont do what you tell them in crucial situations which leads to goals.This is more obvious if you have a sveral game winning streak. Konami often decides if you win or not. The keepers are so bad that it doesnt matter if its Neuer or Kanjuosta. I dont even care about them.Its what happens between on the pitch. Control respons is bad that it always lags a sec so you have to play a sec ahead like in the future. There are no pros in this game and i dont recommend it because it doesnt reward skill nor is it well coded.
<br>
<br>Its network is horrible. Disconnects vs cpu?? Really?
<br>
<br>Lag cheaters and hackers every few games. Beating the living crabs out of players to be rewarded with a disconnect los.
<br>People on the leaderboard with 50+ games winstreak. What are you, some kind of  Lucy?!
<br>
<br>The game is good only for the targeted audiance 12-15yeras olds. Dont buy it,dont lend it,dont try it nor download it for free. Forget about it and erase it from existence.Lets just hope Konami gives someone else the rights to Pro EVO so it has a chanace, We need more devs like CD project or give it to SOny, Square enix,Nintendo.
<br>
<br>But knowing my luck it will be scripted into a EA or Ubisoft relase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6185337">Expand</a></span>

PES 2016 is a game that should be excellent, but suffers from some very horrible balancing issues. It seems that some **** at Konami has gotten over excited about the new collision system and collions occur when there is no need to collide. This game just loves collisions, to the point that the actual game of football is badly affected. Even with players like Pirlo, often a simple pass is a stretch too far as the game imposes some random nonsense collision or improbable recovery touch on the ball from an opposition player. In the final analysis, far too much of the game is down to random events, which can be best influenced only by mashing the tackle button like a maniac. Because the collision systems makes playing a passing possesion game so dangerous, the most effective way to play Pro Evo 2016 is pretty much hoofball. The flow of the game is not dissimilar to that of FIFA 15. All in all, PES 2015 felt much more solid a title than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5498512">Expand</a></span>

<br>And i could go off and say, yes this stuff are minor and don&apos;t break the game, but than we come to shooting.
<br>
<br>Absoluty untested, arcadish, broken ass shooting.
<br>Ball physics do not exist when you press shoot button. It rockets in the net so perfectly its unreal.  R2 Shoot also known as finesse shoot is still broken from the last game, and the chance of missing the goal are really small.
<br>
<br>Thus this makes the game so hard to cope with. It gets old really quick.
<br>
<br>Anyway hoping for a better Pes next year.
<br>
<br>I wouldn&apos;t buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5490227">Expand</a></span>

<br>The best part is konami trying to cover up and treating PC gamers like idiots. Go to steam, you will see konami listing PES 2016 as a bundle which consists of just 1 game - PES2016. This way you are not able to see the negative reviews that people have put on steam. Terribly shady business and f*** you konami. I will be buying fifa for the PC for this year and the coming years until you learn to treat PC gamers with respect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5504353">Expand</a></span>

I cant explain to myself, why someone who get so much money, every year, cant make next gen game for PC fans!? But ok, we got this hybrid like these people in konami call this pice of unfinish product. It is just ridiculous game, that dosent work. That collision sistem in the game is idiotic i dont know what to say, there we have 2 guys fight for the ball and they are like one, stuck together and of coruse opposition get the ball, also when they have a ball it is like glue on their boots it is so funny, you cant take it away from them, at least on top and super star level. When you slide in, they hope over you and score, if you tap 2 times fast X then your player try to take it, they shake it off like it is mosquito and score again. It is so unbalance, unreal and ridiculous. referee are not fair, they can brake your guys legs and nothing will happend, you slide RED CARD.  When you go for penalty you still have some crossair and you have to aim like you are in some kind of hunting simulation it is unbelievable. License  in this game are whole another story, just like in all others pes games, but if you want you can instal patch and fix that. But there is a lot bigger problems then that, that make this game unplayable, you can play fair when everything is against you. Even if you play vs human there is a lot of odd things going on, during the match up. I think that this kind of games should be realistic, as much as possible. This is sad story, we come to this, that when you pay for someting, you dont know what you get, there is scams all around us, and we keep quiet, we should make some noise - revolt, let then know, that this kind of crap must come to the end. This is not just about pes, they do this things in all games. They speak about dlc, when the main game isnt out yet, it is all about money, just like real football become someting that cant last forever, when you have to pay 100E to get inside and watch the game. We live in silly world i hope in time, things will be better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5549637">Expand</a></span>

And become a legend and Master Legue modes have received great improvements as well such as new scouting system and fans and teammates giving nicknames. So for me FIFA 16 and PES 2016 both provided soccer fix i expected from them, and last two PES games showed some progress towards being worthy competitor of FIFA series, last year&apos;s edition almost got that shot, but was shadowed by game play problems, including one i mentioned earlier. But certainly they are getting back in the game. Oh, and those who&apos;s saying it&apos;s last gen port, actually play the past gen and next gen versions and spot the frickin&apos; difference between them or better yet watch the comparison videos by Candyland cause even though the crowds have been better on PS4 version, other parts looked lot more detailed and sharper with a help of anti-aliasing, plus the button prompts are from xbox one, not 360 version and if someone experiences input delay or lag, maybe your PC&apos;s might not be up to snuff, cause i have Intel i3 3,6 GHz processor with 4 GB RAM and GTX 750 on max settings and i didn&apos;t experience any input delay on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5622995">Expand</a></span>

<br>-it has lag input upto 2 secs playing offline. Its very frustrating because sometimes the player takes ages to pass or shoot after pressing X OR A.
<br>- players fall over each other when they collide.
<br>-players stick to each other while running like they have gum on their body in which case players do not perform actions like passing or shoot.
<br>-you play without Goalkeeper. It&#x2019;s an illusion that our team has goal keeper and he is useless. He will let every ball pass through him.
<br>- A Pass means you give the ball from one team player to another. #Konami&#x2019;s definition of passing is giving the ball away to opponent team player(AI) with free Will. Even defenders give pass to (AI) attackers when the ball is in D! What kind of programming is this? I cannot even pass to other teammates to keep possession.
<br>-How do i tackle in the game? Both A and X are useless when playing above regular difficulty.
<br>-Replay&#x2019;s are ugly in this game. Better you skip them.
<br>-One pass goals. Just press Y-Y through pass or lob can score goals easily.
<br>- Five defenders cannot take ball from one Attacker (AI) how weak defending is designed.
<br>-Defenders make way for (AI)Attackers. Defenders run in the opposite direction making way for (AI)Attackers to score easy goals and you question yourself how the hell did he score that goal? Just watch replay you will figure that out.
<br>-why do I fell like playing on big billiard snooker table and not in a football stadium? No 3d grass in 2016?
<br>-90th minute goals scored.
<br>-Ronaldo finishes with stamina bar at around 36min of a football match. Wow so much for realism.
<br>-Limited ways in which you can score goals= too much scripting felt in gameplay.
<br>-lots of bugs cannot mention all of them.
<br>+ve
<br>-the only +ve in this game are sliding tackles which are helpful.
<br>So what kind of gameplay does PES 2016 has?
<br>Ans: It has become FIFA because they have too started concentrating only on online features and ruining the feel of actual football played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5541710">Expand</a></span>

Speaking of updates, the squads feature the roster of the 2014-15 season, something which is shameful ( Cech is still on the Chelsea team, Falcao at Man. U, ect). One can expect many unlicensed teams, but to not even have strips that are the same colour as the real teams is appalling. There are even fewer desirable teams than other versions of PES, with the exclusion of Bundesliga (except for 3 teams), particular Borrusia Dortmund being the most notable. Certain leagues are present (unlicensed may I add) that would not interest the average player, such as the Chilean league and the Championship. The game is also lacking many playable features, something which Fifa is not lacking. However, the actual gameplay and matches feel more engrossing and intense than Fifa but even that is stress inducing. It is way too easy to score and concede and sometimes feels like an arcade, scoring straight from kick off via a through ball is not uncommon. Goalkeepers are atrocious, they parry almost any ball into the box and any hard shot which is on target normally result in a goal. This was also present in the last iteration of PES I have played, 2008. The AI also seems to be lacking, as defenders fail to pick up runs and attackers are slow to react when in offiside positions. The only major positive in the whole game was the training modes, both skills and free training are enjoyable and improve your overall game. To summarize, this is an outdated, frustrating game that gets tiresome quickly. Do not think for even a second that Konami are any different from EA, they both share a common disregard for quality. At least EA have a glossy game that feels fully realised.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5518208">Expand</a></span>

Last two PES games I didn&apos;t like them, but this PES 16 is one of the best football game we&#x2019;ve played in the last then years. I only with FIFA 16 will &quot;feel&quot; like this and have at least same player and ball physics as this game have.</span>

<br>It addresses several important features that were starting to annoy me in PES 2015.
<br>First, in PES 2015, I got frustrated about being never being able to knock the ball of a computer opponent at higher levels. It meant I had to fall back and try to dispossess on the last line of defence, which got tiresome. In PES 2016, with some good timing and momentum, you have a sporting chance of dislodging the ball, even from top players. This makes the midfield battle much more interesting.
<br>Second, scoring in easier in PES 2016, and there are more random sequences, such as deflections. The easier scoring puts a higher premium on defending intelligently. But with the improved battle-for-the-ball mechanics, this adds to the excitement of defending too, as you can through good timing and sheer weight of bodies, can block even the best players. But if you get sloppy, you get punished though...as it should be.
<br>Third, in Master League, the trading mechanics are much less tedious, especially with regards to contract extensions.
<br>Overall, a much more fluid experience, where every goal seems different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5516190">Expand</a></span>

In fifa nowadays players run like robots plus u need a pc which should be way above their recommended specs cause if you don&apos;t it lags as hell. But on the other hand pes 2016 can run in a low end computer which is awesome for people who are not that rich.</span>

<br>So...

<br>I&apos;m going to play a lot with him. But I hope that Konami learn from our their mistakes. I support the release of the PC game (I paid full price for a game: 49 EUR) , but if in the next year Konami didn&apos;t give me the same versions as like what the next-gen consoles, I will be very angry...
<br>
<br>I hope this year we get some patches. It would be nice if the achievements, trading cards would be available in the future.

The graphics are washed-out, with strange lightning and with an overall strange, blurry result. Many of the main points listed on steam along with screenshots are not for the pc version. Many people says that gameplay is much more important than the looks. I am too believe in this. With the little bit better master league and the multiple second leagues introduced last year this year I might finally have some fun after all.
<br>But, this is just like last year. I do not feel, that the pc version performs well gameplay wise. Moreover, I feel it is closer to fifa than ever before. CPU does not do anything, only scores goals and intercepts passes. I do not feel, that it is struggling getting the ball into my box. When it wants it scores with the least number of attacks. I have the feeling that the cpu is playing with me, letting me score some, passing a bit, but in the end it is laughing in my face as it is scoring from a 5 second attack. This is the reason I do not play fifa anymore. The predictability. When I feel that I cannot do anything to avoid conceding a goal, it is beyond my control. And, it happens a lot of the time, and it gets frustrating very quickly. Top class defenders leave their positions often under the cpu control, on the attacks the automatic cursor changer switches to wrong player, etc. It is not smooth, not perfect, it is far from it. I played a few dozen matches, but none of them was 0-0. Usually, 5 goals at least being scored. Defense is useless in this state.
<br>Overall, this game in its current version is bugged mess. Also, I did not play the PS4 version of the game, but if the gameplay is the same, then this is my opinion on that one too.
<br>
<br>My points:
<br>+ Nice face textures
<br>+ New physics engine with dynamic player contacts
<br>+ Better master league
<br>+ ML negotiation system is better than the old ones, and harder than last year&apos;s
<br>- PC version is subpar
<br>- Gameplay is still unfair and frustrating at times
<br>- Too easy to score goals from a few positions
<br>- Keeper performance and animation is bad at close range
<br>- Control and AI bugs
<br>- ML is still far from great, nowhere close to the level of fifa 08
<br>- I do not like the old, ugly, badly named ml youth players
<br>- Many (many) outdated transfers on release</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5493578">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay itself, animations, passes, shots, players movement, etc ... are all good.
<br>
<br>In PES 2016 the players are not so mobile like in FIFA, but that&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing. Matches are more strategic. Worse it is with the pace of the game. The pace of play in PES 2016 is almost always the same. Not too fast or slow. It is only normal. In FIFA this year, you can play quickly, slowly, carefully, etc... and your players will fit your gameplay automatically.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, the players in PES their contact with the pitch and the ball is more heavy and realistic.
<br>
<br>Big disappointment for me is that, like last year, this year the PC version of the game is technically and graphically much worse than the PS 4 version for example. PC version is more of a clone PS 3 version.
<br>This is unacceptable and it is one big betrayal from KONAMI. It will definitely not support the saleability. For me personally, it is one of the decisive factors why not buy the game.
<br>
<br>I do not recommend you buy PES 2016 because FIFA 16 is better in vast number of game aspects.
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>- Gameplay is generally good and fun
<br>- The players on the pitch and their contact with the balloon is heavy and realistic
<br>- Sound, Stadiums and atmosphere of matches is very good
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>- Some aspects of the game are not very good (very short passing, centers, penalties, the pace of the game is constant rather than dynamic)
<br>- Lack of licenses (For example Premier League) greatly detracts from the overall quality of the game. Earlier years, the PES had better gameplay than FIFA and we could close both eyes over the licenses . But nowadays licences are great weakness of PES
<br>- The PC version is a port from the Playstation 3 version
<br>- Menus are ugly</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5496751">Expand</a></span>

There is always room for improvements though, I think Konami could take some ideas from NBA 2K Sports for ML mode, they should also get Gary Neville for commentary... I think we need a database to work with for players, D.O.B, Contract, Loans etc. should be updated like real life, aslo the overall price of players should be realistic</span>

Pre-game formalities are beautifully showcased.Goalkeepers are sometimes good sometimes pretty horrible while shot stopping.More celebrations should be added to the existing ones. MyClub is a very good feature in PES with its news page &amp; transfer window graphics during the managerial mode.All in all PES 2016 has done an okay job but should do  away with the existing problems to overtake FIFA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=5866490">Expand</a></span>

Let me explain with an example: I&apos;m on master league, 2nd season, with UD Almeria on the Spanish Primera Division. I&apos;ve been playing on Top Player, and with about 22 or 23 games gone, I&apos;m in 5th place, fighting for a place in the UCL. When I play against a team in the Top 10, I usually end up winning or fighting for it and making great games, at least. Barcelona had 19 wins in 19 games (!), 3rd best attack, best defence, and I beat them on their home ground 3-1! Real Madrid is in 2nd place with the 2nd best attack (the best attack is mine) and I drew on their home ground 1-1. However, when I play against a team from the 2nd half of the classification, it&apos;s guaranteed that I&apos;ll have a hard, hard time. It&apos;s almost impossible to draw against them, let alone win. I played against Levante, in last place, I lost 3-1. Played against Villareal, 19th place, lost 2-1, without almost touching the ball. Played against Sevilla, 14th place, I lost at home 3-0 and they had 69% ball possession!!! Barcelona (Barcelona, for God&apos;s sake!) only had 53 when they beat me 3-2 in my first game against them. Against Barcelona I had a close game, with plenty of shots and attacks. Against Sevilla I only got the ball when they failed a shot! Literally! It was absolutely impossible to take the ball away from them. They passed it around as if they were Barcelona or Bayern Munich. It&apos;s ridiculous. I find myself in a position where everytime I play against a team in 15 or 16th, I know I&apos;m going to lose points, and everytime I play a team in 3rd or 4th place, I know I&apos;ll probably win the match. Besides, when I&apos;m playing against &quot;normal&quot; teams (teams against which I can actually play and touch the ball), they are pretty easy to handle and to score against. However, immediately after I score my 1st goal, they start playing like they are possessed or something, and it doesn&apos;t stop untill they score a goal. They win every rebound, they get every pass right, they intercept all of my passes... Sometimes it genuinely looks like the game is programmed so that it is impossible for me to play normally, because the ball ALWAYS ends up on their feet, no matter what I do. It seems like they are a completely different team. Then, after they score, all goes back to normal. But then, when I score another goal... madness once again. And I didn&apos;t even speak about the useless goalkeepers and the close to useless defenders... But I think everyone will get my point.
<br>
<br>They should correct this for the next game. I want to do my best against teams like Bar&#xE7;a, Madrid, Manchester City, Juventus. If I lose the game and if they trash me, fair enough. But if those teams don&apos;t do that, and instead I get trashed by teams like Eibar, Cordoba, Frosinone or something like that, it&apos;s not nice nor realistic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6410596">Expand</a></span>
