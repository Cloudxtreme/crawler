<br>
<br>If you play this game as a game  particularly if you expect a challenging puzzle game  you&apos;re going to be disappointed.  Whereas if you liked games like Dear Esther then Papo &amp; Yo will probably be right up your alley.
<br>
<br>The graphics are functional but scarcely stress the Unreal Engine.  The sound is a bit lackluster and the puzzles themselves are not logical (though neither are they difficult).  Basically push a white glowy thing which will enable you to push another white glowy thing or lead the monster to a white glowy thing.
<br>
<br>You will not be taxed by this and if you find yourself stuck then it&apos;s probably because you haven&apos;t run to the right area yet.  I don&apos;t really have a problem with this as it allows the story to flow without frustration.
<br>
<br>Papa &amp; Yo is a pretty solid game; I&apos;ve had only two technical issues: once it&apos;s locked up my PC entirely requiring a reboot and then I&apos;ve gotten stuck in a wall on moving block.  I&apos;d rate it a pretty solid 65/100 but was tempted to give it a 0.  A voter block looks to be artificially inflating the user scores;  at the time of writing only 7 of the 17 user reviews really looked legitimate.
<br>
<br>Finally is it worth your money?  Yes I think so.  Not all game can  or should  be massive AAA titles.  Papo &amp; Yo has it&apos;s niche and it fills it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papo-yo/user-reviews?user_review_id=3390875">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t mind the easy puzzles here, because they do not break the experience. The symbolism of the story is very easy to understand, but that is not a problem as it gives a lot to the atmosphere.

That aspect of it was quite interesting to me personally, but I also support the idea of games moving into more difficult narrative and emotional territory. I think I read that this was actually autobiographical on part of one of the developers  making this game a risky proposition commercially and something very raw and close to someone&apos;s heart, creatively.
<br>
<br>The gameworld is quite beautiful, without being graphically impressive  it is just nicely, nicely designed. Although the 3D environments were probably quite simple to put together  and there are a lot of copied and pasted houses on show  they are imaginative and clever. Things like (analog) levers that fold the entire map in on itself, or flexible ramps made out of flying houses. It should manage to put a smile on your face.
<br>
<br>The reason I give Papo &amp; Yo quite a low rating is that it really boils down to a few (10?) extremely easy puzzles slotted into an extremely basic story. It would have been quite okay to quadruple the length of this game, stretch a few of the basic mechanics (freeform, epic-scale, physics puzzler!) into more challenging puzzles and pick up the story again a bit later after you&apos;ve had some fun levitating huge buildings in from the horizon to land on top of tiny frogs  or some such.
<br>
<br>The story is delivered so honestly that it can&apos;t be faulted for laying it on thick. But it&apos;s the sort of story that someone who hadn&apos;t suffered parental alcohol abuse would tell about parental alcohol abuse... but being told by someone who had. The most poignant moment in the game for me wasn&apos;t in the story at all  it was when you kick a football at Monster, and just for a moment he snaps out of being a lumbering, coconut-chomping cartoon character and patiently throws the ball back to you, like a Dad.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is maybe a 2-hour wonder for younger players. If I was an alcoholic father, I would buy this game for my children so they knew what to do with me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papo-yo/user-reviews?user_review_id=3445661">Expand</a></span>

Maybe it&apos;s not fair to the game, but frustration at knowing what to do but being unable to catch the frogs fast enough makes me rage a bit, and that&apos;s just not fun.  It bugs me that I won&apos;t see the end, but, oh well.  I don&apos;t know why I can&apos;t grab the frogs fast enough here - they just take off and run straight for monster at breakneck speed before I can orient myself after the animation.  It seems like most other people think this game is too easy, but I&apos;m just frustrated at it at the moment.  Prior to this the game had lost my interest half-way through and I was just now coming back to try to finish it after many months away.  I guess it&apos;s kindof one of those games that I&apos;d call &quot;decent&quot; up to that point, but it didn&apos;t grab me and keep me coming back based on the long break before coming back.  I feel like production values are pretty good.  Visuals and world are intriguing, and sound is nice.  I like games that let you explore, and this game has elements of that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papo-yo/user-reviews?user_review_id=5236105">Expand</a></span>

Si no lo has visto busca alguna conferencia en Youtube de su creador Vander Caballero pero es muy emocionante. La mec&#xE1;nica y los gr&#xE1;ficos est&#xE1;n muy bien, pero el sustrato es lo mejor. Buena compra.</span>

<br>I often write that good mechanics are paramount for a good game, yet I make an exception here. Not that the mechanics are bad, but they are nothing new or special. Instead, the setting and the narrative are so enthralling that they compelled me to overcome my general disdain for jumping from one block to another. To the point that I ignored my usual inability in these matters and, for once, completed this parkours, not for the joys of achievement (I couldn&apos;t care less) but to know its universe.
<br>
<br>I concur with all reviews calling Papo &amp; Yo emotional and artistic. Despite its linearity, this is also a true exploration. There are very few games I&apos;ve ever replayed, but I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ll replay this one some day in the future.
<br>
<br>Instant classic. You should feel from the very start if you&apos;re going to enjoy it or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papo-yo/user-reviews?user_review_id=6466039">Expand</a></span>

This game dredged up memories of a time when I had to let go of a best friend of mine because of illegal drug use. It was alcohol specifically, that made me decide. In the moment when he broke into a liquor cabinet and began to get drunk, (while of course being underage.), I was afraid. I let him get drunker and drunker, and when he was stumbling around and falling down, I got in my car, (which had his stuff and the stuff of the people who were with us.)  and I left and drove to his parents house. I deposited everyone&apos;s stuff on the front porch and rang the doorbell and told his dad where he was and what he was doing. Afterwords, I never looked back. I haven&apos;t seen him in years now, nor do I want to, but I just know, if I saw him again I could become friends again with him easily. But I took the harder route of not forgiving him and simply letting him go. The ending of Papo and Yo was a metaphor for an actual moment in my life, and it was one of  if not THE most, moving ending to a video game I have ever seen. Millage may vary for other people, but at least for me, I felt very moved. It was just like revisiting that moment again, but this time, I was able to let go more easily. This is a game that simply must be played. It is a beautiful piece of art.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papo-yo/user-reviews?user_review_id=3145690">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ll regret the difficulty of puzzles which are too easy, and the game duration, I completed it in less than 3 hours...I just want more of this game, with harder puzzles for a deeper experience.</span>

<br>But NEVER mind, it&apos;s a game and a wonderful one indeed. The more I play it, the more convinced I am that our young poor mistreated boy never touched alcohol, having seen what it did to his father,  but instead ventured into the wonderful world of hallucinogenics  You pull a rope and a building magically pulls out, morphs or generally transforms itself in a most pleasing and highly psychedelic manner.
<br>The art direction alone is worth the entry prize, but it&apos;s also a very pleasing game to play.
<br>Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papo-yo/user-reviews?user_review_id=3126444">Expand</a></span>

The game explores the fearful, codependent relationship of a child living with an alcoholic father. As an adult child of an abusive parent, I can interpret it as an intimate illustration of my own personal journey. The interaction of the player with Monster is like therapy, in the same way that therapists use roleplay techniques that encourage you to the difficult but necessary task of facing your pain, processing your feelings about it, &amp; moving past it into the freedom of who you are meant to be.
<br>
<br>The codependent relationship of Monster &amp; Quico may anger someone who is lucky enough to have grown up in a happy home. The child depends upon Monster for survival, but he must also take care of the wounded parent &amp; serve to meet the parent&apos;s emotional needs at the expense of his own innocence and safety. Monster is docile &amp; uninterested in Quico except for how Quico may care for him, but he goes out of his way to rescue Quico if needed. I like this because it is an example of the confusion created by the abuser, who tempers his abuse with kindness. The player is always on edge because Monster&apos;s kindness turns to fury as the whole world turns dark &amp; red as he explodes into a flaming rage, pouring out all of his fury on the child, cruelly battering him, taking away his only comforts, and then going back to his docile self with no regard for what he has done, or what Quico has lost.
<br>
<br>The end of the game is a bittersweet, emotional sense of closure. The whole environment, a childlike world inside Quico&apos;s mind, begins to fall apart as the player begins to face the truth of his situation, &amp; there is nothing left but to face all the pain straight on. There is no violence, no revenge. I would suspect that acting on your anger towards your abusive parent would turn you into a monster yourself. But you must do something else, which is even more emotionally difficult, but altogether right. I had to lay my controller down and cry with my head in my hands when I realized what I had to do. It was a raw moment of pure grief. In that moment it was no longer about the game, but about my own abusive parent who is incapable of changing, &amp; the realization that there is only one choice for me in order to be whole and move on. The bravery of acting out my only choice at the end gave me the bravery to do the same in my life.
<br>
<br>I am going to be ok.
<br>
<br>Papo &amp; Yo is the vulnerable expression of someone who has walked the same difficult path before me &amp; is not only ok, but turned it into a passion to make something authentic and beautiful. It fills me to the brim with hope in more than one way. When I graduated high school seven years ago, I played ICO, and knew I wanted to be a game designer. I knew I had talent, potential, &amp; a special artistic vision. I understood the unexplored possibilities of game design as an expressive art medium. I wanted to create games that gently stirred something deep in the player in same way that music, books, &amp; film does, but with the element of interaction that emotionally engages the viewer in a way that only games can. I wanted to give children hope, alone and cut off from all help except for the entertainment that they escape into, just as I did. But at the time there was little to nothing like that in the industry. I could accomplish little for myself while I was still taking care of my Monster. I spent my whole 20&apos;s trying to save my monster.
<br>
<br>But now, oh now! I have let my Monster go! And brave developers like Minority are blazing a trail in the industry with authentic games that sell, proving that games like just like this one are marketable. When I am ready, there will be a place for me. I&apos;m grateful and excited to begin a new journey to turn my renewed passion into something that will touch people&apos;s lives who might not find the hope they need in any other way.
<br>
<br>If you have been fortunate enough to grow up in a happy home and have difficulty relating to this game, then that&apos;s alright. If you haven&apos;t been abused, the game is not going to intensely effect you if you cannot relate. It may feel like just another platformer (with beautiful reproductions of actual street art around the world, whimsical environments, and a gorgeous soundtrack). To be honest, that is a good thing. Papo &amp; Yo isn&apos;t so much about entertaining you as it is about creating awareness &amp; hope for those who are abused, on a medium that is safe &amp; accessible to children. But for those of us who are stuck, for those of us who are afraid of the rage that comes when we regain what was taken from us, for those of us who know loss &amp; loneliness &amp; fear from the very one who is supposed to love us, this game is precious. It reminds us of our self worth. It reminds us of our capacity to individuate from our abusers, to let go, &amp; to be whole.
<br>
<br>I am no longer hiding in a closet, alone &amp; afraid. I am healing, &amp; I am strong.
<br>
<br>Thank you, Minority.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papo-yo/user-reviews?user_review_id=3168312">Expand</a></span>

[Save] This game saves automatically and works well [Keys] are WASD and cannot be remapped. Normally this would upset the hell out of me but it all worked out Oll Korrect [Graphics] To be honest I played this on a 6-7 year old laptop running XP because I was on the road. There were a few choppy bits at times  but I survived and enjoyed the game. [Audio] Hey I love music and nice sound. This game has great music and great sound which are mellow between the green frogs [Compliments] I think these developers are going to surprise us big next time. They are on my watch list.

<br>If you don&apos;t mind a bit crappy mechanics, pretending that they are more important than the story, boring tasks and puzzles, or not fitting to this kind of game graphics, you should definitely give it a try, cause there aren&apos;t many games about child&apos;s point of view.</span>

Also, I am glad that they chose third person for a game like this, where you really get to know the character. Speaking of which, the story in this game is perfect. The player has to really get into the game and piece the puzzle together, an aspect that I think is missing in games today. Overall, Papo &amp; Yo is definitely worth the play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papo-yo/user-reviews?user_review_id=3913364">Expand</a></span>

<br>Most of the gameplay is simple puzzle platforming, but the style and atmosphere stops it from getting boring. The puzzles are well designed but fairly casual, so don&apos;t expect a challenge. This game would be suitable for young children, although they may not understand the adult message (which is fine).

<br>After enjoying &#x201C;Brothers &#x2013; A tale of two sons&#x201D; (an amazing indie game), I searched for some more indie games that I hoped would be similar, and found this. While Papo &amp; Yo is not as good as Brothers, it is still decent and I recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papo-yo/user-reviews?user_review_id=6331951">Expand</a></span>

<br>The mechanics and puzzles are very simple, you will not get stuck, frustrated by angry and wanting to quit the game or looking for some walkthrough. You will be challenged just a few times, and just for a few minutes each time, bounded to the feeling of keep on doing it to know a little more about that story.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a metaphoric world created by the suffer and desires of a boy, that leads you to join him on his quest to help a friend.

Si no lo has visto busca alguna conferencia en Youtube de su creador Vander Caballero pero es muy emocionante. La mec&#xE1;nica y los gr&#xE1;ficos est&#xE1;n muy bien, pero el sustrato es lo mejor. Buena compra.</span>
