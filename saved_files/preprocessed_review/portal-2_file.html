Funny ,great puzzles , and a great new song by Jonathan Coulton. Then the addition of challenge maps , commentary on all levels with insight on the creation of the game , a Co-Op campaign , and Co-Op DLC just solidified this as one of Valve&apos;s Greatest Achievements.</span>

For one thing, the XBOX version which I purchased doesn&apos;t have any DLC, and even if it did, as I understand it offers nothing that I would feel even the slightest bit compelled to purchase. It&apos;s ignorant to resent Valve for taking the money of people who are willing to give it to them simply because you&apos;re not willing. Get a job, kids...or stop wanting silly hats.<br><br>As for the actual merits of the game, so far it&apos;s got everything I loved about the original, but more and better. The difficulty of the first 4 hours could be increased somewhat, but I suspect that&apos;s only because I enjoyed the first game so thoroughly that it has made &quot;portalthinking&quot; more natural for me. For a new player, the difficulty is likely spot on.<br><br>As for the length, I&apos;m 4.5 hours into single player mode and I&apos;ve only had any significant delays in one room which left me somewhat stumped for no more than 10 minutes. If anyone is clearing it in 4 hours or less, they already know the solutions to all the rooms and are simply sprinting thru each level without taking time to actually look around or listen to dialogue. Besides, if the game actually deserved a 0 rating, &quot;too short&quot; wouldn&apos;t be a flaw; it would be a blessing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1586428">Expand</a></span>

But the fact that it&apos;s still got so many positive reviews shows how many people have enjoyed this game.<br><br>True there may be some people who expected the game to be longer, but I think the length is just right. Unless your racing through the game you wont complete it in 4 hours. Hell, I bet you couldn&apos;t even if you did race through, so far most people seem to complete it in about 6-8 hours. That&apos;s just the single player, the Co-op campaign is all original too and adds around 5 hours of content, or so I&apos;ve heard, although I&apos;ve not completed that yet.<br><br>The &apos;dlc&apos; people complain about are all cosmetic and don&apos;t effect game play at all, I might be bothered if they were selling extra maps on there on day 1, but they aren&apos;t. I bet no one would have minded if these things were never available at all anyway. I sure wouldn&apos;t care, but good on Valve if they can make some extra money out of dumb asses. More money to make great games, they are a business at the end of the day. It&apos;s not effecting me and the majority of other players, so why complain?<br><br>I enjoyed every second of the Single player, there was no need for it to be longer, it would only be more of the same mechanics. They paced the introduction of all of the new mechanics nicely so the gameplay didn&apos;t become stale at all. I loved the story, especially the dialogue which was hilarious at times and kept me interested the whole way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1587651">Expand</a></span>

I am disappointed with the number of people who have complained because A) they think the game is to short and B) they bought DLC obviously selling &apos;trivial&apos; content and C) they believe the visuals are poor.<br><br>Before I discuss those two points I want to say why I think this is game is incredible, firstly it succeeds in being a great sequel, it&apos;s added loads of new gameplay mechanics to freshen up the puzzles and gameplay and hasn&apos;t tainted the original essence of its predecessor. The production values are astounding there are huge set pieces, stunning effects and some of the best voice acting i&apos;ve ever heard in a game from the cast, particularly Stephen Merchant for his excellent performance as the babbling Wheatley and Ellen McLain returns scary as ever as everyones favourite AI baddy GLADOS.<br><br>Now to comment on the three main criticisms i&apos;ve seen. The singleplayer took many hours for me to play (at least 7 hours) and I haven&apos;t even touched the cooperative mode either which is sure to take several hours as well. The day 1 dlc is quite obviously not meant to &quot;extend play&quot; and is instead meant for novelty, also you can buy all the dlc in a bundle for about a quarter of the price than if you bought each item separately (if you still bought it and feel cheated then your too stupid to be playing this game). Finally, while the source engine is indeed quite old, even on my moderately powered laptop the game certainly looked impressive (admittedly the framerate did falter during &apos;busy&apos; segments of the game) and those of you with more powerful computers and the people who will buy the console versions will enjoy the game looking even better.<br><br>In conclusion, Portal 2 is a must buy this year, a certain contender for game of the year (if only Mass Effect 3 wasn&apos;t coming out this year), the game is smart, clever, well designed and a joy to play and I highly recommend picking it up but please if you haven&apos;t already please play the first game because it makes the experience that much better.<br><br>P.S. The ending is a great one, I can&apos;t believe some people didn&apos;t like it, It will leave you wanting more is all i&apos;m going to say</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1577505">Expand</a></span>

All the pieces of DLC are purely cosmetic changes for the multiplayer characters and you&apos;re not left out in the cold for not being able to afford a new paint job. None the less, the DLC is the reason I&apos;m not giving the game a 10. It left a sour taste in a lot of people&apos;s mouths, but it doesn&apos;t overly impact the quality of the experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1577518">Expand</a></span>

Can be earned playing the videogame.<br>Simple as that.<br><br>What you are seeing here is nothing more then the manifestation of an anonymous image board that believes they are more powerful, well reasoned and knowledgeable than pretty much anyone else who&apos;s ever stepped within 30 feet of their personal computer.<br><br>Anyone knows their way around the internet is already well aware that the people who frequent ****&apos;s /v/ videogames, contains some of the most foul mouthed, and unreasonable human beings to ever grace out planet.<br><br>So make no mistake when you visit metacritic, and you see good games like Dragon Age II, and Portal 2 being 0&apos;d down into obscurity.<br>They will say things like &quot;Well its not right to give the game a perfect 10!! It doesn&apos;t deserve it!&quot;<br><br>Guess what /v/ - Videogames, from ****. It doesn&apos;t deserve a 0 either, you unpleasable misinformed children. What you are doing is blatant, foul, not only are you attempting to damage the face of portal 2 and valve, but your attacks also are sometimes directly at Gabe Newell himself.  Ordinary I wouldn&apos;t bat an eye last at a few customers who had a bad mishap with a videogame, and voted it down because of it.<br><br>However there is zero justification for this. It is simply nothing more than an organized attack on Valve, and Portal 2.<br>****&apos;s /v/ - videogames almost got away with this with Dragon Age II, and even David Gaider himself called out **** for this, and they cried wolf, and claimed they had nothing to do with this, and that it was &quot;the will of the people/customer&quot; However this was never the case, and the same applies here.<br>What you are seeing is nothing more than an organized assault on metacritics users, and the developers who aim to deliver us videogames.  ****s children believe if they shout loud enough and make enough 10 minute emails, and spam here with 0&apos;s  they will be able to down out the people who enjoyed this game, and make it look like this game is a total abomination.<br>It simply is not.<br>If you have ever been iffy about professional reviewers, today isn&apos;t the day to second guess.<br>They weren&apos;t making this up when they said this game is fantastic.<br><br>This is nothing more than a childish, and bandwagon state of affairs that only shows the true face of what David Gaider and dragon age II were facing on metacritic. Now it is simply time for Valve, one of the most respected PC platform champions to face the the wrath of shouting children from ****&apos;s /v/- videogames.<br><br>I hope you have taken the time to read this, and now realize that these user scores simply can no longer be taken seriously, as their innocents, and validity has been robbed from the users, and meta critic.<br><br>This is not only a sad day for gamers, but is the face of shame **** brings upon us when we realize we have to play online with these fools.<br><br>Thanks for your time.<br>~RealDeal7</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1577623">Expand</a></span>

Now, I don&apos;t know this person, and don&apos;t remember ever even adding him but I joined him anyway. We spent the next 7 hours playing into the dawn. There&apos;s no better feeling then going through co-op mode with a new friends, raging when spamming &quot;LOOK&quot; to your partner only yields blank stares and spastic jumps, laughing when you both realize that the hardest puzzle that you&apos;ve been stuck on for the last hour had the simplest solution. I thought co-op was going to be the downside to this game, but it was actually it&apos;s saving grace.  The game overall is...breath taking. The levels, the characters. Even though there&apos;s no real story you still feel a sort of connection to the robot friends., especially when that robot friend is an actual, new friend you just met. The DLC I have no problem with. Obnoxious paint schemes, silly hats, high-fives; all cosmetic so I don&apos;t care. Most items are achievable through playing the game and getting achievements which makes it a good incentive system. If people want to spend money on silly hats then I don&apos;t care, I take solace in knowing that these silly hat wearers are paying for my future free updates and maps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1576851">Expand</a></span>

Portals are just means to tell and advance that story.  The action, beautifully-paced and driven by a dark and ominous soundtrack, invokes memories of Half-Life 2.  The writing and voice acting are superb, with plenty of comic relief to put a smile on your face.  While it&apos;s not the revolution HL2 was, it&apos;s as every  bit a masterpiece in game design.   Players looking for hardcore dexterity-based puzzles may be disappointed.  Those of us who enjoy all aspects of gaming will cherish Portal 2 as an instant classic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1579220">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not going to go on forever about how the core gameplay and whatnot is great, because the pre-launch hype covered it well enough with its teasers, etc.
<br>
<br>However, I&apos;d like to point out something very important: The claim of the game lasting four hours is FALSE. Your first run through should last you at least 6 hours, probably 7 or maybe 8 if you get stuck a couple of times and take your time exploring the scenes. And that&apos;s not counting the multiplayer. Oh, and don&apos;t forget how Valve are - as usual - very friendly to custom mappers, and once the SDK releases there surely will be lots of new custom content, if their past releases are anything to go by.
<br>
<br>Some people have complained about the in-game store. This is completely ridiculous, as there is a simple way to fix it: Don&apos;t buy stuff! It&apos;s all cosmetic, and it&apos;s not like there&apos;s room to show off like in TF2, which further defeats the point of buying items at all. This means that, really, there should be no reason to be bothered by the store. In fact, you can choose to completely ignore it, thus there is no reason to include it in the overall evaluation of the game. Letting such a small problem ruin the game for you is foolish and childish.
<br>
<br>One complaint I find very valid is the fact that the ARG helped very little in boosting the game&apos;s speed of launch. However, this has NOTHING to do with the quality of Portal 2 as a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1576487">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s Portal, totally revamped and made into a true game, and is a shining example of Valve&apos;s quality. While the puzzles are a little harder, and there are more elements to work with as you progress like the repulsion gel, they don&apos;t take that long to figure out. It is a lot longer than the original, 4 hours in and it doesn&apos;t seem like the end is in sight. With twists in the plot, beautiful graphics, funny dialogue, and gameplay you won&apos;t forget, simply look no further. Ignore the moronic whinging by the trolls, you will thoroughly enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1578109">Expand</a></span>

One of the greatest carry-overs from the origional is the fantastic writing, I was genuinely laughing throughout and the performaces behind the voices were amongst the best I have ever heard.

Nothing that anyone needs to buy to enjoy the best game in long times! The humor, teh art direction and the music fit so perfectly together that it creates a really intense and enjoyable experience. And this game is not really 4 hours, more like 7...</span>

The complaints of a DLC store don&apos;t actually mean the game ITSELF is bad. They&apos;re just the kind of people who like to **** about things like this, even though THEY DON&apos;T NEED WHAT&apos;S IN THE STORE AT ALL. It could not exist at all, and people get none of what&apos;s for sale, and nobody would be complaining. But holy **** if Valve is to offer some extra content that ISN&apos;T all free for once, and people get pissy. The actual DLC content, meaning more playtime, will still be free. But Valve has to look for reliable ways to make long-term money off of games. Valve&apos;s development times are long, and the games all drop to the $15-20 range rather quickly, with $5 sales happening often. They have to profit to be able to grow, and accomplish more. That doesn&apos;t mean the Valve office is going to get gold toilets. But it does mean they can hire more people, improve Steam further, keep things running smoother, and develop games with a larger overall team to get more work done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1575284">Expand</a></span>

But the gaming community is being fickle and whiny (especially after the ARG stunt). Despite what these self entitles day one reviewing crybabys will have you believe, Portal 2 is a great game. There is just  no way to justify giving it a 0 or a 3. Yes there is day one DLC, that is OPTIONAL. Yes you may have found the campaign short, but you&apos;re probably better at puzzle solving than most. Yes the visuals may not be Crysis material, but it&apos;s available multiplat and accessible to those who don&apos;t have beast PCs.<br>I am unbelievably disappointed in the gaming community, and this backlash will surely have consequences. Valve was already a bashful giant of gaming and arguably one of the last great developers. I fear that this unwarranted backlash may cause them to be much more careful and lose some of their personality in the process. Read the rest of the 0-5 reviews and you will realize WHO exactly is giving the BS reviews. I beg you to reconsider listening to them before checking the game out yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1574653">Expand</a></span>

Although i also think that dlcs, ingame shops, console versions and the like are absolutely unacceptable, i will ignore them for my rating of the game. The game is nearly perfect and deserves a 10.

Why are there so many (or so few, but with lots of accounts and too much free time) people with apparent vendettas against Valve?  The &quot;DLC&quot; that these whiners are crying about in no way affects game play.  They are hats and little dances for Co-Op mode.  If you don&apos;t want them, don&apos;t buy them.  It almost seems like they were put in as a joke anyway.  Did these crybabies even try the Co-Op mode?  As for the game engine, if they would trade in their 15&quot; CRT monitors for something a little bigger and newer, they could see the game with a better resolution.  Also, while you&apos;re at it, plop down another $50 to get a decent budget video card so you can play at something above minimum.  And finally, as for a console port: Clearly, these trolls have not ever played an actual console port, such as Borderlands.<br><br>Overall, i think Valve has outdone themselves once again.

Granted, you don&apos;t have to like the idea of such purchasable in-game items, but it&apos;s definitely not any additional content that people are missing out on if they don&apos;t pay for it, it&apos;s just to change your appearance in coop mode. People should value this game for its perfect story, great humor and fun, instead of taking some minor flaws and making them into huge problems. This just seems to be hatred against Valve, for no apparent reason.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1573951">Expand</a></span>

Portal 2 is worth the full retail price. I pre-ordered it on Steam, got home from work today and played it for 6 hrs and still haven&apos;t finished the SP campaign but i&apos;m well into it enough to say that it is a definite 9/10. Same great dialogue, character development, tantalising hints of a greater and much more epic story that links Aperture Science to the Half Life canon, without being too familiar. If anything this was it&apos;s biggest threat, being so familiar that people playing Portal 1 community maps would find Portal 2 disinteresting, but I personally found it refreshing at times and also very much like I was returning home at others. If you liked the Portal Universe you glimpsed previously, then you will definitely enjoy this. Steam version is the best version as always. Ignore the /v/ trolls. Runs flawlessly at 1920x1080 in vista on my q9450/260gtx. Great stuff GabeN. Cue &apos;jazz music&apos; as this level is quite a challenge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1574907">Expand</a></span>

The story also helps pad out the increased length of the game with enough twists and turns to keep the average player interested. whilst the trademark Portal humour kept me laughing throughout.<br><br>A great game that I would recommend to any fan of puzzle games, hell, i&apos;d recommend it to anyone really.<br><br>I&apos;d also like to make a note of this &apos;Day 1 DLC&apos; that everyone is talking about, they&apos;re on about purely cosmetic items earnable simply by playing co-op that has absolutely no bearing on actual game play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1573983">Expand</a></span>

It is exactly what i expect from something called portal 2; more of the familiar portal gameplay. Textures were a bit **** at times and loading screens are rampant, obvious signs of a console port, but nothing game breaking. The game has a &apos;hat store&apos; just like TF2 and if this was not included then you wouldnt see nearly as many low user scores here. The fact thats most amusing is that all these cosmetic items are usually unlocked with achievements, you would only pay if you were too lazy to just play game.  4.5 hours of gameplay and another 3 hours of a separate co op campaign is pretty good for $45.<br>This game does not deserve to be bashed the way is being bashed now, especially from people who haven&apos;t even played the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1574117">Expand</a></span>

Everything available in the store is able to be unlocked ingame for free, not to mention the fact it is all cosmetic, so there is actually no need for it.<br><br>The singleplayer games length is perfect. It is 6 hours at the very minimum (most people i know took a lot longer to finish it than this). Sure i could repeat it and finish it in 3-4 hours, but thats what happens when you repeat a puzzle game... Regardless, 6 hours of unique, funny, interesting, challenging game play is well worth the cost. I&apos;d prefer this over 30 hours of a drawn out, boring, repetitive game like nearly every other recent title i can think of, which is long for the sake of being long.<br><br>I highly recommend picking up this game, I fail to see how anyone could not enjoy this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1574070">Expand</a></span>

Maybe they&apos;re trolls who can&apos;t stand that this is an EXCELLENT GAME and that DRAGON AGE 2 SUCKS. Deal with it and move on. Yes PC gamer prefers Portal 2 and gave it an editor&apos;s pick unlike DA 2. Well, this is an absolutely amazing game and nobody should miss it. doubt it? read the reviews! how could it be bad with some many 100s? 10/10</span>

<br>Let me preface this by saying I could give less than two **** about the DLCs. I didn&apos;t even know they existed to begin with. Since I just finished the single player campaign, I feel ready to write this review. Why? Because honestly, the single player campaign was awesome. Ridiculously varied from the first game and insanely brilliant puzzles. A lot of people are complaining about the &quot;Please don&apos;t turn off your console&quot; dialogue that shows up when you are saving. I don&apos;t understand how people can be so immature about this. The entire game feels just as PC tailored as the previous game, and any other fantastic Valve creation. If that little line of dialogue is enough to piss you off, boy you sure haven&apos;t played the other PC to console games yet. And rest assured, there is NO cliffhanger ending for Portal 2; everything wraps up perfectly, as you will experience. Honestly, you would be doing yourself an incredible injustice to yourself to dismiss this game on such trivial grounds. One thing that is true however is that the campaign is short. I finished it in 3.9 hours according to Steam (though it&apos;s strange because I started at 10:30 pm and ended at 6:00). However, just like with CoD4, this campaign is intensely satisfying, and making it longer would have definitely killed the fun. Personally Portal 2 would have been well worth $60 (I got the PS3 version for $55 with $20 Amazon credit and played the Steam version) but that&apos;s just me. Regardless of how much you are willing to pay for it, I definitely recommend that you eventually play this game if you loved the first one like I did. It is a sequel that improves upon its predecessor in every way imaginable. (P.S. This game ran full res/high textures on my Atom 330/nVidia ION netbook so it should run well in most computers)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1573089">Expand</a></span>

Even the original Portal was all but defined by its tight focus and limited scale; it just executed on all those elements with a consistent, almost preternatural level of ingenuity and humor.  I use the somewhat dismissive &quot;just&quot; here because the challenges of following up something so inventive and so universally well-received are arguably greater than coming up with the core concept in the first place. The element of surprise was a significant factor in the impact of the original Portal, but going into Portal 2, you know how a portal gun works, you know that Aperture Science is essentially a less diabolical, but equally irresponsible counterpart to Half-Life&apos;s Black Mesa, and you know that GlaDOS likes testing, but loves murder.  With these known quantities in mind, Valve does about the smartest thing it can with a full-blown sequel to such an effectively minimalist package by tossing out many of the self-imposed restrictions of the original and largely ignoring the temptation to lean on lots of easy callbacks. What it lacks in the surprise punch the original packed, it makes up for with scope and scale, couching that now-familiar combination of deadpan humor and brain-boggling puzzles in a game that&apos;s significantly bigger and more robust in virtually every meaningful way, but without feeling any less dense.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1573833">Expand</a></span>

Slightly disappointed in Valve for including so much DLC on day one, especially considering they don&apos;t point out that most is unlockable in-game.  This doesn&apos;t warrant giving the game a low score.  Not by a long shot.</span>

Just finished the single player in one 7 hour sitting and could barely tear myself away the entire time. The writing was stunning and the game as a whole expanded on everything offered in the original Portal by leaps and bounds. I&apos;m disappointed to see many other users giving this game unfairly low scores because of day 1 DLC and a single bug where the save message displays &quot;do not turn off your console before save is completed&quot;. Valve explained on their forums that late in the development process it was easier to keep the message in when trying to obtain certificates from Sony and Microsoft in order to release the game, and it is forgivable that removing the message may have slipped under the developers radars. The DLC is purely cosmetic, doesn&apos;t affect the game in any way and is essentially just hats, paint skins and a few animations. I&apos;ve heard reports from people that achieving certain achievements in-game has actually helped to unlock some of the DLC for them, showing that it may be a similar system to items in TF2 where Valve has obviously taken the idea from.<br><br>The ARG marketing leading up to the release was a nice touch and really helped build up deserved hype for this excellent game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1573083">Expand</a></span>

The DLC is a completely extra thing that nobody could claim should have belonged in the base game. (You are really pissed about not getting beanie caps for your robots??? #firstworldproblems). Our community has gotten completely ridiculous in acting like if anybody wants money for anything, they must be evil. Well, we exchange money for things we like, and Portal 2 fits the bill.

NO ONE IS MAKING YOU BUY IT. Secondly the single player campaign is a good length, 3 times as long as the original and if you rush through it, you will miss so much the game has to offer. I found myself sitting still and listening or watching things going on because the game is so detailed and layered in terms of scripted background events and the dialogue itself is Class A comedy. Stephen Merchant and JK Simmons shine here. I feel like the game dragged in the middle, the new game play elements were hit and miss, the paint levels being somewhat more frustrating than they should have been but otherwise the level design is tight and smart. Really looking forward to the level editor. Load times have to be my biggest grievance against the game but when it does so much else right, I&apos;ll begrudge it these small issues.<br><br>Buy the game, ignore the DLC if you want, find a friend and play the co-op. And most of all, enjoy the game. Not many comedies are as funny as it and very few games are as intelligent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1572180">Expand</a></span>

I followed the whole ARG surrounding the game and was amazed at the effort that had been put into it. I got about 6-7 hours from the single player, which whilst I would have liked more, is what I expect from a modern day game and have yet to touch the CoOp. My main reason for buying was the single player and seeing what happened to Chell, the story line is quite well thought out and some of the puzzles are very interesting. The new elements (faith plates, different liquids and lasers among others) are fantastic and work really well. My reason for rating this an 8 is mainly the duration of singleplayer and the fact that there are day one DLC&apos;s for sale (I&apos;m not opposed to them however I do not support them). I&apos;m rather upset that they are charging for skins of the coop bots aswell as hats, it does make the game feel a bit like Team Fortress 2. In terms of presentation the graphics are pretty good, there&apos;s some blurry textures here and there but apart from that it looks great, the physics are superb and the music fits really well. All in all I can see myself getting around 15 or so hours out of this without modding etc (doing singleplayer, getting achivs and coop) but not much more than that. Would recommend it to anyone who liked portal but if you didn&apos;t then I really doubt this is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1573172">Expand</a></span>

That being you said you don&apos;t have to buy it and it is a fantastic game outside of that and Valve has always done a good job of pleasing its fans. Don&apos;t buy the dlc if you don&apos;t want it, the game itself is fantastic as is.</span>

The writing is the best I&apos;ve seen in a long time. The story is engaging and the tie-ins from the ARGs were great. Both of the characters really grow on you. Thumbs up!</span>

The whole concept of Aperture Science all abandoned and with a lot of vegetation growth only adds to the atmosphere. The story is confusing at first, but you&apos;ll pick up. Don&apos;t let the other user reviews let you think otherwise, this game is amazing. If you&apos;re new to Portal though, I suggest you play the first one then the second one. There&apos;s no DLC with this game at all, just some cosmetic skins for Co-Op. The skins change no game play and just add for decoration. This game deserves the score it got, it&apos;s fantastic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1571756">Expand</a></span>

You should simply ignore their blind hate, then pity their existence and move on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1572800">Expand</a></span>

It has been heard by many that most of the &quot;anticipated&quot; games have these terrible 0&apos;s and 1&apos;s. So here is the general metacritic public review rules to follow. ALWAYS ignore scores from 0-4. A game getting a 0-4 is impossible, unless the game itself is completely unplayable from the beginning of the game, the soundtracks are terrible, and the UIs are also terrible. (Gameplay includes anything in-game). DO NOT take 10&apos;s very seriously. Most of the times when people gives 10, it is from the hype that they just played it. HOWEVER, some games DO deserve the score 10. Just like Portal 2, it deserves the full mark, 10.<br><br>WHEN REVIEWING THE OR LOOKING AT REVIEWS,<br><br>The only legit reviews are these reviews that take an in-dept view of the gameplay, storyline, soundtrack, graphics and etc. Anything outside these are not an accurate review. Now time for my own review. This game, I can only say is one of the most brilliant game that I&apos;ve played in so many years. It has been too long ever since a game producing company has made a game that really focuses on storyline and dialog. After playing this, I noticed how Half-Life 2 looked so small compared to this. Any games out looked so small and unrivaled to this ultimated game. When ValvE says its they best game ever created, then it is the best game ever created. There is no game that outmatches the storyline of this game. While challenging indeed, they give you lines of dialog time by time to keep you active in-game. There are no timed pressured **** like some other games give. This is one of these games where you could relax, and make you brain fry depending on your intelligence. Thats singleplayer without spoil. Now about the co-op. I should say, co-op is a total brilliance. Unless you chose a terribly wrong partner, there wouldn&apos;t be any raging over why can&apos;t you do this and this. Rather than single player, co-op actually require you to think way out of the box. Of course, for creators, it is a pretty easier job to create a puzzle, but as more puzzles you solve, the harder it gets, even for the creator. I recommend you to play sp first before mp. The only reason is because there is s correlation between these 2 game modes. The graphics, it might not be a beast graphic, but I tell you, for a ten years old engine, they make some terribly good graphics. Every single textures are so clean, and the weapons are so shiny that you actually want to lick the **** out it. There are no major changes is game mechanics as it only gets better from the first one. And about the DLC ****. These are trolls. Don&apos;t listen to them. These of you who are new to valve&apos;s multiplayer such as TF2, they require you to pay for specific items you can get ( which doesn&apos;t affect gameplay) to customize yourself. However, it must be noted that these items can be gained for free by playing quite a lot of times. So don&apos;t waste your money there. Or, if you want support valve to make a better DLC, then do so. Portal 2 DLC comes out after L4D2 DLC. Also, just one reminder, don&apos;t rush the game. Go slowly and try to enjoy it. Total gaming hours including co-op: 15 Hours. Replayability: If your going for achievements -&gt; Tons    If your the type that just wants to play again -&gt; about 3-5 times. And Im probably sure, when DLC comes out, the fun just increases so much more.<br><br>Also to remind you, valve&apos;s DLCs are always free for PC. PS3 and XBOX360s are sometimes uncertain due to these corrupted company. But as far as I know, both console will have free DLC and PS3 now also supports steam, thus giving flexibility between PS3 and PC gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1571370">Expand</a></span>

The level design is very typical of Valve, very well executed and detailed with careful attention to even the littlest bits of foliage.  The ending is apparently very easy to misinterpret, as I&apos;ve seen quite a few people posting about how a sequel is inevitable but I really can&apos;t see that happening.  Portal 2 actually wraps up the Aperture storyline quite nicely in my opinion, but we&apos;ll see.<br><br>The game is definitely pretty lengthy compared to the first one, sporting two separate campaigns; Valve has publicly stated that the single player campaign is three times the length of the original, while the campaign for the co-op times at about twice the length of the original; having five times the content at a little over double the price seems like a very fair and generous trade off to me :)<br><br>Ignore the hate and definitely check this title out if you&apos;re a Valve fan, you won&apos;t be disappointed.  It&apos;s a shame a solid game can&apos;t be released anymore without a flood of miscreants who haven&apos;t even played the game rating it at a 0/10.

This is easily valves best game so far and it deserves a 9 and above....from the hilariously well written dialogue, to the awesome puzzles only console gamers cant figure out, to cross platform between the ps3 and pc, this game is marvelous.  The people complaining about the potato sack sale are complete retards.  you weren&apos;t forced to buy anything and the game was not delayed in any matter.  So for you to be complaining for a company to do marketing, then you have some serious issues.  Also, if you actually did the potato sack buy, you were rewarded, with a golden potato and the complete vale collection including PORTAL 2, so seriously, go whine somewhere else.  Valve did this to support indie developers and its a shame to see the pc gaming community behave like Microsoft in this regard and not help out with what valve did.  Its a sad day in pc gaming.  I, however, will continue to support Valve in every single game.  They have not disappointed me ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/portal-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1572842">Expand</a></span>
