You need to think really carefully what you do with your heroes and what weapon you choose against a specific enemy. Nowadays, there are hardly any games like this one - games that demand from player to use his brain and not to just randomly hit keys like in AAA titles and spam an enemy to death. It won&apos;t work in here so any average triple A game fan might get lost in here.
<br>
<br>What I think is the best in the game is difficulty curve, which makes it real and competitive through all the gameplay. You can&apos;t just create immortal team of super-hero characters with legendary weapons all -around that hack and slash through everything. Every man in your team is a living being that can get killed just like any other man if you get a little too careless in a dangerous situation. This aspect of the game makes many fights puzzles where you have to think what to do; wheather to make a spear wall formation against dire wolves or take strategic advatnage of terrain and place your soldiers on grass tiles in a swampy area just to make the enemy come there and ... get stuck swamp.
<br>
<br>Economy is also nicely done as it gives you some options to earn money; you can either sell loot from defeated foes; trade certain goods in specific areas for bigger profit or get quest rewards. Generally, if you think you will have no economic problems in here.
<br>
<br>If you like to use brain in games and think of fights like of puzzles and you are looking for a virtual challenge then this game is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-brothers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7187986">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It has a deep tactical level of play and you need to be able to react quickly to the changing tides of battle. Like with Darkest Dungeon, not every fight can be won and RNG is RNG. Sometimes you need to run away to save yourself. I guess some people can&apos;t handle that aspect of the game, just like some people can&apos;t handle Darkest Dungeon or the X-COM series.
<br>
<br>The game has over a 92% positive review score on Steam. Don&apos;t allow some people who are sour that they can&apos;t spam &quot;X&quot; to win at the game and upset that they actually have to do some tactical thinking keep you from giving a great indie game a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-brothers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7191960">Expand</a></span>

The map seems not exploited to its full potential and the game is lacking some end-game goals. Hope it will be improved with patches because the base game is solid.</span>

<br>The Con.
<br>- RNG may be fair BUT losing one of your man due to poor roll is much worse than your enemy losing one of theirs , because the enemy population do not follow any rules of growth; they are like grains of sand mites crawling all over the place, and are spontaneously generated all over the world, while good recruits are RARE, EXPENSIVE, HARD TO TRAIN and NOT EXPANDABLE (other RNG games allow for easier replacement of gd ppl as long as you have the resources, but not here), and thus an unlucky RNG for you is a Nuke in the face but a pinprick on the enemy&apos;s pinky. Despite much player feedback, devs are not responsive and slow to implement measures to allow for EASIER replacement of your men, which will allow for their death to be NOT SO FRUSTRATING (measure such as buying level with gold).
<br>
<br>Just this 1 con makes the game EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING (the MOST FRUSTRATING RNG game ever). Even though, in the game, there are nuggets of enjoyment, the PURE AGONY OF LOSING A HARD TO REPLACE dead men thanks to RNG devil COMPLETELY overshadows ALL that is good about this game. For this reason, DID NOT buy this game unless you wish to experience hell on earth.
<br>
<br>Oh, and did i mention that dead soldiers are hard to replace?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-brothers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7156282">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Compound that with the fact that the game is extremely stingy with giving the player resources to recoup from losses it either forces you to retire early or constantly redo saves which reduces the game to random number generator.  I think the endgame stuff (132 days) is designed to kill a handful of your veteran&apos;s (In my current save I have to take on 15 undead legionaries with necrosavants, honor guard, and undead priests in a god damn swamp)  and I get it your trying to make it gritty, but if you give the player no/very limited options to recoup than its an arbitrary middle finger and turns an otherwise fun game into an arbitrary frustrating waste of time. &quot;Rocks fall everyone dies&quot; in other words.
<br>
<br>TL:DR its gritty low fantasy XCOM set in medieval not Europe, with same intrinsic problems late game XCOM has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-brothers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7324339">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Context :
<br>You are the new leader of a medieval warband due to the former captain&apos;s death against bandits. You will recruit, equip, level and eventually burry your battle brothers during your travels in a world randomly generated at each new game, between the icy lands of the north to south&apos;s sandy beaches passing throw swamp and dark forests.
<br>
<br>In each worldmap (Mount&amp;Blade like), most of human cities and settlements are ruled by three noble houses, some are also independent, but all will offer you contracts more or less difficult to complete to earn reputation and gold.
<br>
<br>These contracts are very differents from one another, from caravan escort to orcish fights or graveyard exploration, on tacticals map depending on your location (forest, swamp, snow...).
<br>The combat system is very intuitive and tactical, specially recommended for those who like turn-based strategic games (like X-com but less inmersive).
<br>
<br>Your actions will determine your reputation. Will you be a cruel bandit or a noble mercenary ? Will you flee from battle to fight another day or die with honour ?
<br>
<br>Visual :
<br>See screenshots. The team&apos;s graphist is very talented. Arts are excellents and immerse player into game. I love style and textures, and specifically the days and nights effects traducing the time of the day from dawn to dust and vice versa.
<br>
<br>Audio :
<br>Just beautiful. Each ennemie has few specific musics.
<br>So with some experience you will know who is ambushing you just by listening ;)
<br>
<br>Gameplay :
<br>On the worldmap, if not paused, time is spending continuously during your actions (travel, camp, repairs, heal) with very nice visual effects. Your main job will be to take contracts, one contract at a time, in towns, castle and cities. Contracts are missions with a narrative context which if you take time to read, generate sometimes shivers or laughs. Suceed and will earn notorioty, gold and upgrade relationship with settlements.
<br>Gold is usefull to buy goods, food for your men, equip and heal them.
<br>Good relationship enables you to decrease marchant prices. Eventually a bad one will may end in a fight.
<br>Notorioty influence events ends or possibilities. Events are triggered depending on your action, the background of your men, their level, randomly... I let you discover those which are a good part of Battle Brother&apos;s richness.
<br>With all that you will mostly fight to level your men (if they survive) against abundance of ennemies (orcs, gobelins, bandits, knights, undead, ...). Each ennemy faction has its own tactics in battle and you&apos;ll have to adapt and prepare your men consequently. It is a nice challenge : panel of weapons, armors and skills will be the key to do so.
<br>Most of the time you will decide when and where you&apos;ll fight but not always due to night or surprise attack or ambush. Last but not least there are some dungeons to explore with legendary item as reward.
<br>
<br>As there is no really end to the game, as long as you survive, it&apos;s really great to play countless hours with the men you trained from their beginning to the mighty knight or agile bowman he has became (and you may cry their death).
<br>
<br>Cons :
<br>- Band limited, you will not able to rule a castle or manage anything different than your own warband.
<br>- No horses in a medieval game (wtf? ;).
<br>
<br>Pros :
<br>+ Very conscientious Devs listening to the community.
<br>+ Interesting skills-tree to develop your own tatics.
<br>+ Various ennemies (humans, beasts, greenskins, undead).
<br>+ Various armor, weapons, goods to trade or craft and more.
<br>+ No-end campaign or retire when you want (except premature death ;).
<br>+ Each game is unique.
<br>+ Donkeys !
<br>
<br>To conclude, Battle Brothers&apos; world is mainly unexplored, dark and full of terrors. If you like the visual and turn based tactical game with a deep RPG immersion do not hesitate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-brothers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7372425">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons: Too short, Gets too easy very fast when you get metal armor, Events are poorly done and way too short, leaves you with a &quot;meh&quot; feeling overall which is a shame because it had potential. It has no endgame at all... none. So don&apos;t expect to get more than a week out of it.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll just say the game started out strong then suddenly the difficulty fell off a cliff and everything got boring very fast. The worst was when the late game event started (orc invasion) I thought &quot;oh man things are going to get crazy now&quot;. Nah still pretty boring. Then suddenly 30 game days later the war was suddenly over and some soldiers passing me on the road from a faction I was strongly allied with (and killed oh I dunno a hundred or so orcs for) called me a wuss and I was given the option to fight them or retire (LOL ok) so I chose to fight them and the friggin game won&apos;t even let you do that... Also a 30 day orc war!? Really only 30 days!? Laaaaaame! Why would you shoot your endgame in the foot like that? Even if I wanted to hit the &quot;continue onward anyway&quot; button they made this stupid level 11 cap for all the mercs. Why? There&apos;s no point in continuing the game anyway after the orc invasion because other events just don&apos;t happen and by that time you&apos;re overpowering everyone with heavy armor anyway. The game woon&apos;t even let you imagine that there&apos;s endgame content because there&apos;s no treasure hunts for unique weapons even worse the unique weapons you do find are the most boring underwhelming things I&apos;ve ever seen... that&apos;s just laziness IMO. I&apos;m sorry but this game is completely lacking in actual content after less than a week of gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-brothers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7216743">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The biggest strike I would call attention to is that it plays a bit like a card or board game. These are casual experiences, designed to be completed in a couple of hours, so high risk game play works well. Not so well for computer games. In Battle Brothers, the risk to your crew is always very high and the time investment to develop your crew members is also very high (many, many hours of play). I think these two elements are not compatible. Being forced to recruit inexperienced cripples is a design idea that really does not work.
<br>
<br>Beyond the German setting, the structure of the game is reminiscent of an old classic called Darklands. Other people have noticed this as well. My opinion is that they should study this older game to help influence the evolution of this title a) because they are closely related in concept, b) because this game needs much more depth to reach its (lofty!) potential, and c) because Darklands was fantastic for its time and needs to be revisited.
<br>
<br>I really wish Overhype Studios well on this fine foundation. Triple A could be in their future.
<br>
<br>As a final note: Although the writer is talented, and I don&apos;t wish to insult him, his sense of humor needs to be weaned out the game. Monty Python-esque humor is very hard to do well. It is PhD level comedy ... not for the amateurs. I feel that the weak humor detracts from the play experience. The writer also ventures into inappropriate and obscene humor. This is not as widely acceptable as the current media would have you think. I feel this should be avoided.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-brothers/user-reviews?user_review_id=7714593">Expand</a></span>
