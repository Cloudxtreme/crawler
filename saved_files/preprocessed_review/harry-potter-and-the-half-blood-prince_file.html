<br>A repetitive wizard experience
<br>IF you&#x2019;ve seen the movie or read the book you know what to expect story wise.. I having done neither didn&#x2019;t know what I was getting myself into, and was ultimately disappointed in the overall delivery.
<br>The feel of this game starts out great, youre slowly introduced to the mechanics of the game in a way that never feels like a tutorial..
<br>The entirety of the game take place at Hogwarts&#x2026;
<br>You feel like youre just a student..
<br>You run around solving the problems of other students and dealing with bullies&#x2026;
<br>You can also collect crests and wiggle your wand at shiny things until a bunch of mini crests come out.
<br>As of course you would expect from wand wiggling.
<br>This is a wizards school so the stair cases move as you move, so going out on your own could get a little confusing, luckily you have a guide in the form of nearly headless nick
<br>with the press of a button, he will appear and lead your to your next objective..
<br>This is the most clever way to help the player progress that ive ever seen&#x2026;
<br>All of this is great..
<br>You get to make potions by quickly following recipes, you get to duel with your wand, you get to play quidditch and you get to do these 3 things over and over and over&#x2026;
<br>The entire story is I need to make this potion, bring it back to whoever but on your way someone stops you to duel,
<br>Dueling can be pretty fun the first couple times, but I feel like the spells are not nearly as responsive as they should be which can lead to a couple of frustrating losses, and in between this dueling and potion making you have to play a pass through the rings game of quiddich,
<br>much like dueling, this is fun for the first few times, luckily missing a ring doesn&#x2019;t fail you like it would in any other game, but I found it hard at times to see whats going on with the sun shining in my eyes like rihanna.
<br>The story here though is of course figuring out who the half blood prince is, who owned the recipe book that harry potter now has&#x2026;
<br>This story will slide in all of your favorite characters, but the ending lacked any punch in what could have been a very sad moment..
<br>It felt rushed and all over the place lacking any true emotion from me or the characters&#x2026;
<br>This game has some potentially great things going for it&#x2026; the magic of harry potter is here&#x2026;
<br>its just doesn&#x2019;t do enough different throughout your 4 hour journey.
<br>I give Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince a 6.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince/user-reviews?user_review_id=6138829">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, all (and I mean ALL) resolutions of plot points in this game are only solved by three means, either a duel, potion making or a flying sequence. All three mini games are surprisingly good and that&apos;s why the game is better than the fifth one, nevertheless, you&apos;ll still get bored of doing the same thing over and over again. However, instead of quitting after 5 members of DA like in OotP, I actually almost finished this game before it became way too tedious for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince/user-reviews?user_review_id=5369667">Expand</a></span>
