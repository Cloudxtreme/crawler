The technological advances not only add more units and building options, but actually create a wonderfully immersing backdrop for an already heady, atmospheric campaign. Choose to side with the Emperor or Shogun in a time of political and martial upheaval, and decide to try and maintain the traditional approach to warfare or embrace the new. The added units make ranged combat the order of the day, and with the addition of powerful artillery and naval support create a very engrossing battlefield experience. The campaign map is much bigger than Shogun 2, and looks more detailed with the railroads and surging industry of towns as they grow. The AI is good (although still able to be outwitted fairly easily) and for the most part it runs well without errors. Ignoring Sega&apos;s absolutely criminal approach to DLC (which does not affect the quality of the game in itself), I recommend it highly to strategy fans, irregardless of previous Total War experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=2471419">Expand</a></span>

Briefly, this is for the following reasons:<br><br>*  No realm divide issues:  although there is a similar concept (where all shogunate and imperial han are forced into active conflict), they&apos;ve gotten rid of Shogun 2&apos;s completely ahistorical and game-killing &quot;Colonization 2&quot; style AI dogpile.  All the other side&apos;s han declare war on you, but they don&apos;t spawn huge armies instantly.<br><br>* Less monotony:  one obvious issue with all the Shogun titles, including the original, is the relative monotony of setting and unit types.   Battles tend to be maximising your archers&apos;  window while the enemy closes, and then generic melee attrition.   In comparison, although FotS is arguably not as good at distinguishing each faction as Shogun 2, with its clan-specific movies and big bonuses, you can now choose to build your armies with anything from spear ashigaru hordes to Empire Total War style line regiments complete with a light infantry skirmish line and carbine-equipped cavalry screen.   With modern field guns and naval fire support thrown in - and the potential to be genuinely devastating - combat has a lot more depth than Shogun&apos;s slogging matches.<br><br>* Better naval combat compared to Shogun 2:  the AI is strangely worse on low levels, but it&apos;s a very cool take on a very neglected period (1850-1902 - the evolution of pre-Dreadnought battleships) of naval warfare, with centre-battery ironclads (l&apos;ocean and Warrior), turret ironclads (Roanoak) steam paddle frigates, ironclad rams (Stonewall / Kotetsu) and torpedo boats all making an appearance.  RBLs versus wooden hulls equals general devastation!   * Tech tree and special units:  modernisation effects on unrest, awesome tech and some great special units - especially the Shinsengumi / Ishin Shishi.  Although each clan gets its own bonuses and sometimes their own units (e.g. Tosa get special rifleman unites), it is true that you&apos;re likely to end up with either a generic Shogunate or Imperial army rather than one dictated by specific clan bonuses - i.e. you will either have a samurai unit core or a line infantry core with modern artillery support in either case.  So it&apos;s slightly more generic in that sense.  However, this doesn&apos;t stop the player taking the game in a particular direction to suit the clan or just to see what happens.  All in all, for me only a fully DLC&apos;d copy of Empire beats this, and that&apos;s mostly for the greater scope of Empire.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=2315459">Expand</a></span>

This also the most beautiful Strategy Game I have ever played from the unit details to the city battles.

The previous line infantry warfare titles weren&apos;t that exciting because of an extremely small number of different unit types and viable strategies. Shogun 2 had an increase in viable unit types and strategies, but it still paled in comparison to Medieval II. Fall of the Samurai is the sweet spot, they&apos;ve managed to find the one period in history where sword and spear infantry, cavalry, and both archers and musketmen are balanced just well enough to all be viable and provide just enough tactical consideration based on what you&apos;re going against. Definitely a worthy buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=2269686">Expand</a></span>

It fixes a lot of the &apos;faults&apos; of Shogun 2 with the two different unit-compositions (modern vs traditional), which makes the armies feel diverse and interesting. Also brings up a lot of new tactics if you want to be successful (especially with the modern armies). The navy aspect has gotten a new and improved aspect with the bombardment. This is great as it makes navies important as never before. The navy battles are also improved compared to Shogun 2, but that might just be the guns.. There are now multiple ways to win the game, as everybody does not turn on you in the end (if you choose to support the common cause), but you can also go the total war-style (war with everyone) if you like. The expansion supports (multiplayer)battles with the original Shogun 2 armies and that is also great fun. I think they have balanced the games pretty well against each other. The only complaint I have is the tendency of the modern units to bug when they shuffle into lines after getting shot. This makes the unit unable to fire in the meantime and while under fire, even more troops will die which equals to even more shuffling.. Oh well, still love this expansion and you should go buy and game it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=2274843">Expand</a></span>

One of the new features is the ability to call in off-map artillery support from nearby ships - they&apos;re finally good for something besides protecting your trade lanes.  The conflict between new ideas and traditional values, briefly touched upon in the previous games, is genuinely interesting and is central to the game. The only complaint I can really acknowledge is that if you found the line combat of Empire or Napoleon sort of boring, you might feel the same way about FotS... though you have the option of using samurai to chop up the foreign devils.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=2268543">Expand</a></span>

I personally enjoy the setting of a civil war situation in the campaign, and the choice between modernising and traditionalism, the latter, ironically being the more challenging play style. I did think, however, that because of the setting, unlike any other total war game i&apos;ve played, you often get squeezed for choice of enemies since everyone fights either for the shogunate or for the emperor, narrowing your choice of enemies, conquests and your prospects of success. It doesn&apos;t quite seem like the domination-style gameplay of other total war campaigns, rather it feels co-operative and coalition-style. Particularly true in this instance is the idea that having more allies (which you inevitably will have) will not actually improve the game&apos;s progress, rather it seems that it hinders your progress and interest since you have less to fight and take over.<br>I did, however, particularly like the modernisation system. I like the choice between becoming an advanced, europe-esque clan, and fighting against modernism across your campaign in an effort to remain traditional; I love the feel of the old japanese order colliding with the new.<br>Then there&apos;s battles; Graphics don&apos;t have to be on highest settings to thoroughly enjoy this aspect. My fairly low-Spec PC runs Shogun 2 on low settings with an excellent performance and it doesn&apos;t look at all bad; i found this runs better than Napoleon TW on my PC<br>Definitely worth the money , i&apos;d say, i mark this highly for its in-depth coverage of the boshin war period and the conflict between old and new, and would mark this down purely because of the restriction of the number of opponents faced in campaign. Ultimately, excellent game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=2466258">Expand</a></span>

Shogun 2 and S2: Fall of the Samurai are really, really impressive. I&apos;m especially happy with S2: FotS. The improvements are so that it ALMOST feels like a whole new game. I just have one request -not a complaint mind you, but a request: please stop re-releasing newer, better versions of old games. I absolutely loved Rome Total War, but please do not release a newer better version of it. Please keep it moving forward. Please make your next game about the fall of the old empires, i.e. World War 1. You could even set the technology to be turn-of-the-last-century at the beginning of a campaign mode, then have it developable (is that a word?) into WW1 tech, then maxing out at technology equal to what would&apos;ve been available circa 1950. From bolt action rifles and bi-planes to early fighter jets and the atomic bomb.<br><br>That. Would. Be. Awesome. And I can&apos;t imagine a scenario where I WOULDN&apos;T be playing that game, job and wife be damned.<br><br>I&apos;m probably just kidding about that last bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=2297119">Expand</a></span>

<br>In battles you literally line up your men and watch them fire, you do absolutely nothing.  The few battles that do happen (and they rarely do) are so utterly boring 90% of the time is spent sped up.  Defense is even stronger now, provided they don&apos;t have artillery.  But while artillery evens the playing field it makes the game no more interesting, as again you sit there and wait for your artillery to run out of ammo, or theirs.  So if you like a game where you can line up your men and walk away, this is the game for you.
<br>
<br>Naval battle are much worse now, and considering that naval battles were so utterly atrocious in S2, that they could have managed to make is worse is a feat in and of itself.  Where-as before though you could ignore that aspect of the game, now you have no choice as you&apos;re cities will get endlessly bombarded.  The flee in circles mechanic is still there, where it you spend your entire time chasing navies that refuse to engage but just run away, during which time 10 other 1 stack units will blockade every port and trade route while bombarding your cities.  If by sheer dumb luck you can actually engage an enemy navy, the naval battles are worse than the bumper-car cluster-fck that was S2 naval battles.  As stupid as watching 20 ships sit there stuck and unable to move just firing ineffective arrows at each other for 20 min was, Fall of the Samurai&apos;s naval battles are even worse.  The defender lines his boats up sideways and does nothing, while the attacker has no option but to steam head first into the fire losing almost his entire fleet before being able to fire a single shot.  Unless you&apos;re MASSIVELY out numbered, you can&apos;t lose at naval defense.

(I would rate this lower, but this is more of my opinion of guns and the Total War series) I am also highly unsure whether the traditional style of playing Total War games (aka Troop Grouping/movement) would work well at all for anything passed the 1800s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=2435778">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Singleplayer gets tedious really fast, Japan gets divided in two - Shogun up north, empire down south, and one has to attack over very long distances. This is where enemy&apos;s use of ships to blockade trade routes gets really annoying- the enemy keeps spamming stacks of 1-2 ships, and it&apos;s a hassle to chase them all, especially since they can magically retreat really far away most of the time.
<br>
<br>In terms of clans, there&apos;s really minimal differences between them.  The shogun/empire divide is only visible in the early game, as capturing enemy settlements later on allow a player to field both samurais/ninjas and best riflemen, like US marines.
<br>
<br>Castle sieges were disappointing, as the enemy is utterly retarded. It can neither attack nor defend properly, and seeing AI try to climb the same tallest wall in my castle with 5 squads of 150 men at once is just too much.
<br>
<br>Overall, I don&apos;t see myself playing this for long, and it seems like a waste of 30$</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=4196443">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s nothing more satisfying than calling in your offshore ships to bombard  and enemy in a castle and see them get absolutely destroyed, or setting up  some Gatling guns before a wall of charging samurai and just watching as they get mowed down. I&apos;m still not a fan of the setting. Japan is a still a very homogeneous country and none of the factions really felt any different from the others. The few interesting factions in the game were locked out and you have to buy a DLC to unlock them even though they are already in the game. FotS loses a point over that scam. Overall though, the game is an upgraded Napoleon and well worth the time of anyone who enjoyed that or Empire.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=4109887">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Look, unless you liked empire at war, you probably wont like fall of the samurai. But even then, why get fall of the samurai when you can just play empire? Empire is much more indepth and ecompasses more territory than japan.
<br>
<br>I strongly prefer Rise of the Samurai as mobilising Samurai armies is much more satisfying than musket-wielding noobs.</span>

This game boasts great graphics, great maps, great units, great factions, and a decent sense of historical friction of Japan in a state of transition from medievel society to modernity. Sadly however the elements of game design are not so strong in the single player campaign. As in all CA games this game has an overly mechanical feel about it. War is a process of steady expansion, and it lacks any sense of narrative, identity politics, indeed any sense of politics, diplomacy or political economy. The game (on hardest setting) see saws from TOO HARD at the start to TOO EASY once your faction reaches the point of sufficient mass.  Also lots of little things are unbalanced. Agents in particular are WAY OVERPOWERED. A single Geisha can convert all the generals in a rival faction to your army. A single Ninja can kill ever NPC in a faction and so on. This game was never truly play tested.  For Multiplayer Fall of the Samurai was a great expansion. But the single player experience is, like all CA games, not very well designed. CA needs to get beyond mechanical expansion and into campaigns based on real diplomacy and real political economy. GROW UP CA!

There are more new interesting aspects of the game: fights in the port and the 2 parties after realm divide. The biggest problems remain: KI is bad, especially realm divide is frustrating, because the KI is throwing everything against the player and the allies are stupid. The battles should be more interesting, because you get a new kind of units. But on the other side the battles get all the same: shooting with artillery, infantery and bows at the rear, front units attacking or defending the infantery. I prefer the battles in main game. The same in naval battles: they are better and more interesting in main game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=5411358">Expand</a></span>

<br>The good at Shogun II: Everything.
<br>
<br>The visuals, sounds, game mechanics, diplomacy, naval battles, everything is such a vast improvement over Medieval II TW(I didn&apos;t play Empire).
<br>
<br>The game as a whole is a glorious success in every aspect, but it does come with a few minor and two major flaws.
<br>
<br>The first major flaw is simple: it lags. Terribly. After checking around, this game has no multicore support. That means that the game&apos;s loading times, battles and world map all lag. It&apos;s a terrible, unforgivable issue that never stops. It will sometimes lag so bad it&apos;ll crash, that&apos;s how bad it is.
<br>
<br>Besides that, the balancing of units is a little poor: Artillery almost always ends up being the one and only thing you want to use, along with some support units to defend your cannons. While the mountainous landscape sort of kills that, it only sorts of does it. Most of the time, going for cannons is your best option for 90% of battles. Ironically, cannons become way less good against castles as the walls and hilltop fortresses are usually pretty decent at protecting from the ammo-limited cannons.
<br>
<br>Cavalry has become almost universally useless except in some extremely specific situations, too. That is certainly historically accurate, but it means that you&apos;re almost better off never making any cavalry.
<br>
<br>I may also be a massive pansy for saying this, but the other big flaw I found is that this game&apos;s very hard and legendary difficulties are just bollocks. They are absolutely ridiculous since you will find yourself, even if you play like a god, having to fight with 4-5 provinces against 30, since every single clan and their mother will attack you. I even had clans from literally the other side of the farthest island of Japan send out an amphibious assault specifically for me when they could attack literally anywhere else on the way!
<br>
<br>The AI doesn&apos;t get more difficult, it&apos;s just that the level of agressivity towards YOU specifically gets retarded. Even your allies, or people who have every reason to attack you, will betray or assault you.
<br>
<br>As long as you hold yourself to normal or hard difficulties, this is pretty great though. The difficulty is just fine and the strategy, while usually pretty simple as Japan&apos;s shape does force you to fight clan after clan, you can&apos;t have many 3-way wars, you have to just push forward city after city till your victory, does allow for a lot of ambushes, surroundings, sieges, assaults of all kinds, naval supports, and such.
<br>
<br>Naval battles are a ton of fun, but are a bit on the easy side once you&apos;ve learned the basic principle of &quot;get them in your range, don&apos;t get in their fire range&quot;. I won many battles with 3 major ships against fleets of 10.
<br>One big problem with it is how huge the sea battlefields can be. You literally have to wait 5 full minutes of game time just to get in range! That is 2 real life minutes of waiting for nothing. And when it&apos;s a tough battle that you keep losing and have to reload to win, it&apos;s two minutes you&apos;ll really get annoyed at.
<br>
<br>This is actually another big problem, the loading times. They added this neat little quicksave feature before every battle. That&apos;s great and all, but if I lose a battle, the game automatically loads the world map to show me my defeat. I can&apos;t load a save from inside a battle. So I lose 10 seconds. Then I reload the quicksave. 10 more seconds. Then I can reload the battle. 10 more seconds!
<br>How about keep this feature but allow to just reload the battle once you&apos;ve lost it? It&apos;s the same principle and it doesn&apos;t have to take that much time! Or better yet, just have the little battle menu show up if you choose to reload the battle so you can choose auto-battle or battle battle without any loading.
<br>
<br>With these problems out of the way, and apart from a few minor gameplay mechanics like the boarding and unloading of ships, trains and the like, this is an excellent title in every aspect.
<br>
<br>The upkeep of units is too high though, especially for artillery which should have very little as it only needs 30 men.
<br>Diplomacy works much better(although I&apos;m never quite sure why my trade agreements are rejected and I find it a bit silly) than M2TW, the battles are extremely fun and varied although you&apos;ll often end up fighting in a forest or a hill, guns and cannons are the way to go to win battles apart maybe for castle battles, the technologies, agents and generals growth trees are an extremely great mechanic and this is an all-around wonderful TW game.
<br>
<br>I just wish CA had made an effort on the programming and actually had working multicore, this lag is awful. And that the difficulty wouldn&apos;t go from fighting a somewhat weak enemy to fighting 10 somewhat weak enemies at the same time. Oh and the cutscenes are very meh, too.
<br>Still truly a great, memorable, fun and complex game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2---fall-of-the-samurai/user-reviews?user_review_id=4016038">Expand</a></span>
