<br>Game mechanics themselves are almost flawless, you get to enjoy deep in-field combat tactics and EVERY unit (not only unit types) has its uses on the battlefield.
<br>Also, this title is almost entirely plot driven, halfway from a game, a visual novel and an anime itself; and I have to say that the plot is actually quite good (if you like anime-like dramas).
<br>Last but not least the graphic engine is awesome, 3D models become amazing pastel-colored line-art sketches with a marked anime style.
<br>
<br>So why do I have mixed feelings about this game? The port lacks settings customization (there are NO anti-aliasing settings for example) and in-engine cutscenes are pre-rendered in 720p (or even less) and extremely aliased; why pre-rendering cutscenes made with the game engine? and why on that resolution without anti-aliasing?
<br>If cutscenes played a marginal role in the game I would have not been disappointed much, but since most of the game time is actually spent watching cutscenes I really can&apos;t comprehend the choice, not to mention that this also made the game extremely fat download-wise (~10GiB instead of probably 2~3GiB).
<br>
<br>Mixed feelings aside I have to say that this game is still really good and extremely enjoyable so I&apos;d like to recommend it to all turn-based combat games enthusiasts and to all romantic/grand-strategy anime fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=5238699">Expand</a></span>

When finally I had the time to play VC, I was disappointed. I am not sure that it is the fault of the game... I think I am simply not in the targeted audiance. Whereas I see why others may adore it, its Japanese style presentation is not near to my heart. Also, I like characters being more realistic: not everything black or white, good or bad, nice people always being nice, etc. The development possibilities I found very simplistic and pretty much predestined, I appreceiate more freedom in choices needing more brainwork. The fights, being rather time-consuming than challenging, also failed to impress me. On balance, it failed to entertain me.
<br>So I gave up hope and quit playing after some 10h. Again, it might not be a bad game, but surely it is not for my taste.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=5348325">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s got everything to it; a solid story, meaningful, memorable characters you wanna save and keep alive... and even date, exquisite gameplay, and an art style that&apos;s filled with much love and soul. It&apos;s got the problem of Anime characters being young but seemingly having experienced the world over and much more, but it&apos;s got way less of that, and angst, compared to the dull characters you&apos;ll find in most later Final Fantasy games. The soldiers in your team have wonderful stories behind them. The only gripe I have is that the turn-based RPG gunfights have poor ballistics and unexplainable misses. But these faults are minor as this game, by some miracle, got so many things right, it&apos;s a classic. What happened to Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 is a travesty that needs to be corrected. Great games like these should not be bound to their platforms.

You can tell it was made awhile ago (2008) but since that&apos;s just part of the deal I don&apos;t necessarily judge it by today&apos;s graphics or gameplay standards. Bear in mind that I never played the original so this is the first time I&apos;m experiencing the game.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- I really like the blend of turn-based and real-time. It&apos;s unique and it adds a bit of uncertainty.
<br>- Their gear and the tank get cooler as you upgrade their equipment which is fun. Honestly this was one part that actually really appealed to me. Going from wooden rifles to poly M16s is pretty cool.
<br>- The characters are cheesy and cliche as hell, but if you&apos;re a fan of Japanese games or anime or manga then they&apos;ll be fun for you.
<br>- When you take someone out it&apos;s pretty satisfying, especially with snipers.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Too often it feels like there&apos;s really only one way to do a battle correctly which means I spend more of my time restarting to try to figure out what the devs *wanted* me to do instead of me thinking creatively about how to use and position my units.
<br>- Units can be frustratingly inaccurate sometimes, particularly lancers. Sometimes they&apos;ll miss something that&apos;s 5 feet in front of them.
<br>- A lot of the strategy elements are pretty shallow, particularly the crouching mechanic. The fact that they&apos;re in a trench shouldn&apos;t give them a defense bonus when I&apos;m in the same trench and I&apos;m flanking them. Or someone who&apos;s crouching by a sandbag and still get&apos;s the defense bonus even though I&apos;m behind them shooting them in the back and the sandbag should be doing nothing. This seems like a pretty big oversight because there are plenty of games before this came out originally that nailed the flanking mechanic correctly.
<br>- The movement of shocktroopers feels woefully limited. I understand it being inferior to scouts and engys, but it should be better than snipers and lancers. As it stands I find them hard to use effectively (although I always bring Rosie for the CP).
<br>- Mostly I find that I don&apos;t have the time to grind skirmishes to gain the levels to actually be able to reliably do the campaign battles (and skirmishes take awhile).
<br>- Having extra command points when Alicia, Roxie, and Largo gives me an incentive to have them at the battles (artificially because really it makes no difference), but all it really does is make me hang them back so I don&apos;t get pissed off when I lose CPs. Not well thought out.
<br>
<br>All-in-all I&apos;d say it&apos;s a decent game at best, though I&apos;m sure if I had nostalgia on my side I&apos;d have a different opinion. If you never played this originally, personally I would say your time is better spent on XCOM or the Shadowrun series (Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall, Hong Kong).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=6227475">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>REBIND CONTROLS: YES, but not each individual action; any actions are tied to the same key (i.e. Confirm/Crouch/Climb/Attack are all one key).
<br>
<br>MOUSE SUPPORT: YES in 3rd-person, YES in Tactical View (cursor fixed to center), NO in menus (must use wasd/arrows).
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS: In-game graphics are beautiful, scale incredibly well to resolution. Pre-rendered cinematics, however, are locked to 720p and were not remastered for the PC release. Still look great thanks to non-realistic art style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4671116">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only problem I found is that the volume of sound effects are sometimes inconsistent (gunfire for example, is very low) but nothing that can stop me giving this game a 10/10.</span>

Never got to playing this game before today (not a PS3 owner :&apos;( ), but loved every moment of the second game in the series on my PSP. While Valkyria Chronicles apparently brings nothing new content-wise (so I&apos;ve been told) with the PC port, all the DLC&apos;s, brilliant anime visuals and controller support, not to mention the inclusion of the choice of authentic Japanese audio, makes for an excellent PC port. Coupled with the interesting turn-based-shooter style of play (which by the way is more complex than I&apos;m making it sound), believable characters fleshed out through cut scenes between missions and a bug-free interface potentially makes this one of those games which everyone would regret not at least trying out.
<br>
<br>While all of my friends are languishing how their computers are not good enough to generate playable FPS for AC - Unity at acceptable graphic settings, I&apos;m sure glad I gambled on this gem. And with a quickfire double of Football Manager 2015 followed by this masterpiece, Sega has regained a large chunk of their respect in my books.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4675273">Expand</a></span>

But here is why I had to stop playing it: (1) the controls are abysmal, like truly bad, obviously a console port but with zero effort to make them even remotely acceptable, and I tries mouse and keyboard and controller. (2) Enemy turns can take forever as each guy moves. It reminds me of Codename STEAM on 3DS which suffered similar super long enemy turns. (3) There are some major difficulty spikes (level 7 is horrible) and this exacerbates #2.  (4) The 20 turn limit is really freaking stupid. I&apos;m ok with all other tactical design choices, but artificially limiting the options with a hard turn cap is just ridiculous. (5) The cutscenes were not updated and look identical to PS3, which is ok, but not ideal.

<br>XCOM is one of my favorite games ever. I love Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Divinity Original Sin, many JRPG and some anima - many games and genres that would portend that I would love this game. But it was tedious, boring, and too difficult at times (and I usually play most games on hard).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=5372821">Expand</a></span>

To its credit Valyria sports a veritable style of gameplay refered to as a tactical-RPG 3rd person shooter, the problem is that nothing of that taxonomy works. It is not very strategic since most scenarios are straight-forward and on the simple side of things tactical, the RPG simply does not exist since you are forced on a single character shoehorned by the story to be a &quot;hero&quot; upon whose development you have no real control, and the 3rd person shooter aspect is reduced to a single click adorned with decorations of something more complex (E.G. cross-hairs while you select your target).
<br>The art is of high quality with an interesting pencil-watercolour style. The music is at times inspiring but often seemingly out of place for a particular scene.
<br>Valkyria is also a &quot;menu&quot; and &quot;acquiescence&quot; nightmare, where progression and information are both buried beneath layers of clicks and &quot;are-you-sure?&quot;s. After each &quot;Episode&quot; is unlocked (episodes that commonly amount to no more than a small dialogue) you are asked if you would like to see the next one (which could be just another brief dialogue), ad infinitum. To search the side tabs you must first click a menu tab to access the tabs menu. Console-itis full on. Good PC ports dismiss things inherent to consoles that are cumbersome elsewhere, they do not bring the ballast to the new medium.
<br>I prefer games with an intricate story, and Valyria seemed to have that aplenty, but with an unsuferable lead character and tedious dialogues the exposition parts become and excercise in patience.
<br>Tedium is no stranger during combat either. Each movement you make is surrounded by unnecessary and time consuming eye-candy. Icons explode, camera zooms-in and out from the battlefield. Each. And every. Time. Nothing of these makes the situation feel more interesting nor clear, all it does is take time.
<br>All-in-all, a game only the anime-manga neophite, or the already fan of this franchise will truly like. The rest of us will appreciate some of its uniqueness, give it a more accurate 5 or 6 out of 10, and move on to something better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4774632">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is the short answer to what is to expect of this port, of a game actually a few years old, but able to outsell some big players, like certain flops released near this date.
<br>
<br>Valkyria Chronicles is a well made strategy game, made with the intention of doing something different from usual. The intent wasn&apos;t on having awesome graphics (even in 2008 the graphics were ok) but something beautiful, and even now, six years later, the game still looks beautiful, not at all old.
<br>
<br>The plot is engaging, maybe a bit reliant on cliches, but still well done and interesting. Any story about a war not glorifying it, but showing it with fairness (Cruelty, heroism, sacrifice, duty, loyalty...) is always a welcome sight. The main characters are well developed, and the side characters get their own missions to shine.
<br>
<br>The music is beautiful, with some tracks being fairly normal, while others are memorable. Voice acting in English is kinda OK, while the original Japanese work is polished and flawless.
<br>
<br>The controls are well ported, mouse control is smooth and correct, I miss having a cursor in the menus, but the important part (The combat) goes flawless. It also allows controller use, for those who prefer the original experience.
<br>
<br>Combat can be as challenging as you allow it to be. Certainly victory won&apos;t be an issue most of the time, but getting A rank is another, different, matter. Still, the learning curve is user friendly, as long as the player accepts B ranks for a while.
<br>
<br>The Strategic part varies, sometimes being smart allows the player to have really fun combats, while considering possibilities. Other times using strong scouts allows to skip the entire combat by simply rushing an objective fast. It&apos;s not cheating, but still, I&apos;d discourage players from exploiting the mechanics for fast victories.
<br>
<br>The game itself is fairly long, 30 hours without doing repetitive tasks, like farming points in free missions. Still, the game doesn&apos;t have much of an after-campaign content, leaving aside the included DLC. so re-playability is low, apart from NG+.
<br>
<br>Long story short. This game is cheap, is good, it has aged well, the control is good and it&apos;s fun. Get it, so other games like this one get out on PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4685277">Expand</a></span>

<br>I personally have sunk many hundreds of hours into the PS3 version.  The game&#x2019;s main positive attribute is the amazing story, which is masterfully voiced in both English and Japanese.  The awesome soundtrack is beautifully composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who has also created scores for Final Fantasy titles.  The extremely unique and breathtaking watercolor graphics produced by the CANVAS engine make this game&#x2019;s art style literally one-of-a-kind, and now it looks even better in high definition thanks to the work done by SEGA to release the game on PC.  The game also took advantage of Nvidia&#x2019;s PhysX technology to simulate realistic physics for debris, hair, clothing, grass, and more on the PS3.  Without a doubt, this technology will be coming to PC along with the game, and possibly be even better than before.  The game also boasts its own type of gameplay style; I would describe it as &#x201C;a turn-based real-time third-person-shooter strategy RPG&#x201D;, yes, turn-based and real-time together.  The game&#x2019;s characters are very easy to identify with, or at least make a personal connection to one of them.  Throughout the story, the cast (over 100 playable characters with unique personalities) will have to find strength to fight in a war they never wanted, and to find solace in even the grimmest situations.  Each one of the characters carries their own personal set of &#x201C;perks&#x201D;, or as the game calls them, &#x201C;potentials.&#x201D;  These unlock overtime, and throughout the game the roster of more than one hundred characters each have a different set of eight &#x201C;potentials&#x201D;, some good, and some bad.  For example, a unit may gain the ability to occasionally fire off a barrage bullets without the enemy having any chance to dodge from the aptly named &#x201C;undodgeable shot&#x201D; potential.  Or, a unit may slowly lose hit points during their turn because they are allergic to the terrain.  This makes for a great strategic gameplay mechanic as you will have to change your line up of soldiers for each mission in order to have the best possible team for the situation.
<br>
<br>Short Version:
<br>+Great Story
<br>+One-of-a-kind art style
<br>+Great Soundtrack

<br>+ Very good and innovative turn-based combat
<br>+ Pretty good looking for a game that old
<br>+ A very good port in the times of ports that are straight up disfunctional at release
<br>+ decent story for a JRPG
<br>+ Pretty long
<br>- Very clich&#xE9; characters, but hey, what did you expect
<br>- The story starts out horribly weak but gets better (as does the combat)
<br>
<br>Minor cons
<br>- You can&apos;t skip the dialogue which can be pretty annoying when restarting a mission multiple times
<br>- Tank movement feels very icky
<br>
<br>Summary:
<br>If you don&apos;t dislike JRPGs per se and can stand the annoyance that the dialogue/story in this games can be, I&apos;d very much recommend you try this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4739120">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I actually loved the game itself. It&apos;s a mixed between turned based, and real time combat. The bad part of this game is that it&apos;s real time, and their should be an option to turn it off. The enemies are super overpowered. You literally have to grind and grind on the repeatable battles to gain levels, and upgrades just to have a chance on the campaign battle to come.
<br>
<br>The game is original, and that I loved. The turn page campaign was pretty sweet. The story is cheesy as hell, but it&apos;s what you&apos;d come to expect from a Japanese writer.
<br>
<br>Next time, give the game campaign an easy mode for people that play for the story. I don&apos;t like buying a game only to find out that it&apos;s too hard. I&apos;m a casual gamer, and don&apos;t think this game is good enough to be putting so much thought into strategy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=6019459">Expand</a></span>

Like several reviewers have noted this is actually a puzzle game, not an RPG, and it&apos;s a very bad puzzle game, full of nonsensical design decisions, bugs, bad AI, and exploits. You will be wasting time doing (almost) the exact same things over and over and over and over and over AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER while you attempt to game the broken system that underpins this mess merely so you can advance the story and pass whatever awful broken level you&apos;re currently trying to slog through. After about 5 of these idiotic set piece puzzle disasters I threw in the towel and deleted this trash.
<br>
<br>If you love poorly written JP tales of World Wars and girls in miniskirts wielding massive weapons then you might give it a look, but you&apos;ll have to love the story and characters a whole lot to force yourself through the mind numbing, incredibly annoying, absolutely awful &quot;gameplay&quot; to actually see them.

Excellent story and characters, great graphics, unique battle system and ranking, unique theme, awesome soundtrack, and it&apos;s a good game from start to finish. I cried at one part just because the story was so well done and I was THAT attached to the characters in the scene (you&apos;ll know which scene when ya get to it). It&apos;s at a very good price ($19.99) so it isn&apos;t like it is killing your pocket.
<br>
<br>If you love strategy, warfare, a good story, history, or just video games in general, this is a must have! 2008 Strategy game of the year for a reason! I literally have nothing bad to say about this game! if you like this, there is a sequel (and a third one released only in Japan) for PSP! Share your feelings about the game and let your opinions be known so that Sega might just release another VC, or at least put the trilogy on the newer consoles (hopefully PS4, PLEASE SEGA!) One of my favorite video games of all time. I&apos;m still looking for a PSP to be able to play Valkyria Chronicles 2 :/</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4728923">Expand</a></span>

<br>I missed it on PS3, now it&apos;s almost impossible to get it (because it&apos;s released only on BD) and now such a gift for all PC gamers, what can be better?
<br>But there&apos;s a warning for everyone: you can become emotionally attached to your squad members and cry every time you lose them, beware :)</span>

<br>Valkyria Chronicles es uno de los juegos desconocidos de la generaci&#xF3;n pasada, el cual pertenece a la &#xE9;lite de los mejores J-RPG t&#xE1;cticos, desarrollado y publicado por SEGA en exclusiva para PS3, el cual salio el 31 de octubre en Europa y el 4 de Noviembre en Norte Am&#xE9;rica del 2008. El dise&#xF1;o del juego cuenta con un motor gr&#xE1;fico llamado SEGA CANVAS, ofreciendo al t&#xED;tulo una de las mejores caracter&#xED;sticas con ese Cel Shading tipo acuarela. (me encanta su apariencia)Sobre el idioma se puede seleccionar como lenguaje el Japones o Ingles con la opci&#xF3;n de habilitar o no los subtitulos en ingles, siendo este uno de los puntos negativos del juego.
<br>
<br>Es un t&#xED;tulo con una historia interesante, el nivel de juego es muy fresco en el genero, que ofrecer&#xE1; un reto en cada misi&#xF3;n, llenos de personajes con carisma muy agradable unos y otros caer&#xE1;n mal, no solo con los principales tambi&#xE9;n con los secundarios y los reclutas que iras conociendo en el avanzar de cada misi&#xF3;n, siendo algunos personajes los del juego Skies of Arcadia, todos con su propia personalidad y por eso uno siempre tendr&#xE1; ese extremo cuidado para que, ese personaje con quien hayas simpatizado no caiga en combate. (aunque no afecta en nada, siempre regresaran)Un juego que invita a jugarlo repetidamente, una vez que hayas superado el modo principal para mejorar lo ya hecho y conseguir todas las medallas del juego (vienen siendo los trofeos, ya que no tiene ese sistema) cuenta con un sistema de valoraci&#xF3;n de rangos desde la D el mas bajo hasta la A la valoraci&#xF3;n mas alta y tiene la posibilidad de otro modo de juego llamado Batalla Libre o Skirsmish donde existe la selecci&#xF3;n de dificultad, ya que en el Modo Historia solo hay una dificultad predeterminada.
<br>
<br>Respecto al sistema del juego, se basa en combate por turnos, en vivo y por zonas llamado en ingles BLiTZ, en plena batalla habr&#xE1;n dos modos de juego, el modo Comando que nos dar&#xE1; una perspectiva a&#xE9;rea sobre un mapa t&#xE1;ctico donde visualizaremos las unidades aliadas y enemigas (esta ultima, si nuestros soldados tienen visi&#xF3;n sobre el enemigo), al seleccionar una unidad aliada entraremos al modo Acci&#xF3;n, donde tendremos una visual de nuestro soldado en tercera persona, en ese modo todo transcurre en tiempo real, con la ventaja que solo tu soldado tendr&#xE1; la posibilidad de moverse en el campo de batalla dependiendo de la distancia a recorrer por la barra AP (Action Points) pero puede ser atacado por el enemigo si llegan a tener visi&#xF3;n sobre t&#xFA; unidad e igual cuando llega el turno del enemigo, no podr&#xE1;s mover ninguna unidad tuya pero, dispararan autom&#xE1;ticamente si la unidad enemiga pasa por la visual de tu soldado, dando as&#xED; un &apos;&apos;equilibrio&apos;&apos; entre turnos. (si llegan a jugarlo sabr&#xE1;n el por que de las comillas)
<br>
<br>Es un juego que se desarrolla en una Europa ficticia del a&#xF1;o 1935 cuando la paz hab&#xED;a acabado, iniciando la segunda Guerra Europea entre la Federaci&#xF3;n Atl&#xE1;ntica y la Alianza Europea Imperial, donde los pa&#xED;ses vecinos sufrir&#xED;an las consecuencias de la misma, en medio del conflicto de esas dos grandes potencias esta el pa&#xED;s de Gallia donde conoceremos a nuestros protagonistas y dar&#xE1; comienzo la aventura del juego.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4671600">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only reason this game doesn&apos;t get a 10 is its post-mission ranking system.  Its scored entirely on number of turns.
<br>
<br>Though it has no real penalty if you choose to ignore it (you can play other missions to get additional character progression if you want it), if that sort of thing bothers you, it takes away from the strategic element of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4691307">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game play is great. It was like returning to the past, when games were actually fun and tactical strategy games still existed. There are a few bugs and quirks but never enough to really hurt the enjoyment of game. The pros far outweigh the cons.
<br>
<br>The music is excellent. It really inspires you during combat.
<br>
<br>I would&apos;ve liked to have seen more of the squad during cut scenes, but I was surprised they were individually voiced and had unique characteristics. It really helps immerse you in the game when you&apos;re not commanding a bunch of clones or bad ass super-soldiers.
<br>
<br>I had no idea this game would be this good, but believe me - it is. It&apos;s actually quite lengthy as well. I would love to see similar games in the future.
<br>
<br>Oh, and use the num-pad on your keyboard and &quot;w&quot; and &quot;s&quot; to control the tanks instead of the mouse unless you enjoy driving your tank in circles. It&apos;s actually easy to control once you figure it out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4784653">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Port is well executed, you have the option to hear the always better japanse audio with english subtitles. Controllers work perfectly and you also have the option of playing with mouse and keyboard.
<br>
<br>Gameplay feels as polished as the original and nothing has been lost in that regard.
<br>
<br>The only CON y could find was the lack of better resolution during cut scenes (they look great nonetheless), maybe a future patch can improve this?
<br>
<br>Great job from SEGA, a must buy if you didn&apos;t play the PS3 version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4675389">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game deals with everything in a alternate reality sort of way in WW2 it even has concentration camps and persecution..

It plays a good bit like the XCOM reboot (and I&apos;ll mention I thoroughly enjoyed the XCOM reboot), but without any of the base-building mechanics or quick gameplay, instead favoring a focus on individual character development, so maybe a bit more like Jagged Alliance or Wasteland. I had trouble understanding the point of the upgrade system over something which happens automatically by soldier experience -- the way they do it is to have all units of the same type upgrade at once, but all units&apos; points go into one pool of experience you can use to upgrade units. The upgrade names, by the way, are about as unimaginative as you can... well... imagine (upgrade 1, upgrade 2, upgrade 3). It&apos;s still tedious like customization, but doesn&apos;t really &quot;feel&quot; like customization because the changes are either very broad or applied to the tank.
<br>
<br>Voice-acting and situations feel both generic and inorganic. The story as a whole didn&apos;t stick with me... I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;m already confusing it with Ys. The art-style is interesting and it&apos;s a refreshing exploration of the time period reimagined in a partial fantasy setting, but it has trouble overcoming its graphics being fairly simple images with a fill and a few filters applied. The UI in the game is awful, a good few steps backward from current-gen titles -- you&apos;re constantly digging through menus, confirming commands, and pointlessly re-selecting people.
<br>
<br>The combat style is interesting, though the difficulty curve is ridiculous -- it starts out incredibly difficult while you&apos;re underequipped and then, for the rest of the game, suddenly becomes easy once you unlock the HQ. Enemy NPCs can shoot at you while you run in first-person (with a very unique fatigue system), while your units can also shoot back when the enemy moves (however, the enemy AI is much more efficient at moving and doesn&apos;t get stuck on walls or not know which objects they can climb over).
<br>
<br>Overall, I was disappointed and quit mid-way through. There&apos;s obviously a target audience which&apos;ll love this game, but I&apos;m not in it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4812788">Expand</a></span>

I find it funny that there still is such a difference between the average western made games and the average eastern made games ( and i like that there is such a difference - because that means we get more diversity )
<br>
<br>Like many japanese games ( if i may, it is a bit of a stereotype .. ) - rather simple game mechanics are covered by an also simple but beautifully told story. The game creates immersion from the get go without the need of photorealistic graphics or hollywood-like CGI effects and cutscenes. Its style reminded me at times on Miyazaki movies with its distinct steampunk feeling.
<br>
<br>+ Gameplaywise it is nothing too special - but it does what it wants to do very well.
<br>+ good design/style - cutscenes and ingame graphics blend in well enough
<br>+ runs smoothly on lower end / middle class computers
<br>+ plenty of content and well done translation
<br>
<br>- although the controls are configurable, there is no mouse support for most ingame menus and controls - imo a clear artifact of a console origin
<br>
<br>well, clearly more + than - ... and for the price it is 100% recommended - at least for those gamers that seek substance over the latest graphics. It is not a fast game - to enjoy it .. one has to sit down for some time and allow it to entertain one...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4697300">Expand</a></span>

If you like turn based games, you should have already downloaded it, this is the most beautiful, smart and unique turn based experience you&apos;ve ever had. I really wonder why there never was a follow-up or at least why with all the turn based games coming out lately, no one has &quot;borrowed&quot; this game&apos;s gameplay.</span>

The game didn&apos;t really suck me in at the beginning because I felt some of the english voice acting was bad and the animations were cheesy. I pressed start after enduring it for a while and couldn&apos;t find the option to change the language to japanese. I put the game down and didn&apos;t pick it up again for a couple weeks. I then realized that you can change the language from the main menu. This changes everything!
<br>
<br>The combat is brilliant and it keeps you involved. The campaign is nice and long. The game has the perfect amount of depth and simplicity. It is the type of game that anyone can catch on to almost immediately but can only be mastered by few. The price is more than fair. I&apos;ve gotten way more value out of this game than i have with other games that i&apos;ve paid $50 - $60 for.
<br>
<br>The story kept me entertained. I cared about the characters. I laughed. I wanted to know what happens next like a good book or an episode of Breaking Bad. I can&apos;t imagine any intelligent person not falling in love with this game. I understand this is a port but I don&apos;t have a PS3 or a PSP so this was my introduction to the series. Go Sega! I&apos;ll keep supporting them if they keep producing quality games. PC&apos;s have infinitely more power than consoles so it hurts when ports are released on the PC unpolished. This game has to be flawlessly ported because I see no issues.
<br>
<br>I would honestly give it a 9.5/10 if that were possible but I feel strongly that a 9/10 would be blasphemy. Buy this game! You wont miss the $20 unless you&apos;re a dumb person. I would recommend using the Japanese voice overs instead of english. The english voice overs were extremely corny and don&apos;t always translate in a way that gets the point across strongly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4790340">Expand</a></span>

Storyline is Outstanding - 10/10.  All Characters gave engaging back stories including side characters. Main characters are great and interact with other characters perfectly -10/10. Animation is beautiful like art work 10/10. Uniqueness of game - 10/10. Gameplay will take getting use to for beginners but once you play a couple hours you the hang of it. Non the less it will be hard getting use to but don&apos;t give up you won&apos;t be disappointed 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4876895">Expand</a></span>

I got to the second chapter before I couldn`t take any more of the ridiculous dialogue, terrible characters and nonexistent gameplay. You literally have to sit for about an hour watching a cringeworthy cartoon, which is badly drawn, telling you an endless and tedious story before you get to actually play the game. And when you do it`s bad both as an RPG and as a strategy game. As usual with JRPGs you have little kids defeating armies while making cutesy and/or sentimental remarks. The soldiers make squeaky noises when you shoot them, as if they`re a dog`s rubber toy or something. Of course the characters also make hip remarks when they shoot someone. It is all unbearable rubbish. And there are as always endless amounts of these pointless dialogue lines, and you have to click to get rid of each one. It`s as if the game is trying to talk you to death and it makes it almost completely unplayable. And of course it has ported the interface from the PS which you just don`t need on the PC. This leads to endless menus, &quot;are you sures&quot; and just constant interruptions of the gameplay. The characters are also dull, in addition to talking all the damn time, and I found nothing to hold my interest at any point. I just do not understand how this pile of manure is a 10 from so many people posting here. Are you all working for Sega or something?

<br>Uninstalled after about two hours. Only consider if you love poor story telling, trashy gameplay, rotten dialogue and bad graphics. In short, if you for some reason like JRPGs you might possibly like this. Everyone else should steer clear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=5270240">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is simply amazing, has the most beautiful anime graphics a game has ever had, the gameplay may seem complex , but it is very quick to learn to play and then create your own strategies.
<br>The story is well told, with half slow at first, but then gets very dynamic, the main characters of Squad 7 are well developed, they can get you their angry, sad or how they are feeling at the moment.
<br>But it has flaws, sometimes can leave you frustrated for not passing a mission, in fact, can be quite difficult, but instead of crying, you should motivate even more to pass that mission by improving your tank , your soldiers and your strategies.
<br>This game is indispensable for the tactical game lovers and who like to enjoy a good story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=6528879">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you&apos;re looking for a different kind of strategy war game, this is it. It&apos;s a mash up of FF Tactics, an FPS, An anime, and WWII.

Tactical part of the game, turn based battles are very good and no so easy so You have a challenge in even simple skirmish. so it,s time to get to my tank and defend Galia from Imperials ..

A few thoughts (no plot spoilers, but some discussion of mechanics) -
<br>
<br>Combat mechanics - This is probably the best turn-based combat game I&apos;ve ever played. I love the XCOM games, and the mechanics here while similar were, if anything, even better. As some reviewers pointed out, the integration of real-time and turn-based elements took a tiny bit of getting used to (hovering over the escape button after firing to avoid return fire, for example), but I found it led to more gripping and immersive gameplay than pure TBS games. (Incidentally, the actual combat mechanics reminded me strongly of Sega&apos;s own Shining Force games)
<br>
<br>Presentation - I was extremely impressed by how well designed the whole game was. The use of a history book as a framing device, the numerous fun things to do at HQ, the many additional challenges available in Hard/Expert skirmishes - all of this made it very easy to lose myself in the world (and the nitty gritty of choosing weapons upgrades to buy and which classes of troops to train next). Another incredible stand-out feature of the game, and one I wasn&apos;t expecting from a seven year old console game.
<br>
<br>Setting and story - I know some people have questioned whether it&apos;s tasteful to combine anime tropes with allusions to the bleakest events of WW2, but I thought that things were mostly done very tastefully. The continent of Europa felt very real to me, while also managing to remain distinctive and original despite its being a clear interpretation of Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. Incidentally, although you&apos;re in theory fighting Europa War 2, the game as a whole reminded me more of (the real life) World War 1 - the trenches of Naggiar, the green fields of Bruhl, the pastoral idyll shattered by horror of industrial war; not to mention the vast lumbering tanks and cloth-bound aeroplanes.
<br>
<br>Characters - I confess, I grinned a bit when I started playing because the characters seemed fairly archetypal. But they quickly grew on me, and one scene in particular took me by total surprise and had a real emotional impact on me. It&apos;s true that there&apos;s a simplicity and predictability to most of the characters - Alicia&apos;s never going to turn out to be an alcoholic former prostitute, let&apos;s be honest - but this worked well given the broader fable-like tone of the game, and the fact that the game&apos;s morality is fairly black and white (not in a crude way, of course - there are plenty of humanizing moments with the Imperials, and plenty of terrible people among the Gallians). I was also astonished at how effectively the characterization of your squadmates work - who&apos;d have thought you could slam together a pollen allergy, a sexual preference for men, a crush on Largo, a love of muscles, and a passion for blowing up tanks and end up with as a rich a character as Jann? I thought the depiction of squadmates was a textbook example of &quot;show don&apos;t tell&quot;, and it worked wonderfully - I quickly was sucked in their &apos;personalities&apos;, even though the game didn&apos;t show us much of them explicitly!
<br>
<br>The only thing that makes me really sad at this point is that I probably shouldn&apos;t hold out much hope for a proper sequel.  My heart tells me that here&apos;s a fantastic original Sega IP, with sales that vastly surpassed expectations when it was released on Steam last Fall and that has met with considerable critical acclaim, and that in Sega&apos;s new push for quality it&apos;s not impossible that we&apos;ll see a true sequel. But... my head tells me that it&apos;s unlikely after this much time has passed. Still, given the amazing older franchises we&apos;ve seen resurrected on Kickstarter lately, perhaps it&apos;s not impossible! In the meantime, I have a bunch of A ratings still to get...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valkyria-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=5639383">Expand</a></span>

<br>PROS:
- Beautiful comic book style graphics.
- The game uses fictional countries and nations, but definitely has a WW2 feel. If you like WW2 themes (I do), the game is great.

<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>- Beautiful comic book style graphics.
<br>- The game uses fictional countries and nations, but definitely has a WW2 feel. If you like WW2 themes (I do), the game is great.
<br>- Fine character development and touching story.
<br>- Good voice acting.
<br>- Good music.
<br>- Lots of tactical options. Every unit serves its purpose. Multiple options to win every battle.
<br>- Some levels are challenging, but as a person that sometimes has to refer to tutorials and FAQs, I was able to complete all by myself.
<br>
<br>MEH:
<br>- AI moves might be better. There are times when enemy is able to ruin you, but instead of destroying one tank, delivers equal number of attacks on both your tanks. So you have a feeling that AI goes easy on you. There is no difficulty setting.
<br>- Japanese dev had to squeeze a cute winged piglet there. It serves no purpose at all.
<br>- There are times where it is sort of naive, but it&apos;s still good.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>- Controls are sort of clunky, definitely prepared for gamepad, not a mouse.
<br>- Your tanks get stuck.
<br>- Some parts are unskippable, which may be painful, because sometimes you know you royally screwed up after enemy&apos;s first move and you&apos;ll need to reload from save for sure, but surprise surprise, you have to wait for enemy&apos;s all moves to do anything (it can take 2-5 minutes).
<br>
<br>As you can see, important stuff in the game is really good. There are some nuisance bugs and glitches, but it&apos;s all within norms. I recommend Valkyria Chronicles wholeheartedly.
