<br>Bad game that is not finished. Ridicules diplomacy where you get declared on by your race even when you have their real enemy on the map between you. Do not buy and give such greedy companies any more money when they shortchange us players all the time. Wait until the sales when u get everything hopefullly cheaper.</span>

<br>
<br>Overall the difficulty has been ramped up a bit as you&apos;ll now have to manage a new strategic resource called amber which is needed everywhere: buildings, tech, units and even your progression towards victory all rely on it. In the battles, Wood Elves need quite a bit more micro management than other races, but when you master them, they become very powerful indeed. The building trees and character skill trees are also more complicated than you&apos;d be used to.
<br>
<br>But if you&apos;ve already been playing the game with all the other races for many months, the challenge is more than welcome and the addition of Wood Elves gives Total War Warhammer a fresh feeling and adds a lots more hours of enjoyment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer---realm-of-the-wood-elves/user-reviews?user_review_id=6879059">Expand</a></span>
