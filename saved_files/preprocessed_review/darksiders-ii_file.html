Gorgeous characters and world design, great voice work and a real old school dungeon crawler feel with all the modern day bits from classic&apos;s like Zelda, Prince of Persia and Devil May Cry all thrown into the mix. You can quite readily approach the game at your own pace. Choosing to go off and pilfer and loot forgotten chests to your hearts content or follow the quest line and learn new abilities as you level up, earn ever improving weapons and armor and progress through this great tie in of a story to it&apos;s predecessor. Outside of the main game you have the new Arena mode which allows you to fight against wave after wave of enemies for increasingly better loot , be warned however, if you die you lose everything. This can really force you to up your game and gives the Arena a great sense of urgency, making each battle increasingly tense. The feeling when you know you&apos;ve earned a great reward and chosen to risk it all for the taste of something even sweeter is invigorating and how a game should be enjoyed. The combat indecently is very satisfying and pacey. Gone is the brute force and strength of War and in it&apos;s place a new sleeker combat system. If I were to liken it to something, then it would be a &apos;Devil May Cry light&apos; style of combat. You have your standard enemy grapple and main dual wielded weapons, intended for quick combos, pummeling your enemy before you dodge out of range again. Death is a lean combatant, he cannot parry or block enemy strikes so dodging will become your friend here. You also wield a heavier and incidentally slower secondary weapon which deals greater damage and can break through some tougher enemies defenses that Death&apos;s scythes cannot. A ranged pistol will soon become your ever present companion also, good for quick bursts of ranged damage. The pistol is less of a focus in Death&apos;s combat in comparison to his other weapons, the pistol being more integral to the games vast puzzles, which you frequently encounter along Deaths journey through conveniently parkour friendly architecture. Death will encounter environmental blockages he must traverse with an assortment of talents, from wall running, to climbing, to a ghostly grapple; swinging from point to point. All sprinkled with certain environmental items and golem helpers . Death can also often be found blowing holes in wall after wall with a toss of a bomb and a quick shot from the hip of your pistol, opening a new passage. Puzzles will reveal areas unreachable through standard adventuring and will reap the player rewards such as hulking chest which Death rips open in a triumphant smash of nether world magic to poor more loot into you hulking inventory or the ever elusive quest keys, which can be found throughout dungeons or as rewards from defeating the games many bosses. A boss battle in Darksiders II joins a rank of so few, that only games of the caliber of Shadow of the Colossus and Dark Souls can hope to rub shoulders with what&apos;s been accomplished in this game. Gone are the quick time events of old and anew we find a game where each Boss encountered is as gleeful and exhilarating to the player to enjoy as it clearly was for the creators to craft. Enemies will employ varyied tactics hoping to stop Death in his quest to reap them. Each encounter is compelling, often lasting several minutes and challenges the player to adapt, track the enemies patterns and discern how best to tackle these determined and monstrous opponents. These bosses may be the highlight of the game, but as Death you find yourself in a world so vast you will need to travel great distances to reach these encounters. Compared to the original, the game world and the playground Death now inhabits has grown in spades. Totaling 3 times it&apos;s predecessor. The environments are richly varied and detailed, the occasional muddy textures will be forgiven in the wake of such a masterfully crafted world. Death will not be alone on his journey. He can summon his trusty stead outside of cities and traverse the games many environments in a flash. The game offers a quick travel system also, making some task far less trivial and hastening you towards your next encounter. Many players may want to take the extra time to travel the land my horse back however. The music is exquisite and finds that balance so few games can find in allowing the music dip seamlessly into the background as you feel it express your adventure, your trials emote the world, it&apos;s environments. Death&apos;s journey through the game brings many joys to the player. The game seems to scream at the top of it&apos;s lungs it&apos;s unashamed to borrow from it&apos;s peers whole hardheartedly and concoct a new formula, blending the old with the new. When Death&apos;s adventure comes to a close, you will have learned many facts and stories about the world you inhabit. However, this game demands to be played again, going so far as to offering a Game+ mode for those who have completed it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2567563">Expand</a></span>

Tons of content, great voice acting, killer gameplay. You would have to be a fool to not realize that PC gamers are not the main revenue for developers, deal with it. Consoles took over years ago. That doesn&apos;t mean we should be neglected, but it also doesn&apos;t help to cry about it and miss out on a great game like this and pretend your 0 metacritic score is enough to matter. 0 really? Grow up. You are probably playing it right now with a **** eating grin on your face. I&apos;m 31 and have played more games than I want to admit, this is a great one.

<br>I&apos;d be giving this game a 9 IF IT WEREN&apos;T FOR THE FACT that at a certain point, I crashed to desktop which bugged out my game, preventing me from continuing the main quest line 13 hours in. This particular crash also happened to others, not just me. THQ, a game that breaks half way is a game not worth playing at all.
<br>
<br>I am extremely disappointed that such game breaking bugs exist, given that THQ&apos;s excuse for the delay of the game&apos;s release was to &apos;polish it up&apos;.

This could&apos;ve been a perfect PC title but Darksiders 2 suffers from an all too frequent developer flaw: the terrible PC port.  Let&apos;s nail it now: the video settings are HORRID.  Not only are they lacking video options but THEY DO NOT WORK.  Aside from the resolution settings the video options are useless.  I had to go use my NVidia control panel to remove the annoying tearing.  The V-Sync doesn&apos;t work properly.  The only way to get it to function (not entirely mind you) is to make sure the control panel forces it to work.  Not only that, but the triple buffering has to be disable in the control panel to make it function.  It&apos;s absolutely disgraceful that in this day and age, any game produced for the PC has such little regard for simple video settings. The other issue I had with the porting is the lack of key mapping on the number pad.  The directional keys are bound to the arrow keys on the number pad so the number pad keys of 2/4/6/8 can&apos;t be remapped along with the DEL or backspace keys.  Annoying.  Aside from these issues, I can&apos;t think of any other negatives.  This is simply a great game to play.  The plot is very well-thought along with the smart dialogue perfectly executed by the voice-over cast (actor Michael Wincott with a British accent).  It&apos;s a very entertaining, exciting and gripping story that strays from familiar plots.  The gameplay is well-thought out and easy to use.  There is a small problem with the &quot;quick-action&quot; logo that pops since it looks like a gamepad icon it doesn&apos;t make sense for it to be there.  The level designs are articulate and well crafted.  The production design is epic with such detail and creative environments.  The character designs are colorful, detailed and unique.  The foley work and voice-over sound great and are very well edited and pronounced.  The music score by Jesper Kyd is outstanding.  It&apos;s some of the best I&apos;ve ever heard in a game. The game mechanics are excellent.  I especially like the role-playing elements involving the weapons and gear.  The attributes are random and mix well with the other components that can be added to the character.  I liked the possessed weapons in particular.  Darksiders 2 is on par with it&apos;s predecessor and is just a little bit better overall.  It&apos;s an exciting game that is thrown into this amazingly created underworld.  It&apos;s quite the feat only marred with programmer laziness.  So close!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2949920">Expand</a></span>

<br>I wanted to like this game, because it looked pretty fun, but I cannot bring myself to play any further than the prologue. I&apos;ve scored this game a 2, because the combat mechanics are actually not bad, and there seems to be a pretty solid RPG element to it, but it is seriously undermined by developer laziness and/or incompetence.
<br>Avoid this game at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3157645">Expand</a></span>

It did not mindlessly combined ideas of other developers, to me it created its own Bible Arkham asylum. With this game it&apos;s different. I don&apos;t like it. First of all, I think it lacks story moments. Of 45 hours I spent in this game I had about 2 hours of story telling moments. I thing had the game length of the original, I would not notice this. But here it frustrated me. Secondly, the game artificially prolonged. Instead of one brilliant quest changing another with bullet speed, I go to one person for help, he sends me to another guy, the later needs me to clear 3 dungeons/floors/ collect orbs/crystals etc. You name it! How comes the game that handled quests presentation similar to Bayonetta and God of War, suddenly goes down to MMORPG-style? Next big problem - loot. I have nothing against it. I had my thumbs up for this opportunity. The case is, it is broken. In the original game, developer decided when you receive pieces of equipment, thus carefully selecting right moments to make battles interesting and challenging for you, because they knew how strong you gonna be when you reach this boss. Here developer can not determine that. You can rush forward through bosses, or you can farm experience and gold and become stronger. The result for me was: a) most of the enemies on Apocalyptic difficulty did not pose any threat for me and b) of 100 opened chests 98 chests contained garbage. In the original game, as you remember, every chest was useful, it was a treasure to find one already. It had lots of souls/artefact/map/life enhancer/demon meter enhancer. I really wanted to find all of them on the level. In Dirksiders 2 I don&apos;t care for chests. I already know they contain rubbish. As a result the game is easy for me and I changed my equipment 3 or 5 times. And without any enjoyment, because I was buying things from trader. What is the point of creating 1000 of equipment, when you need just 20-30 peaces of it?
<br>DLCs are a money sucking mockery - you get 2 hours of mediocre gameplay without interesting plot (you can not create interesting story in 2 hours) and innovative ideas. Compared with original game Darksiders 2 looks to me like Diablo III compared with Diablo II. It looks tempting, it feels empty. I witness MMORPG becoming more singleplayer engaging than singleplayer slashers. What a shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2709731">Expand</a></span>

If the story had more to it the length would&apos;t be a problem. But by the last 3 hrs I found myself hoping for the end so I could move on to other games.</span>

<br>
<br>When a game requires holding down two keys and pressing a third with the same hand, I know it&apos;s a crappy port. You can adjust the keys, but the on-screen display telling you to press something doesn&apos;t tell you which key, it shows some mysterious icon and you have to figure out what you&apos;re supposed to press. Pressing TAB to bring up your ability list takes over five seconds, so in combat you&apos;ll probably stick with a mash-the-attack-key strategy. However, at least in the first hour of the game, no other technique is required.
<br>
<br>There are lots of little things too, like your character can hold two dozen giant war hammers and battle axes, but only five healing potions. Or the run-along-the-wall button is the same as the jump button, so you frequently jump off a ledge by mistake. But this seems to be planned because you respawn where you were with no penalty, so then you start to wonder what&apos;s the point of the movement-based puzzles.
<br>
<br>Also, there&apos;s a big warning at the beginning that this game will ALWAYS track your playing data, and you are forced to watch the &quot;created by&quot; animations every single time you boot the game. So it doesn&apos;t seem like they really give a crap about the people giving them money.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, if you like games that reward learning a thousand different variations of key presses that are all &quot;kills the enemy&quot; (and want to stockpile gold to backtrack and buy them), you don&apos;t mind your personal data being tracked, and you like sitting back watching the screen do nothing half the time, you&apos;ll enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3281135">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t give it a higher score only because it had a ton of potential to be amazing all the way through. I loved the game, and wished they would of been able to keep making games, but it did get to the point where it was a little lame. Having to always get 3 items or 3 of something to further the story was a let down. Destroyed the immersion of the game. Also the tools you get are not really used too much accept for convenience of the current level you were on. There is a few exceptions, but other then that it felt like you were just lucky to have it right when it was needed. Other then that I felt the game was amazing. I&apos;m glad I was able to experience this game.

Yes and No. Character Death was very well done, especially if you have read the book, his sarcasm and witty jokes were amazing and so was his voice-acting. Story provided a lot of new information about Horsemen, Death/War, World, etc. The game focused more on RPG elements such as items but you didn&apos;t have to bother with them much since the game is relatively easy and 3/4 of gameplay you spend running around doing puzzles, only 1/4 is combat but that is nothing new compared to the previous game. The music is slightly better, it already was good in DSI, but now there are more different motives and from time to time I thought I was playing Prince of Persia. And where the game fails? Poor PC port. No proper video options, horrible aiming with gun/bombs. Another disappointing aspect of the game is difficulty. On Apocalypse it was fairly easy even without bothering with obtaining best gear only depending on what dropped from the stashes or Bosses. Final fight was was probably worst in the game history. The main boss did not inflict a single damage on Apocalypse and was dead faster than some minor bosses. And with the final boss going down goes the story, the end was horrible and it felt like it was rushed/written by someone else. Over and all, I gave the game 8/10. 20 hours fun with not-so-ordinary character Death, beautiful world design, story (omit the end). Main problems of the game are poor port, easy difficulty, weak ending.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2908343">Expand</a></span>

To start I was a bit of a fan of the first one cool story line neat char&apos;s plots epic boss battles and of course puzzles. This one was a bit of the same I think the boss fight was lacking compared to the first, and the puzzles where decent and fun way less challenging then the first. I did love how the char death tied in with war&apos;s story I felt kinda let down at the ending really all that work and then bam. So Con&apos;s of the game where : controls, my guy was jumping everywhere didn&apos;t go where I wanted him at times when I&apos;m jumping one cliff to the next he would fall and die.. kinda, good thing for tho&apos;s non death re-spawns or I don&apos;t think I would of finished it I&apos;m sure if i had a controller hooked up to my PC it would of made life easier.  Another was the game was basically one dimensional I mean I didn&apos;t really mind this but every mission was the same in a sense solve a lot of puzzles jump around fight for a short period of time and then boss rinse recycle repeat. Pro&apos;s the attacking system was really cool and the equipment that went a long with it was to make the deal even better. Graphics where nice everything looked like how a game should look now a day that animations style that is. Loved the story line big reason why i came back to this cuz the first was Awesome as will...So i would say this is a def a buy...Can&apos;t wait for the other horsemen!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2873524">Expand</a></span>

Although several reviews have said problems in graphics, I can not find them, if the cause is the graphics option from the shadows, you just put in the middle and start playing! The story has a plot and a very beautiful engagement. A final point in my first review, the game is excellent, it is a combination of hack-and-slashing with open world, skill tree like any other RPG, but that combined enough. Earlier in the game, you will get a little bored and very eager to get powerful, just be patient and calm to explore this magnificent game. You will not regret.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2929318">Expand</a></span>

The awesome combos are so fun to do i wish there was a replay camera. The skill tree actually works really  well and the powers you get are powerful but not overpowering. The loot you get it very nice (don&apos;t know why more people don&apos;t mention it) and the puzzles were very, very fun. The only reason this isn&apos;t a 10 is when you beat the game you have an option to start a new game with your character (not sure what that means) or continue and finish side quests. I decided I should finish the side quests, but what that does is restart right before the final boss so you have to fight him again. So essentially all the fun extra areas like the Crucible exist but there is no good way to get to them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3166399">Expand</a></span>

I had to change some of the bindings about as they were incredibly awkward and began to strain on my wrist but...I feel they improved the story a lot from the first game. It seemed more like an open world this time and I loved the wood setting and the field, brilliant ideas (although still a bit Zelda-like) One of the things I did not enjoy (don&apos;t slate me) Is the VAST amount of weaponry you could have. And you could obtain amazing weaponry from a silly little bug, which I found odd. I&apos;m walking around playing Death with my scythes and this butterfly pops out and gives me scythes that are twelve times better. Yes, there was little to no variety in the first game, but I believe they overstepped the variety in this one. And that&apos;s only by a tad. Gameplay wise, I felt it lasted longer. In the first game it was at a great pace at the start but then it just sped up. To tell you the truth, I remember more from this game than the first. And I just replayed the first in apocalyptic mode!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3305697">Expand</a></span>

<br>Combat system(repeating and stuttering but not challenging ):I thought the game is trying to create a fluid combat experience,but i was totally wrong.I played the apocalypse difficulty(with controller), while most of the foes can do the uninterruptable attacks ,that means when you are performing the chain attack you have to break it to dodge the attack,from the middle of the game,your foes are always use the uninterruptable attacks,and i mean your FOES.You can hardly finish you chain from then on.  At the later part of the game,almost all the combat i just use the dodge+forward+heavy(widow maker?)+dodge and light weapon to steal health.
<br>
<br>Camera:big problem.frustrating.While most combats take place in confine space,camera is really jerking  30% of time when i want to do a dodge forward+chain attack would become side dodge+normal attack AND miss!
<br>
<br>Map design:repeating dully prolonged.You need to solve the same puzzle many times in one dungeon.and there is no great puzzle like previous title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3647220">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t get as attached to the characters as the original. Sometimes you get that &quot;What was the point of this game again?&quot; feeling as the story doesn&apos;t really suck you in and you are occasionally reminded that you are on a mission instead of just randomly looking for stuff to kill. Dialogue is mostly interesting and humorous and you rarely find yourself skipping cut scenes to get back to the action.
<br>
<br>There is a good balance between combat and puzzles but sometimes you wish there was something else in there to break it all up. I&apos;m not sure what, but something. Occasionally you are shown a room full of jumping puzzles and you just cbf. Sometimes having to collected X number of items before you can fight the boss gives you the same feeling.
<br>
<br>While the graphics on the PC port are not perfect the art itself is quite impressive. It is a shame it wasn&apos;t ported with a bit more effort as a high end PC would have really made this game shine. Textures sometimes take me back to the late 90&apos;s, while the characters are bright and quite detailed at times the surroundings really lets them down. Forcing everything to max via your graphics card settings squeezes a little extra eye candy out of the engine.
<br>
<br>Combat is fun, fast and for a controller based game really not that repetitive. The variety of moves and weapons really puts this game in front. While some fights can drag on a bit the intensive action keeps the game alive. There is quite a variety of items and upgrades in the game and plenty of treasure to be found which makes the long and sometimes quite tricky jump puzzles worthwhile.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is a good sequel to the original and definitely worth the time if you&apos;re and action RPG fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2604673">Expand</a></span>

This game&apos;s story is quite average with no new ground breaking or thought provoking moral themes, but it serves the purpose well. The combat is reactive and fast pace, although I found everything to be a cake walk as soon as i built up some critical chance and got Achidna&apos;s fangs from the story--even on the hardest difficulty. The aesthetics in this game are very well done although disappointing because of the slightly below average port. The texture work is bad. Without changing the focus i can see whole millimeter pixels in the shadows. For some odd reason inventory is mapped to &quot;o&quot; and &quot;i&quot; just pauses. In order to remap keys you actually have to go into the items screen. The map system is annoying requiring you to click and drag a small white box over the location, but these end up being only slight hindrances. The video options are sparse through and through, but seeing as this is a port, remains unsurprising. The controls have failed me more than once in a high stress platforming situation; I often found Death doing the wrong context sensitive action in a lava-is-rising-you-need-to-get-out-now situation but never enough to cause a rage quit. Over all this is a solid game, not revolutionary, that is barely held back by the transfer from consoles to PCs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2580046">Expand</a></span>

Instead it was exactly like Darksiders I in every regard but far less engaging.  The story is very bland and difficult to be interested in.  Death&apos;s character was extremely uninteresting.  The combat a very standard hack and slash with press A over and over but sometimes with pauses between slashes to do a different variety of slashes with an occasional dodge here and a &quot;super demon mode&quot; there.  A drop system was added that doesn&apos;t really add provide a sense of progression since using one weapon over another may literally be the difference of hitting an enemy 2 more times or not. There are not even that many weapon or armor designs which means all you have to look forward to is different shades of gray, black, blue, or purple to wear through out the game of items you have already acquired.  The replay value is pretty much no existent since everything here can only be categorized as 8/10 which does not beckon people to play a game over and over again on various difficulties, especially when the lengthily and uninteresting dungeons are the core component of this game.
<br>The puzzles/dungeons were by far the most frustrating part of this game not because of their difficulty but there tediousness and uninspired designs.  I found myself figuring out the puzzles in the game at a max of 5 minutes but found myself spending 20 - 30 minutes carrying out all the actions to complete the puzzle.  Taking a long time to complete the puzzle is okay when it is actually fun to put to the pieces in place (see Portal series).  There is nothing fun about the executions of the burrowed designs from other successful and fun franchises (Zelda, Prince of Persia, Portal).  The portals, wall running, time traveling, gadget getting were fun in those other games because of their innovative nature and cleverness that left a sense of satisfaction in your head once you completed.  I can still remember the times I completed memorable puzzles and enjoying myself in the process from the previous games I listed.  I beat Darksiders II yesterday and I can&apos;t recall how a single puzzle looked now.  The only thing I remember clearly is how annoyingly and terrible the soul splitting puzzles were.  The moment you unlock this ability in the game is the when you experience the death of fun.  You can tell that Vigil was so proud of this design with how often they forced the player to do it.  But in actuality, there is nothing fun about putting a stone version of yourself on a platform and pushing yourself through a passage. In conclusion, Darksiders II meets the very definition of  &quot;Just Okay.&quot;  Everything Vigil used in this game came from very successful formulas, which is the core of the problem.  In order for people to really love a game, innovations need to be created and used effectively instead of copy and pasting popular elements from successful franchises.  Something needs to set the Darksiders series apart from the rest of the games out there but nothing comes to mind that does at this point.  I am noticing that Vigil is not the only studio that does this but actually almost every studio associated with THQ.  After playing Darksiders II, it is very clear why THQ is suffering financially.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2875081">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Don&apos;t believe all the negative reviews, try it for yourself, there are a lot of mixed reviews out there, but if you liked the first one this game is better on every single level! Almost plays like a completely different game! Hopefully Vigil/THQ will come up with some PC specific updates maybe a config file or something to tweak and a instruction manual would be nice too! Great Game! Would&apos;ve been a 10 if the graphics options weren&apos;t so handicapped.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2565463">Expand</a></span>

You play as Death, the fourth horseman, on a quest to prove your brother&apos;s innocence; this quest takes you through some amazingly well crafted and created realms and, unlike in the first game, introduces you to many more NPCs, each with their own distinct personality. Speaking of distinct personalities, it becomes quite clear from the first interaction that Death is very different than war; his personality ranges from badass criminal to just plain dickish, and he lacks War&apos;s patience and discipline. The voice acting for all of these NPCs is very well done and most of their characters are quite believable, though there are a few who are just a little wonky. As for the gameplay mechanics,  I like how Vigil tried to turn this into an RPG, and it was a pretty good effort. They included skill trees, loot, sidequests, and even a dialogue wheel. They haven&apos;t forgotten what made the original game great (more than EA can say. BURN!) ; the combat is still as dynamic as ever, and the puzzles are just as fun. The main problems I have with this game is that the one I played has more than just glitches; THQ made no effort to turn this into an acceptable PC port and everything (graphics, sound, gameplay) suffer for it. This is more than First Week Syndrome and some of these problems can&apos;t be solved by a patch. Is the PC gaming industry so dried up that game companies don&apos;t want to mke the effort anymore? All in all, though, the game is good and proof that a little respect for your creation goes a long way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2566776">Expand</a></span>

And for people saying &quot;this game looks awful&quot; I want you to step back and look at it for a second, yeah i know right, pretty awesome. yeah the game isn&apos;t as high fidelity as modern games, but at the same time modern games don&apos;t have art design thats this good either. the plot is fantastic and the characters are enjoyable and interesting. this game is totally worth picking up if you enjoy action games, or RPG&apos;s. its honestly one of the best games I&apos;ve played in a long time and that&apos;s saying a lot</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2567029">Expand</a></span>

The graphics do their job as they also did their job on the first game but the meat of this game is its gameplay and its amazing cast of characters and enemies along with breathtaking boss fights waiting for you on the game&apos;s multiple dungeons. This is better than the first game which was already amazing and is game of the year so far although Guild Wars 2 will probably take that prize.

Graphics arent always the primary thing when the artwork is simply superb and first class.  Gameplay balances perfectly the RPG and action elements. I dont know why people are complaining about this game and giving less than perfect ratings. Excellent Boss fights and awesome environments, and of course story and the characters and the lore perfectly fit to make the perfect and very enjoyable game. I very rarely enjoy games this much and darksiders 2 is on the top of the list. And please buy the game because THQ promised more darksiders game if this one did well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2568336">Expand</a></span>

Separate from all the crap textures and lack of graphical settings in the PC version that everybody is reporting, the game itself just rubs me the wrong way. After a lackluster spreadsheet intro that explains the plot of Darksiders 1 and your role in this new part, you are plopped down in a non-de-script world, hunting a man called the Crow-Lord because he knows how to resurrect humanity (how? why?). Seeing as how proving War&apos;s innocence starts with Death resurrecting humanity for some reason (how? why? what?).  Also, at one point in the past you collected a million dead souls, stuffed them into a talisman, and forced the Crow Lord to wear it, torturing him because all those souls never stop whispering in the Crow Lord&apos;s ears, because of....reasons...
<br>As you fight the Crow Lord to force him to open a portal to a world where you can start resurrecting humanity, he turns into War (Death is completely un-phased by this) but you kick the snot out of him regardless and with the Crow-Lord literally choking on your scythe, he opens the portal and throws the talisman at you, causing it to break and Death absorbs it into his right pec. Again, because of reasons. Yeah, if you are looking for a story that makes sense, do not play Darksiders 2, but regardless of the plot, as soon as you enter the next world, my biggest gripe with this game becomes evident. It&apos;s freaking World of Warcraft, only then as a single player game. There are loot drops from chests and mobs that are either upgrades or vendor trash, there are NPC&apos;s who send you all over the place to do their dirty work and there are even two talenttrees to pick from.  I am sorry, but NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, if I want to play World of Warcraft or any other kind of MMO, I will play those games. I want to play as Death, a **** force of nature. The Jack Bauer of video games. The Chuck Norris of the underworld. I do not want to spend time comparing gear stats and ponder about talents. Darksiders 1 was hardly original with green/red/yellow souls coming out of chests and mobs, but I prefer that system over gear and gold. And now we shall delve into the mosh pit that is the combat: it&apos;s fast (sometimes so fast that you can&apos;t even see where Death is), it&apos;s fluent and it flows very nicely...
<br>SO WHY THE **** DID THEY ATTACH SUCH A WORTHLESS CAMERA TO IT! I love getting hit by mobs that are off-screen, because that adds such a fantastic strategic layer to the game. There is no PoV option for this game in the PC-mode, so that only adds to the headache that you get from playing Darksiders 2 for longer than an hour. I was so looking forward to this, I was counting down the hours until launch, but Vigil studios just took my hopes and dreams, grinded it into a pulp, mixed it with pig meat and squeezed it into sausages ready to be sold at the next Oktoberfest in Germany, to feed the great ,drunken, unwashed masses. I normally buy my games from the bargain bin, only with very rare occassions do I purchase it full-price, and I felt that my 50 bucks would be justified in this case, especially as THQ is suffering financially. I wanted to help them out. Now I just want to see them burn.
<br>
<br>My advice would be to stay away from this game, and if you really feel the need to play this, get it on console, because the PC port is just abysmally bad and we shouldn&apos;t take this kind of travesty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574942">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not perfect as a score of 10 would imply, but it&apos;s very close. However, with the staggering amount of stupidity running rampant through the negative scores I figured I&apos;d give it the extra point just to try and help.
<br>
<br>As far as the game is concerned, it&apos;s stunning. Yes, visually there are no options to change and some may feel the graphics are dated...but honestly who cares? The game still looks good, and fits with the graphics of the first game. No graphics options is not, in ANY way, detracting from the experience of playing the game so there is absolutely no reason to rate something a 1 or 2 just because you&apos;re spoiled and feel privileged because most PC games have those options. But setting aside the very minor issue of graphics, everything else about the game is superb. I am about 13 hours in and have experienced absolutely no crashing, freezing, stuttering or any other hiccups in performance. The gameplay has been smooth, fun, and engaging. I like that Death is more agile than War was in the first game, and if you have to label the game a Prince of Persia clone for that then so be it...Prince of Persia is also a fantastic franchise, so if you&apos;re going to copy at least they copied something great.
<br>
<br>One review cited the questing as boring because it was all simple go and retrieve? Some of the quests are like this yes, as they are in any rpg, but most of the &quot;questing&quot; plays out exactly like it did for War in the first game. Maybe he didn&apos;t have NPCs at quest hubs telling him to do things, but he did have NPCs popping up and instructing him on his next course of action...it was exactly the same concept, so why is it so hard to swallow in this game?
<br>
<br>Next, the looting mechanics in the game. Simply put, they&apos;re great. Yes you do get a lot of crap gear, but every RPG is like that, so it&apos;s hardly something that warrants giving a game a low score...it&apos;s just part of the experience to get cheap vendor crap, and it makes it all the more special when you find that really rare item.
<br>
<br>The sound and music in the game are also among the best I&apos;ve had the pleasure of playing, and the voice acting is fantastic - Michael Wincott was the absolute perfect choice for Death, and his dialogue alone was enough to make the game enjoyable let alone the dialogue of everybody else. So in summation, this game is definitely worth the purchase. Yes, it&apos;s a console port...if that&apos;s really such a problem for you then well you have a serious case of entitlement. Use a controller and pretend you&apos;re playing it on the console...except, you know, you&apos;ll get actual patches for problems and stuff much more efficiently than people on console, but that bonus is worth giving up just to play on console and still not have graphics options right!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2567755">Expand</a></span>

<br>Enable V-sync in your graphic card&apos;s 3d settings. It fixed the problem for me and others. The higher resolution is worth getting it for the pc in and of itself. I haven&apos;t played much of the game, but I like what I&apos;ve played so far.</span>

Normaly I would give 8 but because of all that &quot;U have no graphic option&quot; reviews, I gave it 10 . By the way, If you&apos;re a graphic b***h,  you won&apos;t like this game. Nearly all games on pc are console ports. Keep in that mind.</span>

Ok so you set the resolution to 1920x1080, but it&apos;s not really 1920x1080, it&apos;s upscaled 720p from the consoles. Deaths shadow looks like a bunch of giant pixels, the screen tearing is terrible. Vsync is forced with two HD7770 cards in Catalyst Control Center, but it still doesn&apos;t work. Comparing Darksiders I and Darksiders II side by side, the first Darksiders is way better on the graphics. But the game has been fun so far, I can&apos;t complain about that. But it is a terrible mess of a game which should have been released on the Wii too. Nevertheless, I like the gameplay despite it&apos;s graphical setbacks, considering there are few games like these for PC, I&apos;d rather have it than not have it so I can show my console friends that I can play the same games as they do on my PC. Graphics could have been a lot better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2568342">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics are stunning, and Death himself is a badass. The new loot system, the talent trees, and getting my horse at the very beginning was much better than having to wait until over halfway through the game like the last one. Death is not War in any way, and that&apos;s great. He&apos;s his own person, has his own (wondrously unsavory) personality, and turning into the Grim Reaper as much as you do is satisfying. The puzzles are just as entertaining and frustrating as the last game. Though Dust can, at times, be a bit confusing when you&apos;re trying to find the right way, you&apos;ll usually figure it out (after a bit of head scratching).
<br>
<br>I was disappointed when I did not see Fury and Strife, as Vigil had promised us that, but perhaps the White and Black Riders will get their own games, eh?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570451">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s worse than the original, and unfortunately it&apos;s worse in almost every way.
<br>If we were to divide it into 10 parts, Darksiders 2 would be 3 parts 3d platformer, 3 parts scavenger hunt, 3 parts puzzle game and 1 part action game. See the problem here? They took all the wrong lessons from the first game and instead of giving us more and better combat, they settled doubling, tripling and even quadrupling the puzzle and platforming elements. It gets to the point where a good hour of gameplay has at most five minutes of combat in it. My question is why? Honestly, when did we decide three dimensional platforming was a good idea? Who decided this? Was there a vote I missed, because I feel unrepresented here... And why make a sequel to an action game, the worst parts of which were the endless and incredibly boring puzzle dungeons, almost entirely about platforming and puzzles? Yes, the combat is a bit better than it was in the first game, or at least slightly more varied. But you wont get to see it for the majority of your game time, because you&apos;ll be too busy searching for knick-knacks, struggling with the bad platforming or solving tedious and repetitive puzzles.
<br>Then we come to the story. Who&apos;s bright idea was it to take the game away from the devastated Earth and place the hero in a completely unknown and generic fantasy world with absolutely no connection or relevance to the plot of the first game? Why? Darksiders might as well have not existed and we could have called this game something else, and all you&apos;d have to change is half a dozen lines of dialogue to make it work. I find myself completely uninterested in the plot because of this, since the link to the first game and the characters and world I grew to like is so tenuous it might as well not be there. As a whole this is a very poor effort. It takes the worst from Darksiders 1 and magnifies it times five, then throws out the story completely and expects you to stay interested. The combat is it&apos;s only saving grace, but you get to do so little of that it&apos;s not much of a one. I&apos;d wait for a severe price cut before buying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2592428">Expand</a></span>

<br>So yeah it needs albeit refining of menus and what not but the underline is GAMEPLAY - and Darksiders 2 prevails so much that I never stopped enjoying it. (the whole 12h first apocalyptic run, going nightmare now :) )
<br>The infusion with RPG elements only made it better, the protagonist is clinical and Mary Sue  (like l like them
<br>) and u even get a couple of true lols.
<br>
<br>After first playthough:
<br>AWESOME gameplay,
<br>Great graphics (not top notch but hey its open world) ,
<br>Intense soundtrack ,
<br>Better story than the first one ,
<br>One tiny flaw is the port thing, in the beginning youll get confused but after awhile it will be better. 8.8 outa 10 defiantly one of the better games (if not the best) this summer</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2569114">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s pretty decent looking, but very few &quot;WOW!!&quot; moments for me.  A few things drag it down for me, dodgy controls on PC keyboard, lots of keys are missed, feels like they haven&apos;t made much effort to do it properly (I assume they focussed on controllers).  Quests are generally very poor, very simple, very unimaginative, the side quests are few and also devoid of any imagination.  At it&apos;s very worst DS2 uses the most dreary form of &apos;quest&apos; to death. Collectibles, f**k collectibles, it&apos;s the laziest easiest option and they overdo it, then overdo it some more, and then... overdo it again. The Arbiter&apos;s maze is another example of crushingly boring zone design.  I guess the Crucible is required by the genre, but given that you have that, the Maze shouldn&apos;t have existed at all.
<br>
<br>A few people have commented on the greatness of the score, I think they must be listening to a different soundtrack.  Several zones are poor, City of the Dead sounds like I&apos;m back in a hotel concourse listening to piano muzak, simply awful.  Entering the dead world you are greeted by overused flanging/phasing.  It&apos;s nice, but we have heard it before.  A very average score with some disastrous moments.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s very easy to get sucked in by the great combat and great looking art work, but large parts of this game are dreary, unimaginative and dull.
<br>

Going in depth, the gameplay is exactly the same as the Darksiders, with a &quot;switch&quot; in battle style to accentuate dual wielding, which is purely cosmetic. The story is not as engaging as the first game (which says a lot) and the puzzles feel a bit dumbed down (i&apos;m not sure if they secretly tried to cater to kids or whatever) and there&apos;s no real challenge other than an arduous test of patience since BACKTRACKING is the name of the game. There&apos;s a system present to simulate a loot driven RPG but that too feels superficial and somewhat out of place. It feels rushed and bland and not at all fun and engaging. Basically, you&apos;ll feel right at home if you&apos;re a die hard fan but everyone else might feel lost, confused and unmotivated to keep playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2816715">Expand</a></span>

The graphics , the sound , gameplay and story is perfect. -The graphics of the character and surroundings is really good.
<br>-And the sound is also good... from the music to the sound effects and voices. It really makes you feel like you are in the game.
<br>-The story is really good. You can feel the weight that &quot;death&quot; carries with him through the whole game, the souls of his kind ( the souls of the people that he killed ) trapped in the shards on his chest and that his brother &quot;War&quot; will soon be executed.
<br>-Gameplay... overall the gameplay is great. You loose touch of reality while playing the game just for a few minutes. And when you finally reach the end of the game you feel a great relief.
<br>The game shows you that 3d graphics that look like the real world are not what matters when it comes to a great game,That the music and story are what counts.
<br>Also the cut scenes and clips in the game were pretty good, some had a couple of jokes in them just to lighten the mood.
<br>In the game you will find a lot of items and chests , secrets , collectibles... and when i say &quot;a lot&quot; i mean  A LOT.There are also quite a lot of quests too.
<br>In the game you will find some familiar characters like: Vulgrim the merchant , The stone golems that you have to move using that loud horn..
<br>
<br>All of these things are why i loved this game and it deserves to be on the top 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2657099">Expand</a></span>

The game&apos;s fantasy world feels great, and the voice acting is also great, filled with unique accents and Death&apos;s smart-ass remarks. The combat is also very fun and mindless at times of course, despite the camera (i&apos;ll mention that later), although sometimes the input seems to not be able to catch up to you, resulting in Death not being able to perform the correct moves. Platforming is also alright, but sometimes it has its moments. For the completionist, there are many different scavenger hunts that can keep you occupied while still doing the main story. Now, the not so good. For starters, the camera doesn&apos;t care what angle you have on your enemy sometimes, and when being mobbed you better hope you can pull off some unseen moves on an enemy currently not in your view. Sometimes while platforming it is also prone to going off on strange angles, not allowing you to really see where the hell you&apos;re jumping to. The next big complaint is honestly the amount of platforming and puzzles that really put a damper on the fast paced combat. Each area generally has an arena event, but in between that are a bunch of very small groups of enemies, followed by large amounts of platforming to open a door, which then leads to another small group, which leads to doing another puzzle to open another door, rinse and repeat. Its like dining in a restaurant and being forced to eat small portions of your meal at a time, then being handed a Rubik&apos;s cube and  having to solve it before eating more. Some of the puzzles are brain dead easy, while some are simply confusing because you aren&apos;t quite sure where the objects are to achieve the next objective. The third biggest complaint is the fact that it is a poorly done direct port. The keyboard controls are bad, options are about 0,  and you can see the remnants of an Xbox port from a mile away (the most appalling is probably your character&apos;s model in the menus, rendered in glorious 800x600 resolution it would seem..). Slightly less game-breaking are a couple of features, such as armor and weapons. They are there, but their presence is not felt much, yet they still provide small bonuses. The DLC armor is also shortlived and lasts till about level 8-9, at which point it is mediocre. Dungeons feel very linear and are reminiscent of each other as well, and the story doesn&apos;t help this, being mediocre at best. Quests are no more than &quot;fetch this, kill him&quot;.
<br>
<br>TL;DR - Overall, this is a fun game, but by no means perfect.  The combat is fun, the world feels fantastic, and the platforming is passable. However, the (PC version) is marred by being poorly ported, average graphics, and bad controls, along with some potentially game breaking bugs. Besides the PC port, the game still suffers from linearity, bad camera, forgettable story, and  slowed down gameplay due to an overload of puzzles and platforming versus fast paced combat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2840984">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>With so many positives come some flaws, it&apos;s not perfect but ANY gamer who likes action/adventure should STRONGLY consider picking this up.  Negatives on the PC include the controls which are a bit difficult at times.  Aiming mode is odd for example.  Some settings are missing and you can tell it&apos;s a port (but I really didn&apos;t feel like I needed them).  You can you use an xbox controller, sure, but I used keyboard mouse - I have an xbox controller just didn&apos;t feel the need it here personally, and it was fine to finish the game for me.  Honestly I liked that all the abilities are available by keypress 0-9+ since I&apos;m used to that from PC gaming.
<br>
<br>If you like games such as Zelda, Fable, Kingdoms of Amalur, Fallout 3, Diablo, Prince of Persia, etc. and want something similar but maybe a bit darker then definitely get this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2859839">Expand</a></span>

<br>the game has few problems though. graphics arent really good. because the enviroment looks good, it makes up for it a bit, but when theres a cutscene and you have close-ups on characters and objects, you see how bad textures and character models are.the animations are inconsistent. finishers look great and opening doors is also pretty cool. combat animation are good, though they can be better. the running animation is pretty bad though. running also feels too slow. the story is bland. writing and characters are bad. voiceacting is also for the most part bad. the game tries to make a cool universe but it fails. the story was pretty forgetable. the open world is useless and doesnt make any real purpose. your horse is also pretty useless as you barely use him. the game is also a bit buggy. the aim redicle is just bad, and its a shame they released it. the aim redicle feels like a cheap port, and there are barely graphics options.
<br>overall, i sometimes enjoyed the game. it has a lot of problems, but sometimes i just couldnt stop playing because it was so amazing, but sometimes it was really boring and i didnt really want to play it. the game is just inconsistent in almost every aspect.  if you like this kind of game, you will enjoy it and in its best moments it will be great, just sometimes expect some boring segments and a bad port.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4080328">Expand</a></span>

Firstly, I played and enjoyed the first Darksiders but this game is radically different. They are both hack n slash games but this game seems to have something of an identity crisis. It wants to play the roles of both RPG and hack n slash and its weaker because of it. The story feels a bit pointless and you always seem to be sent on quests of 3 (that is kill 3 things, bring back 3 things, activate 3 things etc etc...).

Ok I had to start with that, not enough are saying it. The first mission of the game seems custom designed to illustrate just how restrictive the camera controls are and just how bad of a decision having wall running and jumping on the same button can be. Good luck exploring in this game, it&apos;s got lots of really bad platforming... =============================================================================
<br>Targeting units in battle is also a mess, which is to be expected in games like these so it&apos;s hard to take points off, but if an enemy so much as taps it breaks your attack combos, leaving the massively overpowered move I like to call &apos;jump hammer smash&apos; as your best option in most combat situations. The TERRIBLE controls aside, the game looks pretty good. The textures are ported poorly and there&apos;s a serious lack of options (I&apos;m playing PC), but aside from a few textures the game is gorgeous.  The story isn&apos;t great, but it&apos;s fairly well presented and interesting enough to keep you playing. The music is fantastic, and the in game cutscenes and cinematic are well presented. The game plays much like TLoZ: Twilight Princess combined with elements of LoK: Soul Eater, the puzzles are often straight forward and sometimes poorly thought out with no indication of how to proceed, but the game can be enjoyable once you get into it. =============================================================================
<br>If not for the TERRIBLE controls this game would be very easy to recommend. Unfortunately, as previously stated, the controls in this game are TERRIBLE, we&apos;re talking accidentally jumping to your death trying to run on walls, fighting with your camera to get a good view of a collectable you&apos;re trying to reach, not being able to see where you&apos;re supposed to jump to, hard to target enemies, poorly thought out contextual dodging (effected by camera over directions,  TERRIBLE idea). The Terribad controls in general are the only reason I can&apos;t give this an 8.0, if not for the controls this game would be great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2579876">Expand</a></span>

The intense combat, combined with an amazing storyline, incredibly designed dungeons, and freaking awesome RPG elements, make for a fantastic time playing this game. The dungeons can often prove challenging, but never overly so. And there are always new things to spice it up, be it portals or shadow clones. The RPG elements fit very nicely with the overall schema, with the loot being incredibly addictive and the leveling up always a joy. The graphics on PC may not be on par with other titles, but I honestly did not notice nor did I care. This is an amazing game, and easily in my top 5 games list. If you&apos;re main gripe is the poor PC port..... seriously? It may not be the best looking game ever, but its&apos; gameplay and story make up for that ten times over. RIP THQ, and good luck Vigil. I hope you continue this amazing series of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2919759">Expand</a></span>

<br>+Ability to use weapons that are not able to be equipped but environment use bring forth a new style of gameplay (reminiscent of Red Faction)
<br>+Visuals have been improved mainly with lighting and water effects
<br>+Voice acting is fantastic just like the first game
<br>+Music is much more memorable and fitting to the theme of the setting
<br>+3 DLCs feature additional enemies, bosses and areas.
<br>+Tons of sidequests which are not required part of the main storyline are included which add more to replay value and length of the game
<br>+New Game+ is included
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Storyline has some plot holes and conflicts with the first game
<br>-Ending and final battle scenes were done poorly and rushed
<br>-Glitches are rampant at some parts of the game such as going through the floor, not moving at all despite input of command and at some times certain events might not occur unless you reset the game.
<br>-Some textures are poorly made and look outdated for a 2012 game.
<br>-At some points in the game, sometimes the music or sound will stop even during a event or a battle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5183767">Expand</a></span>

Runs well on my computer, but I would have to say a drawback is the controls.  Definitely buy a gamepad or buy on console, but you will find it looks much better on PC.</span>

Despite the initial bugs, the three patches that have been released so far improved the game a lot (it loads faster, has more graphic options) = +1 to the final score. Death as the character is witty and ironic, a bit romantic in his quest to save War. The RPG elements, with skill trees and Diablo-ish looting system is well thought, though Achidna&apos;s Claws are OP and ruined the final experience, making the second part of the game a bit repetitive if you use them. What I enjoyed most, though, were the arenas and locations. Fighting is really the essence of Darksiders and I missed some kind of PvE battleground in the first part. Great choice here, chapeau! Finally, considering the attention by Vigil Games towards the community and the upcoming DLCs, I think Darksiders II is a solid piece of epic entertainment. So sad it isn&apos;t selling well...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2631960">Expand</a></span>

When it came out there were very limited graphics options, it crashed a lot, and I finally gave up in frustration when I kept getting the same freeze/crash at the same point in a boss fight late in the game.
<br>
<br>A year or so later and this game is finally in the state it deserves. Instead of War in his costume that looks like an explosion at a fantasy comic convention, we have Death. He is bare-chested, has an awesome skull mask, and focuses on leaping about and being quick for combat (rather than planting his feet and swinging a sword). He still seems to buy his footwear at the same place as War, though.
<br>
<br>The combat was a nice change, but can feel a bit button-mashy if you don&apos;t vary the moves chained together. Character development has moved away from the Zelda-esque system of the first game to a more standard RPG system, with skill trees, equipment with lots of numbers to look at, etc.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s lots to do, a big colourful post-apocalypse setting to explore, and decent comic-style graphics that match the grand atmosphere very well. Voice work was very good, with Michael Wincott a great choice for a gravel-voiced, sarcastic Death.
<br>
<br>On the down side, the camera is still a real pain in the backside, especially when faced with lots of enemies. Bugs still occasionally rear their heads, and yes there is the odd crash.
<br>
<br>As a game which is essentially a violent version of Zelda with a dark atmosphere and post biblical apocalypse setting though, I was definitely hooked. Budget price with all the addons now, so well worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3937025">Expand</a></span>

<br>Than the bugs: secondary attack stuck again, graphics changes to low resolution, game crashes and/or is not starting because &quot;this resolution is only allowed in windowed mode&quot;, or something like that. Can&apos;t turn into Reaper form because hotkey is not working (re-binding is not helping). Using special ability is annoying...have to stop the game, go to the menu, !!!SELECT THE ATTACK!!! I want to perform...come ooon, WHY???

The story is intriguing, epic and excellent, similarly to the first title, and really ties together with the first installment. More importantly, in Darksiders II, it seems the franchise finally made its own mark and stood above the rest by implementing new and creative twists such as RPG and platforming elements which finally distinguishes the title from Zelda and God of War which it has been compared to countless times.

Only issue I have is slight issue with the camera jerkyness, and some hotkeys use odd keys, like [O] for the inventory instead of [I] and when you go into the inventory, the same key pressed on that menu should leave it, but only [ESC] leaves menus. So, they could have brushed that up a bit.

Does it look and play well on PC, yes it does. The game is amazing. Story is surprisingly good. The gameplay and combat is visceral and awesome. The RPG elements (skill trees, loot, etc.) are very well crafted. And the character Death is just great. His dialogue and interactions make you think now this is how Death would act... And the world is open, doesn&apos;t feel constricted, but also doesn&apos;t feel like they were trying to do too much. People give is a 0 just because of specific options being disabled are probably the same people that gave Mass Effect 3 a 10/10 when it had limited options. I understand being upset at the limited graphical options etc, but they also claim in their reviews that the game is well-made and fun. So why not just dock a few points instead of giving it a 0/10? Doesn&apos;t make sense to me that you give a 0/10 to a game you admit is fun. Oh well, rant over. Don&apos;t let these reviews dissuade you from purchasing the game. Vigil and THQ have a real gem right here and I hope they build off of it for the next horseman game? (Strife maybe?) :) Hard to make a more captivating character than Death though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574634">Expand</a></span>

<br>As of writing this, i am 13 hours into the game, and despite some..fanatical &apos;reviewers&apos; on this site, i have experienced no game breaking bugs, no problem with the controls (which by the way can be changed through a keybinding menu, so i see no reason for anyone to have a problem), and since i just forced higher graphical settings through my graphics card UI, no problems with lack of graphics options (it takes less then 30 seconds to setup a game profile in your graphics card interface, where you can put whatever settings you want)
<br>The story can feel like it&apos;s put to the side at times. In the second dungeon, i almost completely forgot why i was there, i was too engrossed into the gameplay of the game, i hardly cared anyway.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a great game which will supply you with lots of entertainment, definitely worth it regardless of what console you get it on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2576763">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The economy system of the game is totaly wortless. I have a million bucks in game, still the most valuable weapon cost 14 000... whats the point of having that much money???? Plus, most loot or chest items are worthless, good only to be sold at a merchant. There is no balance in the economy system which ruins the point of having an economy system.
<br>
<br>The quest are sometimes interresting, sometimes very dull. The economy system was better in Darksiders 1, the quest were better, the graphic options were better.
<br>
<br>The only good thing in Darksiders 2 VS 1 is that you start with your horse.
<br>
<br>That said, dont buy this game at full price of 50$, just wait for a deal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2576968">Expand</a></span>

After playing the first one and getting totally hooked I was desperate for the sequel. Once I watched the trailer I started counting down the days wanting for more teasers. Finally it was released and I waited for what seemed like a life time to download. But lets skip that. First of all, this game is impossible to play with a keyboard and mouse. Even after I changed all the keys to my liking i still couldn&apos;t get used to it on a keyboard so I did have to buy a 360 controller wireless adaptor for my PC. However, let&apos;s start with the world Death wanders around in. First of all you start in the icy depths of Hell which is imaged &apos;right down to the &apos;tee&apos;. Huge sharp spikes emerge from the world, frost covered skeletons thaw from the ice and start to attack you, which straight away shows you the amazing combat system that Darksiders has to offer. Simple arcade hack and slash controls: X to attack with Death&apos;s signature double scythes which neatly fit together in certain combos to get a massive double ended scythe and Y to attack with your secondary weapon, which ranges from massive glaives and hammers, which attack slowly but do massive amounts of damage, and smaller claw hands or bucklers that attack with rapid speed but do less damage so the options are yours to play with. You also have B for executions and other moves. The combat combos are very simple and is all in the timing of the X or Y buttons and you can mix the two buttons together which makes Death seamlessly switch between the two creating bigger more damaging combos which visually is amazing to watch. You then get teleport to the Creators world which has been corrupted by something creatively named &apos;The Corruption&apos;. The creators world is quite standard with rolling hills of grass and forests. Everything you do in this world is to help the creators restore there old forge to help you get rid of &apos;The Corruption&apos;. However it is Deaths sole objective to free his brother War from imprisonment by any means possible so this traverse to the creators world didn&apos;t really hold much to the storyline however it does set everything for the game in place showing you all the techniques and abilities Death has to master. I won&apos;t explain any more of the worlds as this would be a spoiler. Darksiders 2 has now developed an RPG system. It has the same leveling up style as in number one i.e. 2 paths, one for magic and one for combat so Death can expand in either of these ways or a jack of both trades. They have also added in a hack and slash style of weapons. You will find many pairs of scythes all ranging in damage and different attributes etc. My only issue with this is that at certain points in the game you will discover &apos;uber&apos; weapons that make finding new weapons pointless as you have ultimate weapons in your hands already so this seemed like a silly design element to me however it does add something to the game for the first 75% of it. Another issue I had with this game is the objectives of the story. Every objective follows a theme. Which is doing the task 3 times! Many a time did become bored half way through a play session because I was doing the same thing 3 times. Each time wasn&apos;t harder or particularly different just rinse and repeat. This was disappointing as it made certain parts of the game drag. Another issue is the lack of guidance. You come across lots of dungeons in Darksiders 2 and many of them have 4-5 ways to go with a puzzle at the end but it doesn&apos;t explain which puzzle needs to eb done first to unlock something for the next so I spent hours in some dungeons basically getting lost. I don&apos;t want a game to be spelt out to me however I don&apos;t want to waste my time heading in the wrong direction trying to solve a puzzle that isn&apos;t actually solveable just yet. The game is free roam to an extent. You can go pretty much where you like however you will have to follow the linear path that the story depicts. Although it is free roam there isn&apos;t much to do in the world but the storyline. There will be enemies roaming around the world that you can kill, you can also try and get to chest that seem unreachable and hunt for side quest items but that&apos;s about it so the free roam isn&apos;t all that. Altogether I think I &apos;Hyped&apos; this game up to much. After the incredible first one I was hoping for the same but better and to be honest it&apos;s exactly the same in my opinion so I think I let it disappoint me because of my own actions. I still think it is a fantastic game and anyone looking for a good adventure game should definitely pick this up!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darksiders-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2633502">Expand</a></span>
