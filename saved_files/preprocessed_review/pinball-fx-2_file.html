Pinball FX2 has some absolutely gorgeous looking tables (37 in all as of this review). Really, the lighting, models, and animations are all top notch work. They are intricately designed and definitely eye-catching! You&apos;ll be excited to jump right in and see everything in action.
<br>
<br>And since these tables are all custom fictionalized works the designers were able to really go to town with them. A giant Darth Vader walking around the table, test tube aliens, Hulk going nuts, the Avengers fighting it out, ghosts flying around, cool looking water effects, lasers, video gamey minigames, and all kinds of other elaborate gimmicks!
<br>
<br>The voice work on the tables and sound effects are very appropriate when actually used and the physics for the most part are solid. Yes, there is some unnatural ball stickiness that tends to occur especially around the flippers, but I think it is done intentionally by the game designers to make the balls last longer (compared to traditional pinball tables which were designed to chew through quarters.) Honestly, I find it strips away much of the challenge and makes it too easy. You can literally play on a single ball for over an hour to the point you are just ready for it to end.
<br>
<br>And when I say &quot;just ready for it to end&quot; its because despite all the eye candy and seemingly intricate designs I found almost all of them to be a dull and lifeless experience. After you launch the ball an initial voice-over plays to get you pumped up and then... the table just kinda dies. You&apos;ll basically find yourself listening to the background music and the sound of the flippers flip&apos;flappin&apos; while the rest of the table takes a nap. Its like playing the old simpleton pinball tables of days gone past where getting the ball to finally hit the 3 bumpers at the top and bounce around for for a few seconds was the most exciting thing to happen.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll give Microsoft/Zen Studios a lot of credit for the effort, but I think I just realized what made companies like Bally/Williams and Stern so great. Its not enough to make the table look like fun it actually has to be fun. That crazy hyperactive audio/visual sensory overdose you&apos;d get from playing the classics and their ability to immediately kick into high gear and not let up until the ball slips past your ever vigilant flippers is something Pinball FX just failed to replicate for me.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll go ahead and give this game an 8 just because I&apos;m sure some will like it (maybe even love it) and I can tell the company really gave it everything they had, but for me personally I&apos;m going to go back to the tried and true classic experience that Pinball FX tables will never be able to provide me with...  they just don&apos;t have the magic touch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pinball-fx-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3814149">Expand</a></span>

<br>That is a free table to play, and i think it&apos;s one of the better. Just try... :)
<br>
<br>Despite the problems at launch, they manage to fix them all.
<br>They put the &quot;free to play&quot; label, although at this time Pinball FX had no free tables. A lot of people refuses to buy and a little before they change the label, lastly including the free table. Now the game can be named free to play, but they decided to don&apos;t.
<br>
<br>I really enjoy all tables i bought until now. And worth the full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pinball-fx-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4015122">Expand</a></span>

Pinball FX2 is quite simply the best pinball game I&apos;ve played because of it&apos;s nice interpretation of the game along with good physics and an excellent variety of tables.
<br>
<br>You play against your friends via high scores as you&apos;d imagine but there is also a &apos;super score&apos; feature that adds all your millions up to a total across all tables which adds to the dynamic but clearly a bid to get you to buy more tables but hey ho, they&apos;re a business not charity.
<br>
<br>The fun factor, pick up n play factor and casual set out makes this one of my current favourite additions to my Steam collection.  If you&apos;re a PC gamer most of your games will probably be serious and competitive, this allows you to have a break and calm down.
<br>
<br>As far as buying this game goes you don&apos;t need to, the Steam version comes with a free table...the free table actually being a very good one too, one which so far I&apos;ve totalled a few hours playing alone.  All tables have a try before buy download which is why I&apos;m keeping this review short and sweet, simply because it only takes a steam account to get playing it.
<br>
<br>The only downside to this game is in a sense the tables aren&apos;t based on a simulation due to the graphical intervention (you&apos;ll see what I mean).  There are no simple tables for that matter which whilst I loved when I first got it, sometimes a simple realistic table would make this game more diverse and appeal to the sim lover too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pinball-fx-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3931263">Expand</a></span>

<br>I got it for next to nothing in the Humble Bundle, so can&apos;t comment on value.
<br>
<br>It&apos;d the only pinball game I have tried that compares favourably with Pinball Dreams and Fantasies on the old Amiga. If you loved those as I did, you&apos;ll love this!</span>

And though the Pinball FX 2 tables are fun and clever in their own way, they are distinctly and exclusively digital.  As such, its flipper physics will feel strange to anyone who cut their pinball teeth on a physical machine, or even the tables digitally recreated in Farsight Studios&apos; Pinball Arcade (its chief competition), which mimic real-world feel and physics far more accurately.  Old-school pinball players, such as myself, will likely find this to be PFX2&apos;s greatest weakness.  Others will simply decide it&apos;s a matter of personal preference.
<br>
<br>On the flip side (pun intended), PFX2 enjoys the freedom from real-world constraints in a number of admittedly novel ways.  The table &quot;Rome,&quot; for example, features burning torches, a flowing aquaduct, and a shooter that uses ropes, pulleys and counterweights in place of springs for a tongue-in-cheek touch of first-century &quot;realism.&quot;  Other tables feature a wide variety of playfield toys that would be similarly impossible in a real-world table, such as the Tesla coil in &quot;Tesla.&quot;
<br>
<br>For all PFX2&apos;s departures into the realm of the fantastic, however, none of Zen&apos;s tables rely on any device essential to play that couldn&apos;t be recreated on a physical table, at least to this reviewer&apos;s knowledge.  Nor is there ever a suspension of &quot;natural&quot; physics (e.g. anti-gravity beams that float the ball).  The ways in which PFX2 departs from reality are strictly cosmetic.  The essence of pinball is the visceral interaction between the player and a physical device made of wood, steel, rubber, and plastic.  This accounts for much of what makes pinball so enjoyable.  Zen shows great wisdom and restraint in observing these facts, and is better for it.
<br>
<br>So, should you, the pinball afficionado whose love for the silver ball predates the PC, buy Pinball FX 2?  Yes, if only to help keep the idea of pinball alive in the minds of younger generations, until the day when physical pinball machines once again rule the neighborhood arcade.  You might even enjoy it.
<br>
<br>And should you, the younger gamer, who never experienced the brilliant rays of wonder and awe that shone from video and pinball arcades in the 1970s, &apos;80s, and early &apos;90s, spend your money on such an archaic form of entertainment?  Yes.  But don&apos;t be satisfied until you&apos;ve found a real-world pinball table at a nearby bowling alley or arcade.  Proceed to feed it quarter after quarter.  And within $10 you will begin to experience the unparalleled, magic sensation of touching the soul of a machine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pinball-fx-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4406867">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I really enjoy the Windows Store version that comes with the Mars table. Being a big fan of the original Pinball that shipped with Windows XP, the game takes the classic to another level with HD graphics, lots of tables, and cool side attractions. My only gripe is the fact you have to pay for other tables vs. an unlocking scheme. The Xbox integration is really good too.</span>

Would have liked to have seen more tables available at release (as the game is basically &quot;pay for the pack of tables you want&quot;) but they give you a &quot;try before you buy&quot; option for every table and more are on the way. Definitely worth picking up if you&apos;re a pinball enthusiast.

It has a good variety of tables to choose from like a few different Star Wars, and around 10 Marvel tables (developers need to do a MAXIMUM CARNAGE table, nuff said), along with other themes... There is even a FREE table to play now, since the last update... Physics are excellent... Character animations are cool to watch... Music is great... Voice acting is decent... Leaderboards to chase your friends on for bragging rights... Plug a controller up to your PC, route it to the big screen, kick back and enjoy... I give it a 9 for what it is, and that is a Great Pinball game...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pinball-fx-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3278319">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not pinball for pinball fans, it&apos;s pinball for fans of other things who want a &quot;themed pinball&quot; experience that is forgiving, simplistic, outrageous/action packed, full of unrealistic special effects, and not comparable to real pinball in any way except in appearance and scoring. Inaccurate but predictable ball physics and poorly designed levels mean you can spend 30 minutes racking up a high score doing the exact same things over, and over, and over, and over, only to find out not only is it not a high score, but there are dozens of pinball losers out there that have played the table for LITERALLY DAYS, 24+ HOURS, to get a score so ridiculous you wonder what the point of the game might be? It isn&apos;t fun for very long, it&apos;s VERY repetitive (you get bored frequently long before you run out of balls), there&apos;s no real target to shoot for scorewise, and there are maybe 5 good tables out of the 40 or whatever that are available. Oh, and the tables: weird, weird stuff. More than half the tables are superhero themed, Marvel and such, I don&apos;t know for sure I&apos;m a pinball fan not a comic book fan. Also a lot of Euro Football Club (FC) themed tables were just added recently. I don&apos;t know, I&apos;m not a football fan, I&apos;m a pinball fan. There&apos;s a Plants vs Zombies table, but I&apos;m not a PvZ fan... I&apos;m a pinball fan. Seeing a trend?
<br>
<br>UPDATE 10/9/2014: This week Pinball FX2 got a 3.2gb patch that added Stereo Sound. Yup, stereo sound for 3.2gb, with still no update for multi monitors, physics, pincab setups, or a huge list of other things the community has demanded for years. Deleted. For good this time.
<br>
<br>UPDATE 6/1/2015: HAHAHAHAHAH @ this new EULA. Signing away all your rights to privacy, agreeing to 3rd party targeted advertising, giving Zen unlimited freedom to do anything they want with every piece of information you supply to them while using this game or your pinball account, and even forcing you to agree to 3rd party advertising privacy policies JUST TO PLAY THE GAME? What could possibly go wrong! I haven&apos;t touched this title in ages but at least it still provides comedy from time to time. Good thing I like black humor, eh?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pinball-fx-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6338411">Expand</a></span>

<br>+++ PHYSICS: This is what pinball games and real pinball machines hinge on - if the table physics are off, you won&apos;t enjoy it. &quot;Out of the box&quot; the flippers lagged terribly for me. There was a delay of maybe 300ms which made it unplayable. Luckily there is an easy fix out there via some graphics cards settings which remedies the problems almost completely. I say &quot;almost&quot; since there still is an extremely small delay, but certainly no more than on a real-life pinball machine.
<br>
<br>That issue aside, on some tables the ball feels heavier than on others, but this is the same with actual pinball machines depending on their gradient. All other physics seem perfectly fine and believable, if you take away all the many special effects which you&apos;ll never get in real life!
<br>
<br>+++ GRAPHICS: Not much to moan about here. The colours are vibrant and enhance immersion. Reflections and glares are realistic (as long as you turn off ball traces!) and really add to a super-fun experience.
<br>
<br>What you won&apos;t see in real life are all the many special effects that have been added to the tables - X-wing fighters shooting lasers across the table, action figures coming to life and playing out fight sequences on the side of the table, and a myriad of other sweet gimmicks that you&apos;ll have fun encountering. Some tables include cut scenes to introduce the story lines. You can see that a lot of work and loving attention has been put into the design, and it really pays off.
<br>
<br>+++ SOUND: Really impressive. The typical sounds are all there, give you the necessary feedback and are very appropriate, but added into the mix are the sounds for all the added effects, which make it all so much more satisfying. The tables really come to life with all the whirrs, clangs, voice-overs and fanfares, and it never stops. The only complaint one could have is that at times there&apos;s too much going on!
<br>
<br>+++ DESIGN: The tables are very varied in their designs and contain an abundance of hidden surprises to unlock. Some of the ramps are totally outrageous, and it&apos;s a lot of fun learning where the unlocks are and where to shoot to get further into the table. Ball runs are very well balanced.
<br>
<br>+++ GAMEPLAY: This simulator is sometimes challenging, but never unforgiving. It&apos;s possible to get a real feel for each table and get better over time, which is about the best verdict you could give for a pinball game. All the pro player moves like trapping balls on the flippers, moving them over from one side to the other and skill-shooting are possible and can be learned by practice. It&apos;s all very smooth and enjoyable and suits both casual players as well as a more seasoned veterans.
<br>
<br>OVERALL VERDICT: 9/10 - very little to complain about, extremely satisfying gameplay, 1 point deducted for the initial issue with the input lag on the flippers. Info on remedies can be found on the Steam forums.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pinball-fx-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4784957">Expand</a></span>

But it&apos;s been around for as long as most people can remember, and as far as I can tell, it&apos;s not going anywhere anytime soon. And I&apos;m totally okay with that, because it&apos;s usually the simplest games that are the most fun to play, and are typically the hardest to master. At least, I think people can master pinball.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve ever played pinball and enjoyed it, then I&apos;m sure there was something about the machine that drew you to it in particular; maybe it was &apos;Star Wars&apos; themed, or maybe it was modeled after &#x2018;NASCAR&#x2019;, or perhaps you liked the one based on &apos;The Sopranos&apos;; regardless of your taste, the beauty of &apos;Pinball FX&apos; is how many choices you get in tables. It&apos;s got everything you could ask for in terms of themes, and each table offers it&apos;s own unique story and intricacies, making them all feel different and original. And new ones are still being released too, so there&#x2019;s always something to look forward to up on the horizon.
<br>
<br>Despite the significant drop in popularity, pinball machines are still being produced today, and typically appear in bars for drunks to enjoy. But if there aren&#x2019;t any in sight, and you still feel the need to get your pinball on, this is a great replacement to sit back with a sixer, and try and run up some high scores. And the best part about each table is that you get to test it out for a few minutes before deciding whether or not you want to purchase it. There are a few pinball games on Steam, but I have to assume this is the best one out there.
