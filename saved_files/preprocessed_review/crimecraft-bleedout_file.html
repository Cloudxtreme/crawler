I played for 18 months now, but in case of anti-cheat policy really nothing changed. The game, especially EU Server (Cabrese) is still infested with cheaters.
<br>Mayn games does nothing against them, but is shutti
<br>ng down any public discussion on the matter. The ongoing threatening of legit players who try to fight the worst cheaters is leading to the wrong &quot;feeling&quot; that the game has no problems with cheaters at all.
<br>But the exact opposite is the case.
<br>Old developers of CrimeCraft develop and sell commercial cheater clients to their russian and ukrainian customers. Known cheaters return, even if banned, the very next day with new account and new nickname, but the same old cheats.
<br>Some players have build up an economy on selling lvl 50 accounts to those hackers to supply them with always new and easy accounts to have their wicked fun.
<br>
<br>The biggest gangs, iNSANEs, MAD, Redemption and LUCIFER are all protecting cheaters, because they are helping them to dominate Territory wars or carry them to their daily and weekly tournament victories.
<br>
<br>Dont get me wrong, there are good players in this game and you usually feel it when you face them. But there are also many cheaters who basically have a good skill, but cheat to be just the best.
<br>
<br>Typical cheaters will use the SIGMA SMG or Raskolnikow LMG because that way they can get the biggest benefit of the usual aimbot.
<br>Just watch their reactions when you shoot at a cheater, especially from far away. They will turn fast in all directons, randomly spraying bullets because they think you are right behind them and try to get a lock with their aimbot. It looks kinda funny.
<br>Also good indicators are very high mouse sensitivites that you can see in spectator mode. They move like they had some spasmic problems, but as soon as they lock on target, the crosshair stays cool and clear on the target until its dead.
<br>
<br>So, this game cannot be recommended at all.
<br>Paying money for it is like throwing it out of the window, because after all, it also turned pay2win and there are people who spend hundreds of dollars per month (!) for their equipment (there is evidence now, Mayn started an event to see who spends most money. The winners have a special title now &quot;Fat Cat&quot;.
<br>
<br>So you can chose: play the game and be owned by cheaters that are protected by the development
<br>Or: play the game and be owned by ppl who spent more money on it.
<br>
<br>You will never win a daily tournament unless you befriend with the biggest **** in this game (B3AST of Mad gang, cheater himself, Highness of Redemption, the oldest russian cheater gang on the server, or NeferTITI from iNSANEs, a really mentally retarded person with many asslickers arround him.
<br>Or LUCIFER where a russian girl named KITIKEN keeps hacking with always new accounts (currently named &quot;Bloodsisters&quot;.
<br>
<br>Have fun.
<br>
<br>By the way: soon there will be games coming out that beat CrimeCraft in its unique playing style. No need to start it so far...
<br>
<br>(Mercenary Ops for example. Turkish beta already started (M.A.R.S. Online).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft-bleedout/user-reviews?user_review_id=2823756">Expand</a></span>

The reason for that is the game paly and story line to the game and the fact that u  can do so many things in crime craft. You can pvp or pve or if u wantto have some real fun and you hook up with a gang you can gang battle to see who the best gang really is. Since i have stared playing there has been alot of changes and problem but vogster dose there  best to fix any little problem that u find or have. if i was to rate this game right now out of 10 stars i would give it a eight. just cause this is one of the best third person mmos that i have played in along time. I dont think i will ever go back to playing world of warcraft cause it is the same thing over and over. At least here you have a choice of what you can do and the maps are fun some good sniper maps if that what u like to do. There are also some great closed combat maps as well.  I think it would be good to check out if  you like shooters and mmos i am glad i did cause i found my home and that is the city of sunrise were even though u fight to the death in battle you alway make allies through the city of sunrise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft-bleedout/user-reviews?user_review_id=1449820">Expand</a></span>

I found CrimeCraft almost 2 years ago and it has non-stop been blowing my mine since then. Patch after patch released with New Content and fixes that continue to blow my mind. I didnt think it could get any better until I got to Beta Test for the Bleedout expansion, and let me tell u i didnt think it was possible but yet again my mind is blown. I literally find myself at work and school with nothing on my mind except crimecraft, i cant wait to get home or off just so i can play it. Its not even just the game itself i have such a great time interacting with the great player base in chat and on the extremely active game forums were we share videos/pictures/stories and anything else that tickles our fancy and passes time. The game is def on the right track by taking the time to listen to the people who make the game what it is &quot;The Players&quot; I dont see me going anywhere for a long time if this keeps up....... Crime Craft u complete me.

The PvP combat was nicely balanced, even when low and high levels are fighting each other. The different game modes were interesting and challenging. Modifying your weapons and crafting items had an addicting effect on me. But most importantly: the micro transaction system did not imbalance the game. The game never gave me the feeling I have to buy stuff to advance in the game and most items can be crafted or bought without the use of real money. Well done I say, my hat is off to you!<br>What I didn&apos;t like about the game is how boring and limited the PvE combat is. There are only 2 real PvE game modes, versus 10 PvP modes. The developers dug their own grave with this, because they&apos;ll miss out on a HUGE group of potential paying customers, like me. Secondly, I hate the fact that you can not jump. Whatever the reason behind it may be, it&apos;s probably not good enough. Why make a fast paced action game and disable that which makes the game so much more dynamic? Some of the level designs SCREAM for a little jump over the edge! Lastly, I hate the fact that every single female character looks like a prostitute in this game. I know this is a hot issue lately, but in this game it&apos;s almost laughably exaggerated. There are a lot of female gamers and I don&apos;t think they all enjoy entering a fire fight wearing high heels, a hot pants and bikini top.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft-bleedout/user-reviews?user_review_id=1783465">Expand</a></span>

The only reason I can see why people say it&apos;s a bad game is because they haven&apos;t made it past level 10. The intro does suck pretty hard admittedly, but just push through the tutorial and make it to the first city and it will be a lot better and more rewarding then. And if you don&apos;t like playing PvP, there are maps only oriented to PvE play. And personally, I like PvE games anyways, so it worked out wonderfully for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crimecraft-bleedout/user-reviews?user_review_id=2141777">Expand</a></span>
