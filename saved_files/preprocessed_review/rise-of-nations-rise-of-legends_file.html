It was sharper, the visuals were better, the soundtrack was better, the art design is still gorgeous to this day and it trimmed the fat of the bloated resource system that bogged down its predecessor.  The hero units were really implemented and the entire game is so startling different that I&apos;m amazed at the number of people who haven&apos;t heard of it.  It was a rough year for Big Huge Games, as I expect they had trouble presenting it as any sort of &quot;sequel&quot; to Rise of Nations.  Take one look at the box for the original PC release and you&apos;ll see the problem, &quot;Rise Of Nations: Rise of Legends.&quot;  Why on earth they featured this bizarre half-attempt at connecting it to their novice first title I still don&apos;t know.  It doomed the game effectively, as I&apos;m sure many who bought it were not clear how different the game was structured compared to the ridiculously popular &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; and &quot;Rise of Nations: Patriots and thrones.&quot;  The three factions in the game are all beautifully designed, though equally similar in terms of how they play.  Their are only two resources now, which works out just perfectly for a such a fast paced real time strategy game of this kind.  This is a game where matches can last just twenty minutes, so I&apos;m sure the change-up from the lengthy Rise of Nations confused many new players.  The Cuotl, the Vinci, and the Alin are all so enormously realized, that many should give it kudos for taking something entirely new and fresh for once.  The combat system is much tighter this time around, the hero abilities and powers are the chief focus in most battles, which takes a lot of heat off the player constantly activating unit abilities alongside.  Yet, what happened?  The game had everything to offer to new players and still fell short.  Who knows really.  It was a bad year for Big Huge Games, but its been many great years since of falling in love with this wonderful world they&apos;ve created set apart from the scourge of their beginnings.  If you haven&apos;t played this game, you really aren&apos;t a fan of RTS games I&apos;m afraid.  It still has so much to offer and though lacking in a solid single player campaign, the skirmish mode is incredibly fun and their is no doubt in my mind- you will have a great time with this game should you play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-nations-rise-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=3615216">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>A very original game. It comes up with new consepts as well as taking old ones. This is a must have game for anyone who loves to play games. But i must admit that the storie line is a bit weak. Also, there really isnt many campains for you to do. Still it takes my vote for one of the greatest games of the year! It truley is something to behold.</span>

After playing the Demo for countless hours of amazing fun i never once repeated what i did on the same level. Its fun and amazing and a complete whole new gameing experience then the orginal RON. Which is why this game is a must for RTS fans.</span>

This game is everything it was supposed to be. It is an engaging RTS. The demos didn&apos;t even scratch the surface of what is available. There are a sufficient number of maps to play in skirmish mode. The three races to choose from are all truely unique. I&apos;m even enjoying the campaign, which is unusual for me. The graphics are great, as is the music. The overall sound design is a tad weak, but still OK. Even after playing nonstop for 10 hours, I haven&apos;t even put a dent in this game. It will take me a great deal of will power to go outside this summer. This game will have me putting away my copy of Age of Empires III.

By the way, I think that the developers of the game are watching Sci-Fi&apos;s Stargate series, because the Egyptians w/lasers race is just like the Goa&apos;uld. Both races have used their uber-tech to set themselves up as gods for the the other races, and their cultures are similar to the ancient Egyptians. Awesomely diverse. Each race uses an entirely different unit set and strategy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-nations-rise-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=388114">Expand</a></span>

Cutscenes have poor animation, and the repetition of godlike enemy - kill godlike enemy - move on to another godlike enemy gets old. All in all, its like a step sideways for RTS in general. What really pissed me off was the fact that the conquer the world gameplay, which is the reason I bought it, is only available in campaign mode. I really would like to see more RISK/Starcraft integration here, but I guess thats up to LOTR Battle for MIddle Earth 2 and Rome Total War.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-nations-rise-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=389283">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m surprised so many people compare this game to &apos;age of empires&apos; or &apos;rise of nations&apos;, because legends is not an &apos;advance through history&apos; style game. Nations is closer to Command &amp; Conquer Generals, Dawn of war, Warlords battlecry, Act or War etc. (games with 2 or 3 races, 2 resources and a single time period). Pros: No builder type units needed, yeah! Very Cool flying units. Pause and still give orders Excellent interface. Neutral buildings to capture for bonus Very Good AI Board game style strategic map. Territory boundries affect gameplay 2 resources (i don&apos;t like more than 2, ideally just 1) Cons: Online multiplayer is sparse. Need an above average computer to play.

The RTS aspects of Rise of Nations were undeniably the most entertaining part, which accounts for why Rise of Legends is still fun--and it IS still fun, especially for more casual gamers (like myself) who want the thrill of watching waves of soldiers overrun enemy installations without any of the skull sweat involved in other genre gems like WarCraft 3 (ugh, micromanaging!) or Homeworld (ugh, 3D navigation!). But RoN was enhanced, not shackled, by the infusion of 4X elements; by taking the &quot;Nations&quot; part out of RoL, Big Huge has left us with a game that looks gorgeous but plays like a rather tame StarCraft. It&apos;s a better RTS, but a worse game--and, seriously, how many more of those do we need?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-nations-rise-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=408760">Expand</a></span>

It answers the question of, &quot;What if Rome never fell, and Leonado had become the great inventor -- rather than Edison or Newton, etc.?&quot; It answers the question of &quot;What if the Age of Mythology existed &amp; never ended?&quot; Finally, it answers the question of, &quot;What if we add some aliens into the mix?&quot; Rise of Legends has gameplay that is very similar to Rise of Nations. It continues to use the concept of national borders. When enemy units cross these borders, they suffer attrition. In addition, one can&apos;t normally build any buildings outside these borders. This should be familiar to those that have played Rise of Nations. However, Rise of Nations also adds in a town center system similar to Age of Mythology&apos;s where you are only allowed to build a city after occupying an existing city. All cities not occupied by enemies or allies are guarded by neutral parties. In some cases, you can buy the allegiance of these neutral sites. In addition to cities there are also other types of neutral sites that have various benefits to your nation when captured. Another aspect of Age of Mythology that was incorporated into this game is that each civilization has three unique heroes that can be summoned during gameplay. If you play the campaigns, you might have even more than that at your disposal. The final aspect of the game that was borrowed from the &quot;Age of&quot; series, are some well written campaigns. There are three campaigns that have multiple scenarios, and a story in the background -- along with a final goal. Like Rise of Nations, you choose your scenarios from a larger world map. Unlike Rise of Nations, a story was developed that guides you through the map. The result is that each game has familiar characters -- even the &quot;random map&quot; games. There is enough variety in the technologies that you could play the same game over again a few times, and it wouldn&apos;t necessarily turn out the same. For one civilization in particular, you have to choose from three different technologies when you upgrade. You can only choose one. Random map games are also made more interesting, because occasionally, the map will be rotated. Not only might you start in a different location on the map, the orientation might also be different when you begin playing. I know this game is a little old now, but it is a game that I have found to be enjoyable, and I continue to find it enjoyable. The campaigns are nice, and they have some interesting cut-scenes. The story would probably never make it to the theater, but it is good for a computer game. It&apos;s enough to sustain the game and give one an excuse to keep playing, in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-nations-rise-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=416071">Expand</a></span>
