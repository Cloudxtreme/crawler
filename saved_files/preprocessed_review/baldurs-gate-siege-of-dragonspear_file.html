<br>2) AI is still stupid as ever.

<br>4) screen scroll doesn&apos;t work nicely.
<br>5) everything seems blurry. Like someone spilled smoke over the game. Original game was far more crispy and clear.
<br>6) new class is supposed to dance. No animation....why? So hard to add some non 1pp stuff in the game? Hire that Sentrizeal guy, do yourselves a favour.
<br>7) while rather nice, new areas don&apos;t really look as BG. So people pls stop writing nonsense line in the course of &quot;it feels like old BG&quot; because it doesn&apos;t. Some may like it, some may not; but new areas have nothing to do with original, for bad or for worse.
<br>8) crashes. gotta love ctds.
<br>9) Options menu. Click a red box, I can barely tell if an option is now on or off - it&apos;s still red, just mildly less. If this is a game for handicapped people, I don&apos;t want to know what it would look like if it weren&apos;t.
<br>10) LUA options. Is this so impossible to implement in game, rather than keeping a seperate file that looks like this:
<br>SetPrivateProfileString(&apos;Game Options&apos;,&apos;Journal Popups&apos;,&apos;0&apos;)
<br>SetPrivateProfileString(&apos;Game Options&apos;,&apos;Classic Selection Circles&apos;,&apos;0&apos;).........................
<br>
<br>This is awful. Clumsy, lame, seems more like WiP than something a proper game would endorse.
<br>
<br>11) Portraits. Where to begin? What happened to Imoen? Did Sarevok beat her up ? there were supposed to be some new ones. I found 2 male and 2 female, both of fairly low quality looking as they just arrived from Arcanum of Steamworks; a quick google search will net you several dozen better ones.
<br>12) LoB mode is nothing more than a very simple mod can do - unlike the game implementation, mod actually works properly.
<br>13) Most importantly, it&apos;s linear. No BG game is so linear as SoD.
<br>14) The devs begging for positives reviews in their forums was hilarious and just sad.
<br>15) Deleting negative reviews, really? I&apos;ll keep posting, it just shows how corrupt these guys are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6415434">Expand</a></span>

The narrative was compelling, the dialogue witty and intelligent, fantastic villains, excellent voice acting, spending time worshiping the ground my Drow Goddess Viconia DeVir walks upon.... oh wait I digress.... but the list of positives could go on and on. Sure games have moved on since then, with the likes of Dragon Age, Mass Effect, The Witcher, Dark Souls etc. but the original BG series will always be among the RPG greats.
<br>
<br>Hence when four years ago it was announced the games were being revamped with the possibility of new expansions or sequels I was very excited.
<br>
<br>Alas these enhanced editions have been nothing more than severe disappointments and the new expansion Siege of Dragonspear continues the trend of mediocrity one has come to associate with Beamdog products.
<br>
<br>The game was found wanting in almost all areas, including but certainly not limited to:
<br>Numerous game breaking bugs with clear evidence of lack of QA
<br>Exceptionally poor writing, dialogue, lackluster character development, lack of insight into how interactions should work
<br>Spelling and grammatical mistakes
<br>New party NPCs which are uninteresting, lack charisma and in some instances have no genuine reason for actually being in the game.
<br>New classes and race specialisms that are completely unrelated to the plot or setting
<br>New areas that are completely out of place and do not serve any purpose other than to say, hey look its new content!
<br>A stark contrast in the sense of humour used in the original, the new material lacks any sort of emotional impact
<br>Unwanted changes to the personality of old party NPCs
<br>Lack of understanding of D&amp;D lore
<br>Lack of respect for the original game material
<br>No new challenges and a watering down of difficulty
<br>Failed to address balance issues by importing BG2 mechanics into BG1
<br>Performance issues even on high spec machines
<br>NPCs are forced upon you in a failed attempt to bring some sort of cohesion to the plot
<br>Things which are supposed to be Easter Eggs or Jokes (I assume) but achieve nothing but break the game immersion
<br>Attempts at doing multiplayer did not work
<br>Importing saved games resulted in crashes almost like malware
<br>No innovation or creative flair
<br>
<br>The list could go on and on but as there is a word limit here I have kept it succinct.
<br>
<br>While it was good to see some old voice actors return e.g. David Warner reprising his role as the villain Irenicus, Jim Cummings as Minsc, it was sad to see such talented people wasted on this expansion through its poor writing and execution. Even such talented individuals can only perform as well as the script they are given unfortunately.
<br>
<br>As for Beamdog, well for reasons unknown over the past four years there are individuals at Beamdog who decided to alienate a large section of the fan base of the original games by adding unwanted features to the enhanced versions, not listening to constructive feedback, changing things which did not need changing and so on, making promises on game content and translations to encourage pre-orders that were subsequently broken.
<br>
<br>Many genuine fans of the original BG games and D&amp;D have been silenced, banned, discriminated against, trolled upon and subsequently discredited on their official forum over the years, so it comes as no surprise that when Beamdog finally released a new expansion it has failed so miserably to impress the target audience of such a game, the majority of whom do not actually use the official Beamdog forums.
<br>
<br>The lack of professionalism permeates Beamdog&apos;s ranks is not only confined to its own forum though, as evidenced when Beamdog actively encouraged individuals to give artificially high review scores in attempts to circumvent the barrage of negative criticism received for the poor quality of their
<br>products. Unfortunately for Beamdog they cannot silence people on metacritic, steam, YouTube, twitter and other social media as they have done within the confines of their own forum.
<br>
<br>Beamdogs main achievement with this expansion is to merely undermine the original games legacy once again with another below par release.
<br>
<br>In comparison to more modern game titles available in 2016 or even if one prefers retro style games, one cannot recommend investing any time or money in this expansion.
<br>
<br>Final Verdict: All those responsible for this substandard game expansion, and for that matter the &quot;enhanced&quot; versions of the BG games, should be banished indefinitely to the Nine Hells of Baator!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6319915">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Safana&apos;s &quot;transformation&quot; of character is, simply put, retarded and inconsistent, the game is very linear (unlike true Baldur&apos;s Gate games), sometimes the Chaotic Evil characters aren&apos;t offered dialogue options that suit their alignment and on top of all these glaring issues, they have the guts to mock their own playerbase.
<br>
<br>This is not Baldur&apos;s Gate, as you might&apos;ve guessed reading the other reviews. If Beamdog wants to force their agendas in a game, they should do it in a series of their own. I hope WotC takes their rights to the BG franchise back, because Beamdog has neither the skill nor the knowledge of how to do a proper fun, well-written RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6481969">Expand</a></span>

<br>I tried to slog through the resets and crashes, but the dialogue is horrendous. Characters seem to be lables and ideas rather than living and breathing. They dont fit with the setting.
<br>Its very reminiscent of a cosmonaut at a dog show, aure maybe theirs a convoluted reason for him being there, but he keeps shouting russian propoganda at people and spilling vodka everywhere.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s trash. Not because of the constant crashes and wipes, not because of the horrible, childish dialogue, but both. I cant mindlessly ignore the dialogue due to the crashing, and I cant forgive the crashing because theirs nothing good to come back to.

This is particularly damming as it was the story line and NPC personalities that made the original so great back in the day. The voice acting was also poor in comparison to the memorable lines delivered in the original back in 1998. Many of the new additions do not fit into the story line at all such as new character classes and races and the new NPCs are exceptionally poor and forced upon you at times. One could be forgiven for thinking that the new development team / writers had not actually played the originals? Unnecessary changes were also made to fondly remembered original NPCs that did not match their character at all.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer did not work, but that may be a positive as there is little content or replay value to actually warrant me and colleagues to play this together.
<br>
<br>Overall I would recommend any fan of the original game from 1998 and its sequel to NOT play this expansion or the enhanced editions for that matter, as this is a very poor product hiding behind the Baldur&apos;s Gate name and there is certainly nothing here to warrant the title of &quot;enhanced&quot;
<br>
<br>I should also bring to your attention that Beamdog actively encouraged their &quot;fans&quot; to artificially boost review scores were possible, in response to the negative reception the expansion received.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6313283">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I won&apos;t say anything about the numerous gamebreaking bugs or awful UI, because everyone else has already mentioned that.
<br>
<br>Basically if you want to enjoy baldur&apos;s gate, just download the original and use Tutu.  This &apos;expansion&apos; won&apos;t tickle your nostalgia button, it will enrage it.

Instead, you had the nerve to &quot;fix&quot; what was not broken, and add unnecessary elements that detract from the game and change beloved core characters from the original. When you reflect on this as a business decision, realize that you lost sales, not because of the supposed political drama and shortcomings of customers&apos; worldviews, but simply because you deviated from an original IP that was a sure thing. In my case, I am a long time fan of the original games, and hold them in such esteem that I will not suffer an expansion that is not true to the original. I chose to get a refund on Steam for this reason. I had modest expectations for this expansion, and would gladly have purchased it, but Beamdog could not leave well enough alone and just take my money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6296433">Expand</a></span>

To be blunt, this game is an insult to the BG legacy, not an enhancement. Do not reward inferior programmers that are far more interested in pushing their kooky social agenda than they are with creating smooth, bug-free games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6296709">Expand</a></span>

Frankly, pretty much nobody cares but for the fact the character was a ham-fisted, poorly-written token to modern political BS.
<br>
<br>That ham-fisted approach was just one symptom of the overwhelmingly ham-fisted, juvenile writing.   The new characters are shallow, superficial and uninteresting.   The dialogs are poor.  Even beloved characters were wrecked.   Add in the game play is even more linear than the original and choices are mostly inconsequential coupled with crashed, the UI being utter garbage, I can&apos;t see anyone wanting to waste their $20 on this disaster.

My concerns are about gameplay.
<br>Aside from a barely functional UI, I encountered an incredible amount of bugs in singleplayer of which I&apos;ll mention:
<br>
<br>- Localized BG:EE content should not be missing from the SoD build as this expansion is supposed to bridge between BG1 and BG2
<br>- Pathfinding issues
<br>- It should not be possible to cast arcane spells from quick slots while wearing armor
<br>- Inventory item icons should not have a distorted shadow effect
<br>- Character AI choices should be remembered after a load
<br>- Elves should not have access to all mage specializations
<br>- It should be possible to load an old save game
<br>- Legacy of Bhaal stats should not be reset to normal for creatures in the area a game is loaded in
<br>- Proficiencies should not be ignored for the off-hand weapon if you have a weapon with both a ranged and melee function in the main hand
<br>- Story Mode and Nightmare mode should not randomly activate and deactivate
<br>- Character record should display the active weapon style bonuses
<br>- Archer opponents should not attempt to run away while entangled
<br>- You should be able to trigger the coalition camp attack
<br>- Neera&apos;s quest items should not disappear
<br>- Romance should end after dialogue with Glint
<br>- Legacy of Bhall difficult reset randomly
<br>- Petrified Dynaheir
<br>- Khalid and Neera should not be killed at the Bridgefort...
<br>
<br>and 50+ more bugs that I logged in the forums, Spoilers and lack of space to mention here.
<br>As of right now the multiplayer is simply unplayable.
<br>Until these is fixed updates and patches that allow for a smoother gaming experience, I consider this game inherently broken. This is simply not acceptable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6279680">Expand</a></span>

<br>- There are quite a few bugs, and many previously-working mods are currently broken.
<br>- Many changes to the user interface and graphical style are unwelcome. Some can be disabled in the options, but most cannot. Many of them are there to hold the player&apos;s hand, and feel distinctly out of place.
<br>- The storyline plays fast and loose with established lore and characters, at best. At worst, the writers use it as a soapbox for political commentary on modern themes like gender politics and the refugee crisis. And the iconic character Minsc now gets to spout Internet memes. How wonderful.
<br>
<br>This feels more like fan fiction than a genuine entry in the classic Baldur&apos;s Gate series. It wasn&apos;t needed. I recommend just playing the original games as they were meant to be played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6269370">Expand</a></span>

And yet, the developers are attacking the fan-base of the original game for being disappointed about all the game&apos;s problems. Seriously, who does that??? If they had just come out and said &quot;look, we apologize, the game has a bunch of issues, but we&apos;re working asap to fix them&quot; then that is how you respond to this situation, but instead, they imply we are all liars and bigots and racists, when in fact most of us are just complaining about all the bugs in the game and not a trans character. Marketing 101 Beamdog, if you alienate your brand champions, you are DONE. And even on that note (the SJW stuff),  yes the original games flirted with some LGBT ideas you could say, but never forced them down your throat. It&apos;s just wrong on so many levels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6265361">Expand</a></span>

<br>I played the original Baldur&apos;s Gate back in the late 90s / early noughties, when I was still at University. It is a game I have never forgotten - in fact, even today nearly 20 years later I still have saved character files from the original CD-ROM version of the game.
<br>
<br>Baldur&apos;s Gate Enhanced Edition was an opportunity to allow fans to relive a great game, but sadly it has added little to the franchise whilst there have been many complaints of bugs.
<br>
<br>Even so, I decided to give the new expansion Siege of Dragonspear Keep a fair try as it was on offer. After buying and installing the game, I fired it up. My first concern was that I still cannot import my characters from the original Baldur&apos;s Gate. A casual forum search reveals that this is by no means an uncommon problem and has been known about since 2012. For a product that owes so much to nostalgia, that is no minor flaw.
<br>
<br>The expansion coincides with the 2.0 patch for the &apos;Enhanced&apos; version of the game. Unfortunately new settings introduced for animated characters are, to put it kindly, unaesthetic. Users have described this as making the game look worse, although it should be noted that the settings can be turned off.
<br>
<br>Finally, the writing in Siege of Dragonspear is clumsy in the extreme compared to the original. The game&apos;s writing includes a certain amount of political comment - not in itself unwelcome in any artistic genre. However, the heavy-handed preachiness is unwelcome as is the impression of an unfamiliarity with the game&apos;s setting. There is a jarring disconnect between the original game and the new DLC.
<br>
<br>As I already own a copy of the original game, I am left with the feeling I have gained nothing from my purchase other than wasted time and annoyance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6257953">Expand</a></span>

This &quot;expansion&quot; isn&apos;t just bad by itself, the update that accompanies it has actually broken the base game for many too. So many glitches (eg, text box not appearing, UI flickering, save-game corruption, constant crashing, characters disappearing, gear from imported characters disappearing, getting stuck in doors, broken mods, broken multiplayer, dialogue errors, UI degradation that makes the game look WORSE than the original 1998 release, etc). Many of the 10/10 &quot;infallibly perfect&quot; scores contain the usual egocentric &quot;Don&apos;t read any reviews that scored less than me&quot;, and many others come from recently created accounts with no other game reviews.
<br>
<br>The current 3.7 out of 10 is actually quite accurate given the broken state of the game. And that&apos;s in the face of a massive, deliberate and sustained attempt to try and censor as many negative reviews as possible (regardless of non-abuse) plus Beamdog&apos;s call to inflate positive reviews as a panicked response to a self-inflicted review bomb caused by non existent QA and &quot;amateur hour&quot; PR.

<br>
<br>I spent some time wondering if this game was even worth writing about at all. In the end I thought people should at least be forewarned of what expects them in this paid mod/DLC.
<br>
<br>Siege of Dragonspear&apos;s only redeeming value is the Infinity Engine and its combat. That&apos;s about the only thing that has not been tainted by Beamdog&apos;s incompetence in every aspect, and has even been somewhat improved by tailoring combat encounters, and AI scripting.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s about the only good news though. The Baldur&apos;s Gate games have always been the most open-ended of the Infinity Engine games, up until the rushed Throne of Bhaal, allowing you a lot of freedom in which area you&apos;d visit and which quest you&apos;d approach next. The designers at Beamdog however decided to make their own lives easier at the expense of gameplay, and have made Siege of Dragonspear a railroaded, linear slog through each large area and multiple smaller areas connected to it. This reminded me of a game that I and a team of students I had never met in person had to put together in a week&apos;s time for a software academy course - sure, our game had to run from the windows command prompt, but the gameplay was pretty much the same - you move from room to room, kill the enemies and can&apos;t go back. I didn&apos;t expect to get the same kind of gameplay from a purported &quot;Baldur&apos;s Gate expansion&quot;.
<br>
<br>Regarding writing - my opinion is if you&apos;re looking for good writing in computer games, you&apos;re better off reading a book, or playing one of select few adventure games (Grim Fandango and The Longest Journey are the first that come to mind). Sometimes however there are writers so ignorant of their own lack of talent and so full of themselves that the results of their labor deserve a mention in a review.

<br>Most people talking about the writing of SoD concentrate on specific instances which caused outrage for various reasons. However I do not think he problem with the game&apos;s writing is the themes, sadly it&apos;s far more basic - it&apos;s the inability of the writer to create distinctive characters, even after such characters have been served to her on a silver platter with the BG license. Playing the game just a couple of hours beyond the starter dungeon nets tens of examples of:
<br>- Every last female character of any importance speaks with the same vocabulary, uses the same sort of &quot;witty responses&quot; and sarcasm, and its language is stylistically indistinguishable from the next.
<br>- Every female character is obligated to express her superiority to men at every opportunity, in general or in particular - whether that be her father, her boyfriend, her traveling companion (Dynaheir/Minsc), or a male PC. Examples range from Corwyn&apos;s daughter, to Skie and her father, to Viconia and some generic duergar friend of hers who serves no other purpose except for her to spite him, to the Safana and Coran exchange. You don&apos;t even have to look closely for those examples.
<br>- Minsc has to act as if he&apos;s signed a contract with a hamster pets shop chain, by which he is bound to mention Boo in literally, and I mean literally, every other sentence that comes out of his mouth. The Boo jokes are so overdone, that as much of a fan as you could be, you could seriously grow to hate Minsc by the end.
<br>
<br>This inability to draw distinctive characters generally speaks of lack of good literary examples and culture around which a distinctive writer&apos;s style could develop, and lack of personal experience with and understanding of real-life people. I&apos;m sorry, but the writing team in this game is worthless as a writer and should never have been let near SoD&apos;s script.
<br>
<br>So, what exactly is left of a Baldur&apos;s Gate game when you remove the cheerful high fantasy atmosphere and characters, and the open world? Character progression and combat, supposedly. As for character advancement - if you start at the XP cap for BGI (160,000) you may only advance by two levels in SoD (up to 500,000 XP). Most of character customization comes from items you find in shops and in dungeons. Unfortunately combat in itself isn&apos;t enough motivation for me to play through this game, especially since this is not all that a Baldur&apos;s Gate game is supposed to be.
<br>
<br>As a D&amp;D and Infinity Engine games longtime fan, SoD was a huge disappointment for me. The more you care about the series, the less I could advise you to buy this so-called expansion. Really a paid mod with a fanfic-level of writing, and some above average dungeon crawling, lasting between 15-20 hours on Core Rules/Normal difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6285613">Expand</a></span>

I played BG1 as a young adult and enjoyed it, then a few years later played BG2 and absolutely loved it.  Much later, Beamdog came out with the enhanced editions, and I liked the way they just fixed them up a bit, increased resolution, stuff that improved the games without taking away what made them the classics that they are today.  That&#x2019;s why when I heard Beamdog was going to be making a game that sat in between 1 &amp; 2 I was thrilled.  They respected the previous games and had demonstrated they could get things done, so I came into this with high hopes of hitting that nostalgia button while being introduced to a new and hooking story.  Well&#x2026; for the most part I was disappointed.  Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, there were some parts of the game I truly enjoyed and the humor was pretty good, but the downsides of this game left a bad taste in my mouth overall.  It&#x2019;s quite buggy, which to be fair, is something a lot of games tend to be these days when they come out, so it&#x2019;s a minor gripe.  But, what bothers me the most is that parts of the game felt forced.  I sorta had the feeling I was being led by the nose instead of being able to explore the world as I chose.  The options presented during a lot of the dialog felt a bit flat and restrictive (not all, some of the writers were better than others).  Overall, the story just felt like a let-down.  It wasn&#x2019;t bad, but considering the time between the last game and this one, the vast pool of ideas that could have been come up with during this time, it simply didn&#x2019;t deliver in the way I had hoped.  Also, and you have probably heard this in other reviews, there was a liberal/political slant to this game that I didn&#x2019;t find attractive.  I tend to be a conservative person, and with the inclusion of gay and transsexual characters I felt like the game was trying to force me into accepting this, not just in the game, but outside of it as well.  That can taint an experience, and it tainted mine.  The female NPCs are not likeable at all in that they are trying very hard to force dominant personalities onto them.  It&#x2019;s not necessary.  Anyhoot, for the more liberal minded people out there, the game might be worth the $20 since hey, it&#x2019;s all the Baldur&#x2019;s Gate you&#x2019;re getting, lackluster writing or not.  For me, I&#x2019;m just disappointed that Beamdog had to go there and make this a political type of game instead of concentrating on interesting story and FUN.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6257593">Expand</a></span>

Then the wrapping paper came off and I saw the steaming pile of cow excrement inside, and felt utterly betrayed.
<br>
<br>Beamdog released a buggy mess of an expansion. It has broken quests. Dialogue trees with NPCs glitch and force reloads. It has a broken Multiplayer feature. It has writing which reads like middle school fanfiction. The graphics are somehow *worse* than the 1998 originals. The occasional crashes which occur almost feel like the computer itself fleeing from this accursed program.
<br>
<br>Given the hideous way Beamdog has treated its customers in the days since the release, I have no hope that these issues will be addressed. Give this one a pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6264499">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My two main issues:
<br>
<br>1. The game is buggy as hell, within the first few minutes it froze for about 20 seconds inside the menu. I don&apos;t have a slow machine, it&apos;s about 3 years old and was pretty much top tier in its time. i7, GTX780, Windows 7 for reference. It crashed mid-game and I couldn&apos;t start it without a full reinstallation. That took an additional 10 minutes.
<br>2. Internet memes right off the bat. This turns a game form a classic to a passing fad. When will these writers learn some creativity?
<br>
<br>I uninstalled it before reaching the fabled politically loaded content, but if it is the case (and a lot of people are saying so), it&apos;s even more reason not to buy it. No one should buy games to get indoctrinated. Games should give you an experience you want, not whatever the authors want shoved down your throat.
<br>
<br>This will be my last BG game purchase. Farewell my old friend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6248095">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Patch 2.0/Dragonspear made Baldurs Gate EE a worse game for a number of reasons.
<br>-random crashes
<br>-mods aren&apos;t working properly any longer
<br>-questionable graphic update (they managed to make a 16 year old game look WORSE than on release) I know, these are optional, but when i first started the game after the update i just couldn&apos;t believe it how ugly it looked. Funnily enough, the preview screenshots on gog and on steam don&apos;t show the ugly new sprites.
<br>-questionable difficulty changes. Why the f*** does the game lower the difficulty after a few reloads by itself, without asking. I realized this awesome &quot;feature&quot; when i reached the so called &quot;Story mode&quot; which sets all stats to 25 and adds a ton of immunity. Basically Godmode. Obviously i thought it was a bug and tried to reload my game again. Well, i figured it out eventually. What a terrible feature.
<br>-Voice acting The voice acting in the addon breaks the feel of the original game. I know, many people hate to read and prefer voiced dialogues. But Baldurs Gate has its own style and if suddenly whole dialogues are voiced it just feels out of place and you know immediately that it doesn&apos;t belongs to the game. It just feels wrong. They could have saved the money for the (mediocre actually) voice acting and spend it on fixing bugs.
<br>-Multiplayer Its working barely at best.
<br>So far this addon has been a huge disappointment. The worst thing is: Even if i refund it, the terrible patch 2.0 will stay. I guess i will let the EE games rest and play the original games with mods for a while. Maybe Beamdog gets their **** together and fixes the issues and i can enjoy playing EE. Hopefully this time it won&apos;t take them whole year.
<br>
<br>Steam Achievments are buggy as hell too. Some won&apos;t unlock. Others do unlock for the wrong quest... its a mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6246985">Expand</a></span>

People play games to get away from **** like this. Furthermore, it just seems really out of place in a medieval world when they discuss SJW fantasies, it takes away from the atmosphere and rpgs live from their atmosphere. I hope this game is a warning to every developer.</span>

<br>Bottom line is if you&apos;re a new player then get the original first but be aware that it&apos;s dated. Game feels very late 90&apos;s to me but some people like that.

<br>There is no problem with having messages about social issues in a game. The problem comes when one hijacks another franchise, gut out its soul and fill it with vapid maxims and fables in its place. That is one of the surest ways to kill off a franchise, and it is especially odious when it happens to a well-loved franchise.
<br>Want social justice? Sure, but stop hijacking the industry and make your own games. You&apos;re not going to improve the industry, you&apos;re just going to kill it from the inside out.
<br>Also way to go Beamdog vote brigading reviews, asking their fans for false reviews here and on GOG and steam, and banning members for legitimate concerns in their forums.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6247807">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s also bugs out the ass and I&apos;m not willing to forgive that just because it&apos;s new. Do note also that the accompanying update to the base game breaks a lot of mods and **** with the UI turning it into something reminiscent of a tablet game. Finally the ending was rail-roaded to all **** I understand it has to try and match up with the existing canon but it could have been done in a better way.
<br>
<br>On the positive side they got many of the original VAs to reprise their roles and that was a nice surprise to me after not following the development too closely. The attempt to link the two games, however poorly executed it might have been, is also praiseworthy.
<br>
<br>Now onto the topic of the political war that seems to have appeared over this expansion. Feel free to skip this part if you only care about the broad picture of the expansion&apos;s quality I&apos;ve given above as it really just comes down to &apos;poor writing&apos;.
<br>
<br>The character at the centre of the controversy really doesn&apos;t fit into the setting. Their views are that of our modern day in a setting where the same issues would just not appear to create those problems that generate such views. You might think of it as someone spouting Marxist terminology in a setting which has not been through the industrial revolution. It&apos;s hardly the main problem but it does rather damage suspension of disbelief when it shows up. The changes to existing characters based on one writer&apos;s political beliefs are unwelcome also. Regardless of the motive for changing them it just snaps me right out of the game when their personality has completely changed with no explanation. Similarly the overt reference to GG (again something I couldn&apos;t care about either way) goes beyond humour and will, I suspect, be more of an annoyance a few years down the line when this has all faded into the background. Direct references to current events never age particularly well. I was rather annoyed by the developer stepping in and demanding positive reviews which, frankly, is the reason I&apos;ve felt the need to give my view when I&apos;d normally stay silent. Additionally rumours of metacritic itself deleting negative reviews are rather worrying. Surely if anyone deserves that it&apos;s the reviews the developer has tried to influence? I am as suspicious of the 9s and 10s as I am of the 1s and 2s for an expansion that is frankly average at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6267598">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So first I tried importing my save into the game, but the game kept crashing every time I would do so. Eventually I did get in the game, only to find that none of my gear was there. Eventually I gave up and talked a friend into starting a new character with me... Only to find that the multiplayer doesn&apos;t work. It crashes every time you try to save and seemed to randomly decide not to let you unpause. These two issues combined made playing the game in multiplayer impossible.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve heard that the expansion also breaks any and all mods for even the base game, but I was going to try the base expansion first so I didn&apos;t see those bugs myself.
<br>
<br>So eventually I just decided to play a plain single player game with a new character. And I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because I spent the day fighting the game, or if it&apos;s a case of general video game writing trends going more in the direction of ME3 and away from roleplaying, but I could not stand the writing. The new UI is bad and I encountered yet more bugs, but the writing was the real killer.
<br>
<br>It was actually kind of a relief, because I knew that I wouldn&apos;t have to try to get it working again because there was nothing worth playing behind it all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6239659">Expand</a></span>

There is a 80&apos;s surfer dude fully voiced, people with southern accents and other very modern words and terms. They did a bad job on Safana, could not relate to her. The game was too dark and found myself having to hunt for party members. The main story was great and near the end when they got serious it felt more like a Baldur&apos;s Gate. The new U.I. looks bad and was frustrating. The bugs were not too bad. I don&apos;t know if it was me or the bugs that kept me from finishing many side quests. Near the end I gave up on them. Khalid was missing, guess it was a bug. Some real innovations using the Infinity engine for effects and quests. Over all I feel as a Baldur&apos;s Gate fan a little hurt by not trying to make it not feel like Baldur&apos;s Gate. Really could have been a great game if done with a little care for the cannon that was already in stone. The whole GamerGate thing is so crazy, all the hate being thrown out there by homophobic, racist and misogynistic people really put a damper on my enjoyment as well. Minsc, Viconia and Irenicus were well done and voiced beautifully. I think someone not well versed in the early games could enjoy it, for me it felt like not everyone working on this game were on the same page.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6255896">Expand</a></span>

Its score is brought down due to a very buggy release that did the company a disservice as they are gaining a reputation of buggy releases at a time when they are asking for the honor of doing a Baldur&apos;s Gate 3. This is unacceptable and they need to hone their programming chops to be taken seriously. However, as I stated, it is impressive to just go in and meld a new experience to a game nearly 2 decades old and have it feel like it belonged there all along. Also, ignore the low score from the Gamer&apos;s Gate trolls that keep whining that the company has an agenda. The only agenda is from the loony fringe of the Gamer&apos;s Gate that thinks anything that isn&apos;t white and male is something to attack. I would also ignore the fanboy&apos;s giving this 10&apos;s. It is a very good expansion that I cannot recommend until they have shown the commitment to fix it&apos;s technical state. Once that aspect is under control, I can say that if you enjoyed this classic series this will feel both new and familiar in a positive way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6240108">Expand</a></span>

<br>The cry about &apos;politics being shoe-horned&apos; into the game concerns one minor npc and a single line of text. I do not care. Even if you think transgender should not be part of a fantasy game, this is not a theme that you will encounter all through the game. Negative reviewers blow it out of proportion big time at the moment.

<br>Make up your own mind and do not simply listen to those hating on Beamdog right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6240341">Expand</a></span>

It was an enjoyable adventure that did a fairly decent enough job filling in the gap between BG1 and BG2.
<br>
<br>I found the writing a little weak and the plot/story was rather weak, but I suspect that&apos;ll happen when you try and squeeze an original story in the middle of a very well established plot line.  In that regard, Beamdog did a pretty decent job.  Not good, not bad.  I would very much like to see what they can do when the &quot;shackles&quot; are off and tell a story all their own.
<br>
<br>I found nothing remarkable about the new joinable NPCs, as I avoided them almost completely except for Corwin (I needed a ranged warrior, and she fit the bill).  I wasn&apos;t a fan of the new NPCs in the Enhanced Editions, so I just avoided them altogether in SoD (the returning and the new to SoD ones).
<br>
<br>The Shaman class addition is welcome (as are any character options), but one I will never use.  Considering the class&apos; main feature (summoning spirits) is not guaranteed to work right away...any shaman in the party will likely spend most of the game standing around (since they can&apos;t move when using this ability) crossing their fingers hoping they can contribute (before it&apos;s too late).  Welcome, but not very useful.
<br>
<br>The UI.  I don&apos;t mind the layout, though it needs some serious touching up (and frankly, the original layout is still better).  The colour of it is horrid though.  Just horrid.  Devs, wherever your fetish for varying shades of black comes from, please stop.  Return this UI to the blue stone/gold GUI we saw in patch 1.3 and I&apos;d honestly have nothing to complain about (or an option to use either would be great).
<br>
<br>As for all the furor over purported gender/sexual identity agendas and political correcting of things....I don&apos;t really care.  The day a video game can influence my own personal views about life, I have larger issues than what a video game (or its devs) believe.
<br>
<br>Overall, I very much enjoyed myself.  I&apos;m eager to see what Beamdog can come up with as a wholly original offering, without any particular constraints to an existing story.  I&apos;d still like to see Beamdog create some more (Enhanced) Infinity Engine D&amp;D games, and they&apos;ll get my dollars for them.
<br>
<br>With the recent disaster that was Sword Coast Legends, Beamdog looks to be THE place to scratch the CRPG D&amp;D itch for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6241979">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Some of the sidequests are outright garbage btw, especially things like the &apos;vision quest&apos; that looks better on **** than it would in a baldur&apos;s gate game. The game has a few bugs in singleplayer and the multiplayer has multiple and numerous crippling bugs.
<br>
<br>If I wasn&apos;t such a huge fan of baldur&apos;s gate and more fixated on the encounter I&apos;d probably rate it lower. For me though, it&apos;s a solid 7 and enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6247907">Expand</a></span>

I haven&apos;t encountered any bugs at all, which is strange for my usual luck. I loved the original Baldur&apos;s Gate games, and so far this one has been very enjoyable as well. I&apos;m liking the new characters enough that I&apos;ve managed to make room for one in my party (gasp!), and I&apos;m a person who keeps the same people on every run through because I just can&apos;t bear to switch!
<br>
<br>So far my only small complaint is that the character graphics are a bit more cartoonish than I would like... or like they are in front of a green screen or something. But, I forget about it when I&apos;m playing, so it isn&apos;t that big a deal.
<br>
<br>Thank you so much to everybody who put effort into making this expansion; it makes me so happy to play a new Baldur&apos;s Gate story now, so long after I first played the originals. Definitely worth the twenty bucks!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6243791">Expand</a></span>

What a sweet, beautiful tale I got to take a part in with this game.
<br>
<br>Well, that is the short of it... In a way, it is difficult attributing a score to what is, by default and design, a game that cannot, and will not, compare to other present day titles in terms of graphics, presentation, and polish. But in the end, there is no better criterion than the fun I had playing this game, as a veteran of Baldur&apos;s Gate and Icewind Dale from back in the day. The story is lovely; the new angles to this game not seen before in Infinity Engine games is refreshing, and the careful (mostly optional) changes to the UI are helpful.
<br>
<br>Some parts of the game remind me of aspects of Icewind Dale 2 in terms of scope and spectacle on screen, while the plot fits in seamlessly between Baldur&apos;s Gate 1 and 2. The new locales, the sheer number of NPCs, the new characters and the fleshing out of old characters make this a very colourful world and worthwhile addition indeed.
<br>
<br>One aspect which has received much attention here, as elsewhere, appears to be the not-merely-straight sexual identity/orientation of some of the new characters and the fleshing out of character relationships, which seems to infuriate a great many gamers. Indeed, the level of, for want of a better word, sheer hatred expressed in some comments is baffling. Now, I wonder who of those &quot;critics&quot; has actually played the game - if they had, they would recognise that this facet indeed is rather unobtrusive and minor. What&apos;s more, claims that this is breaking with the &quot;spirit&quot; of the original games apparently disregard the fact that a great level of diversity (for the time) has always a hallmark of the old Baldur&apos;s Gate games. (And if the &quot;spirit&quot; of the old games had truly been the embrace of a monoculture, of bigotry and of prejudice, would this really have been a spirit worth upholding?)
<br>
<br>There is a different, more nuanced level of criticism which I can at least somewhat relate to: In a fantasy world where there are so many options of altering one&apos;s physical form, a character with a sexual identity different from his physical body seems at least odd, and slightly in conflict with the game world&apos;s own logic. For this, and some other minor breaks of immersion, as well as for some bugs (none game stopping, in my experience) in the initial release, I am detracting a point from the score. But for the blast I am having (some 25 hours into the story), I can only recommend this wonderful new addition to the BG canon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear/user-reviews?user_review_id=6240911">Expand</a></span>

Personally I love the new UI. Pay no attention to the nonsense about &quot;Gender politics&quot; and such, it&apos;s overblown foolishness. A fitting expansion to one of the great series in recent memory. I highly recommend it.</span>

<br>
<br>Sadly, some people are giving 0 ratings because of a *single line* of optional LGBT friendly text in a game filled with mountains of dialogue. Most of these people haven&apos;t even played Siege of Dragonspear and any suggestions that the game &quot;preaches&quot; or &quot;forces&quot; heavy handed messaging are completely inaccurate. Decide for yourself and don&apos;t let other&apos;s people&apos;s distortions deter you from buying a genuinely wonderful game.
