You spell some words, it equates into damage. There&apos;s some joy to be had from spelling words that are &quot;dirty&quot; in nature and getting away with it. There&apos;s also a few secret words that it will take that aren&apos;t in a normal dictionary. It&apos;s a cute game. There&apos;s also a little bit of strategy involved with the powerups you can obtain throughout your adventure. However, there are a lot of tiny things that really outright annoys me. Let&apos;s start with that the game won&apos;t take some perfectly valid words. It&apos;s in the dictionary. Yes, the word may have some other meanings that parents wont like, but what parent actually parents these days? I&apos;m an adult. I can handle these words. The next issue is the whole gem system. Certain letters seem to have more value over another letter. If you spell a word that&apos;s five letters long with those higher valued letters, you may get a green gem. Otherwise you may get nothing. The word could only be seven letters long and you just might get a purple gem. That is very very annoying. I&apos;d rather see more consistency. Certain word lengths yield gems, not gems based on the value of the letters that you use. However, the greatest peeve I have with this game is how some bosses have nearly undefatable combinations unless you have a huge stock pile of certain potions so their attacks won&apos;t cripple you. Healing, with poision and bleeding and tile smash and petrify and freezing with heavy armor and immunity to fire and poison, and the ability to make your attacks less effective just makes a boss near invincible. While there are certain items you have at that point in the game that &quot;resist&quot; that sort of thing, the chance of it doing so are very slim, giving you nearly no hope because the boss keeps healing himself (and freezes you at the same time, something which you have no counter for at that point in time). There is fun to be had, and with STEAM selling it for half price right now, it&apos;s worth the money. $15, yes, $30, no.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bookworm-adventures-deluxe/user-reviews?user_review_id=705756">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is not for everyone.  Already from the title you should be able to tell it is a word game.  If you don&apos;t enjoy things like scrabble then you won&apos;t enjoy this game.  It&apos;s as simple as that.  For those of you who do enjoy words, then this game is a hilarious and entertaining way to brush up on your English skills, but have it still feel like you&apos;re playing a real game.</span>
