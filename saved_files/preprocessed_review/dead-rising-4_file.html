<br>
<br>From what I played before I refunded, it actually seemed like it was going to be a really good game. More of what made 3 great. Hardcore fans of 1 and 2 might not enjoy the simplistic over the top style, but I really did.
<br>
<br>And if you are wondering why the reviews on the Windows Store aren&apos;t lower; They don&apos;t allow you to post a review after refunding, since you no longer own the product.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll change my review once it releases on Steam and I get the chance to fully evaluate the product, until then the abomination that is the Windows Store severely hampers the experience.
<br>
<br>Oh, and you can refund the game if you talk to Microsoft support, I will say that they were very polite and quick to refund my purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6901972">Expand</a></span>

<br>The GAME, which is what we&apos;re supposed to be reviewing here, is great. It&apos;s everything you love about Dead Rising, but smoother, and more of it. I&apos;ve played since the first Dead Rising, and I love them. Especially part 2. They&apos;re just... fun. Zombie killing fun. This one is great, as well. It&apos;s also one of the better ones. It&apos;s worth the purchase, IMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6920781">Expand</a></span>

Going into it I wasn&apos;t expecting much, so that may have made it a better experience.
<br>
<br>Overall, the timer is gone which is going to bother a lot of people. Personally, I&apos;m conflicted as I thoroughly enjoyed it in the first game but at the same time wished there was a mode without the timer that would give me plenty of time to do a perfect run. Putting it behind a DLC paywall is what they opted with which is dumb, but it&apos;s still there if you really want it.
<br>
<br>The game overall runs well on PC and looks great compared to past Dead Rising&apos;s. Texture clipping is still an issue in cutscenes but that&apos;s been an issue for as long as I can remember. Lot&apos;s more zombies on screen and varied environment from town streets, sewers, and a mall.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>* Story is prob the best of the series besides DR1. And it ties in well enough with DR1 to make it interesting and engaging through the first playthrough.
<br>* Weapon variability is as good as it&apos;s ever been. Lot&apos;s of combo weapons and funny items to use throughout the world.
<br>* Exo Suit. Pretty cool when you get to use them.
<br>* Special Zombies - Won&apos;t go into spoilers but there&apos;s more than just the standard zombies that were present in past games.
<br>* Fun - Game is just fun to play in my experience. Not game of the year by any stretch but still a fun game to sit down and play.
<br>
<br>Meh:
<br>* Psychopaths have been replaced with Maniacs. Not a huge issue since Pyschopaths have been forgettable since the first game, and Maniacs are pretty close. Simply put they are groups of crazies vs just a single pyschopath. Pyschopaths were a favorite aspect of DR1 so it&apos;s sad to see them really go, but tolerable.
<br>* Game is too easy. Very rarely do I feel like I&apos;m even close to dieing. They can change this easily in a patch or two after getting feedback for now there is very little challenge. Very different from the first DR.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>* Zombies all look the same. They are all seemingly wearing the same outfits/colors so it just looks like a copy/paste job.
<br>* Some people may be bothered by the Christmas Theme. May be a bit off playing this during the Summer
<br>* Aiming is atrocious with a controller. Tried it out and it&apos;s just as bad as ever, feels like the aiming moves in chucks of 50-100 pixels so lining up headshots is hard.
<br>* No Multiplayer. Essentially just a single player only game with a multiplayer mode that is really just a min-game. I hardly played with friends but this will turn some people of the series off.
<br>* Kinda short. If you are only doing the missions you&apos;ll blow through this in under 10 hours. I recommend taking your time saving survivors and killing maniacs unlike I did, perhaps because I was so used to the timers in DR. Still have New Game + so you can always go back but just realize there is no rush to the end.
<br>
<br>Also worth noting they changed the voice actor for Frank, but I honestly don&apos;t mind the change. No idea why people are freaking out, the voice actor fits the character quite well. Lot&apos;s of long time fans of the series are stuck in the past and don&apos;t realize they need to expand the fan base to keep the series alive, which means changing the formula a bit here and there to reach a wider audience. All things considered, this is a really good game. Would rate it an 8 but rating it a 9 for now since fanboy&apos;s are unfairly rating the game lower than it should be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6861249">Expand</a></span>

<br>So the cons... Maniacs, are now nothing more than boring normal enemies with more health. None of the maniacs are even remotely rememberable.
<br>Vehicles are very uninspired and alot worse than in DR3. More often than not you don&apos;t even bother to make them and just grab any random car at hand.
<br>Ai, sure they are zombies but it is blatanty obvious that everything is lifeless until you get with a certain radius and human enemies barely have any intelligence above the zombies.
<br>But worst of all this game lacks any and all challenge. I did not die a single time during my playthrough. I wasn&apos;t even close to dying and I never leveled up my healthbar.
<br>There is no timelimit or anything to warrant a sense of accomplishment. And the actual gameplay consists mainly of pressing &quot;X&quot; repetedly. Without anything else to challange you, this repetetive gameplay turns bland really fast.
<br>During all my years in gaming I can&apos;t remember any game that is as much a cakewalk like this game.
<br>Pros... there isn&apos;t much imo, the performance is way better than DR3 both on PC and Xbox one. Obviously out of the two PC is the version to go for if given a choice.
<br>I also like that they have skipped escort missions. That would actually add some challenge but seeing how the game is as clunky as DR3 it wouldn&apos;t be a fun challenge.
<br>There are plenty of weapons and they are more easily created, with some fun christmas themed stuff.
<br>The story is probably the best of the DR games but it really isn&apos;t all that special. It&apos;s &quot;Okay&quot;.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day, if you liked DR3 you will probably like this game aswell, but even then I think you will still find it &quot;a letdown&quot;.
<br>For me, it&apos;s a mediocre game at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6893822">Expand</a></span>
