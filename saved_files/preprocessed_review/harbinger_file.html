Originally I gave this game a 1.  Which, on the basis of stealing Diablo I&apos;s game play, ambiance, and design, it deserves.  For more than even Never Winter Nights I, it is obvious how much this game is &quot;borrowing&quot; from Blizzard&apos;s game, and that is something that simply annoys me.  The lack of LAN play was something that made me immediately hate the game, because this is what I bought it for.  But then I realized that this was an old hatred based on preconceived notions that were extremely disappointed.  I wanted a new RPG, and it did not deliver.  I wanted to play with my friends and my brother on a network, and I could not. _____  This game lacks variety.  The bartering system lacks balance.  Even the storyline is mediocre, at best.  I had to replay the game recently to see this.  And when I did, I saw that the game was actually fun to a degree.  In this -- it is challenging.  Which is more than I could say for Diablo except on Hell or Nightmare difficulty (in reference to DI, not DII which is a more advanced game and thus is on another level).  I would never, however, recommend you to play it simply because it is repetitive.  Extremely repetitive.  There is SOME variety, granted.  But it is Diablo I without the firewalls and lightning.  It&apos;s lasers, which is neat until you realize the different abilities differ in color and damage but not in effect or actual physics.  Mines and &quot;CAMS&quot; are there, but only depending on the race.  Which, is really limited.  And believe me, you are probably not going to enjoy this game enough to want to play through the exact same story twice. ____ I had fun playing this game when I was drunk.  So based on that, I increase my score 1 point.  I detract that it is the worst game I ever played, but I also detract that it had a good story.  It is a sci-fi scrap book story really.  I am not going to &quot;spoil&quot; it, however.  How &quot;Harbinger&quot; is symbolized in so many ways in the game is in fact the coolest, and deepest thing about it.  But this is where depth begins and ends, I am afraid. I recommend avoiding this game.  However, if you come into contact with it I recommend buying it as an artifact due to its rarity, if it is cheap that is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/harbinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=1602452">Expand</a></span>
