The amount of stamina loss, when you parry/block attacks is minimal. Blockers/parry always beats someone trying to actually duel. Combat ends up in trading one or two blows then blocking everything else. Its boring and sluggish gameplay. Using block breaks takes away around a half of your stamina while only being able to attack once or twice after. A power attack should reduce someone&apos;s stamina, if they are trying to block/parry. Having such a fundamental mechanic, as flawed as it is, completely ruins the game. Its too easy to counter a feint as well, so there is absolutely no excuse for this kind of game play to exist in this type of game.
<br>
<br>If someone gives this a 10 out of 10, automatically disregard their review. The game is absolute Rubbish, just like the developers who developed the game! Thank god I was able to get a refund on steam. Just bypass this game, and don&apos;t waste your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6968503">Expand</a></span>

<br>Plenty to learn and get to grips with as learning your opponent&apos;s abilities is as important as your own. There is a tactic for all. Keep exploring.

And they have the nerf to charge &#x20AC;60 for this crap without even providing servers for online play while at the same time forcing you to be connected to Uplay? Truly shameful...</span>

Sometimes it&apos;s pretty OK, but sometimes you gonna get a close fun game where you or your friend is just gonna be suddenly kicked. Oh and btw it can also happen in single player which will make you to start over.

<br>Fighting is pretty cool but might get tedious after a while. Game worth about 19$ in the current state.</span>

This game is proof that the present day gamer has become complacent. The fact the Ubi Soft can release a game with unbalanced characters and a match making system that fails repeatedly is crazy. For Honor  is a quick response game that requires fast reflexes and solid war strategies, I loved the concept of this game and never had issues with graphics or anything like that. But without dedicated severs the game is laggy and its not uncommon to drop out of matches with your friends 2 or 3 times in an hour, which makes this game hard to stick with. With lag and unbalanced characters, there is a handful of characters that are easy to use and are overpowered. Players (including myself) often choose fast dodgy characters because they have an advantage over other players in a game like this because they are harder to block and hit with such lag. You will often hold a direction to block one of these players but find that the hit still go&apos;s through because of the delay, you will also find that if you do manage to get them close to death they just run away from you until they get an unfair team fight or find health. You will probably see a descend amount of people saying they don&apos;t know why people dislike this game but these players are the ones that play OP characters, I don&apos;t find a game fun when I just destroy the other team over and over not because I&apos;m better but just because my character is better and has an advantage. Another unbalanced part of this game is revenge. I like and understand the concept of revenge because it makes fights balanced when you get teamed up on and its nice to get rewarded for things like blocks and dodges. But the problem is that that players get gear that rewards them for getting hit, many times I have been laying a beat down on someone only to have them get revenge 2 of 3 times in a single fight and kill me. I was clearly the more skilled player but because I gained no revenge and lost the fight. NO PLAYER SHOULD GET REWARDED FOR POOR PERFORMANCE and anyone that plays this game will for sure run into this problem. I would say I am pretty good at this game but I never feel good domination a team just because I have better gear or spam revenge. Again I love the idea of this games but its clear MANY corners have been cut and Ubi Soft seems to care less about how many players it has lost. Even to the point that they don&apos;t take complaints or suggestions, most company&apos;s will at least give you a place to say what they like or don&apos;t like even if they don&apos;t really listen or care. It seems that they release game after game tricking people with cool concepts and then abandoning the game, we pay a lot of money for these games and I feel we have the right to ask for a quality/finished product. We are making these guys rich so the least we can do is demand a solid game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=7080238">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s been a while since the demo (because that wasn&apos;t really a beta) was way better than the full release.

<br>
<br>Graphically the game looks good. I can&apos;t deny that. Music and overall sound design are amazing. Gameplay is as good as I hoped - easy to understand, hard to master. The single player campaign is a joke, the story is a joke, the characters are a joke and NPCs... are meme-worthy but the meat of the game was in multiplayer and... they&apos;ve made it pay to win. Seriously, a full price, AAA release with microtransactions that allow you to buy power in the main multiplayer mode of the game. That is, if you&apos;ll get to play at all. Now, I have an amazing internet connection, don&apos;t want to brag, but let&apos;s say I can stream YouTube in 4K 60 fps and still I wouldn&apos;t get to the maximum speed... and yet I get multiple disconnects in For Honor, the game is lagging, matchmaking takes minutes instead of seconds and even then I can&apos;t play more than one match because of some random bug that freezes the whole game! It&apos;s a mess. P2P multiplayer where I get penalised for other people&apos;s crappy connection is one thing, but when the same thing happens when I&apos;m duelling a friend who has just as good, if not better, internet? It&apos;s a mess... a good game hidden behind poor decisions and nonsensical online design. I really hope Ubisoft will one day start actually making good games that aren&apos;t being held back by microtransactions and P2P multiplayer again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=7072205">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is fun as it actually takes skill and understanding of the game to play it also anyone can play the characters in the game but to be good at them is a different story. The multiplayer is very fun as it does several game modes but they might be a bit to similar but the game keeps making you come back with its dailies, weeklies and events. But the servers on launch and for about 2 weeks after were absolutely awful as you lag like crazy at some points because of connection and you would just randomly crash out of games and the reason this was happening was probably because they were using peer to peer servers which is a terrible idea especially for a triple A game. The campaign, which was a surprise to be in the game which is very good as most multiplayer focused games don&apos;t even bother anymore, was decent as the story was lackluster and you didn&apos;t really have any connection with characters but there were some interesting mechanics like story feats and you could play as every faction throughout the story and play as most characters in the game to make you get a feel for them in the multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=7143309">Expand</a></span>

While not the most visually impressive, For Honor is a fairly pretty game. The premise is interesting and unique and is, at its base level, executed rather well. Certain design choices, however, are questionable at best, the most notable being the P2P matchmaking architecture. This often leads to connection instability and even if you have the best internet money can buy in your area, there&apos;s no guarantee the guy(s) on the other end will have a good connection causing frequent pauses as a dropped player gets replaced by a bot or you just get booted with a enigmatic error code that is almost meaningless. If you can somehow get a stable connection and actually play the game, you then have to deal with a game that is going through the growing pains of finding balance not only between the characters, but the stat boosting pieces of gear that are random drops as endgame rewards or from loot packs bought with in game currency (which can be bought with real money) as well.
<br>
<br>I like this game, or at least, I want to. There&apos;s good in there, I can see it, and it occasionally shines, but in its current state, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m willing to deal with the bad just to get to the good when there are other, better things to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=7081348">Expand</a></span>

<br>It has its problems like its well known net issues.

Can&apos;t even join 2 of the 3 game types at all, and matchmaking is terrible if you ever DO manage to join a game - one team will be full of leveled-up veterans while the other is packed with bare-bones new players.  Then once the game starts, expect constant interruptions from connection problems.

<br>I got the game for free and I still would not recommend it.</span>

<br>60&#x20AC; for a mainly online game that suffers terribly from connection and matchmaking problems is just not acceptable.

<br>
<br>For Honor looks great and plays great, the combat system is something new and is definitley something for honor should be praised for.
<br>The faction war being across all platforms is welcomed, and the fact you have access to play all characters from any faction despite picking one faction to fight for and earn war assets for is a certain plus.
<br>The campaign for each faction is fun and refreshing to go to after if you take a break from multiplayer.
<br>However this is where the games main focus is duelling online 1v1 2v2 can be fun and frustrating at the same time due to the high learning curve and also multiplayer matching you with people more experienced and at a much higher level than yourself.
<br>This is also a gear score and it seems whoever has the better gear score will win regardless of skill i wouldn&apos;t mind this as much if there wasn&apos;t an in game currency that you can buy with real money as it makes the game pay to win for those that don&apos;t want to dedicate time and effort to learning and gearing their characters.
<br>The P2P hosting is kind of cheap aswell considering the fact that a fight can be won or lost in a split second i can&apos;t see no reason why the devs decided to skip the dedicated servers.
<br>All in all it is more fun with a friend to play with but i wouldn&apos;t recommend paying full price for this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6987568">Expand</a></span>

They instead come out and say they are &quot;improving the game&quot; by coming up with more anti-cheat coding. The game doesn&apos;t need anti-cheat coding because cheatings not an issue. How can you cheat when the matches are constantly pausing, crashing, or just not being put into a match to begin with? The issues Ubisoft needs to be addressing is making DEDICATED SERVERS and fixing the match making before coming out with &quot;improvements&quot; to everything except what is the actual issues. It seems to me that Ubisoft doesn&apos;t care about about the player base and instead is trying to get as many people to buy a game that is unplayable in its current state. Shame on you Ubisoft.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6986026">Expand</a></span>

Or rather, this is what the game COULD have been like.
<br>
<br>This game is like going out for Jack in the Box at two in the morning, because everywhere else is closed. You immediately regret your decision and think of what you could have actually spent your money on.
<br>
<br>My experience with this game... Well, to be quite honest I didn&apos;t even have an experience with this game. It is hard to have an experience with a video game if it doesn&apos;t even want to launch. Shocking, I know. I didn&apos;t think it was a big deal at first, I went through troubleshooting to see if I could alleviate the game&apos;s failure to launch, to include:
<br>
<br>Validating the games files
<br>Disabling my anti virus software
<br>Adding exceptions to my anti virus software
<br>Re-installing the game to my HDD
<br>Watching an episode of Rick and Morty (Season 2, Episode 1) this step is crucial
<br>Re-installing the game to the same HDD that the launcher is located on
<br>Taking a shower, using Old Spice bodywash and Tea Tree Shampoo (Lather, rinse, repeat)
<br>Un-installing and re-installing easyanticheat multiple times (no less than 30, give or take another 10)
<br>Baked a pizza (pepperoni, this is very important)
<br>Un-installing and re-installing Uplay
<br>Watched an episode of Game of Thrones (Season 6 Episode 5, The Door) SPOILERS: HODOR DIES
<br>Consulting the FAQs on both the Ubisoft forums and EasyAntiCheat website, none of which actually was helpful or insightful. Do not recommend.
<br>
<br>I also submitted a trouble ticket to both Ubisoft and EasyAntiCheat, neither of whom were able to help figure out the issue. I suppose EasyAntiCheat is working, considering I can&apos;t even cheat if I can&apos;t access the game. Well done Ubisoft and EasyAntiCheat, bravo. Working very well 100%.
<br>
<br>Now on to the grades I have given various aspects of the game:
<br>
<br>Campaign: 0/10
<br>
<br>I gave the campaign a 0/10 because I wasn&apos;t actually able to access the campaign. I am sure I would have been able to if the game had the capability to launch itself, but I wasn&apos;t able to determine whether the story had merit, if there was any character development, or if the dialogue was crisp. Sadly, the campaign gets 0 flurbos out of 10 possible. Not a good way to start off Ubisoft.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 1/10
<br>
<br>I gave the graphics a 1/10 because I wasn&apos;t actually able access the game due to its inadequacy and inabilty to actually function. It gets a single point because the splash screen the game gives me (before it gives me the launch error that I&apos;ve seen 50+/- times give or take) was rendered wonderfully. I&apos;ve never paid $60 USD for just a splash screen before, but unfortunately it is not able to make up for the rest of the game&apos;s dull appearance and mediocre attempts at being a joyful and exhilirating experience. Graphics get 1 Plumbus out of 10 possible.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer: -69/10
<br>
<br>I gave the multiplayer a -69/10 because the multiplayer functionality of the game was not accessible at the time. I believe this is due to the game&apos;s inability to start and perform its sole purpose in its life. It had one job, and now its back on unemployment, at least until it ends up at the bargain bin at your local Gamestop for tree-fitty ($3.50 USD). It would have been nice to wage war against my fellow gamers as a Samurai hopped up on cocaine and hookers, but alas, it was not meant to be. Multiplayer gets -69 shleemies out of 10 possible.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: Don&apos;t settle for Jack in the Box. Go get the steak dinner (or tofu dinner, if you&apos;re into that) that you deserve. Also, I do not recommend this game. You are better off wasting your time inflicting minor/severe injuries onto your body, such as shooting yourself in the foot, peeling the flesh off your pinky, or cutting off your limbs with a lightsaber (PRO-TIP: Dress up as Obi-Wan and proclaim you have the high ground.)
<br>
<br>If you have already purchased the game like I did (foolishly), know that you can get a refund for the lack of game you received if you haven&apos;t played it for more than two hours. (The .5 hours on record for me was the time accumulated just trying to get the game to run). My refund request was submitted and approved within a matter of 3 hours. THANK YOU STEAM!
<br>
<br>Good day to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6986172">Expand</a></span>

<br>There are a lot of bad points and only one good one. However the good one is arguably the most important, so that pumps it up to a 4. The worst points for me are the imbalances and inconsistencies. Sometimes attacks that should hit, fail to hit for some reason, be it input lag or a bug, it triggered me a lot. My friends stopped playing because of this after 2 weeks, I held out for 2 weeks more because I really liked the fighting mechanics. But with all the negatives I cannot recommend this game, it had great potential, but ultimately it fell short.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6995468">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>My opinion, the game is pretty good but the thing is.... all games should have an offline play, simple because where I live the internet connection is not so good and if I can play 2 matches without getting kicked out I&apos;m happy. Second thing is that the game is to expensive now, because 60$ games for me must have a good
<br>story and a good multiplayer. Altogether the game is worth playing.</span>

Poor connection from being P2P, I couldn&apos;t connect to the game for almost 2 straight days and overall frustrating controls for keyboard and mouse which are sometimes unresponsive. One of the worst and frustrating games I played this year, it doesn&apos;t even have a good progression feel. I recommend this game if its 5EUR or FREE considering that it has microtransactions and you can basically pay for gear and items. Ubisoft and they greedy ass made a half of a game with full price and microtransactions and they don&apos;t even need that many servers because they want the players to support the connection. **** you Ubisoft.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6994359">Expand</a></span>

But i have experienced a lot of problems already for a game at that price. Random disconnects with great NAT connectivity from games, which by the way take a looong wait to get into (guessing because of the cheap P2P solution).
<br>
<br>Pros/Cons:
<br>So yeah, Cons:
<br>
<br>1. The waiting... It feels like you play the game for 5 minutes, and then wait another 5 minutes to get into a new game, which i don&apos;t feel is acceptable.
<br>
<br>2. Random disconnects
<br>
<br>3. Whenever a disconnect happens, an error occurs, a random guy/gal don&apos;t push ready for a new game, and therefore kicks you out of the group (playing with friends), and leaves you at the main menu.
<br>
<br>Everyone of these should be fixed ASAP! Oh yeah, and dedicated servers please.
<br>
<br>4. The anger i experience from getting killed when someone gangs up on me.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>1. Game/fighting mechanics. it feels and flows great.
<br>
<br>2. Actually having to learn the game. You have to learn what the different &quot;heroes&quot; can do and how to counter them. When you get better at this, the combat is F***ing great.
<br>
<br>3. Free pickings of what kind of hero you like, and what suits your fighting style.
<br>
<br>4. The happiness i feel when ganging up on someone a executing them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6970882">Expand</a></span>

<br>For Honor is a game</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Cheese:  The Game.  That is For Honor.  Forget the fact the game doesnt actually function on a technical level for a moment. Sure, that makes it a 0 and well deserved, because a game this technically broken doesnt deserve a single cell and the creators deserve some serious financial repercussions.  Forget all of that for a moment and let me tell you about For Honor.
<br>
<br>For Honor is a game with 12 characters, 4 of which are playable.  The other 8 are for marketing purposes only.  They can be selected and using your input device on them in game will make them move and even execute moves and it will feel as though they exist, but they dont.  Why?  Because the balance in this game is ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS.  For Honor is at its core a fighting game, akin to Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat.  Those games generally end up the same way, only 1 or 2 characters are &quot;top tier&quot;.  These things generally are unavoidable, but are organic.  Most fighting games end up with a &quot;tier list&quot; organically, birthed from the billions of hours that millions of players worldwide will put into the game, learning and mapping it all out.  The developers rarely actually KNOW which characters that players are going to figure out interesting and powerful tactics for, they simply develop the roster around a core set of mechanics and design philosophies.  In effect, most fighting games evolve and distill down naturally.
<br>
<br>For Honor was designed from the factory with a tier list in mind.  And the way in which this game plays makes it absolutely hell if you decide you like one of the unplayable characters.  If you REALLY want this game, you need to google for the &quot;Best for honor characters&quot; RIGHT NOW before you buy it, and decide if one of the 3 or 4 viable ones interest you.  You see, the problem is that despite what you may be told by people who casually play the game, or what you might see on YouTube videos, For Honors combat is dog simple.  It is built entirely around spam, and abuse.  Each of the 4 playable characters are playable because they possess a handful (or even just a single) insanely powerful, easy to perform move or ability that renders the entire roster nothing but cannon fodder.  Take the peacekeeper, the current top tier character (and without doubt she will be until the heat death of the universe, as she has been since closed beta and has been receiving BUFFS each patch).  Her basic light attack is so fast that only 2 other characters have the block speed to block it.  And if for some reason she falls under attack, or faces another PeaceKeeper she can dodge with such speed and distance that it renders her invulnerable until she decides otherwise.  Forever.  With 0 cost of risk or resource.  She is unstoppable....
<br>
<br>Unless you pick one of the others, who have equally broken mechanics, and have had them for the entire run of the games playable(such as it is with the network issues) existence.
<br>
<br>Warden is nearly as fast, and can kill any character in 2 hits with single button moves and has unblockable chainable stunlock.  This move takes 2 buttons.
<br>
<br>Warlord has unblockable stunlock that chains into unblockable stunlock and cannot be interrupted, as well as nearly 3x the the health of any other character.  This move takes 2 buttons pressed at once.
<br>
<br>Orochi is even faster than PeaceKeeper and has even higher damage and the second longest range in the game, and can dodge-attack with unblockables with a stick input + 1 button.
<br>
<br>And those are the 4 characters that make up 85% of the matches online.  Without fail, without change, it will be those 4 in whatever combinations every single match in every single game mode.  If you pick anyone else, everyone on your team is going to moan and whine at you.
<br>
<br>I should also mention that EVERY SINGLE MAP IN THE GAME, IN EVERY MODE is built around removing combat from each encounter.  You can throw people into pits in this game, it ends fights in seconds.  There are pits everywhere.  The games duel mode, which focuses on 1v1 balanced combat.... always takes place on a narrow bridge or a cliffside.  Not just every other map, but literally the duel arenas are built around the pits.  So most duels end up just being whoever can press the throw button first. Loading takes longer.
<br>
<br>In summary, For Honor is a haphazard comedy of disastrous design encapsulated in a beautifully rendered game that looks amazing in marketing shots and YouTube videos but has no depth or actual meat to the gameplay.  Between the deliberately terrible balance, the lack of actual combat due to all maps designed around throwing each other off cliffs, to the fact the game hasn&apos;t actually been functional since release due to the networking architecture being so (well documented elsewhere and not the focus of this review) broken I feel safe in declaring this the worst high budget AAA release of 2017.  Maybe ill be proven wrong later in the year, but i sincerely hope I dont end up buying whatever game out-craps For Honor</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=7197882">Expand</a></span>

How can such a huge company as Ubisoft tell us to f*ck off and not create dedicated servers for an AAA title like this?  Another minus, just like any other Ubisoft title - Uplay. It&apos;s awful! This game will most likely be dead and have no playerbase in a couple of months. You&apos;ll see. 4/10</span>

<br>Positives:
<br>1. Decent graphics and good environment
<br>
<br>2. Unique. The fighting art is amazing, immersive and challenging.
<br>
<br>3. Customization. It has numerous options to customize your heroes and not only make them more powerful but also give them an identity.
<br>
<br>4. Diversity between the heroes. The heroes are completely different to each other.
<br>
<br>5.Modes appealed to everybody. To those that want to play 1v1, duo with a friend or to those that prefer a team based fight in larger scale it has everything.
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>1. &quot;Server issues&quot;. Yup that was a big issue in the beta and it will continue to be one. P2p is not the best way to go for a triple A title.
<br>
<br>2. Even though as I mentioned before the modes can appeal to many types of players, there are only a few of them and they can easily get old too early.
<br>
<br>3. Community. Not that good honestly. People will taunt you hard when they win( and I don&apos;t mean the classic taunts, I mean the spam **** and the chat taunt), and flame you and call you cheesy when they lose.
<br>
<br>4. There is not much diversity in heroes. As I said before each hero is completely different to the other, but the negative or at least in my opinion, is that there are only 12 heroes to choose from. In the long run it might not be that bad though as you have to waste lots of silver(in game currency) to upgrade a hero. it just seems a little boring considering someone has put a week into the game.
<br>
<br>5. In my opinion the biggest flaw in the game. Silver, which I mentioned before as the ingame currency, can be found by battling or purchased with real money. Now silver is really important if you are focusing on 4v4 battles, cause it makes your character stronger(the upgrades and the parts you buy) and it&apos;s not just for cosmetic purposes. Those that will use real money to buy the silver will gain a strong advantage over those that will not want to to pay for it. The game though is a triple A title and it costs a fair amount of money(if not overpirced which will be my next point), so being p2w in the 4v4s(the most competitive side of the game) while also costing a full price and a season pass of 39 euros is abusing and exploiting the player base.
<br>
<br>6. Overpriced. Even though the game has depth, it lacks modes, heroes, is p2w in certain modes, uses p2p(which is another important flaw imo), and can get boring after a while(not sure cause it&apos;s too early though) are the reasons that stop me from buying this game for full price.
<br>
<br>TLDR The game is good and solid but it seems that the devs are too greedy promoting cheap methods(p2p) and trying to milk away money from their customers(p2w 4v4s). I can&apos;t put a 9/10 which I was thinking to put because of the gameplay but the negatives I listed are serious flaws and what prevents me from purchasing it full price. Thus a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6970582">Expand</a></span>

If there was more to the game, say a simple king of the hill or other classic games reinvented for For Honor.  This can be solved with more content later.  Until then, I think it has a solid base, but needs to be changed to dedicated servers, and a few more games modes to keep it saucy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6975057">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Do not play this game with keyboard and mouse. Your performance in pvp will be significantly lower than that of someone using controller. It doesn&apos;t really matter if all you do is 4v4 Dominion, but if you want to be good at 1v1 and 2v2, you really need the best possible control scheme, and that is the controller, not the kb&amp;mouse.</span>

<br>I love the different classes and how unique each style is.  If you take the time to learn one hero you can beat higher level players with better gear.  the game looks great visually and so far I have no network issues aside from sometimes taking a minute to get into certain game modes on occasion.
<br>The fact they wil be supporting this game with FREE dlc is a huge plus to me.  I am very weary of ubisoft but I have to give them credit where it is due they seem to have done this game right, the only thing imo it needs is some rebalancing of elimination mode and dedicated servers so we can customize game modes, other than that the story mode is great and the online is addictive.
<br>Everyone complaining about P2P either hasn&apos;t played the game or they are just unlucky as I have only encountered maybe 1-2 times throughout closed beta and open beta and launch where I had a game disconnect.  YMMV but my friends have  the same experience. the game is so much better with teammates you know but not necessary to have fun.  If you think this is a regular hack and slash you are in the same boat I was when I first saw it but I&apos;m telling you your mind will be changed after you play it.  if you enjoyed mount and blade warband  or war of the roses the combat system is similar although improved.  I hope to see this game succeed to it gets more content to keep it fresh for a long time to come.  If you have any doubts about this game I am confident playing a few games of brawl is enough to change your mind=)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6972558">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Mix in a cauldron an action game, historical accuracy with Souls-like engine and fighting mechanics, you get FH.
<br>Being a dedicated Souls fan helped me in order to understand the battle mechanics, where accuracy and timing are law. It is not a game for everyone, since For Honor demands dedication in a kind of game that enhaces duels, imagination, patience...
<br>
<br>It lacks for competitive scene because of the connectivity issues. Ubisoft decided to use P2P instead of dedicated servers. This is a major issue to be fixed.
<br>
<br>I reccomend this game a LOT for both casual and hardcore gamers, since you will be part of the fun.
<br>
<br>Graphics - very good
<br>Sense of progression - good
<br>Customization - very good, not amazing
<br>Music - I prefer to put my own background music
<br>Voice acting - very good (I expected a lot less quality in the voice acting)
<br>Replayability - MP (infinite); Solo (moderate, depending if you want all  the collectibles)
<br>Campaing - good, interesting. Lacks &quot;tactic&quot; diversity like a meta-game where you can give orders to troops.
<br>Controls - very good for a fighting/realistic game (don&apos;t expect Street Fighter flashy moves)
<br>Maps - I like them, but they still need some work in the level design.
<br>MP experience - WHY P2P??? My biggest complain!!! This game needs dedicated servers.
<br>
<br>8.7/10 but I give it a 10 because some **** are just givin unfair scores.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6970143">Expand</a></span>

My experience is only limited to small play times, as well as the closed/open betas and multiplayer modes.

I&apos;m considering the Gold version just because I&apos;m a bit of a cosmetic whore and like the exclusives  P Gold also gives you a season pass and first access to new heroes and content, etc. However much like the Division my fear is that I will lose interest in the game before any of that content is even released. I&#x2019;ll go into that later.
<br>
<br>For Honor has its issues, much like other Ubisoft Games I fear the multiplayer mode has some glaring problems that can quickly snowball and be abused. Currently the crafting/steel/item system is one of the biggest concerns for me. The game uses two types of currency--steel and chests. The chests I believe you only receive if your faction completes its faction &apos;objective&apos; (5000 eliminations, etc.) which is refreshed I believe every week? The item system is a double-sided sword in that steel is your main source of currency. With steel, you purchase RNG based &apos;packs&apos; of items (much like Overwatch&apos;s horrible loot crate system) that give you random pieces of gear. Currently the game offers 3 or 4 types of &apos;salvage gear&apos; that can be purchased with steel, each tier offering a chance for &apos;better&apos; gear-- but again, it&apos;s completely RNG based. The higher tier, the more likely you are to receive better items. In the beta&#x2014;the &#x2018;premium&#x2019; pack guaranteed at least 2 &#x2018;good&#x2019; items. This is where the glaring and abusive properties come into play. While in one hand I enjoy customizing my character, and they did a STELLAR job at this. You can customize virtually every aspect of how your character looks-- colors, materials, you can swap an items &apos;appearance&apos; with another item. But the glaring issue is that the currency can be farmed... I feel that this could easily be abused with those willing to put huge amount of time into doing &apos;dailies&apos; and just repeating eliminations and brawls over and over and just constantly buying &apos;salvage gear&apos; to twink out their character, or even worse a Division nightmare where you end up having to just farm for hours and hours in hopes of getting rare RNG items.
<br>
<br>The customization is fantastic, but also having the items effecting stats leaves room for abuse. Imo salvage gear should not exist at all. You should only be able to obtain RNG items through completing multiplayer matches, etc-- which currently you do already. Do very well in a match and you have a higher probability of obtaining a good item. I&apos;m worried Ubisoft will open the door to allow for real money transfer to buy steel or chests essentially turning the game into a p2w. While customizing your character is fun, (I did enjoy comparing stats, and being able to tinker with my character) I&apos;m just worried that those of us that don&apos;t have as much time will quickly get out-geared by those with the ability to just buy steel/farm steel and farm crates all day long quickly getting powerful item levels. In the beta I ran into high level players with absurdly high item level&#x2014;while you can turn off &#x2018;gear&#x2019; in multiplayer modes, it still leaves much to be desired. The game can quickly turn into a game of who has better gear versus who has more skill.
<br>
<br>On to the good&#x2014;the game is downright fun. On PC the graphics, animations, gameplay is smooth as butter, combat is extremely satisfying and the steep learning curve of mastering characters is done very well. Defeating your foe with a satisfying deflect and launching into a combo and ending with a heavy blow and execution is just downright fun. I do believe there are some balance issues, some characters feel a bit overpowered at the moment such as the Orochi&#x2014;while the character is very difficult to master, those that do master that character can very easily overwhelm virtually any opponent with sheer speed and aggression/parries/counters. I found that by the end of the beta I still was touching the surface of being good with him, but saw others that could simply dominate with him. Domination mode is sort of a MOBA style mode, (3 capture points with AI &#x2018;minions&#x2019;) and with that good players can most definitely carry a team.
<br>
<br>However, with that said&#x2014;this is a blessing and a curse. Not only do you have to master your character, you must learn to fight against other characters. Some classes I handled with ease while others I had extreme trouble with. So, you must learn the other classes and how to counter them effectively, all while learning your own character. I particularly had trouble with the Vanguard characters of each faction as while they are slower, the Orochi is very squishy, one false move and you go down extremely quickly. For now I&apos;m staying cautiously optimistic, but worried the novelty will wear, much like it did with the Division.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6968662">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is getting a lot of bad feedback for P2P, but I&#x2019;ve zero issues with this, I have a fast connection and had minimal disruption and disconnects.
<br>
<br>I find this game great to play using a keyboard and mouse, but also works great on a console controller.
<br>
<br>Its brutal and hard to get into, but once you get a grasp of a character and start smashing skulls, there is a lot of fun to be had. Melee combat games are not for everyone, but if it is your thing, you&#x2019;d be crazy to pass this game.
<br>
<br>Great to see a melee combat game done properly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6972187">Expand</a></span>

Like I said, I&apos;m at a level 2 rep and that&apos;s pretty  rare this early in the game yet I still don&apos;t have access to the best equipment and most likely won&apos;t until 50 or more hours.
<br>
<br>Oh and more on the equipment, there really isn&apos;t any. This game would be great if there was a ton of equipment choices per character but there&apos;s not. There&apos;s only like 3. So that makes getting loot at the end of matches incredibly competitive. Pretty much by level 5 or maybe even sooner you&apos;ve seen all the loot there is if you&apos;ve played for that certain character the entire time.
<br>
<br>I really want to like this game as evidence by my initial rating but playing it just feels dirty. It feels like a really obvious cash grab by Ubisoft. That sucks because this game has a lot of potential but right now, I wouldn&apos;t recommend anybody paying the full 60 bucks for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6969272">Expand</a></span>

The combat is fluid when you learn the animations, and while some classes are generally better than others, none are excessively overpowered. All cosmetics (apart from a few that are linked to buying other games) can be earned without purchasing steel (in-game currency). Stat-boosting gear does not affect smaller game modes; it only provides cosmetic changes. The various classes allow for diverse gameplay. The game includes a co-op campaign. The graphics are a little gritty, but they look great overall.
<br>
<br>The only real drawbacks are the learning curve, some strangely long animation recoveries (there is no indicator for when an animation is over, by the way), and very minor hitbox issues, in addition to minor class balance problems. Many people will complain about strong classes and certain parts of the combat that they don&apos;t like, often because they don&apos;t want to learn to play around them, but all can be learned with some dedicated practice. Matches versus players feel lag-free; they just have occasional hiccups (pauses for everyone at once) when someone leaves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6969302">Expand</a></span>

Finally got into my first game, took one swing with my sword and got booted out of the game by Ubisoft&apos;s 3rd party anti-cheat software. Did some research and found that many people are having the same problem. When contacting Ubisoft support they told me to disable windows defender and anti-virus. Are you kidding me? I already have to have open NAT which compromises security and know they tell me to disable my local firewall and anti-virus. Still, I wanted to play and went back into the game after disabling. Got into a match and got booted again after just a couple swings. Ended up figuring out you could not use a charge-and-play cable for Xbox 360 controller as that was detected as a &quot;cheat&quot;. Finally got to play after disabling all the security on my computer and detaching charge and play cable. As far as gameplay goes, not worth all the problems that I had to deal with. When people get booted mid match may take a couple minutes to re-establish new server. Spent more time in matchmaking screen then I did in the game. As far as the single player goes, Ubisoft stated For Honor would feature a full single player campaign. It took me about 6 hours to complete and felt more like and advanced tutorial for the problematic multiplayer. I might re-visit the game and update my review after some patches, but as I post reviews based on what percent chance I would purchase the game with my knowledge after playing it for a day, I give it a big 0. No way I would buy this game in it&apos;s current state.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6972599">Expand</a></span>

At its core it&apos;s a &quot;fighting game with swords&quot;, but at a slower pace compared to traditional fighting games. The combat system takes a little while to get used to, but once you are familiar with it, it works really well and has a lot more depth than you might think at first sight. The 12 characters all have unique playstyles, with their own combos and special moves, so the game feels fresh whenever you start learning how to play a new one. On top of that the animations are gorgeous, the graphics are great and there are tons of cosmetic customization options (most of them you unlock as you gain XP on each character), so watching those fights is a visual treat.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m currently half-way through the campaign and having fun with it, but it&apos;s clearly not the main focus of the game: it&apos;s very linear and mostly serves as an introduction to the fight mechanics and the various characters available. The real meat is the online part, with several game modes that cater to different tastes (including coop players vs bots, which is great to get familiar with maps and online mechanics without too much pressure). Personally I&apos;ve never been a big fan of PvP but this is the first game where I&apos;m really enjoying it, so I suggest you give it a shot even if it&apos;s not your thing!
<br>
<br>To conclude, a note on the lack of dedicated servers that got the game such a bad rep: personally I had no major issue in the beta, and never suffered any noticeable lag. I won&apos;t pretend it&apos;s bug-free, but with Ubisoft having already announced lots of updates through the year to come, and seeing what they&apos;ve done with Rainbow Six Siege so far, I&apos;m confident the game will improve a lot over time. And it&apos;s already great :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6969834">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Its Tactical, Have a very deep fighting system with no what so ever P2W mechanics.
<br>Instead the MP is highly skill based. Even if your opponent have a slightly better gear you can still block and get those sweet openings in where you can do some massive damage.
<br>
<br>The servers are p2p and a little unstable i&apos;ve heard but I my self haven&apos;t had a problem what so ever with disconnects or drop outs or lag. I don&apos;t know but people complaining must be on a rely bad internet con.
<br>
<br>Also, If ppl stop buying the Deluxe or Gold editions they wouldn&apos;t be pissed about the price and what they get.
<br>I got my for 33 Euro and its worth every single penny. Tho I guess kids and streamers these days want those cool emblems and smoke effects so they look cool in there twitch streams so they pay 20 euro extra.
<br>But then please stop whining like little pigs about the price ffs.
<br>
<br>The only - I can find about this game so far is the SP mode with a story I found a little lacking but maybe a DLC will fix that up. Everything else then that is top 10/10. Ubisoft might be on its way back.  Also, Play SP on hardest diff or its to easy (imo) .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6973289">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, Ubisoft. Who in their god damn mind would set up Peer to Peer multiplayer on a game that is wholly reliant on twitch reaction. Like all games set up on a Peer to Peer the host by definition has a massive advantage, not to mention the constant host migrations when a game is going badly. Having experienced all this in the beta I felt as though a good portion of the time I still enjoyed the game and unfortunately bought on release. The 3 games I played on release day have disillusioned me. Every single game I had actions not register. Losing in this game is infuriating even when the game is smooth as butter, but to lose due to actions not registering will cause even the most sane to want to break everything around them. And this isn&apos;t due to a bad internet connection I have a 1gb/s connection through google fiber, I am however nat strict locked so I can never host. I cannot advise anyone to buy this game unless they are nat open, and even then look for sharp population declines shortly after release as the vast majority of players realize the game is p2p.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6969744">Expand</a></span>

See ya in the game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6971131">Expand</a></span>

Anyway, for those who are actually thinking about getting the game, the first thing you should know is that For Honor is a multiplayer game, mainly, but still offers a decent campaign.
<br>
<br>The combat here is absolutely flawless. Its resemblance to Dark Souls is undeniable, which involves strategy, spacing, combos, perry, counters, and more (you can say it borrows from fighting games too). It has a deep and complex system that makes you pay attention to everything you do and prevents you -technically- to just spam one button. It offers 3 factions each with 4 warriors, so far. A balanced, a strong, an agile and a kinda hybrid class. All of them with a different playstyle. You choose your strategy. It has a lot of modes, including Dominion, Duels, Team DeathMatch, etc. It&apos;s an ideal game to play with friends.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, if you are looking for a deep, complex combat, in a game that is beautifully designed with outstanding graphics and has a lot of content and even a campaign , don&apos;t miss For Honor.
<br>
<br>9/10 BUT I&apos;m giving a 10/10 for those mindless &quot;reviewers&quot; who gave this masterpiece a 0.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6972293">Expand</a></span>

<br>IT can be played in co-op or alone and is spread across 3 chapters.. One for each faction... the knights... Vikings... and samurai... and each chapter contains 6 missions and all end in an epic boss battle&#x2026;
<br>You even play as different characters with different fighting styles throughout the chapters..
<br>I was surprised what I got with the campaign&#x2026;
<br>The story was interesting, as it deals with the art of war&#x2026;
<br>and the gameplay manages to feel fresh throughout most of the campaign...
<br>You never really notice that you&#x2019;re doing the same thing over and over... which is going checkpoint to checkpoint and killing everything in your way for xp&#x2026;
<br>This is very much a game for the aggressive type...
<br>No stalking your prey here
<br>It is worth actively picking fights and searching the surrounding area and not just running to objectives because the game does have points of interests to give back story to your location.. They&#x2019;re pretty well hidden though which is a shame because I loved listening to them as I fought&#x2026; and it brought life to the level...
<br>And killing enemies again gives you xp...
<br>There&#x2019;s a story level cap of 30 and as you level up you&#x2019;ll unlock new perks like the ability to heal yourself or boost your damage or defense&#x2026;
<br>As well as pick up consumables throughout the level to use in combat to poison enemies, catch them on fire, heal your allies just to name a few
<br>It doesn&#x2019;t quite have a AAA campaign feel to it though&#x2026;
<br>It feels very much like an afterthought&#x2026; but it still managed to put in a few surprising moments in there that I wasn&#x2019;t expecting with the type of game this is...
<br>I felt it was a great campaign... but far from amazing...
<br>And I&#x2019;m not sure if it&#x2019;s the gameplays fault or the setting, but during chapter 3 as the samurai, all interest in the story disappeared&#x2026; the game started to feel repetitive, the level and mission design started to feel lazy and I was ready to just hop into the competitive modes&#x2026;
<br>But I still definitely recommend playing through the campaign first..
<br>Dealing with Ai enemies programmed specifically to act certain ways in combat will teach you all sorts of tricks for dealing with human enemies... and it takes the combat system deeper than the tutorial does putting you way ahead of the competition as at this moment only about 4% of players beat the story..
<br>You&#x2019;ll learn how to deal with annoying blockers, light attack or heavy attack spammers... as well as use combos and easily be able to handle groups of enemies&#x2026;
<br>The Actual Multiplayer is pretty great too for a while..
<br>When the game starts you choose a faction but you can still use any and every character...
<br>The faction is just the team you&#x2019;re on fighting to take control of the map...
<br>It does reset every month&#x2026;
<br>And there are tons of customizable options to make your characters feel like yours...
<br>And much like the story mode you unlock feats here as well, which act like perks as you level up
<br>There are currently 5 different competitive modes..
<br>Dominion which is a 4v4 capture and hold game, skirmish and elimination which are 4vf4 team death match games, and finally 1v1 duel, and 2v2 brawl
<br>unfortunately Dominion and skirmish are really the only 2 modes worth playing&#x2026;
<br>The game does an awful job at distributing teammates evenly and fairly&#x2026;
<br>But these 2 modes are where this matters the absolute least&#x2026;
<br>In Elimination, duel, and brawl...
<br>This is where the flaws and imbalances of the game and its characters start to show&#x2026;
<br>Some characters have spammable and unlockable attacks that put you on your back or leave you defenseless&#x2026;
<br>And online players feel no shame in doing this to secure a win&#x2026;
<br>The fact that there are so many unlockable moves really ruins these modes&#x2026;
<br>especially when they can mean instadeath near a ledge in a duel&#x2026;
<br>These modes ultimately feel cheap&#x2026;
<br>There ultimately isn&#x2019;t enough in For Honor to keep people playing for months&#x2026;
<br>The game is hard to pick up and unlockable spam attacks ruin player encounters..
<br>But it&#x2019;s still a great game... at least for a little while&#x2026;
<br>I give For Honor
<br>an 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6973884">Expand</a></span>

It will attract unsuspecting players despite the low quality simply because it&apos;s from a big developer and has huge marketing power, but there are several much better meele games around such as Chivalry (best meele combat design, bad devs, exploitable, still fun), Mordhau (upcoming Chivalry&apos;s spiritual successor, aims to fix everything that was wrong with it) and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord (upcoming, epic battles and sieges, horse combat, good meele system), so if you&apos;re reading this, don&apos;t waste your money on this terrible game and try these others!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6970468">Expand</a></span>

When it first was announced at E3 I didn&#x2019;t expect much of it, but when content began to release and the classes began to get spoiled, I got really excited about this project.
<br>
<br>Fortunately I&#x2019;ve been able to play the Demo several times, the Closed and Open Betas, and now I&#x2019;ve packed around 12 hours to the whole thing, not touching the Story mode because let&#x2019;s be honest it sounds interesting and all but the main focus and what will define the game in a year from now is going to be the multiplayer (I see story as just a bonus).
<br>
<br>I loved/hated the Betas, the gameplay was amazing, challenging and always felt that each battle was unique, the player that had more skill and overall adapted better to the opponent and even the environment wins, managing resources like skills and stamina to emerge victorious. The thing that made me hate the beta was the technical difficulties with the internet connection and NAT issues&#x2026; it was painful to have to tweak or restart my router every now and then to be able to have green or yellow NAT and be able to play with a friend. In the end I thought to myself many times if the time invested in trying to play was worth it, and hoped that Ubisoft fixed all this issues for the full game.
<br>
<br>I have to say I&#x2019;m impressed, in my mind a part of me was certain that the issues mentioned above would continue to persist on the full game build, since open beta ended two days before launch, I can gladly say I was wrong. In the two days that I&#x2019;ve been playing I had no connection issues at all, everything is running way better than in the Beta, even with the P2P porting&#x2026; which I still hope they change so that the ranked competitive scene isn&#x2019;t affected.
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;ve been enjoying this game like crazy, the amount of customization unlockables is something really nice that I haven&#x2019;t seen in a while (reminds me a lot of Halo Reach but in a more focused way for each character you level up), each class is unique with its own difficulty and fun to learn, the game modes are amazing (except for skirmish) with the promise of more to come, the maps are so different from each other and even the night/day, dominant faction icons and climate changes are a nice touch and finally the graphics at its highest with the anti-aliasing option on are beautiful.

<br>I was saddened when I entered to see how the reviews where going, and not because they are bad reviews, everyone is entitled to their own opinion&#x2026; but by the reasons people are reviewing it badly. I&#x2019;m seeing lot of complains about the Beta which is not the full game, about P2P porting which at least for me have not caused any trouble since launch, about the story mode which as I stated before is not the main focus of the game (this is like complaining about OW not having story mode), but the one that blows my mind is the gameplay because it&#x2019;s difficult, &#x201C;slow paced&#x201D; and people can&#x2019;t battle more than one person at a time (people that are saying this didn&#x2019;t play enough or just gave up to easily).
<br>
<br>This is something that players must know before entering For Honor: the game is difficult to pick, difficult to master, learning curve depends heavily in one self persistently sticking to a character and be willing to learn all of its mechanics. This being said if you are willing to take the time to learn how to play, to be tricky and to be patient enough to look for opportunities to damage your opponents, you will end up enjoying this game, especially if you play it with your friends.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this game to everyone excited for it and willing to invest time learning and getting better, winning battles is so rewarding and enjoyable and every three months there is the promise of new characters and content, I say it&#x2019;s a must buy if you are looking for a unique hardcore multiplayer experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/for-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6972779">Expand</a></span>

<br>The p2p connection is still an issue for this game, but it depends on the players connection and nat type they have.
