<br>And I really wanted to love this. I really, really, did. I tried to close both my eyes in front of its shortcomings.
<br>But at some point, I couldn&apos;t anymore.
<br>Gameplay is bad. There&apos;s no way around it. There&apos;s no inventory, just clicks on the scenes and move the mouse. It&apos;s super easy. Just click, no brain required. No &quot;classic&quot; puzzles. Dumbed down interface designed for gamepads. Why the hell are we **** up potentially amazing adventure games so much just to accomodate them to consoles? Really pisses me off.
<br>Every time you move from a location to another (and sometimes you have to do it quite often, repeatedly) there&apos;s a loading screen... and loading times are ATROCIOUS. They&apos;re WAY too long and happen WAY too often. It&apos;s exhausting. It&apos;s intolerable.
<br>Game is quite slow. Like, annoyingly slow. You can&apos;t skip animations, and some of them (like the insect that flies on the mushroom at the beginning, or Spot that does an action that you may have to repeat many times to solve the puzzle) are kinda long and take control away from you for TOO MUCH TIME, it&apos;s extremely annoying. Which leaded to an exponential increase of the game&apos;s duration because I alt-tabbed A LOT out of sheer boredom... which only makes things worse because the game autopauses when you do it (I absolutely hate when games do this: *I* should decide when to pause).
<br>The good things... I love the setting. I&apos;m really intrigued by the story. The characters are interesting. It&apos;s well written. Artistically, I am really impressed by it. It&apos;s absolutely beautiful: the scenery is really amazing, the 3D models are well designed and - astoningshly - don&apos;t feel out of place in the 2D backgrounds (as a general rule, I still prefer 2D characters and animations, though), the animations are smooth. It&apos;s truly a beauty to behold and it has a poetic, heartwarming quality on itself. Some characters (like Kyra and her bizarre head) do have some weird proportions, though.
<br>The musics are also good. Voice acting can be extremely dull and toneless, though.
<br>
<br>I love it for the story and the characters. I hate it for the gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silence-the-whispered-world-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6871729">Expand</a></span>
