That is fine given that it&apos;s an &quot;expand-alone&quot;, but unless you are short on games to play or haven&apos;t played Saints Row IV, you&apos;re not missing much. There is no character or vehicle customisation but that&apos;s fine for a game like this. There&apos;s still plenty of side missions and excuses for blowing things up, flying around and collecting orbs, hurtling a ragdoll into traffic and so on, as well as the typical RPG elements for upgrading your character&apos;s abilities and weapons. But when it comes down to it, the game&apos;s main story is extremely short. There are lots of side activities but these get repetitive and chances are you&apos;re not going to get to use all of the 7 new &quot;Deadly Sin&quot; weapons without completing a substantial amount of them. I finished the story at 84% total game completion and still had 3 or 4 of these weapons unobtained. There&apos;s also no music in this game, if you&apos;re into soundtracks.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, the content that&apos;s there is still on par. The comical value, whacky characters and story do entertain, it&apos;s just a shame that there&apos;s not more of it. I&apos;d rather have had a longer story and fewer side activities. Still worth playing if you liked Saints Row IV but only if you get it very cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell/user-reviews?user_review_id=6008929">Expand</a></span>

Maybe too short, maybe too much based in side misions. There are some characters introduced without proper introduction, or anything instead of being there, doing nothing.
<br>
<br>Also, I loved the ending(s). No spoilers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920693">Expand</a></span>

Well that is no where to be found around here. What you do get is a reskin of SRIV. Sure there may be a new &quot;demon&quot; faction, new weapons, cars, and abilitys, but there is not enough. However I will say that this is a completionist&apos;s heaven.10/10</span>

<br>Very few weapons

<br>No one in coop matchmaking
<br>Most of the game is gathering the &gt;1000 &quot;collectibles&quot; [mostly soul spheres]
<br>They also removed companions
<br>There&apos;s also less missions then ever before
<br>The game is very repetitive and has no replay-ability even if you have a friend for coop
<br>They removed/didn&apos;t include so much content that was in all other Saints Rows but they try to charge full price...
<br>This is the BS that killed THQ.
<br>I much preferred the first two Saints Rows[Consoles only, the SR2 PC port was horrific] over any other. I played through the first two saints rows 5 times, and they were 20 hours long. I played Saints Row the third through 4 times. They have only gotten shorter with reduced content and more BS ridiculous mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell/user-reviews?user_review_id=6959729">Expand</a></span>

Yes, I was really happy about that. The happiness was a little less than before as I heard that there is no available customization, but ok, the Idea of hell was still great. As I played it, I only hoped for a good story and a lot of quests. Accept for the Map and some meet again with characters from the earlier parts, there were a lot of disappointments: The Cars, the not-flexible music, the monotonous people, the veeeery short main story and the very rare sidequests. Also I wasn&apos;t very glad about the unimaginative acquisitions from steam (kill100k, kill10kk zombies, etc), for except one that was too imaginative (take this burning car into that building without dying inside of it and without any chance to control the vehicle(?!?) Which &quot;wise head&quot; ever devise that....I hope you tried that out first. At least you get too easy to Weapons, skills and cover. take some cheats to saints row III or IV and you&apos;ll get a much better story ith the same powers and if I want to play a game like that I would never give those 35 bugs for it again. In summary: total disappointment. I hope that there is a new saints Row in planning because after this tragedy of stupidity is a compensation more than appropriate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell/user-reviews?user_review_id=5356026">Expand</a></span>

Fans of the series will be disappointed almost instantly as most traits that made this series great are thrown out the window. Liked customizing your character to look like a steam punk ballerina? surprise, no customization. Liked the idea of playing as both Kinzie and Jonny? Surprise, they are completely the same, besides the fact that the plot assumes you never play as Kinzie ever. Liked the ability to drive around with your crew and complete side quests instead of the main story line? surprise, the crew cannot be called in, and every mission, challenge, and stunt brings you closer to the final boss, who shows up when you are less that half way done the game, which is when the meter is usually filled. Thankfully, they break this up with a lack of the signature saints humor, and a flying system that made me wish i was playing superman 64. Don&apos;t worry though, because the cars are equally useless, due to the fact that half of them explode randomly, and none of them can reverse, leaving you stuck in corners, since all other cars constantly try to ram you off the road. Instead of the badass reunion of the most notorious saints, with some of the most notorious historical villains joining them, enjoy seeing 3 characters from the entire saints row series return as allies, then watch them have no impact on the plot at all by giving you the same powers you had in the last game, then getting captured once. Watch some of the most notorious villains in history be ignored in favor of 3 historic figures who, you guessed it, do nothing. Instead of taking revenge on your favorite villains, constantly search the map for Dex, a character who, unless you played the secret ending in saints row 2, is completely random to add in as the only returning charcter you can kill. Use the seven &quot;new&quot; weapons that are in the store, which all have no customization, or hunt through the map for the seven deadly weapons, which range in effectiveness from one shot kill vacuum cleaner, to normal pistol that talks and occasionally makes you one shot kill enemies you already one shot kill. The plot forces you to go on endless fetch quests and repetitive enemy clear outs, since there are no creative missions. Even the loyalty missions are just a list of objectives you must complete, that gives you the same reward you would get from doing those things without a mission instead. if a lack of personality in characters makes you giddy, look no further, since without actual main missions, there is no cut scenes, which means no time for pesky character development. In short, this game took everything you loved about saints row, removed it, then made a new game with only the rights to about 1/10th of the characters. Don&apos;t release a game separate from the others. then claim it was a DLC when it sucks as a stand alone game. If it was a DLC, you wouldn&apos;t have released it separate from saints row 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell/user-reviews?user_review_id=5522394">Expand</a></span>

I am glad to say I was wrong, because Gat out of Hell is one... well, hell of a postscript. The boss of the Saints (who looks like whatever you made them look like in Saints Row IV) has been kidnapped by the devil himself, and Johnny Gat, the most dangerous man in the world and the last surviving founder of the Saints, must rescue them. You can also play as team genius Kinzie Kensington, since its her birthday. In some ways, it is the most barebones title in the series- not only are there no customization options, there aren&apos;t even any story missions save the finale- the gameplay is made up entirely of the series&apos; staple activities, like fraud and survival, with a few new ones, such as an aerial twist on the blazing activity. Speaking of air, Gat out of Hell takes your mobility to the final frontier, adding full-on flight to your already overpowered repetoire of super powers. Your offensive abilities return with elements, such a stomp that vacuums in enemies and pickups and an aura that forces the demons of hell to bow before your Saintly presence. There&apos;s also a whole new set of super-guns (and a sword) that correspond to the seven deadly sins, each with nasty side-effects for your enemies. Gat out of Hell is the best elements of Saints Row distilled into a pure form: the mayhem, the power, the guns, the unparalleled sense of catharsis. Not even the legions of hell can stand in the way of your fun. However, it is also the shortest title in the series, though it is priced accordingly. If you&apos;ve been on a ridealong with the Saints from the very beginning, like me, Gat out of Hell offers some much appriciated continuity nodding, which is remarkably one of the series&apos; strongest points. Much as in IV, you will run into a number of old familiar faces, beginning with none other then Saints Row 2&apos;s main villain, Dane Vogel. There&apos;s plenty of collectibles and audio logs to find if you&apos;d like to cover every square inch of the city of the damned. The Saints conquered a street, then a city, a nation, an intellerstellar empire and now hell itself, and STILL there seems to be more for the Saints to do. I hope to don the purple once again sometime in the future. If you have enjoyed ANY of the Saints Row games or crave a sandbox experience that makes you the center of all the fun, Gat out of Hell is a game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507716">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are in need of a update and when it comes to the combat there are bugs a plenty but if we wanted graphics we would be playing GTA5 so I knew what I was getting.

<br>The flight mechanics were cool as were the weapons and powers and while 20 bucks isn&apos;t a bad price I think I would have been happier with a 15 dollar price tag as DLC rather than a stand alone game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell/user-reviews?user_review_id=4947520">Expand</a></span>

If SR4 was a game you enjoyed, go ahead an get this one, it&apos;s just as wild and crazy. The Boss has been kidnapped by Satan and taken to hell to marry his daughter, so Johnny Gat and Kinzie Kensington go after him/her. To get Satan to confront the duo, you have to destroy hell to get his attention. A pretty thin story, but it works well as an excuse for raising hell all over hell.
<br>
<br>A number of old characters return, like the DeWynter sisters (SR3) and Dane Vogel (SR2). There are some new characters too, like Vlad the Impaler, Blackbeard, and Shakespeare. Oddly, though, they&apos;re not recruited as homies, only as &#x201C;allies.&#x201D; Single-player Gat Out of Hell is a solitary effort. And short. Others have claimed 6 hours for completing the story; I took 8, but that&apos;s still a quarter of the size of the other Saints Row games (maximum level is 20). If you want to bring the game to 100%, getting all the collectibles and completing all the activities, there&apos;s a lot to do, but the game devolves into a collect-a-thon at that point.
<br>
<br>Super powers return; Stomp, Minion-summon, Aura, and Blast each have three elements to choose from. The geography of hell is new. Most of the activities are back, though in some new forms. Insurance Fraud is now about removing years off of souls&apos; sentences in hell; when Adrenaline Mode is active, there is an explosive fire effect that can really heat things up. One of the best parts of Gat Out of Hell is the flying, which is good because you&apos;ll be doing a lot of it. The weapons are also a highlight; shooting frosting at enemies to make them attack each other? Yes, please. Shooting love dust at enemies to make them break into a sexy dance (even the titans)? Oh, yeah. If there is a downside, it&apos;s that the game is easy, even on the hardest difficulty.
<br>
<br>I had fun with Gat Out of Hell; Johnny was missing for most of Saints Row 3 and half of Saints Row IV, so this game was like catching up with an old friend. No, you&apos;re not playing as the Boss, but &#x201C;Who wouldn&apos;t want to be Johnny Gat?&#x201D;
<br>
<br>Note about Kinzie for single-players: you can play as Kinzie throughout the campaign and switch between her and Johnny whenever you want; you just have to return to the Ultor lobby to do so. For the final boss battle, though, you will play as Johnny; Kinzie enters the room, Johnny shows up, they high-five, and you play as Johnny for the boss battle. It is called Gat Out of Hell, after all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell/user-reviews?user_review_id=6386791">Expand</a></span>

Have to point out the voice acting, its freakin good, well apart from Sasha Grey, she sounds bored as hell with her dialogue. Also theres lots of new cool guns to play with while rest are just same or reskins. Hell itself is at first glance is decently modeled place with OKish attention to detail and an interesting non the less take on hell setting, but just like last 2 games once you finish the main story, which is absurdly short and most missions are just doing activities, theres no wish to stay and play more, no where near as fun as sand box as Stillwater was, but its fun while the campaign lasts.
<br>
<br>Theres 5 different endings to the game you can choose, which makes we wonder where the hell the series are going next, if theyre going at all. If it was up to me, it would just reboot Saints Row and go with the tone from first two games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell/user-reviews?user_review_id=6875688">Expand</a></span>
