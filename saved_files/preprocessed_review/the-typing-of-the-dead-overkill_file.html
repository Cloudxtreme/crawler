<br>It&apos;s pretty much just like the original with some minor improvements and you&apos;ll obviously be playing through the Overkill story. Not much else to say really.
<br>You get the minigames, there&apos;s a leaderboard, and there&apos;s an upcoming Multiplayer patch. Oh, and probably the most surprising one, you get the complete original Overkill! I was pretty stunned that it was included, although you&apos;ll only be able to play it with your mouse or gamepad.
<br>Another interesting addition seems to be custom dictionaries, although can&apos;t say much about that yet.
<br>If you like the original and you can accept the new direction that Overkill took (which I love), then get this game. Not disappointing at all.
<br>Beware! There&apos;s one con: the video options are PAINFULLY limited. there&apos;s only a couple resolutions to choose from at the moment and then you have anti-aliasing on/off. That&apos;s it. It does run smooth as butter however, and the resolutions weren&apos;t too far off from what I usually run, so it&apos;s pretty minor in my case.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-typing-of-the-dead-overkill/user-reviews?user_review_id=3682798">Expand</a></span>

I was quite a fan of the original Typing of the Dead when it came out, it was at the time when SEGA was still a semi strong company. I loved the idea and at the time it was a nice innovation to the stagnating on rail shooter genre. Then when I saw this is to come out for the PC, I cheered up. Finally a sequel to the long awaited typing experience and a good one too  at least thats what I gathered from the console version. Well  I thought they would actually put some effort into this PC port  and they didn&apos;t.
<br>Firstly  it looks like it has been made in around 2003. Everything is so low res some stages actually looks like something from Resident Evil 2. Yeah, it is that bad. Animations are poor, environments bland and uninspired and its just a whole bunch of horror clich&#xE9;s being thrown together  meh.
<br>Story? Well there isn&apos;t any, but who cares  this game tries to pretend its a cheesy B movie from the 90&apos;s with its F bombing by a afroamerican detective, funky music and bars full of hookers and motorcycle bikers. There is no reason to listen to the dialogues or watching the cutscenes, because it hasn&apos;t any real meaning to it. That doesn&apos;t matter tho  the bigger problems are repetitive gameplay, not many types of enemies, easy bosses and overall boring gameplay. Typing various words or sentences is still a big fun, but not in this outdated and totally stupid environment. So much potential wasted. If you can get this for like 5-8 bucks, go for it, otherwise wait for some sale, because this is the type of game you will play once and never look back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-typing-of-the-dead-overkill/user-reviews?user_review_id=3733351">Expand</a></span>

So, I was quite pumped for the cheap $9.99 release of the sequel. Alas, I was too quick to purchase the game  as its passable gameplay is overshadowed by its nauseating content.
<br>
<br>Having made it through the first two levels, I&apos;ve already been exposed to tasteless cripple jokes (via a Stephen Hawking expy), completely unnecessary levels of swearing (Ex. &quot;Are you ever going to tell me what that f***ing &apos;G&apos; [character&apos;s name] stands for?), and a vomit-inducing fight against two zombified strippers. I&apos;m no stranger to adult content in games, but I was quickly overwhelmed by the exploitative tone of this game.
<br>
<br>House of the Dead: Overkill pays homage to the genre of exploitation films. This serves to justify absolutely juvenile portrayals of everyone and everything involved. If you are unfamiliar with the genre of exploitation films, do a bit of research (tvtropes.org covers the genre about as well as anyone) and you&apos;ll have an idea as to what kind of tone you&apos;ll be dealing with.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay, I detected no significant improvements over the original. While typing one phrase, you are locked into completing said phrase before you can respond to other threats, so if you begin taking down one zombie (er, sorry, &quot;mutant&quot;) and realize that you must deflect a one-letter projectile about to damage you, you&apos;re forced to complete your current phrase, likely taking the projectile to the face. The words and phrases that you type are often humorous, either due to the context or the sheer absurdity of the phrase. Unfortunately the nasty tone bleeds into the phrases as well  the stripper level has you typing plenty of innuendo, the worst of which probably being &quot;viscous vixen&quot; during the boss fight. See what I mean about vomit-inducing?
<br>
<br>The original Typing of the Dead featured blood, violence, and zombies. But the graphics, voice-acting, and cutscenes were so hilariously bad that the game never seemed to feel M-rated. Any sense of danger was immediately dispelled when a cutscene would commence, and you&apos;d see heroes walking around with keyboard strapped around their necks.
<br>
<br>Between the original&apos;s absurd premise and the innocuous phrases that you were tasked with typing, the maturity of the content was pretty thoroughly disarmed, which served to expand the game&apos;s potential audience... perhaps even including people young enough to be learning to type? This sequel narrows its target audience significantly with its nauseating content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-typing-of-the-dead-overkill/user-reviews?user_review_id=3686070">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I bought Overkill on release day, despite it&apos;s M rating  assuming that rating referred to gore and scariness.  Nope:  &apos;M&apos; in this case refers to the most F-bombs per sentence of any game I have ever played.  There is no setting to alleviate the constant barrage of F-bombery.  There are single sentences with three or four curses.  It&apos;s really just a lack of imagination.
<br>
<br>However, it begs another question: who is this game for?  In today&apos;s typing-oriented world... how many people are still trying to learn to type by the time they are old enough for M rated games?  I bought the game in the hopes of replacing my ragged old copy of the original, that my two kids (10 and 12) are using.  Nope.  No way I can let them play this.  I can&apos;t trade an increase in words-per-minute for an increase in curses-per-minute.
<br>
<br>The typing itself doesn&apos;t include any swearing, though it has some suspect phrases such as &quot;Gimp Suit&quot; and &quot;I hate old people&quot; (really).
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a real shame, because it seems like the game-play is all there: a solid on-rails shooter, driven by typing.  Had they offered an option to decursify the game, I&apos;d probably be rating it an 8 or 9 (haven&apos;t finished it yet, and I&apos;m not sure I will).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-typing-of-the-dead-overkill/user-reviews?user_review_id=3679184">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There&apos;s not too much to talk about with the gameplay. You type as quickly as possible, using Tab to pick up secrets and power-ups. What&apos;s more interesting to discuss with this game is how it&apos;s presented: as an old, low-budget horror movie. It tries very hard to be as cheesy as possible. Sometimes the phrases you type relate to the level you&apos;re playing, which gets pretty funny in the strip club level. This game is a bit lewd at times, and the swearing is excessive... not saying that&apos;s a bad thing, but it&apos;s something you should know going in to it.
<br>
<br>Typing of the Dead: Overkill also includes House of the Dead: Overkill. The story is the same, but you play a standard rail shooter with normal controls instead of typing. I like switching between the two, just to change things up. House of the Dead is a little older, but as far as I know, this the only way to play the game on PC.
<br>
<br>If a rail shooter or typing game sounds fun to you, then this would be a good game to pick up. There&apos;s a lot of content in this game, so at $20, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be disappointed. Rail shooters and typing games aren&apos;t for everyone, and this game probably won&apos;t win you over to the genre (unless the movie aesthetic really appeals to you, I guess), but I&apos;ve had a lot of fun with it so far, and I plan to keep playing it for a little while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-typing-of-the-dead-overkill/user-reviews?user_review_id=3837535">Expand</a></span>

This all is at least half missing in this release.
<br>
<br>The only improvement is you&apos;re able to compare your scores online with other players, but aside of that I&apos;d say its a downstep from the original game.
<br>
<br>Original game should be rated 10/10  this one deserves 6-7/10 (giving it 7 just because of the nostalgia to the original). Maybe with some additional patches, dlcs, vocabularies and multiplayer coming it will deserve more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-typing-of-the-dead-overkill/user-reviews?user_review_id=3684183">Expand</a></span>

But yes, it is a game where you kill zombies by......TYPING on your keyboard stuff that comes on the screen. If you are familiar with the house of the dead series (ever been to some arcade game center?), this is just as fun, with grindhouse style, funny dialogues etc. On pc is almost impossible to properly have a peripheral that simulates a gun (on PS you have PS move, on wii the wiimote...), so they chose they keyboard as a shooting device. It&apos;s LOTS of fun. I have a mechanical keyboard (Razer Blackwidow latest version) and it just looks like you&apos;re machine-gun-shooting letters in the face of the enemies. If you are a fast typer you will really enjoy the challenge. If you are a slow typer, you will enjoy it too, just will die more :D
<br>
<br>Also reading the words that come on screen is fun because they may make you laugh from time to time. Funny stuff.
<br>
<br>On the downside, the normal &apos;house of the dead&apos; which is required anyway if you want to get all achievements, is boring as hell....shooting stuff with a mouse watching the cursor is not really entertaining......
<br>
<br>Only CONS:
<br>
<br>- they released different vocabularies (check the DLCs).....but each vocabulary is sold separately and is not very cheap. They should have released all the dictionaries in the normal release of the game, without limiting to one or two dictionnaries.
<br>
<br>- the game renders at 720p whatever resolution you choose. Menus will look fine but the game engine output stays at 720p.

<br>
<br>But it&apos;s not a bad option at all. What it does, it does very well, while being very tongue-in-cheek about it.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve ever played any House of the Dead game, then you&apos;ll feel right at home. This game is ported from the remake; House of the Dead: Overkill. There&apos;s one &quot;key&quot; difference, in that you swap out your light gun for your keyboard. I know, right? I&apos;ve always thought words were more powerful than weapons.
<br>
<br>As you progress through a level (on the rails), you&apos;ll see various zombies ambling their way towards you, accompanied with words or even long phrases. All you gotta do it type a word/phrase at a time to kill the zombies. Easy. But, when they start to pile up on screen, getting ever closer, panic starts to settle in. You can easily be overcome.
<br>
<br>Not only that, but you could get distracted by the chuckle-worthy phrases that do pop up. I don&apos;t want to shoot a zombie that has the words FREE HUGS under it!
<br>
<br>This game could aim for an educational purpose, helping people to touch-type, if only it wasn&apos;t for its non-family-friendly look.
<br>
<br>The Typing of the Dead: Overkill is an overall good game with a unique mechanic. Just don&apos;t come looking here for a deep story or compelling drama. Just expect to type words at zombies for a few hours. And hey, there&apos;s nothing wrong with that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-typing-of-the-dead-overkill/user-reviews?user_review_id=4907756">Expand</a></span>
