Granted, Sanctum isn&apos;t one of those 100-level tower defense games where you lay things down and wait through wave after wave without any control. I personally detest tower defense games, but I love Sanctum. It&apos;s not the first game to allow player control in waves, from what I hear, but it does it with great finesse. The game can vary from easy and relaxing to intense and challenging, depending on the difficulties. Co-op is more challenging, but single player is a good way to learn the basics and refine your layouts.<br>A large part of the fun comes from learning the game. Everyone builds differently, and there are enough options to suit players whether they want to build towers and watch them work, or be the main tool of destruction themselves. The game is challenging enough to require both improvements to really do well.<br><br>Granted, the game is not perfect. Co-op joining can give troubles, and has only worked on a local connection for me thus far. But the developers are devoted to supporting the game, already planning to implement 4-player co-op and new maps. So what the critics say about not having enough content is not necessarily true. Co-op features more weapons and monsters, and there is more to come. It&apos;s very good for a beginning developer, and they need support and fan interest if they are to continue development. Critics may only see what came out at first, and not the full potential of the developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606367">Expand</a></span>

The devs have added a lot of post-launch content in the form of new weapons and maps (both paid and free) and regular updates for bug fixes and seasonal events. Worth picking up with a friend but solo it won&apos;t last you very long unless you&apos;re a die-hard Tower Defense fan.</span>

I also love FPS games like Mass Effect, but here you have to constantly turn, look up and down... if you get motion sickness, you&apos;ll probably play it as long as I did after I purchased it.  One run, about 5 minutes, and then deleted it.</span>

The players will build a maze on a map and construct guns of various types with various abilities. When the players are ready the spawns start - waves of different monsters will be incoming and the players will have to rely on their weapons and the deployed turrets to kill them and stop them from getting through the maze. When monsters die the players make money, which can be used to upgrade guns or existing turrets or build new ones.<br><br>The game is quite well executed (very few bugs) and the design is thought through and relies heavily on the normal tower defense games. The weapons are neat-looking, works as you expect them to work - you have three of them, a sniper, an assault rifle with grenades and a freezing gun that&apos;ll slow monsters. There is a certain variation of maps, but I never felt much of a change when switching between them - as you build the maze yourself, the maps will mostly just provide obstacles for the maze you would like to build. The game, however, got somewhat dull for me rather quickly. The incoming monsters don&apos;t offer much variation - the spawn order is random, so sometimes the only thing that can really threaten you is a spawn composed of 3 groups of the same type: as you have been dealing with varied threats you have made maze for varied incoming, so when a full spawn of flyers (that can only be shot by certain types of turrets) for instance show up, your turrets for shooting at the ground will be useless. Therefore the best investment is a high level gun, which turns the game more into a shooter than a builder. Also - maybe it&apos;s just my personal shortcomings, but I have a hard time getting beyond a fair percentage of the monsters looking like genitals.<br><br>In Sanctum I never get the &quot;tower defense&quot; experience of leaning back and watching your awesome killing zone at work as I constantly had to rush around killing the monsters that slipped through your maze. Turrets can NOT handle stuff on their own and will gladly fire away at the front of a monster that can only be wounded from behind or pumping hundreds of rounds of lead into the belly of someone who only takes damage from head shots. It&apos;s up to you to stop the enemies that will need accurate shots, and after a number of games I was sorely tired of trying to get &quot;head&quot; shots on the wobbly beings with balls on top of their necks. Did I mention that most of the monsters look like genitals?<br><br>Anyhow, Sanctum is a very well executed game that will be immensely funny at first but get rather boring in the long run. If you have some friends who&apos;re keen on co-op playing it will be a good purchase though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=2335880">Expand</a></span>

The mix of first-person shooter and tower defense works well, and navigating to set up your defenses is thankfully a breeze. The defenses are crucial, but you always feel like your own fighting matters. It&apos;s one of the best looking indie games out there, and takes full advantage of the Unreal 3 engine. Overall, this would be a great game for $40... for $15 it&apos;s a steal, and fans of tower defense strategy games, or FPS fans looking for something new, will find a lot to like here. It&apos;s also worth noting that it has a 2-player online co-op mode (4-player soon), and that the developers are active on the Steam forums and working on tweaks and new content. My only complaint would be the save system (one save at a time, and save points aren&apos;t for every wave), but it&apos;s a minor complaint and likely to be fixed based on community feedback.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1593717">Expand</a></span>

The FPS brings you right down into the action but it also adds more depth to the tactical complexity of the TD genre. With the easier game settings it is quite forgiving - you get away with just having a decent long maze path and upgrading whatever towers or you want and point and shoot. However to get anywhere far in the higher difficulties and later stages in co-op you need to carefully plan your maze and tower placement as well as choose crowd control strategy and selection of guns. Should I use the freeze gun to spread out the enemies or clump them together? Should I focus on single target sniping, or grenade bomb them with the assault? Which enemies must be taken out first? Which enemies can I safely leave to my towers and which needs to be gunned down? The different enemy types requires you to master different tactics often within the same wave. It is as much a brain-game as it is intense action and the more you play it the more you discover opportunities of improvements of your defenses. Ive ditched 40+ hours in Sanctum and I still feel I have lot of things to learn. On the downside, if you never played tower defense games before or you simply don&apos;t find TD gameplay amusing this might not be for you as Sanctum is very true to the traditional TD concept. It might not be a game for everyone but then again - how many games are?<br><br>For a TD fan this is a no-brainer for a measly 15$ or even 12.50$ if you share the 2-pack. If you are on the fence, more content is being created by the developers including new maps, towers and guns. I would like to underline that the devs have been very responsive to users requests and questions about the game and they have delivered patches as promised. Also 4-p co-op is an upcoming feature that should bump Sanctum from being a great game to a superb game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606046">Expand</a></span>

What sounds maybe a bit weird works perfectly fine together. Tower Defense games usually let you build your towers and then you either watch or use few spells while mostly... watching. In Sanctum you build your defenses and then.... here it goes, actively defend yourself as well. With options to upgrade your own weaponry or the turrets or any sort of mix in between it offers wide variations of game play. So far there are only 3 maps and only a few modes, what is the only downside of this else really good buy for the price. Once Coffee Stain Studios come up with more content this game easily can climb up into the 8-9 ratings. Talking about the developers, they interact with the community on the steam forums and give insight in their work and feedback on feedback what makes me believe that the game eventually will absolutely reach a state where it arguably deserves at least 8 points from any player who likes tower defense games and gives the game some time. Until then 7/10 points is a fair rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1609368">Expand</a></span>

Sanctum is a tower defense game played in first person with 1-4 players. Sure it&apos;s a simple recipe, but it works. The graphics and audio are pleasing, controls are solid, the interface is... slightly confusing at first but honestly works. As an added bonus, text to speech provides hours of hilarity.    I bought Sanctum as part of a four pack hoping for a bit of fun with friends but not expecting too much for the price - and have not been disappointed in any way. I personally don&apos;t feel there is much that could be improved on,. Additional turrets might overcomplicated things, but perhaps a few additional maps and perhaps even a 4th weapon class (to match the recent patch allowing 4 player coop) would be nice, but like I said, it&apos;s a simple recipe and it works. I do definitely suggest that you play Sanctum with friends to get the most enjoyment out of it, but for those who enjoy tower defense type games alone, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1701483">Expand</a></span>

It also has AAA graphics and co-op or single-user game play for the price of an indie puzzle game -- on sale.  Lots of replayability on the few maps it comes with, and (though somewhat controversial) the new maps and weapons released as DLC are a lot of fresh fun that I feel are worth the cost.  The DLC weapons can be used by you in games that your friends may not have them, which helps keep your load outs unique to eachother, and they&apos;re cheap if you ever want to add on.  Those complaining of this model are forgetting how much replayable game you are already getting for the base price of 9.99.  The extra stuff is just sprinkles and doughnuts.  Play it with your friends or alone, it&apos;s a great mesh of tower defense and varied, upgradable gunplay.  Simply stunning game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=2003777">Expand</a></span>

Very fun game if you like TD games, also the variety in enemies makes it fun, you dont just shoot at the enemies, you have to hit their tiny little weakspots, which makes it a lot more fun, Although to me this game would only be good if you had a few friends to play it with, singleplayer is a bit dry.</span>

Bubble tanks and Bloons 3 got me to love tower defense games.  Those have been the only two I found fun and haven&apos;t wanted to play any other tower defense game, until now.  Hopefully the makers of Sanctum release more levels.</span>

Gameplay is really smooth and intuitive, after playing 5 minute tutorial you are very much ready to kick some ass and chew bubble gum while at it but it does not take away from the complexity of the game that is the waves of enemies. Easy to learn, hard to master would be a perfect saying for this one.<br><br>The waves of enemies, one of the most important factor of the game wouldn&apos;t mind some tweaking though. While the enemies themselves are diverse, you are usually grouped with two types at once only, and even then it can be repetitive of what kind of enemies approach.<br><br>Maps are well built and forces one to think even at lower difficulties, which in this modern time and date is only a welcomed feature. And think you can as the game is divided into two phases, buying and battling ones, so there is no haste when you are building stuff. Overall, excellent game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1676008">Expand</a></span>

Sanctum holds its own in large part because of its style, but the game play isn&apos;t as dynamic as those other two games. In Sanctum, the character, Skye, is clearly there in a support role and the towers do most of the work. The weapons are just too weak to take out swarms single-handed. The relatively small amount of character/weapon customization adds to the feeling that Skye s a servant of the big machine and not the main protagonist. This isn&apos;t necessarily bad; it&apos;s just the choice the developers made as to where to draw the line between tower defense and shooter. Some games draw that line more toward the side of shooters. Sanctum is definitely a tower defense first and a shooter second. But this combination does work well. It&apos;s nice to be able to go lend a hand when you find a hole in your defenses, but it&apos;s more stressful to have to go to the tower to upgrade it instead of doing it from a bird&apos;s eye perspective. The DLCs are really not the big deal that some people have made them out to be. They&apos;re cheap on an average day but when they go on sale, as they often do, you can get the lot of all DLCs for less than a cup of coffee at Starbuck&apos;s. If you like the tower defense genre, you&apos;re doing yourself a disservice by not having this game in your collection. At the very least, put it on your wish list and grab it the next time it goes on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=2021927">Expand</a></span>

The maps are very well designed and offer many different ways to create mazes. The game never seems unfair, you always seem to know where you failed at making your defenses, and can always change them around. The game is especially fun multiplayer, where you can have up to 4 people also building towers and working together. All around, a very fun game where content is being added all the time, and that is just making the game better. Plus, it&apos;s only $10, so why not give it a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1834629">Expand</a></span>

Complete FAIL.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=2081126">Expand</a></span>

I have sunk at 28.3 hours in a week as of this review; going so far as to put Portal 2 down to play a map. Outside of some balancing (multiplayer is unforgiving to newcomers, even on &quot;casual&quot;) issues, I feel that the foundation of the game&apos;s design is solid. Additional balancing as well as the promise of additional game modes and more content (only three guns, three maps, and six towers so far), this could potentially be the most successful attempt to create a Tower Defense hybrid to date. The FPS shooter elements are solid. Further weapon diversity- weapon modifications would be nice, though not entirely necessary-, character differentiation- it&apos;s going to be silly seeing four Skye&apos;s running around in 4-player co-op-, and more maps would flesh game out in all of the right ways.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1593836">Expand</a></span>

However its a little short on content, there are very few weapons and maps to play on. There is a decent amount of towers and enemy types though, but you might have to buy  the DLCs if you want it to feel like a full game.</span>

The tower defense element is not very good, the first person shooter element is not very good, and the two combined is not very fun.  I can not stress enough that I absolutely love the idea here.  The FPS elements break up the tedium that a lot of people experience problems with in pure TD games.  We can see something similar in (the very successful with non-hardcore TD gamers) Plants Vs. Zombies with the constant need to click on the sun laying about.  Unfortunately, much like PVZ, it lacks an economy that rewards people for brinkmanship or coming up with a very efficient solution. Another issue I have with the game is that it all feels very much the same after a very short period of time.   Every wave is a matter of shooting as many enemies in their weak spots to thin the herd enough that the towers can deal with the rest.   This gets very tiresome rather quickly for me as that is the only thing that happens in the game aside from the very slow build out of towers.   If the enemies fought back and I had perishable life(perhaps balanced against the economy?), this game would be infinitely more exciting, other issues aside. There are still to date, very few levels. I believe there are 5 total unless they just dropped one in recently.  The best level is Mine, the level in the demo.  It keeps the player very active and engaged with multiple places to engage the enemies from.  The other levels are very flat, both figuratively and literally.  They are predominately just a flat grid to lay out towers on.  The problem there is that flat grids also play very flat. The scaling of difficulty, damage, and costs are equally imagined as they are just double the rate of the previous level for whatever.  The only thing that doesn&apos;t appear to follow that pattern is the income that is slow to grow and plateaus around 800/level.  The towers and guns are all capped at level 6 so even if one could afford to keep upgrading, I think the insane amount of enemy health will outstrip the amount of towers one could lay down.  A fair amount of the enemies really need to be thinned out or otherwise flat out dealt with using the sniper rifle that will soon not be able to keep up with the enemy scaling.  Multi-player match finding is a mess with its odd partial implementation of the Steamworks api.  Finding a friends game requires luck as the filters do not work properly and at no point is it clear what one is actually doing in setting up or finding a game. Coffee Stain, if you read these, you almost have an amazing game.  What you do have is a fantastic concept with a lot of dev work needed to make this into a fun game.  At minimum, a whole lot of polish would make this game much more enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1714879">Expand</a></span>

Even though it&apos;s a fun game to play it just misses the bullseye. Planning in Sanctum is crucial as you must build the longest path with the most twists and turns to win. Before the 1st round starts and after every subsequent round there is a pause that gives you time to rearrange and add to the maze.  You the player decide when the next wave of enemies starts. The fact that there is no time limit on how long you can plan before waves made the game feel easier than it had to be. However, until most tower defense games that give a top down you have to walk everywhere you want to place torrents and blocks which is, I&apos;m sure why they have no time limits. The game is built off the Unreal Engine and it shows a little too much for me. You can tell it from the color pallet, to the way the player moves, and how the guns handle. Not that any of this is a bad thing, but to me it felt like I was playing a mod more so than a stand-alone game. However, this is also kind of a good thing since, if you&apos;ve ever played Unreal, you already know how control and shooting is going to work. Sound is the last part of this game that did it in for me. I never realized how much sound really meant for a game like this. You would expect a horde of aliens charging in a straight line down a path would at least sound terrifying. However it does not. The sense of dread or hopelessness is not there. Instead they quietly jog towards reactor making small groans and grunts when they die. Even your guns sound muted. It just takes you out of the experience and you feel like your watching an assembly line, not playing a game.
<br>
<br>In total Sanctum is a descent game, not a great one. If you really want to try a tower defense that has you running around killing hordes than Orcs Must Die is your game. If you loved Orcs Must Die and are interested in this game you will probably find yourself feeling empty either half-way or once you beat it. It&apos;s just that challenging or immersive to hold your attention for long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=2526252">Expand</a></span>

The maps and gameplay can get a bit repetitive. If they had 10-15 maps even, they could add to the replayability. I also feel they max out the player&apos;s FPS guns too quickly. FPS mode is critical to success on some maps and with anti-air, but the monsters scale way past your guns after 20 or so stages. At later stages, it&apos;s just about impossible to lose to the ground monsters while simultaneously being just about impossible to kill the air monsters.<br><br>Probably an 8 game, but +1 for an interesting concept and for critics rating too low.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=1709540">Expand</a></span>

The game is pretty simple to understand and easy to pick up. And when you play with more people, it just becomes interesting to see the different strategies all mixing together in one level. The game just keeps getting updated with new levels, new *and cheap* DLC.

There&apos;s 4 or 5 weapons, which isn&apos;t all that bad, but you only get a few towers, the rest are all DLC, and aren&apos;t that cheap ($2 for a new tower? No thank you)<br><br>There needed to be more content at launch, but other than that, this is a great game that I have enjoyed playing thoroughly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=2327301">Expand</a></span>

But what if we add a FPS expirience to an already good tower defense ... we get Sanctum. Sanctum is perhaps one of the few indie tower defense games that are actually able to deliver to you a thrill and not only make you use your brain to think of how to set your turrets which varies from standard gatling guns through mortars to anti-air, laser and lightning towers, but also gives you the chance to get down and personal with the monsters trying to move through your maze to the core which you must protect. How can one get down and personal ? Simple really - you get access to weapons from a standard AR with a grenade launcher mounted, a freeze gun which slows or freezes temporary the monsters you shoot the gun at (obviously) and many more weapons.  The game features nice soundtracks fit to the maps and the art and physics of the animations are pretty well made. And if we take into account the 4 player co-op and several levels of difficulty - Sanctum is definetly a game worth buying and playing. If there is something this game lacks it&apos;s perhaps playerbase since not many people have interest in that genre and know about the game, and the other thing is the lack of tools to create our own maps which we could share with the community. Make no mistake though, despite those cons Sanctum will offer you a challenge which you won&apos;t forget ... until we all get our hands on Sanctum 2, of course :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=2374897">Expand</a></span>

Replay value is kinda meh, the should do free updates imo to get more people interested in the game, however they choose to do DRM which is a huge downer for them.</span>

I had heard about it a couple times on Steam before it was on sale at about $2.50. So I nabbed a copy and to my surprise, it was quite a curious beast. The game is a hybrid that you don&apos;t see much of. A First-Person Shooter/ Tower Defense game. Hybrids like these really are something to look at. It&apos;s like what Brutal Legend did to RTS, made it possible for you to jump into the action yourself. However, UNLIKE Brutal Legend, Sanctum doesn&apos;t hide its Tower Defense elements.  It fully embraces them. This game also has a small sense of humor and it&apos;s always a blast to play. The controls are nice, the game looks pretty, and the fighting is fun. So why isn&apos;t it perfect? Well I suppose a substance problem is what we have. I don&apos;t mean levels, it has plenty of those, but there isn&apos;t much more than the premise it promises. No story, no structure, just build and fight, build and fight, build and fight. After a while, the fun seems to diminish a little and becomes a game to take in small doses. It leaves you with questions. &quot;Why are these aliens attacking us?&quot; you might ask. &quot;Shut up and just shoot them.&quot; the game will respond. Very few games can get away with a single trait and unfortunately, Sanctum doesn&apos;t quite deliver. Maybe if the combat was a tad more fun or the enemies tried attacking me by stopping for a good tussle rather than running jihad style toward my core. In short though, the game is lots of fun and will entertain you for hours and the game delivers on what it offers in such an amusing manner, I feel generous for it, but if you&apos;re looking for substance or story, you might be left disappointed, but grab the game anyway. Even if it&apos;s on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=3156901">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros of the game: It has very engaging game play and intriguing stage layouts that offer a nice variety on a traditional theme; there&apos;s a decent selection of towers and weapons, each with unique but distinguishing characteristics; It&apos;s the perfect level of difficulty.  You&apos;ll really think and have to apply strategy on each map to knock down all the waves but it is never too difficult that you&apos;ll want to rage quit; the controls are straightforward; it let&apos;s you play co-op across an internet connection (I love this feature, many times I&apos;ve teamed up with friends that own the game hand have steam accounts).  Cons of the game: As you get towards the end waves, the game can lag hard with hordes of monsters flooding the screen; it saves with checkpoints (about once every three waves) and does not let you save the game after each completed wave; the game occasionally quits unexpectedly (might be my computer though) which is annoying when you can&apos;t save after each wave.  The Bottom Line: For tower defense fans or anyone that might enjoy a strategic FPS, this is a great game that will get you a lot of bang for your buck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=2863533">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It BOMBARDS you with way too many towers and weapons all at once. I don&apos;t really get why most every tower needs to be built on a block. I could use more specific information on tower damage to help me learn strengths and weaknesses vs certain enemies. How do I know which lane is going to be used next? The graphics are kinda blocky and bad. Am I really supposed to get on top of a tower and shoot enemies there? Many of them run so fast I have to chase after them, shooting them in the butt. The sound effects are generally headache-inducing, especially the menu ones. And worst of all, being first person means you can&apos;t see what&apos;s going on. Even a Dungeon Defenders style of camera would be preferable.
<br>
<br>On the plus side... uh... honestly, I can&apos;t think of a plus side here :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=6898825">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s easy to pick up, enemy behaviors are clearly explained and the towers helpfully indicate their attack radius even before they are actually placed. The weapons in particular are very enjoyable to use, particularly the tesla rifle. The game&apos;s sound quality shows in said weapons: the shotgun makes a very satisfying bang, and it has a lovely animation in its telescoping barrel and heat-dispersing fins. You have the ability to switch away from a reloading weapon to a ready one without interupting the reload, an ability you will need to make use of often in later waves. Much like in other tower defense games, money is extremely limited and you will frequently have to juggle placing new towers, upgrading existing ones, and upgrading your own weapons, though I found that erring on the side of your own abilities often pays off, as in Orcs Must Die. The map layouts are interesting but at times haphazard, and Whirlpool, the map that won a user submission contest, has an absurd difficulty curve- I could not complete it even on easy, and I glided through it up until about wave 19, when it decided to drown me in a tide of Runners and Soakers, the latter being the most annoying enemies in the game. However, the multiplayer experience is quite solid, and adds the useful feature of sharing money between players. Whirlpool aside, this is a great game, and a bargain for its price considering the sheer time it took me to play each map at least once. It&apos;s by far one of my favorite tower defense games, a genre not always known for quality gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507863">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Personally not quite my thing but those who are a fan of the genre and the tactics that will come with this will get plenty of value out of it and the unique fps aspect is also enjoyable.</span>

It get &apos;s repetitive and only do I have fun when playing with friends. Playing by yourself or playing with one other friend still makes the game difficult to play and we tended to lose a lot. Even though this game is unique in it&apos;s own way I still find it boring.
<br>
<br>This game isn&apos;t worth full price but I would defiantly pick it up if it&apos;s on a big sale. Wasted potential in my opinon. I haven&apos;t gotten the chance to play Sanctum 2 but it looks better then the original game and better. If you are going to choose between Sanctum and Sanctum 2 I will choose the sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=3636941">Expand</a></span>

I sighed when I heard about it. But it&apos;s not a half bad game. The guns (though few) are all really fun and all have pros and cons, so you&apos;re going to want to adjust your loadout. Some monsters have weak points, so the sniper is great at exploiting them. The assault rifle picks the flyers out of the sky, and the tesla gun just shocks everything. The towers themselves are well balanced as well. Some only target flying monsters, and you might not wanna use up your space on them, but when a swarm of flyers come you&apos;re going to wish you prepared a tower or two to rip through them. Some target weak points, some just kill. Some target air and land, but don&apos;t really do anything remarkable to each.
<br>Downsides: Graphics are generally good, but I found some dated texture work, which isn&apos;t really THAT bad, but still. Too few guns, Too Few towers, Only a few strategies for each map, overall it earned a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=4034186">Expand</a></span>

<br>- The Mobs do ignore you whatever your doing, even if you shotgun them in the face.
<br>- The grid is sometimes not fair for singleplayer due to too many routes.
<br>
<br>Positive aspects:
<br>- The multiplayer is really fun, specially if you play with friends of yours
<br>- The possibilities to pass one level are nearly infinite
<br>- You can also play either only tower or only shooter  I think there are even challenges for this )
<br>- Looks neat for the time and playes even on low level pc&apos;s
<br>- haven&apos;t met any problems with crashing  This happens to me a lot, so I guess it works better for other people </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2011/user-reviews?user_review_id=3858661">Expand</a></span>
