I&apos;ve played Sonic games my whole life, and after their new direction with the secret rings, and shadow the hedgehog&apos;s own game, I sadly had to stop wasting money on sonic teams garbage. But I&apos;m happy to say this game rocks! And this version on steam is so much cheaper. Currently you can purchase this game for $30, which is quite a bargain for so much fun. I&apos;d also like to chime in that the modern sonic portions are strangely more fun than I would have thought. The boost mechanic really takes some skill in order to master. If you don&apos;t believe me, just youtube modern sonic green hill speed run.

But a seriously well made obvious port. Sure, in-game all the graphics for your controls are still in console form, which can initially be a tad bit confusing when using the keyboard to play and it makes the tutorials yet more confusing. Still though, at least Sega put in the effort to have a proper game launcher implemented with all the configuration options you&apos;d expect from a PC game - and once you start blasting your way through levels which are as classic as Sonic is classic himself you soon see past the development nature of the PC version of this game and see what is simply an absolutely stunning game. Sonic Generations is not just an extremely good Sonic game, it&apos;s an extremely good game full stop. I, like many others, had my doubts upon seeing from the trailers that your in-game perspective would shift to and from &quot;classic Sonic side-scrolling&quot; and &quot;Sonic Heroes style 3D&quot; but Sega has implemented it unbelievably well and it certainly adds another thing to have to think about and prepare for when speeding through a zone. Well done Sega, well done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=1831341">Expand</a></span>

(and by the way - it even offers original voices with subtitles!!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=1829378">Expand</a></span>

Great graphics and optimization, port isn&apos;t half-assed at all. It&apos;s an obvious 360 port, but it doesn&apos;t really matter because the core game is right there, and will soon be enhanceable due to mods. Get this version.</span>

I can&apos;t even remember the last time I enjoyed a Sonic game, probably the 3rd one it was. I was afraid that mixing 2D gameplay with 3D would still suck as all previous attempts to bring the blue hedgehog in 3D. It&apos;s very difficult for me to say it, but even the 3D portion of the game is actually GOOD. The controls are smooth (I use a gamepad, so I don&apos;t know how is it with the keyboard), level design is pretty smart, and the game just flows, changing dimensions in a way that it feels right and normal. Graphics is good enough, runs without glitches on my laptop. So, Sonic is back. After many painfully bad games, we finally get a Sonic game that is fun and enjoyable to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=1829312">Expand</a></span>

The 3D and 2.5D game play of Modern Sonic is the perfect balanced of Sonic Unleashed speed and Sonic Colors platforming plus great 3D plataforming that I waited for years. My only problem of this game that is too short. I just beat in 5-6 hours, olny 7 bosses of the entire game and Classic Sonic only have 2 bosses, I&apos;m waiting the future DLC with more stages and bosses. Sonic Generations is the best Sonic game in years, maybe the best I ever played. After beat the game, the game has 90 challenges to complete, Red Rings to found, replay the stages to get rank S, it&apos;s a must-buy for the fans, but if you never played Sonic before, rent it, you can pass the weekend having fun, Sonic is good again better than never.

The Pc controls are a little hard to use but if you&apos;ve got an xbox 360 controller the game is ready for it. There&apos;s a total of 45 level/activities to complete so the game has plenty of content to keep you busy. Also, Amazon.com version is $25 and it automatically ports into steam so its an easy way to save 5 bucks. 9/10.</span>

The game features some of the very best levels from Sonic games over the past 20 years &amp; reinvents them all, the classic gameplay stays true to the gameplay many of us have grew up with on Genesis, while the modern gameplay puts a whole new view on each level with the gameplay that we&apos;ve seen in the more recent games (example: Sonic Colors). Each level has kept main features, Green Hill still has its motobugs &amp; loops, City Escape still has its grinding down a steep road on a board &amp; giant truck chasing you down at the end of the level &amp; so on so on. The game has a good amount of content for those who are willing to complete missions, otherwise you&apos;ll find it to feel rather short, but the time &amp; effort used to complete missions will be well worth it, the game features unlockable skills for each Sonic as well as special concept art from the past 2 years, music from nearly every Sonic game released &amp; even more. Something that&apos;s rather nice is there are hidden easter eggs in certain levels that refer to other levels that didn&apos;t make it into the game. Personally, this game has taken my greatest memories of Sonic &amp; recreated &amp; added to them with this game, I was very impressed with how well they kept the Dreamcast era levels to the originals with the Modern gameplay &amp; I was also amazed with the new point of view they&apos;ve put on the Genesis levels. This game is must have for any Sonic fan, no matter how long they&apos;ve been a fan of the series &amp; this also makes a great first game for players who have never played a Sonic game before since it covers the very best levels in the series history. One thing I will say is I&apos;m hoping for DLC for this game and not just a pinball mini-game, if Sega released downloadable stages it would make the game even greater &amp; assure that fans won&apos;t get bored of this game. Overall, Sonic Generations is the greatest Sonic The Hedgehog game ever released in my opinion, but I hate the fact that Classic Sonic can&apos;t just make a permanent return from this game on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=1853427">Expand</a></span>

Several little hidden things (like rings / ways) and a lot of mini challenges adds a nice long playtime. Short: buy and love it - like me</span>

                                        <span>Best 3D sonic game hands down. It is next to Sonic 3 and Knuckles as my favorite Sonic game. PC version has 60 fps, which for a game all about speed, makes for a smooth and visually appearing experience. Even a year and a half after launch, I find myself playing this game just as much as when I got it. Easily a 10/10 for me.</span>

Sonic Generations tries to bring in long time fans of the series and people just getting in to it, and it succeeds. Generations takes 9 levels from Sonic games throughout Sonic&apos;s history, from 1991&apos;s Green Hill Zone from Sonic 1 to 2010&apos;s Planet Wisp from Sonic Colors. Each level has two acts, in act 1 you run through as Classic Sonic, whose levels play like a classic side scroller. In act 2 you play as Modern Sonic whose levels play like...well, a modern Sonic game (by modern I mean past the year 1999). There is really no downside to this approach by Sega, other than the fact that some of this game runs on nostalgia, by which I mean there are some things that only long time fans will understand, like Tails not recognizing Green Hill Zone, because he didn&apos;t exist at the time. That however is only a minor complaint, the main problem is the lack of deep plot. The plot for Sonic Generations is incredibly simple, it starts with Sonic celebrating his birthday with his friends when a giant monster appears and sucks everyone into limbo. After that it&apos;s up to both Sonics to run through past levels, save all of Sonic&apos;s friend, and defeat a giant time traveling monster. It&apos;s incredibly simple so for those of you looking for a deep and griping story, you won&apos;t find it here. However in the grand scheme this hardly matters, the levels are what will grab you. The levels are highly re-playable and have multiple paths, so you&apos;ll often be playing again trying to find the fastest route. There are also 5 red rings hidden in each level which when found will unlock bonus content: Music, Concept Art, etc. Speaking of which the music is awesome, but that goes without saying seeing as this is a Sonic game.Each song takes the original music and remixes it for a classic or modern feel and most of them sound great (Planet Wisp&apos;s music didn&apos;t make a good transition). But the best part is if you like a particular piece of music that you have unlocked, you can select it to be played during a level. If you have a passing interest in the Sonic franchise and want a good game to start with, then I would highly recommend this one, If you are a Sonic fan then there is absolutely no reason you shouldn&apos;t pick this up, unless you don&apos;t have the proper console to play it on. For those of you who are Nintendo gamers, there is an option. I would not recommend the 3DS version, If you want the same version that&apos;s on Xbox and PS3, then you&apos;ll need a computer. Just get a Steam account and it you can download it for $30. You can play it without a controller but again, I would not recommend it. Instead you can plug an Xbox controller into the USB port on your computer. Happy speed running!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=2638791">Expand</a></span>

Seemingly just typical PC version platformer, this game has everything that made console ports awesome: satisfying gameplay, great visuals, cool atmosphere, catchy music and some of the very best level design franchise had ever had. On top of that, replay value is top notch, and game constantly rewards players after every collectible and bonus level.
<br>
<br>Though, all of those bonus levels aren&apos;t fun, and bosses are sort of letdown too, weakest area of the game being the story... i mean... bunch of cutscenes. Extra levels have their moments, some of them being equal to main levels, but many also turn out frustrating, gimmicky and boring. Bosses have moments too, but they are mostly just simple gimmicks. Cutscenes are, however, total missopportunity. Also, take note on length, which depends on how much you want to come back to replay game, or beat friends records online. Also, incredibly weak pinball DLC.
<br>
<br>What makes this version best, is the fact that good computer runs it on amazing framerate. Mod support deserves big note here, good ones already existing, new amazing ones still coming. And never have mods been so user friendly or safe to use. That alone adresses lenght issue.
<br>
<br>Sonic Generations is not just good Sonic game, this is worthy purchase for all those in need of satisfying, arcade-ish platformer. No other series has seen such an significant step-up for sake of anniversary game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=3819975">Expand</a></span>

<br>The boost mechanic that started in Unleashed got polished in Colours and perfected in Generations.
<br>
<br>Nothing, absolutely nothing in this game&apos;s gameplay is wrong:
<br>-The control is perfectly responsive and does exactly what you want it to do
<br>-The boost is super fast and dangerous to use, which is exactly what you want in a Sonic game
<br>-The level design is WONDERFUL, I cannot believe how they actually, after 20 years, managed to bring back the quality of level design of the best 2D game in the series, Sonic 2
<br>-The music is great for every stage except maybe Seaside Hill, the remixes are wonderful, but even if that&apos;s not enough, you can collect a ton of songs from previous games and play the song you want to play in any stage you want to
<br>-THEY FIXED 06! I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m saying this but Crisis City from 06 is an incredibly great level in both 3D and 2D, the Crisis City Classic theme is possibly the best song in the game, and it looks beautiful
<br>-Actually everything looks beautiful. The models, the levels, the textures, things both from 1991&apos;s Green Hill Zone to the retake on Planet Wisp look great.
<br>
<br>Everything looks great, everything sounds awesome, the gameplay is tons of fun and has challenge for going fast (and since the boost is so powerful, you take risks by going fast, which is exactly what made classic 2D Sonic so great, you want to go fast but don&apos;t want to die, they replicated this dilemma here with bravado), the level design has so many branching pathways, shortcuts and little surprises, set pieces and just absolutely everything with the kitchen sink, it&apos;s simply too good to count.
<br>
<br>The classic levels got fully remade for 3D versions and all modern levels got an excellent 2D version of themselves. Every stage has memorable level design or moments and it&apos;s literally an upgrade on EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. City Escape from SA2 was considered really good? Here it&apos;s far better in every aspect. Less rides, less watching, more branching, more running, more playing, jumping, more everything...
<br>
<br>I can praise this absolute masterpiece for hours and give it an easy 11/10 but I do have two gripes with it.
<br>
<br>One is that while the revamped, upgraded and new levels are incredibly good, the fact is that the game still needed its own level. This is a time travel game with a very simple plot, and it&apos;s a bit on the short side(although the branching pathways give it an easy 3x replayability over other platformers), so having 9 levels from other Sonic games and one specific &quot;I&apos;m going through time and spaaaaace!&quot; Generations final level would&apos;ve been nice. I think instead of going straight to the final boss, an Unleashed-like final level would&apos;ve rocked, you could alternatively control classic and modern Sonic to reach the final boss, and it would&apos;ve made the final boss a lot more memorable and meaningful.
<br>
<br>Other thing is the story. Sonic games always tried to have very complex stories with epic elements in the 3D games, until 06 completely destroyed that by glaringly showing Sonic Team&apos;s gross incompetence at writing a story. I don&apos;t mind that they stopped storymaking that much, but it hurts this game a bit that its music, levels, gameplay, visuals and general value are 11/10, while the story is a glaring 4/10 &quot;I&apos;m just here in case you want me&quot; type of story.
<br>
<br>So it&apos;s an easy 9, bording on 10.
<br>THE game to play to make people who say &quot;derp, sonic can&apos;t work in 3D&quot; shut their mouths forever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=5235177">Expand</a></span>

They tried to take levels from all the major games over the years, but quite a few are duds and many of them feel like they don&apos;t do the original justice, e.g. 3D City Escape, which is actually smaller than the original in Sonic Adventure 2. The gameplay, on the other hand, is slightly better than Sonic Colors; most levels branch into 3 paths which intertwine, so there is a lot of exploration to be done and many shortcuts to be found. The sheer amount of variety and switching between 2D and 3D kept me coming back for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=1833016">Expand</a></span>

Sonic Generations is really a &quot;best of&quot; Sonic, and does a wonderful job of looking back on all the great Sonic moments while providing a fun new adventure! The game pulls 1 level from each of the most landmark Sonic games going in chronological order. Each level has a retro and modern version, and for all the levels, both versions prove to be quite fun! I even enjoyed the levels from the most recent games, many of which I had never seen before, so there is more to this game than just nostalgia. As others point out, though, the game is rather short, though challenge modes extend the longevity somewhat. I was also somewhat disappointed that you can&apos;t play as any other characters, only Sonic- I always enjoyed playing as Tails and Knuckles back in the day. Also, there is only a boss fight every few levels, rather than at the end of each one, but almost all of the boss fights are exceptional. I also miss the days that Chaos emeralds were earned in secret stages, rather than as a reward for completing levels. Controls can get finnicky on the modern levels if you don&apos;t have an Xbox 360 controller. In the end, if you ever considered yourself a die-hard Sonic fan, you can&apos;t miss this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=2085866">Expand</a></span>

A few complaints, mostly about the short length (the challenges are pretty fun, but I would have preferred to see more full levels). I have a powerful system and there were still a few annoying slowdowns during real-time cutscenes. The voice acting was a BIT annoying (come to expect that though), and I would have loved to see more of my favorite levels return (for example Casino Night Zone from Sonic 2, Angel Island from 3) I really hope there is a sequel with more of the goodness of this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=2103577">Expand</a></span>

Control are great and responsive but still have it flaw with some miss jump but all in all it still a great piece of game. Graphic are the best in the series with no hitches and performance are really, really great. Both Sonics and friends look great in this new generation graphic. Story are easy to follow and I&apos;m having great time playing it, plus optional challenges throughout the game. I&apos;m really happy to see the great comeback of Sonic in this new generation and I hope that this Sega beloved mascot will have great year of gaming in the future.

So you are forced to play awful 3D Sonic whether you want to or not.<br><br>Now that&apos;s been said, I&apos;ll explain why I actually quite like this game.<br><br>Level designs are all based on various eras of Sonic, but updated in a more modern style.  For the most part the levels are very well-made, taking the best parts of their respective history and making fun, exciting levels around them.<br><br>The music is as good as you remember it, with old Sonic&apos;s acts having plain music much as it always was, and new Sonic&apos;s acts having modern remixes of the tunes - similar to the euro mixes in Sega&apos;s Outrun 2.<br><br>As a fan of old Sonic, and his mastery of 2D platform gaming, I was quite disappointed to find I can&apos;t avoid the 3D levels.  They&apos;re not terrible by any means, and certainly a lot better than many of Sonic&apos;s games in the last 10 years, but they&apos;ve still failed to capture the magic of the early 90s.<br><br>Anyone who has grown up with Sonic&apos;s more recent incarnation will absolutely love this game.  I suspect those of us who are (slightly) older will possibly be disappointed with the 3D levels, but should still give this game a chance.  At &#xC2;&#xA3;19.99 for digital download, it&apos;s well worth a blast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=1916213">Expand</a></span>

I love how SEGA united both their 2d and 3d fans together so fluently! I heard that SEGA are releasing their soundtracks on i-tunes, if thats the case Im about to go purchase a $20 i-tunes card because this soundtrack is phenomenal! I can even listen to it like a cd! I love the new physics on Classic Sonic despite the fact that he gets to fast to control at time. I LOVE how they borrowed from the past, but put enough new gimmicks, platforming, and ideas in it to call it a new game. THE BOSSES ARE SOOOOO FREAKING FUN!!!!!! So the biggest downfall for me would be how short and easy the bosses are because they truly are great bosses. Usually Sonic bosses take 8 hits, but Metal Sonic can be defeated with as many as 5 hits. Despite the short awesome bosses you are guaranteed to play them over and over again as well the levels. This game shows how far the franchise it has come and even though it&apos;s had some lows that they&apos;re over. This game also showcases Sonic&apos;s best moments and makes them even better with reworked platforming and music! This game has breathed hope and faith into Modern Sonic, and shows SEGA&apos;S potential. This games satisfies me a great deal and I&apos;m proud to be a Sonic fan!!! Thanks SEGA for an awesome game!...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=2392717">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s 30 dollars in comparison with home consoles which is 50$. You already save yourself 20$ which means expectation shouldn&apos;t bee too disappointing for the price.  The controls are debatable to say the least. When I play the Modern Sonic levels at times the jump button does not respond and I am playing this on a new laptop so by no means is it the keyboard. I even checked to see if anything was caught underneath, but nope. I spotted some bad collision glitches(Classic Sonic being able to spin dash on a vertical wall) and I&apos;ve heard of the city escape glitch where you snowboard in the air for infinity. So by no means is this a polished game. Hopefully Sega will fix this. The main story is ridiculously easy.  You can plow through the game within 4-5 hours. Completing the game 100%, still not that very challenging. Though I am sure this game wasn&apos;t intended to be difficult by any means. It is still fun none the less.<br><br>The soundtrack is good most of them are slight remixes of their original counterpart. If your looking for a good sonic game get this game now. Some of us grew up with Genesis Sonic and though some of his games may not be good to our eyes I hear a lot of little kids talking about the sonic games we hate/dislike. That means that even though Sonic may not be viewed great by critics. Kids of this generation are enjoying the new sonic game. Sonic Generation was a treat to the loyal Sonic Fans who stuck with them all the way and to the new Sonic fan base to show &quot;This is how Sonic started off&quot;.<br><br>The only reason why this got an 8 on my score was because of those glitches. The only real major glitch is Sonic&apos;s jumping delay(I don&apos;t know if anybody else has had the same trouble as I did, but I&apos;ll mention it just as a precaution)<br><br>Happy 20th Anniversary Sonic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=2122245">Expand</a></span>

I played his games on my Genesis and now i can play his games on my PC. First thing first, this game is brilliant. It has about 20 well designed levels and over 100 challenge sections, and I&apos;m already in love with this game just because of those 20 levels. Challenges aren&apos;t that interesting, i found some of them okay, but most of them are pretty mediocre and they&apos;re actually biggest game flaw for me. Game demands you to pass through at least couple of challenges in order to progress. That&apos;s irritating and looks like they just wanted gamers to think, that&apos;s this game is bigger that it actually is. Because, game is really short, if you&apos;re skilled in Sonic games, you&apos;re probably gonna beat Generations in hour, or, i don&apos;t know, I&apos;m not that good in Sonic games. So, challenges aside, game&apos;s main strength are levels. I LOVE THEM! All of them. For me, replay value is really high, i can replay Rooftop Run or Escape the City any time and i will enjoy just as much, as i enjoyed it first time. Probably even more, because in levels there are hidden, you know, things, that you notice after playing couple of times. Controls feels great, except for classic Sonic, i think, but it&apos;s not because controls has flaws, it because it&apos;s just hard to control him accurately because of really bright graphics and, well, camera should be zoomed in a little bit. But other than that, game is great and worth buying. Story is ridiculous, lazy and rushed, however, it&apos;s a game about blue Hedgehog that fighting bold Teddy Roosevelt, what more do you expect? But, to be honest, bosses are pretty easy and lazy, especially final boss, i found him hard just because i couldn&apos;t understand what was going on, and your friend&apos;s advises don&apos;t do any good. Also, remixes for Classic Sonic aren&apos;t as cool, as for Modern Sonic, Classic Sonic has some, well, i dunno how to call that kind of musics, just *music that i don&apos;t really like* yeap, that&apos;s solves that, while Modern Sonic got bad-ass guitars, violins and pianos, and freaking vocal songs. I honestly can listen some of them outside game. PC port is solid, graphics are awesome and controls are actually pretty comfortable for keyboard. In fact, maybe it&apos;s for PC, or it&apos;s just me, but i found controls for Joypad a bit laggy and i prefer keyboard. So, basically, i really want to rate this game higher, because, well, it&apos;s a real come back from a hero of my childhood, that everybody considered pretty much dead. Can&apos;t wait for the next installment (not counting Sonic the Hedgehog 4).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=2912995">Expand</a></span>

They way you control Classic Sonic is very similar to how it worked in Sonic games for Sega mega drive, and here, levels do actually have some platforming and multiple paths to go through.Even Modern Sonic levels are ton of fun.While the gameplay is about going crazy fast, there is even platforming in those levels aswell, so it&apos;s a bit challenging to use boost efficiently. The game also haves truck load of challenges that you need to do some in order to progress through the game. The PC version is great. In fact i would reccomend that you play it for PC rather than on console. 60fps, 1080p, so the port is a big plus.
<br>Although, i will have to say a few things of why didn&apos;t i gave this game a 10/10, but 9/10. The game is short. You beat it in 6 to 7 hours. Still, i had more fun in those 6-7 hours then i had with days of Sonic 2006, Sonic 4,Shadow the hedgehog, together. I also noticed some tehnical problems aswell, like weird framedrop in some parts of the levels, but that is a really minor issue and it&apos;s ignorable, and if you want to play this game on the keyboard, good luck doing a drift with Modern Sonic. I really don&apos;t know what&apos;s up with that. The buttons that you are using for drift work fine, but when you wanna do it, it dosen&apos;t work. So thats proably the only reason i would recommend that you use a gamepad(Xbox360 one preferably), because you won&apos;t have that problem on the controller. So, overall, it&apos;s a game that must be buyed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=3128201">Expand</a></span>

Platforming mostly feels good, and most of the levels are genuinely fun to play. Story isn&apos;t nearly as self-serious as other modern Sonic games. Boss battles are a little weak, but not hard or over-long. Absolutely worth the price.</span>

The same goes for the music track. It would have been neat if Shadow, Silver, Knuckles and Tails could have also transformed into their super form in this game.</span>

The fact that this is merely an Xbox 360 port is rather pathetic, especially with the default controls that was set. I&apos;m just glad you can choose your own controls. I mean when I first played the game, the little blue guy was like: Press B to slide, and I was like &quot;What button is B? WHAT BUTTON IS B?!&quot; 3. Quite a few bugs where you can sometimes fall off the map where you&apos;re not supposed to when you travel faster than I supposed you should.<br><br>There are some good traits. There&apos;s some great challenges and there&apos;s a few funny moments. There&apos;s also many heart pounding moments and the game is very colorful. There&apos;s great customization too and so many collectables to be had. There&apos;s so much to do, although the game can have it&apos;s frustrating moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=1832277">Expand</a></span>

As I played through Green Hill and Chemical Plant recreations I was about to come in my pants. Then something horrible happened. They decided that the rest of Sonic&apos;s days were equally memorable and deserved a proportional part of the game. The result is a bunch of stages from games you have never played, or if you have played them, you wish you hadn&apos;t. Although the game is very short, the gameplay itself is strong from start to end. The artistic design and music are also impeccable. Before I conclude, the ending boss was so stupid that I felt it merited a special mention. It was one the worst boss ideas I have ever seen in any game. You just hold down a button to boost and wait to reach the end three times. I was about to give this game an 8 but that alone made it drop down a point. I am sincerely surprised that in a game with such polish all around nobody realized how lacking that boss fight is. Sega have proven to be very peculiar, talented but misguided over the years thanks to horrible ideas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=2839913">Expand</a></span>

Many will hail this as the return of good sonic, as people did with Sonic Colors. These people are deluding themselves yet again, and will declare the next one to be the return of good Sonic, and the next one after. And they will still probably be wrong.<br><br>I suspect I have figured out the ultimate problem with 3D sonic - that 2D sonic was never actually all that great, and 3D just makes those problems ten times worse. I realized, going back to the original sonic games, just how much time you spend NOT making decisions in that game. In Mario, you&apos;re doing interesting things. In Sonic, much of the time you&apos;re just running around, not really doing much to control the game, and the control you do exert is fairly minimal compared to many such games. This isn&apos;t to say that they are bad, but less interaction in a game can hurt it. Worse, going extremely fast (the fun part about Sonic!) also makes him harder to control as you are basically blind sometimes, and your reactions thus have to be much faster - meaning that going through the game more slowly is often more optimal if you want to survive. 3D makes it worse as it tries to show off Sonic&apos;s environment but the trouble is that the environment can obscure sonic. This game does a good job of fixing that problem, but then you are simply left with Sonic running around in fairly sterile ways.<br><br>There are some fun parts to the game - don&apos;t get me wrong, it is not terrible. But the level design is not great. The ideas behind the levels are quite cool, but the actual execution thereof often is a bit wanting, and the game overall is pretty short.<br><br>There are many worse games than Sonic Generations, but overall there is just nothing to recommend it. There are better platformers, and you should play those in preference to this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=2412654">Expand</a></span>

No boss fights unless you count scripted running scenes as boss fights. This is without a doubt the worst Sonic game Ive ever played in my life.

Basic techniques like spinning just speed you past most of the game with no effort.  The video cutscenes are childish and annoying.  The controls are only ever referred to via their console equivalents (even if you map your controller/keyboard to them) so it can be hard to quickly work out what you need to press to slide / spin etc. when you first encounter those obstacles.

It really fealt like sega patched together this to make some bits quickly and what about the added mini games where they supposed to amuse me between levels because they didnt work. I would have prefered it if they had done like capcom are doing and bring back 3 of the good ones in this case apart from 06, unleashed and colours because one 06 sucks, unleashed sucks and colours was just recently released.

It&apos;s often hard to get the controls just right. The voice acting isn&apos;t the best, although It is clear. The music is catchy and fun. The graphics are spectacular. However, I wouldn&apos;t class this as the best Sonic game.</span>

It&apos;s a refreshing change from the mostly horrid games on the Xbox 360. The gameplay is solid, and the stages are mostly beautifully designed. The graphics are stellar. There are lots of extras, challenges and collectibles for post-story. All in all a very well rounded and enjoyable game.<br><br>The stages are vivid re-imaginings of favorite stages from past sonic games. The level designers, with the exception of one stage, did an excellent job of bringing retro concepts and themes to modern gameplay. The exception is Modern Planet Wisp.The level designer for Modern Planet Wisp is a huge **** That stage was not fun at all. But overall, the stages are very well made, and I even enjoyed the stages from Sonic games that I loathe. (Sonic &apos;06&apos;s stage was particularly good.)<br><br>That said, the PC version is a buggy port of the Xbox version. They haven&apos;t even tried to disguise it. There are numerous glitches and the configuration tool on Steam is hideous. I couldn&apos;t play past Green Hill for a day until they patched it to fix a crash. There are also many control glitches that can cause you to fall off of platforms, though I think they have worked these out with patches, as I haven&apos;t seen them for a few days. Also, the story is an abomination and the voice acting is... well I expected that to be bad anyways.<br><br>All in all, a great game. True to the Sonic spirit. It just needs some spit-shine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=1910993">Expand</a></span>

The idea of 2D and 3D gameplay is clever so everyone is satisfied. The 2D are classic fun whilst the 3D levels are just exhilarating. The game looks great as well. There are a few bugs and control issues but overall, a very good Sonic game.</span>

                                        <span>Overall, Sonic Generations is a great package.  The PC port suffers from odd bits of slowdown in one or two spots, and currently lacks the pre-order bonus content, but otherwise is a solid port to PC.  The initial game is a bit on the short side, but the challenge levels provide ample content that feels just as fun as the core content of the game.</span>

So the art style is basically a mix between the original levels and what they should have been, many levels are better in the remake and work well with the gameplay mechanics. Graphics: 9/10<br>Gameplay: This title has two gameplays, the old and the new Sonic, the old Sonic&apos;s levels are all 2D as they should be and the new Sonic levels are a mix of 3D and 2D so they work well, there are some different moves from both Sonics but in the end the gameplay is very simple, what you&apos;ll need to do well with this game is good timing. There are many alternate paths through the levels which adds in replayability but they are not as extent as they should be. A good gameplay overall and light-years ahead of the previous 3D Sonic games (from 2006 and beyond). Gameplay Grade: 8/10<br>Story: Okay so there have been no Sonic games with a well-developed storyline that I played so, all I can say is that story is not the focus so I&apos;ll not really take a lot of points the simple a very child oriented storyline. Story Grade: 7/10<br>Soundtrack &amp; Effects: This is a shining spot for the game, pretty much every main song from previous games has been remixed and added to the levels which provides a very strong feeling of nostalgia which I have to say I loved. The sound effects haven&apos;t evolved much but there really is nowhere to go from those, they are already good enough. Soundtrack &amp; Effects Grade: 9/10<br>*Obs: The PC version has several version related slow-downs so I&apos;ll take half-a-point for those.<br><br>Sonic Generations Final Grade: 8.25/10 but I&apos;ll make it 7.75 because of the slow-downs on the PC version, which will mean 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=2079892">Expand</a></span>

<br>Overall, it was decent but it left me wanting more of the Sonic Adventure-style maps (which is funny because that&apos;s one of the few popular Dreamcast games I didn&apos;t buy). If you&apos;re a Sonic fan this will be perfect for you but I can&apos;t really recommend it for anyone else unless you can get it on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822776">Expand</a></span>

Many complain about the boost gauge, but it really takes skill to use. Making it almost impossible to spam. Plus one of my favorite features is the ability to unlock songs, because it is just amazing to listen to all your favorite songs from other Sonic games. Even the plot works fine. It isn&apos;t something super complicated and random like other Sonic games. *cough* Sonic 06 *cough*. Over all I&apos;d have to say this is my favorite 3D Sonic game! Great job Sonic Team. You finally did it! Though if you do buy this game for the computer bring a controller and buy it off steam for $40 and you get a bonus bunch of Sonic games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=3226493">Expand</a></span>

The only major let down is the face that because modern Sonic and Classic Sonic play so differently and yet the stages look so similar it&apos;s easy to forget which one you&apos;re playing as which can lead to disaster. It&apos;s also a shame that Sega  didn&apos;t choose to recreate more classic stages for this game. Given that they had 20 years worth of material to work with the small handful of stages we were given seems almost ludicrous. And I still can&apos;t wrap my head around the fact that they included Crisis City  from Sonic 2006. Still I thoroughly enjoyed this game and I&apos;m sure anyone who likes Sonic games will too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171299">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Running at 60 fps in 1080p it looks great. The music is also excellent, taking original and remixes of tracks from previous games. While Classic Sonic stages aren&apos;t as good as Mania, and the story isn&apos;t much in itself, the 3D stages play so well - even better than Colours or Unleashed. And the side missions are pretty fun too, as are the skill upgrades.</span>

<br>
<br>The story is also very good and it creates nostalgia. The music score it&#x2019;s also awesome and it has some old school music from the old games.  Also there are lots of unlockables and secrets here. Each level also offers alternative routs and you can explore and find various secrets. Seriously if you are a sonic fun you will need to buy this.
<br>
<br>Pros: Awesome levels, Nice Presentation, Looks great in motion, excellent level design, 2D and 3D blends perfectly, the 3d levels are fast as hell, voice acting is good, mods are available and you can play levels created by the community, high replayability
<br>
<br>Cons: some minor bugs and some slow downs, some boss fights are boring
<br>
<br>FINAL SCORE: 08/10
<br>
<br>I RECOMMEND TO PLAY WITH A GAMEPAD</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=3836237">Expand</a></span>

The graphics of the game is just so amazing and the storyline was kinda cool and the gameplay is just so EPIC. I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to any Sonic fans. Even if you&apos;re not a Sonic fan, you should REALLY try this game out.</span>

<br>The Story was &quot;nice&quot;. I miss the &quot;whoaaooo&quot; in the Story. But the Gameplay was funny and the Controlling is some getting used to. I recommend to play it with an Controller!

<br>REVIEW: Sonic was extremely popular when I was a kid but I missed the boat the first time around. Now that I&#x2019;m a responsible adult, I can waste money on video games and see what the fuss was (and still is) about. Sonic generations picks famous/infamous stages from past games and gives them to you with cinematics so mind-hurtingly stupid it will make your brain want to puke (if you get too nauseous they are skippable). But hey, I dare you to come up with a story that makes more sense and still incorporates the history/lovefest theme-at least they tried something. And while the game may lack in the story department, it makes up for it with fabulous super-high saturated environments. And some of those levels are famous for a reason: running through them is a pleasure when you figure out what path to take so you don&#x2019;t have to stop.
<br>Unfortunately, finding that path can sometimes be a pain. Sonic has a tendency to walk (walk, mind you not run) off of platform edges when you didn&#x2019;t want him to. And even discovering some paths takes more dedication than I think most would devote to what is, at its core a light game. Frustratingly, boss battles give you audio instructions on how to proceed-but this occurs while things are exploding and the music is blaring and it is usually hard to tell what is said. This led me into a few 10+ minute boss battles where I simply could not figure out what I was supposed to do (although it is easy enough that you can figure the patterns and weak points eventually without looking them up on the internet).
<br>Improving the value of the game is a (surprise!) devoted modding community. If this game were stand-alone I would rate it lower, but thanks to the hard work of dedicated fans your value for money goes way up. Whether you can get this game on sale or not, it is probably worth the $15 or so steam wants for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sonic-generations/user-reviews?user_review_id=4414136">Expand</a></span>
