<br>and it wasn&apos;t even able to make me want to play it more, i tried to force myself to play it more, so that at least i got my money&apos;s worth. but the game is too easy and it makes it very boring, and it got poor performance, nothing special with the graphics (i know its an old 2009 game, but there are a lot 2009 games with better graphics than this trash),  the acting is so bad, i can&apos;t even watch the cutscenes, and the script is also trash,
<br>
<br>and also maggie Q acting is as bad as always, man i bet they spent a lot hiring her, because of her looks, but her acting is terrible, she really should consider something else than acting.
<br>
<br>totally a waste of money, not worth it even when its 75% off, i don&apos;t think its even worth it even if EA giving it away for free, HDD space is more precious for other rather than installing this trash, and my HDD is 3TB, so i don&apos;t have a capacity issue, but this game doesn&apos;t even worth sitting in my HDD.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=4030458">Expand</a></span>

Sound FX were good, cop chases were really fun and intense, however I do agree that an SUV K-9 unit will never do over 150mph. Why a K-9 unit anyway? They&apos;re busting street racers, not drug traffickers. It&apos;s a MW clone by far, I don&apos;t know why people are having perormance issues on their systems, my rig takes a nap when I play this, with settings maxed. Cop AI is to be desired, and the cars handle like their on a magnetic track, which can be fun if you&apos;re a casual gamer, or just wanna drive a fast car and piss off some cops (always fun). This isn&apos;t an epic title by anymeans, but it has it&apos;s strengths, and it can be fun if you&apos;re not an immature hater. But I cant see myself giving it above a 5, it just doesn&apos;t have the juice that Underground2 and MW did, now if you mix the customization and soundtracks of the Underground series with the pursuit features, possible even add some night time effects (it&apos;s always daylight in this game, if anyone else noticed, even in freeroam) then you would have one bad-ass NFS title! Oh, for other thoughts, disband Criterion, I&apos;m very disappointed in the BS excuse for a game that you guys turned Hot Pursuit into, should be called Burnout Pursuit. Terrible game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=1827248">Expand</a></span>

But it lacks the shine of the previous installments of the NFS franchise. Somehow related to Need for Speed Most Wanted (mainly because of the police chases) the resemblence ends right there. It&apos;s impossible to compare such a good game like MW to Undercover. The physics are awful (all the cars handle as if the road itself was made out of rubber), the car customization system is very limited, and it&apos;s difficulty rises from a very (VERY) easy start to end with a nonsensical dificulty as you reach higher levels, whereas oponents cars can outrun you every single time, even when you use your NOS to pump some juice into your engine, the AI goes faster and faster until their car crashes into something or you pass along it with your NOS bar empty. Perhaps you may think that I&apos;m overlooking some important aspects like graphics, sound and others. Yes, the game looks really good and has an acceptable soudtrack, but gameplay is always my main concern and that&apos;s where NFSUC fails. To all those things that I critizised in the upper paragraph, you may add the ridiculous high system requirements required to experience a pleasant game experience. Even when my system is far from being high end (an e7300 with 2Gs of RAM, coupled with an overclocked 512mb HD 3850) the game on highest settings (no Vsync) ranges from a minimal 32 to a top 48 FPS, with 45 being the most common value. That sounds nice, but the game suffers from random FPS drops and suttering. And it&apos;s not the processor or RAM, when checking CPU usage the game never reached more than 3/4 of it&apos;s total capacity. This issue is common, even with stronger systems (q6600, 4Gs, 8800 GTS) the anomaly persists and it gets very annoying when your car is racing at 350 km/h and you suddenly find yourself in danger because the game stuttered and left you in the wrong side of the road with little time to react. And NO, the official patch did nothing to solve this issue. So, taking all that&apos;s been said, my humble advise is to stay away from this one. It seems that fans of the good&apos;ol NFS games will have to understand once and for all that EA will keep smearing a good name with lousy, unfinished games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=422422">Expand</a></span>

Four years after release and they still havent bothered to fix the numerous technical problems that plague this game. For me the game was completely unplayable and the little time i spent in the game was a complete mess with boring races, unskippable cutscenes and a ton of graphical problems.  Stay away.</span>

The review is written now, after 2 years as BB is gone, and NFS is developed by some useless Ghost guys (Rival is made in Criterion-like style - same stupid and boring driving, like in MW2012). NFSHP2010 was a sudden luck, and was successful only due to BBs help to Criterion, otherwise NFSHP2010 would be the same lame as NFSMW2012 etc etc.
<br>
<br>K, this was a lyrical intro, so - NFS Undercover, sure it has some stupid issues with unbalanced control (especially for XBOX gamepads, I luckily could fix it for myself with Pinnacle), some troubles with performance and graphics, still - for 2008 the game was a breakthrough, even now it looks better than some of the racing titles. The game has everything that we loved since Underground: cool OST, lots of cars and tuning. Tuning - only in Undercover it has the top notch level - you can spent hours creating different modifications for your car, and especially styling it. The movie-like style - awesome. Hot races - awesome. Feeling that you are a good undercover cop going deeper ans loosing your connections with the legal world - awesome!
<br>
<br>The game is underestimated mostly by simulator fans (the gamers cluster appeared after Pro Street, and for some reason decided that NFS should go only this way), no - NFS was always the hot non-legal racing game, go play Grid etc if you need simulator part.
<br>
<br>To sum up - lots of ppl are recalling original MW and awaiting for the game to come one day, but IMHO it already was. NFS Undercover - a little clumsy, but still a direct heritage of NFS MW: a) tuning - upgraded to top notch level; b) different modes of races; c) top notch movie-like story; d) ACTION!; e) lots of cars; f) sweet highway races; g) big open world; h) top notch OST etc etc etc. So sorry guys, but most of you missed the sequel of NFS MW, and I am happy that I understand this and love the game, coz in the end - the game is so so cool for 2008 and even now. I love it.

Just saying, to play this game, you need really good skills, otherwise you couldn&apos;t possibly win a race. And there is one minus about cars. You cant pick ANY car, and win whole game. You need to choose it wisely, check stats, and so on, but it sucks. Every car I really like, for example BMW M3, have fu***d up handling. It isn&apos;t possible to drive with it! Example: On NFS: MW I could possibly win game by every car. Another minus. On dual-core CPU&apos;s Autosculpt will freeze your game. And I couldn&apos;t possibly find any patch for it.  Deal with it. EA possibly will never, ever, ever make almost perfect game, like NFS:MW (2005)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=2593966">Expand</a></span>

Graphically, it is average with a nice atmosphere provided by the late-afternoon lighting, but is very buggy concerning any non-standard resolution where some are not even selectable without editing the registry and some will cause the game to crash often, along with a bunch of other crashes that occur for seemingly no reason. The live action cutscenes are well acted, same goes for the police chatter during chases, and all is backed by a good soundtrack which has a little of something for everyone. Story is pretty forgettable and mediocre, though. Gameplay remains largely unchanged from the previous installments, apart from the couple of new race types which are pretty bad, they quickly get downright annoying as the slightest mistake can cost you the victory. Your gaming experience may change based on how much Need for Speed you played in the past. Veterans will get bored halfway through the game, while newbloods will probably find it entertaining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=2881098">Expand</a></span>

I really enjoyed it, there were some parts of the game were it got frustrating because sometimes you would be so far ahead that you know noone is going to pass you and then the AI might just put in there after burners or something and get really close to you as you about to finish a race. The story was interesting and got you thinking all the way to the end. The running from the cops was alot of fun and challenging because you have to think of different ways to drive to try and loose them. I found my self playing it for hours on end to level up my rank in game and to get more money so i can get better cars. Some times the gameplay felt repetitive, like you were going down the same roads as before over and over but alot of times they mixed the route up. The graphics were great. Most of the missions you play are fun. The destroying another car missions are my favorite. There is not an active online in this game, unless you play with your friends. The game took me 13 hours to beat. The Nitrous Oxide in the game for the most part felt weak and it didnt really feel like you were going faster performance wise for most of the game. When you get the faster cars then you will see the advantages  of the Nitrous Oxide.  In game there is a slow-mo button to make time slow down so that you can get out of quick situations. When you keep falling behind of certain missions make sure to restart when you aren&apos;t getting ahead midway through the races, the reason being is because the races and pedestrian car set up is different every time you start a race or mission and sometimes the AI opponents crash into each other or do something stupid so you would be able to gain a bit lead over the competition. The sound track to the game got old after awhile. Make sure you save your money to upgrade your car and dont spend so much in the beginning, if you are winning most of the races with ease and not struggling through the races then you should be fine until you struggle and have to battle your way just to win a race. The best car for speed and overall domination in game is the Bugatti Veyron when its totally upgraded. I really enjoyed playing the game, and it got me excited to play the other Need for Speed games. If you love running from the cops and evading them in rural and highway situations then this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=1396173">Expand</a></span>

Indeed and the worst part is that I don&apos;t find much of a difference between this game and the Most Wanted. I hope if you&apos;re thinking of getting this game, get Burnout Paradise instead.</span>

Other than that the game engine and graphics where outstanding.The maps are HUGE and the A.I. was right up there with any other game you play against a computer(Artificial Intelligence).Overall a good game.</span>

<br>Price dropped to 40 and still isnt worth it. If it was released at 20 or 30 than I would rate it higher for being great budget ware, but this is a long running big name franchise. EA should hire better studios.

The opposing racers rely on a totally random rubberband AI and the &quot;revolutionary&quot; cop AI consists of passing and ramming. No discernable strategy, no finesse, just plain stupid brute force. Add to that a completely broken graphics engine that doesn&apos;t run well even on machines that way exceed the system requirements and looks like it&apos;s three years old to boot, restrictive copy protection and a lack of polish that is totally inexcuseable in the light of a game like Race Driver GRID and you have the opposite of entertainment. If you value your money, please stay clear of this game. It&apos;s time EA changes developers and lengthens the developement cycles on their games instead of rushing half-baked cash-in attempts out of the door.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=420104">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Horrific cannot describe this game, it is quite simply the worst need for speed I have ever played. I cringed at the &apos;story driven&apos; cut-scenes, the handling is too iffy, even for an arcade game, and the races.. no words. Presentation wise, graphics are okay and the engine sounds are fine, but the voice acting is just plain bad. Car variety is decent and luckily cop chases are still fun.</span>

It&apos;s hands down the best Need For Speed game since NFS Carbon, Most Wanted, and the Underground series. The graphics are pretty good even with today&apos;s standards, the car selection is okay, and the car customization is a little limited, but much, MUCH better than the newer games. It&apos;s basically NFS ProStreet, on the street, except the physics have taken a turn for the better. Instead of the really bad understeer that all of the cars in ProStreet had (even when drifting! how can you have understeer when drifting is all about oversteer?!?! ProStreet managed it somehow...), the physics of Undercover are entirely different. Now, at high speeds, all the cars in Undercover grip the road insanely well. Seemingly, the faster the car goes, the more grip it has, so if you go 240 MPH, you can practically take 90 degree turns without letting off of the gas. Humorously beneficial and just as weird as ProStreet&apos;s handling but on the opposite end of the spectrum.  The only real downsides to the game are that the story line is pretty weak and the cut scenes are even lamer, the soundtrack is pretty bad (the game has just about every song you&apos;ve NEVER heard of), and it&apos;s a little glitchy on the PC. I&apos;ve heard many stories about people having problems getting the game to run well.The only problem that has happened to me personally is that the game tends to freeze and crash when using autosculpt in the garage. I&apos;ve installed and played this game on multiple computers and it happens on all of them. The bottom line is that the game has many more pros than cons and is undoubtedly the best NFS game of recent times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=2887255">Expand</a></span>

However with this game I was pleasantly surprised by how you are thrown into a giant sandbox complete with random cop chases based on your actions. If you want you can just play this game for the walled off races, but I personally only play this game for the sandbox. I love the thrill of going 200 mph down the wrong side of the highway knowing that at anytime a disguised Porsche may appear and call in everything from a huge roadblock to a convoy of super fast, tough SUVs. And if you do get caught you often get a rather humorous cut scene of cheesy cops complete with mustaches and sunglasses.
<br>
<br>My only complaints are the bad graphics, frame rate issues, and it takes way too long to bring the heat up on your cars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=3572499">Expand</a></span>

<br>Now the Bad things : the game has a bug which consists in the sun follows you even through buildings , the soundtrack is bad in my opinion , sometimes the care physx are weird and the car flay like a rocket , really BAD STORYLINE ( even CARBON had a better story) , was rushed by EA and could not be finished properly.
<br>
<br>If you compare the old series NFS is a average car race , but compatible with the latest parts who have lost the feeling of NFS is a greate game. If you get past the technical problems you can enjoy the game :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=6202249">Expand</a></span>

I am surprised to see such low ratings for a game that I enjoyed so much (probably because im desperate for another good nfs game). A few scenes were a little cheesy, but I thought that the whole plot line was interesting. It was cool to feel that the whole time I was simply an undercover cop looking to infiltrate and disable a lucrative criminal organization--in fact so undercover, that I literally would act like a racer, and break the law, and win races to win everyone&apos;s respect to deceive them, and shut them down. I felt a lot like Cross, the Bounty Hunter from the other games, except that I was even more, not just a ring leader of cops. Of course I am mainly in it for the racing, and not the story that they tagged along. With the other arcade racing games, the car physics and handling are of course unrealistic, but that is what makes the game fun. If I want realism, I would be playing a game like Gran Tursimo, or a game in the NFS Shift series. It is simply fun to race, it is what you make of it. It is not extremely hard or easy. Depending on the cars you use will obviously make the game harder or easier. Games like these are usually not about the difficulty, but simply the adrenaline of street racing, running into cops, and driving fast. I will admit, there have been a couple events that took me a couple tries. The most difficult events for me were the highway duels, but it depends. A lot of them were easy, but when you are paired with a proper opponent, definitely not so easy. I needed to basically swerve through dense highway traffic, travelling at about 200 mph to actually win. Any time that I would run into a single car, then the opponent would pass me, and it would be hard to recover. They definitely amped up the cops a bit also. It was usually ok, but now I quiver in fear whenever I am in a pursuit, and then they say that &quot;the Feds are taking over this pursuit&quot;. The federal police are scary. A seemingly endless stream of spike strips and roadblocks, SUVs and cop cars. For once, I had to be scared of getting my beloved ride impounded, and I had to take them a little bit more seriously. That is most definitely when the cops get serious, definitely harder than the cops from the other games. The cops are really good at keeping up with you, and making you wipe out. Also if you are not careful enough, the spike strips can easy get you, and you&apos;re done. The game went relatively quick for me though, I have finished the game in a mere 16 hours. What impressed me the most however out of everything was the customization, and how in depth it was, something that a lot of racing games lack. Sort of like carbon, we have the Autosculpt feature for all parts of the car, you are able to color many parts of the car, and basically do whatever you would like with any decal; skew, move, rotate, scale, just to name a few. The possibilities for vinyls are essentially limitless. I was a little disappointed with the options for car bodies however, as there are not many to choose from. Also I didn&apos;t even like how a lot of them looked, so I used the stock Autosculpt on my cars. In the NFS series, this game carries on with the same theme as Carbon and Most Wanted, which I thought personally were excellent street racing games.
<br>
<br>When I first loaded up the game, I was put in an awkward place, already starting out racing in a car that I did not even choose, and I had really no idea what was going on. This game took me a little bit to get used to, but once I did, it was alright. Honestly, the only thing I could think of that would make the game better is if it had more things to do. After you are done with the main storyline, you are pretty much finished with the game. You can still race of course, and mess with cops, but let&apos;s also not forget about the online. The online seems really cool actually, but no one seems to play it. I want to actually try it out.
<br>
<br>Obviously it&apos;s not the best game ever, but I enjoyed it a lot, and I see nothing really wrong with it, I mean for what it is. Definitely better, and much more in-depth than games like the NEW nfs: mw... what a joke. Nothing close to what the old nfs mw was like, although it gets better ratings.
<br>
<br>Pretty much like a worse version of nfsmw or nfsc, but it still can be fun, I guess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=5811279">Expand</a></span>

A lot of graphical problems, anything that has to do with physics not related to the game. The story is also there, but useless. The only good things in this game is the music.</span>

The graphics are mediocre for 2008, the story is just terrible and the game is easy too. You can literarily race in a Nissan 240SX against a Lamborghini Gallardo. Yeah, and like the cops would help much either in the difficulty aspect. It is possible to evade the police without even pressing the turn buttons. What comes back is a city, which you can explore at your will, but it serves no purpose. Why? Well, first of all, there aren&apos;t any unlockables or hidden secrets you can get by exploring the city, second, there isn&apos;t much to see. Like i said earlier, the game looks pretty blank, thus you wont see any breathtaking sights, and third, like in the previous Need for Speed installments, you can&apos;t drive to an event. You can only start it from the map screen. So what is the purpose of the city? There are some new game modes. there is a Highway Battle, which throws a million traffic cars at you and can get frustrating, the outrun mode comes back from previous Need for Speed games and there are some new game modes where you compete against the cops, which aren&apos;t fun, because, again, the difficulty of this game is too low. Seriously, speaking about the difficulty again, it is too low. I can even manage to finish with a 20 second lead. What keeps the game from being a total flop, are the car selection, customisation and soundtrack. So ,yeah, that is pretty much it. I don&apos;t recommend Undercover. If you are looking for a classic Need for Speed game, pick up Underground, Most Wanted or Carbon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=5274537">Expand</a></span>

So freakin rushed that even they have WRX STi files in the game folder but not in the game. How cool is that. Also auto sculpting on PC is broken, every time i try it my game freezes and crashes. Theres too much sun glare in the game which can cause eye pain for more sensitive people and annoy the hell ouf the rest. Video settings wont save unless you fiddle with compatibilty settings. Atleast the game runs fine once you get all that crap sorted out.
<br>
<br>But even after that game still is just sucha mess with horrible driving mechanics, insane rubber banding, OP as hell cops. Car sound quality take a big hit compared to Pro Street and previous games where all the cars sound muffled once you get up to speed. Atleast cars themselves are well modeled and cosmetic damage simulation works decently enough. Story is pretty cringey, but for game of this type it kinda suits. Open world itself is simply boring looking with lack of attention to detail and roads you race arent any better.
<br>
<br>Maybe an extra year of development could have helped this game become ateast decent, but EA&apos;s greed had no time to spare.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-undercover/user-reviews?user_review_id=6784384">Expand</a></span>

<br>Second worst driving mechanics out of all NFS games, poor customization,gets boring after a while i admit.</span>
