Graphically there is no upgrade from previous,maybe even a downgrade, performance is also unstable at times. But there are some interesting changes in mechanics, more action, some dialogues where you need to reply fast or actions where you need to react quickly, it wasn&apos;t really there in previous parts. New look for Holmes and Watson is okay too, I was very skeptical about it but they made it very well. Overall I had a good time but game is quite average at the beginning and gets better with time, certainly not the best way to develop a game, bad start can easily to discourage from playing. I would give it an 8 but it takes too much time for the game to enter the proper level, almost the entire fist half of the game is kind of lackluster. Also giving it an 8 would put it on the same level as The Testament and Crimes and Punishments and I enjoyed them more. Impressive ending parts are not enough to make up the score for entire game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-the-devils-daughter/user-reviews?user_review_id=7036596">Expand</a></span>

<br>The best part of the game: The human hunt.
<br>The worst: The stealth part in Infamy (Really hate this part)
<br>The game doesn&apos;t follow the original story series, but it makes it to have a world for itself, with charismatic characters and involving narrative and dialogues, the deduction and evidences part are very well-programmed.
<br>Just didn&apos;t like that when you finish you don&apos;t have anything else to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-the-devils-daughter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6981406">Expand</a></span>

Frogware was making Sherlock adventure games before and built up a solid fan base in like a decade. Now they have new money men on their neck who want profit and for that you have to make simple (stupid) games, a five year old can enjoy. There you have it. No thinking involved here, just button smashing. Instead of quick money they should have stayed on their paved way, because this way they loose the old fans and won&apos;t get any new ones. This is a sad end for a great series.
<br>BTW the game wasn&apos;t released steam yet, still it had already 10+ positive votes and 1 &quot;review&quot; of a user with 1 review in all and copy paste text. Makes you think about the new Frogware style of game marketing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-the-devils-daughter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6484965">Expand</a></span>

This is not adventure game, at least not good one. It is worse than its predecessor with more QTE. I hate two things in games - &quot;cinematic experience&quot; and QTE, this game delivers both.</span>

<br>Besides that this game is exact replica of Crimes &amp; Punishments in graphics, mechanics and puzzles departments.</span>
