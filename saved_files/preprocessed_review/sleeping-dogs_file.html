<br>
<br>Flare/Appeal:  This game primarily appeals to those of us who like open world games that take place in the city.  If you liked the GTA series or the Saints Row series, this game is for you (as there aren&apos;t all that many games made that way).   Overall: The story doesn&apos;t compare to instant classics like &quot;Mafia,&quot; neither are the vehicles as diverse as GTA.  Both the length and the difficulty level of the game are somewhat of a disappointment.  The only reason this game is scored that high is that there simply aren&apos;t many options when it comes to open world vehicle-reliant games; and, the game takes place in Hong Kong -- this lets players experience the culture and vibe of HK which I find to be fairly entertaining and somewhat educational.  The last time I played a game that drew such a vivid theme was Red Dead Redemption.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2617148">Expand</a></span>

United Front Games did an amazing job of creating a true spiritual successor to the True Crime series that Luxoflux created so masterfully. For once, developers are not selling out to appeal to the Call of Duty audience. The on-rails drive by missions felt so familiar to their TC:NYC counterparts. While the police gameplay is noticeably different due to the nature of you being undercover, the gunplay feels incredibly similar with bullet time, dual wielding, and the purposeful lack of emphasis on shooting. You don&apos;t have some absurd amount of ammunition, and United Front did an excellent job of keeping True Crime true to its roots. The driving feels incredibly similar, especially with ramming replacing manual PIT maneuvers. The hand to hand combat feels just as in-depth as in previous games, with training locations and new moves to learn. I am just so amazed with how they kept all the things that made True Crime unique. You can still store weapons in car trunks, purchase and store vehicles in the garage, customize your player character, and so on. I am beyond ecstatic that United Front made sure Sleeping Dogs would always be remember as the third True Crime game. This consistency is a massive step forward for the industry: Call of Duty cannot ruin every game with a gun in it anymore. We can finally expect more unique, good games again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2565239">Expand</a></span>

Although very similar in many ways, Sleeping Dogs manages to improve on GTA in every way possible. From a well developed melee combat system to exciting gunfights, each feature in the game comes together to offer an amazing, almost cinematic experience - Except you are always in control. Sleeping Dogs does an excellent job of borrowing elements from many other action oriented games and bringing them together into what can only be described as a masterpiece. Honestly one of the best games I have ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2704212">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story is mature enough to keep my attention, the voice acting etc.. is top notch and believable and the &quot;Hong Kong&quot; atmosphere the game is able to portray is fantastic.
<br>
<br>Combat is fun and fluid and even after several hours of gameplay hasn&apos;t gotten stale yet...  The combos are hard to remember (Am I just old?) but that doesn&apos;t detract from the combat, it&apos;s still fun.  There is lots of potential for more content in form of DLC and even more games for the series and I would likely purchase again.  If you like open world style games like GTA  and Saints Row then you&apos;d definitely be happy with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2629502">Expand</a></span>

<br>A great game with great mechanics great story and great characters looking forward to the DLC announcement in October.   Thank you Square Enix for reigniting this project if not for you we wouldn&apos;t have had this truly awesome game.   If your a fan of sandbox games be it GTA&apos;s the original True Crime games or Just Cause then SD is a must own in your collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2647029">Expand</a></span>

<br>By far the best thing about the game is the story. Few games have ever engrossed me into their story as much as this one. You really feel happy, and pissed off, when stuff in the story happens. I dont wanna spoil it for you guys, but the story is just... wow.
<br>
<br>If you like video games at all, get it. It is the very definition of a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682951">Expand</a></span>

I was originally approaching it as just another GTA Clone but it&apos;s not just a straight clone it adds it&apos;s own things and is original in some areas. The game looks amazing on the PC if you have installed the High Resolution Textures DLC but be warned you will need a somewhat good gaming rig if you want it to be playable. The melee combat is freaking awesome. If you&apos;ve played any of the Arkham Batman games you will feel right at home it&apos;s somewhat the same system with quick counters and the like. But with that being said the shooting portions of the game really let the combat down it&apos;s mediocre at best but luckily a huge portion of the combat is melee orientated. The driving is average. Nothing special to scream about cept the option to jump out your car action movie style onto another one and the physics defying sideways shunting you can do to take down pursuing vehicles. The story is enough at least for me to be entertained for a while. It&apos;s not overly action movie like but it is predictable in some spots. I really like the system of leveling up both your gang level and your cop level to really tailor the character to your liking. Even though from the sounds of it this game was in a development hell for a while I&apos;m glad the developers stuck by until a publisher finally saw the great potential the game had and released it. This game wasn&apos;t even on my radar until I saw it for sale for 50% off and for 25$ I think it&apos;s a great game worth the pick up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2730947">Expand</a></span>

You can get weapons, but it usually involves you breaking the law by either jacking one from a cop or from the trunk of a cop car, which seems kind of silly when you can leap out of your car at 100 mph into a car in front of you and hijack it. I understand they wanted to keep this game more kung-fu based, but it&apos;s not really cool when you&apos;re approaching a lockbox and a whole crew defending it unloads on you while you&apos;re unarmed. Aside from this, the game is great and has a solid sound track, and I&apos;d definitely recommend it to anyone who loved the GTA series and Saints Row. Just understand that you won&apos;t be able to grab an RPG out of your backpack and blow up tens of cars and people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2731438">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only thing I didn&apos;t like too much were the chasing parts of missions: in my opinion they were too easy, but that could be me too...
<br>
<br>All in all, the game isn&apos;t too original, but still really really enjoyable! I have spent a lot of time in this game, and I still really enjoy it and will spend a lot more time in Hong Kong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2878124">Expand</a></span>

On PC, Hong Kong looks very realistic and nice. Cars handle very nicely and slow-motion 18K fights are great. There are many combat moves to unlock and are unlocked by collecting statues. You will learn from the martial arts master there. Fight clubs are fun and rewarding, and races are usually pretty good. Hijacking the trucks takes lots of luck and skill to evade the convoy of police that will chase you, and the player/people interaction is well done. Favors and chasing thieves are great time wasters. Buying food and drinks are rewarding, and the buildings you can go into are detailed and cool. The story is amazing, one of the best I&apos;ve ever played. You feel like you really are part of the gang or police, and I felt very connected with the characters. If you can pick this up for a good price, get it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2969478">Expand</a></span>

While the fighting part of the game play was good and challenging, the free running and shooting aspects weren&apos;t as well implemented as they could have been. Also being able to purchase cars and clothing seemed unnecessary. To me there just seemed to be a lot of excess and underdeveloped or unpolished aspects in the game.
<br>
<br>Overall I think this was a good game and enjoyed playing it. If I was a consumer looking to play this I&apos;d recommend borrowing or renting it first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447171">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I personally loved the storyline; this can be viewed as an Asian version of GTA with much improvements. The city size is comparable to GTAIV, and is busily packed as expected in Hong Kong. More importantly, this game felt REAL. Although a variety of firearms can be had, the fighting is primarily combat based; Brawling. Although you ultimately unlock all character abilities for the 3 categories (police, triad, respect) by leveling up with experience gained from missions, special combat moves can only be unlocked by finding hidden statues delivered to this master guru. If you have ever played Batman Arkham (Asylum or City), this is a much more refined and developed fighting system. You must respond swiftly to counter attack, or utilize the environment for awesome finishing moves. (smash head repeated with car door or refridgerator, smash them into a dumpster, or telephone booth.. so many more!) You are also able to open trunks of cars to search for weapons like a tire iron, knife, or pistol. All of these aspects seem very fitting and realistic; No, you wont be able to cycle through all 8 weapons you are carrying, or customize your car beyond its paint job, but you can get some &apos;asian massages&apos; which always help, heh heh. The story line is terrific, but then again, I&apos;m asian. Nonetheless, I felt vested with Shen, which I think is cornerstone to a good gaming experience. As an undercover cop / asian triad gangster... my number one challenge was driving on the left side of the road. At high speeds it can get quite challenging to drive on the opposite isde of the road. Especially in police missions, you lose points for stealing cars, hurting civilians, or damaging public property. You can also lose points for being &apos;clumsy&apos;, such as running into a table or tripping when chasing an enemy. I thought that was quirky. Upon completing the main story, I had maxed out my Respect, Police, and Combat abilities. I was short on triad points; apparently I was not violent enough! I think this helps reinforce generating cool, unique combo attacks for more exp points than shooting with a gun (unless headshot, some bonus exp). During long fights, subsequent combos will charge and release your &apos;fear meter&apos;, when your enemies basically cower for several seconds at your awesomeness while you do some extra damage, ha! There are several in-game puzzles, like cracking a safe or &apos;grid&apos;, but they were all trivial at best, which I preferred. I dont like games that make you stop your intense action to play sudoku before unlocking your objective. Anyways, the graphics are AMAZING. And the atmosphere of the City makes you feel &apos;in the zone&apos;. At 54hrs, I completed the main story line with &gt;50% progress for most of the side stories, missions. Obviously you can finish the game much faster, but I really enjoyed the environment and took my time. Unlike GTA, and esp SR3, this is not a city-rampage style game (although you could do that, Tactical/SWAT DLC). It&apos;s harder to lose cops / stars when you are being chased, because its HongKong, and its crowded and you;re driving on the left side of the road. Ultimately, completing the main story was bitter-sweet. Thankfully, SteamSale for Shaolin, Nightmare, and SWAT DLCs, I can hopefully add on some more hours of play. Overall, Sleeping Dogs did an excellent job recreating HongKong, the bright vibrant atmosphere, and keeping me vested and engaged with the antagonist. The Graphics were Amazing (rainfall?! city night lights reflecting from my kick-ass car wax-job?!) Gameplay was very engaging and precise; it was like gangster Streetfighter, sorta. Don&apos;t Miss this Game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2861780">Expand</a></span>

<br>Its a very strange game to score. The driving feels weaker, and the controls/camera can sometimes be a bit wanky, but I feel it deserves a 9 based on how much ive enjoyed playing it. Its definitely a game thats greater than the sum of its parts, and there are alot of parts. Driving, missions with lots of mini games for hacking, lock picking, bug calibration, cell phone triangulation. Foot and vehicle chases. Shoot-outs and lots of asskicking Kung-fu. Aswell as the great Hong Kong environments, the combat is very much its strong point and feels really satisfying. Im going to say it, the fighting is better than the GTA series by miles!
<br>
<br>If you get the chance to grab this in the sales, i would suggest you do. I&apos;ve really enjoyed my fortnight in Hong Kong for the price of a few pints.
<br>
<br>Is it better than GTA IV.....Well maybe not. But GTA doesnt have bloody Kung-Fu and meat cleavers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2872191">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game does has some issues that most of these types of games have, that is, the driving can be clunky, especially on lower end PCs. There are random bugs/glitches and finding things can be downright annoying. But overall, the story and graphics are amazing, the chasing and fighting is really good. Some people are disappointed about the lack of shooting but it IS Hong Kong; guns are very much illegal for the average citizen, so guns would not be plentiful. Plus, physically punching, kicking people is more visceral and entertaining at times.
<br>
<br>I would say check this game out, I would (arguably) say that it is not worth buying at full price (I got this game for 18.75$, 50% off and an amazon coupon code), but there is a sale on it on Steam right now.
<br>
<br>TL; DR? its GTA in Hong Kong, it has fun fighting, the story and graphics are good, even with a few hiccups along the way, its short but has DLCs and most likely more to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2789132">Expand</a></span>

<br>I found a glitch, though, which made me drop down the resolution because my action were not getting recorded. I had to find it through the forums.
<br>
<br>This is one of the only games I have wanted to finish. In fact, i couldn&apos;t finish FFVII because of a glitch just before the last scene. But I had to finish this because I was so addicted.

Played this game since midnight w/ high res pack and it looks pretty, combat so far is very responsive and the open world feels alive.
<br>
<br>Driving feels better than any &quot;sandbox&quot; to date.. Tight and physics feel &quot;right&quot;.. Driving on the left side of the road did take a few to get used to but im usually driving like a madman anyways BUT during missions hitting / smashing etc will lower the &quot;cop rating&quot; and perfomance.. There is triad rating (bad) and cop (good) although in my personal beliefs its reversed,lol
<br>
<br>The voice acting is very good, story has been paced well and plenty of action sequences and varied combat w/o a hiccup in the &quot;momentum&quot; dept, it all feels right and driven.
<br>
<br>Upgrades avail and just like the gta&apos;s and saints rows there is shopping, cars to steal and own but the &quot;face points&quot; are of triad status meaning the more you obtain the beter gear one will unlock.
<br>
<br>I was seriously hoping square enix didnt have United Front slap some generic saints row re-hash w/ a different skin, So not the case.
<br>
<br>This game feels of its own, combat feels great and progression feels worth while and side missions i seek rather than bypass.
<br>
<br>I must be honest i am milking this one, finding every case and shrine (health and boost unlocks in the form of a prayer box), side mission etc. I fell in love w/ this one since start..
<br>
<br>I have to also submit that i am just 3 hours into this game but the more i put in, the more i am delighted.
<br>
<br>Please give this a shot, a must for sandbox fans.. truely an open world w/ tons of things to do but doing them in sleeping dogs style. May seem like another sandboxer on the outside but on the inside it truely is of its own and i have no complaints and usually this is rare for me.
<br>
<br>Rent it, borrow it, buy it.. its a game i higly reccomend you try at some point.

If you love open world games with excellent storytelling, amazing melee combat, great gun-play, and white knuckled driving sequences...look no further.  I was a fan of the True Crime series, but this is the evolution I wanted to see in these games.  Taking the best parts of other similar games, United Front has really made it their own and an absolutely polished gem.  The graphics (full out) on PC are breathtaking and the amount of detail in the world, and the speed at which this detail can go rushing by, is a sight to behold.
<br>
<br>I was addicted from the moment it started and spent every spare moment playing the game until the intense and satisfying conclusion. A graphical feast with truly lifelike audio, excellent acting, and a strong storyline made me care about the characters in the game like few others.  United Front thought of everything to make the game a challenge yet never one moment of tedious gameplay like these style of games can fall into.
<br>
<br>Stupendous accomplishment.  High praise to Square Enix for recognizing the amazing vision of United Front and I look forward to future offerings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2960410">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only downfall to this game is that the story only runs about 20 hours, I wish it had more, but then again I&apos;m sure there will be DLC for this title.

It&apos;s not perfect, but what game is these days?  You&apos;ll have some finicky controls here and there if you are using a mouse and keyboard but after the third hour of gameplay, you&apos;ll know all the ins and outs and be able to drive like a pro and strut your stuff all around Hong Kong like the best of them.  I can&apos;t recommend this game highly enough.  I&apos;m pleasantly surprised by just how great this game is.

Most issues have been fixed now but company&apos;s cant keep getting away with releasing buggy games and expecting the community to fix it. 9 if the game was working from the start</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2647130">Expand</a></span>

I saw there was already an update being downloaded! 2 days after release it&apos;s completely patched! Now to the actual game, It was amazing! I had played Mafia 2 before this, and thought it couldn&apos;t be beat, but this game matches the story and blows the gameplay out of the water! This is the most open game I have ever played! When I need to take out a bunch of thugs I can: Fight them all, shoot them all, stab them all, or just run them all down from the safety of my car, plus any combination of the three! The melee combat system is phenominal and original! I was just expecting some punch combos and roundhouse kicks, but as soon as my guy hit the ground he was breaking arms and legs, and using every imaginable everyday object to kill people! Whether it&apos;s phonebooths, air conditioners, or good old car doors, you can smash just about anyone into just about anything! Plus the driving is amazing, and the game encourages you to get good at it, it wouldn&apos;t be Asia without street racing after all. And the freerunning element of the game is also very well done. If it&apos;s not your thing, you won&apos;t have to do it to get around, and when it is in missions you&apos;ll have pretty obvious guides helping you through it. Plus you can USE TAXIS! Always bugged me in other games, especially when missions required you to drive across town and back. It&apos;s like a sort of fast travel without breaking immersion. Skill advancement is also very well done, as you can focus on or neglect areas of development in order to get what you want out of the multiple skill trees. Though you can still have everything in the end, if that&apos;s your thing, and you wanna work hard for it(I still haven&apos;t accomplished this :P). So all in all, enthralling story, original and awesome gameplay, beautiful graphics even on ~medium, and FUN! Plus you can try to beat your friends&apos; scores with the ingame social hub feature, but that&apos;s not really my cup of tea. Also KARATE! Did I mention you can break arms and legs and throw dudes and stuff?!?!?! Also tackling, grappling, and lol why haven&apos;t you bought this yet?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2568428">Expand</a></span>

This game is awesome. Story wise it&apos;s very solid, with a very interesting story that keeps you entertained a lot. The characters are somewhat memorable and some even remarkable, and most are very charismatic. Now, the gameplay; It feels very solid too, the fighting mechanics are amazing and clearly the best feature in this game, it&apos;s fun and brings up a thing few games do: instead of difficulty, they try to make you mix up combos and try different things. Much like in Devil May Cry where you have to mix things and taunt to level up your style ranking. The driving is arcady and in my opinion fits greatly to the game. The driving in GTA 4 was realistic and very annoying, if it&apos;s not realistic but fun I take it with joy. Gunplay is good and is on the right place, and the driving gunplay is awesome as well, with that epic cinematic feeling. The game&apos;s flow is incredibly good and the game feeling is distinct and quite immersive. Talkin&apos; about graphics, I must say this game is a piece of work. Very good graphics, with a good artwork. This game feels alive, it&apos;s enjoyable to look at it. GTA IV was quite the contrary. Realistic, yes, but ugly. There was no appeal to the dark and blank cities. GTA IV proved to me that realism isn&apos;t always good. Now talking about &apos;fun factor&apos;, this game is one of the best open world mission-based games I&apos;ve ever played. It is limited and smaller than GTA IV, may not be as realistic or detailed or whatever, but just tops it because of the incredible flow and fun the game provides. I&apos;d say this game is better than all GTA&apos;s except san andreas; but to be honest I don&apos;t really think this game resembles GTA in any way, what the game proposes to deliver is just nothing like GTA, they&apos;re overall very distinct games. Last, but not least, the soundtrack of this game is also very good, not many known songs but the music selection is great and I doubt you&apos;ll finish the game and not want to look for at least a few songs that got stuck in your head. Now, talkin&apos; about PC specifics, some people might not like the way it&apos;s ported, but update 1.5 fixed most problems with KB and Mouse. Haven&apos;t experienced any serious glitches and I played with a controller, I can&apos;t complain about a thing. This game is amazing and is absolutely a must buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2611809">Expand</a></span>

The fighting is an awesome combination of Assassin&apos;s Creed, Batman: Arkham Asylum/City. Lots of customization all over the place. Tons of stuff to explore. The city as a whole looks great even if the game doesn&apos;t have the best graphics to date. I like the Morse code-style combos (short click is a quick hit, long click is a heavy attack). I really like that you have both cop and triad missions to do. It adds a ton of more variety. All the minigames are very cool and pretty innovative. To me, this is easily the game of the summer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2564240">Expand</a></span>

<br>The engine is extremely well done on PC, this is where I stood surprised. They clearly had people on the dev team who were familiar with the PC plaform. After a few days of playing  non stop I never ran into any bugs. Even with HD3D, the experience was seamless. ( although the newbs at gamespot seem to have experienced two crashes under 24hrs of play)
<br>
<br>Overall great times to be had in Sleeping Dogs and I would most definitely recommend it your feeling like some GTA/Kung-fu  fighting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2567757">Expand</a></span>

Not only controls may cause lag and unresponsiveness for many users (as regards the PC version), but also when driving they feel just unrealistic. The city may boast realistic people but, I don&apos;t know, its structure just looks &quot;empty&quot;, as seen in Just Cause for example. Although I must mention the amazing amount of details of some elements such as the market places.
<br>
<br>What I want to point out is there is no need to buy this game when Just Cause 2 costs 4,99$ on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2579401">Expand</a></span>

Not once did I feel like I was playing a video game while playing Sleeping Dogs. Maybe it&apos;s lack of a cohesive gameplay mechanic? The game offers a huge sandbox city to play in - but offers you almost nothing to do inside it. From tired racing mini-games, shallow beat-em-ups, to inane &quot;follow the yellow beacon&quot; side-missions, to a total lack of mayhem you can cause - Sleeping Dogs is but a linear romp through a poorly constructed character-based narrative... where the main character&apos;s development stops after the major twist. It&apos;s the tired and true &quot;cinematic experience&quot; games like Call of Duty are built around - nice visuals, a place to be, a person to follow, a cutscene to watch... but in the end, you&apos;re just wondering why you&apos;re going to burger town, or why you&apos;re doing any of the things the game tells you to do. Most of the game&apos;s major story missions are basically: &quot;Follow the guy.&quot; And those that aren&apos;t, devolve into a &quot;run from the police&quot; sequence. There&apos;s never one moment where you, the player, make any decisions of your own. What&apos;s worse than that? Well, the fact, for a GTA clone, you&apos;re actively discouraged from causing mayhem on missions, as that reduces your &quot;police score&quot;. This can be as arbitrary as scraping a guard rail costing you 25% of your mission experience. But don&apos;t worry, there are plenty of inane things to do to grind experience on. I won&apos;t even get into the story, suffice to say, it&apos;s built up very well in the beginning, introducing several interesting characters - but it never expands upon them, and instead stagnates into a head-scratching ending. There&apos;s nothing so awful with this &quot;experience&quot; (I refuse to dignify it as a game) - you might be thoroughly entertained for several hours at least, but it isn&apos;t worth $60 and it wasn&apos;t fun to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2577197">Expand</a></span>

It still feels like a well-written video game all on it&apos;s own. This game also excited me because a good single-player experience with a decent script is very hard to come by, and it&apos;s why my must-play list isn&apos;t as long as other gamers (Bioshock Infinite and Dishonored are what I&apos;m anticipating most).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2564039">Expand</a></span>

The story is very good and all the missions you do feel meaningfull, even the open world small scale missions feel fleshed out. The graphics are great with the exception of some low poly counts and a bad camera.</span>

I can explore various different areas. martial arts, shooting, chase, treasure hunting are combined all together with impressed story line. graphic is amazing. developers even released HD texture package for free. of course. it looks very good. I can also do benchmark testing myself. the game seems to optimize very well for PC. I get very high frame rate with all max setting. gameplay is good excepting driving. driving seems over sensitive. too faster. thankfully, developers just patched new update this morning. I red Steam forum. many people seem positive on new patch. by the way, there is a big downside. HKship.exe file is in deep trouble. suddenly it is freezing, crash with no reason. I really urge developers must fix this biggest problem otherwise gamers will hate it. overall, it is a nice game even though I hated this kind of game before. nice work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2597032">Expand</a></span>

BUT THIS!! .. is as surprising like Saints Row of THQ .. well optimized , good visuals .. fine story .... nice core elemental gameplay ... in short .... it seems to be worked and polished a great way ..... There are some texture failures and hiccups.. but still worth Port for PC</span>

<br>
<br>Story - as far as I got is great.
<br>
<br>Gameplay - very nice, a little repetitive at parts but still interesting to keep you doing it(aren&apos;t all games repetitive in a way?)
<br>
<br>Graphics - I was mostly blown away after running the benchmark, so many details and so many things happening and game still goes fluid and looking pretty as well.
<br>
<br>Sound - great voice acting, great FX, great sooundtrack.
<br>
<br>I could keep on, but then I lose time from my playtime so...I&apos;ll go and enjoy it and you are welcome too.
<br>
<br>Oh, and I must say that I did see pirated version first - and could easily stay at that - but when I saw the dedication of developers put in this title I immediately ordered it and recommended it to many friends.
<br>
<br>True gaming Gem.
<br>
<br>The way gaming industry should definitely go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2593863">Expand</a></span>

But since we are here to critique, I must say that the controls are a bit clunky and while there is no problems with the key mappings (as some console ports have) the sensitivity with looking around is a bit off and hard to control. Also it seems to have a problem when the frame rates are too high and results in a slight juddering and lag, which is quite weird, but hopefully a patch will fix the issue! But i must say that it is an awesome game to play with a truly captivating storyline, awesome fights that make you feel like a master of kung fu and graphics that will blow you away :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2579109">Expand</a></span>

I took the plunge only after I began hearing positive things on forums. Let me start by saying that this game looks absolutely phenomenal on PC. I am running this at extreme settings, with AA to extreme as well;1920x1200, and once again, it looks phenomenal. The night time/rain cycles look especially nice. Game play is varied, fun, and highly addictive. Combat is just as fun the 100th time as it is the first time. The story is compelling and serious, which is something I wasn&apos;t expecting. Voice acting puts it over the top and is top-notch. All in all, this game is my personal GOTY. It came out of nowhere and pulled me in like no other.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2589020">Expand</a></span>

The story is simply amazing, a lot of mini-games gameplay are fun, especially the when you fight enemies hand to hand combat. In my experience the game is a mix of Max Payne, Batman Arkham City, Saints Row The Third, Gears of War.</span>

The focus on melee combat is fun and fits the games theme. I would not recommend it if you live in any country where the game is censored (eg Germany) because a lot of content is cut out and there are no DLC available in those areas. My first playthrough took me 16 hours and I still have to do a ton of sidequests, only got 33% of the achievements.

Honestly there is far too much &quot;Bling&quot; DLC and too little content DLC.

Wei Shen is often able to melee fight 20 people at once or get into a gun fight with 20-30 people and he&apos;s always fine.  I found that this broke the immersion a bit for me, and if I wanted to break immersion I would play Saints Row or Just Cause because at least you can do cool stunts.
<br>-Most of the side missions are repetitive and boring.
<br>-Controls are annoying (and can&apos;t be changed very much in the options menu), but it doesn&apos;t ruin the experience.
<br>
<br>On the whole I think this game was a decent way to spend 15 hours or so.  I wouldn&apos;t pay full price for it though.  Try to pick it up on sale for less than $10 and you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=3431941">Expand</a></span>

<br>Loses a point for terribly excessive DLC packs. Game companies need to stop cutting so much content from the base game to make DLCs, its not just Square. And also loses a point for lack of depth and content. The game was polished and well detailed, but still lacks the ample amount of world distractions to do that earlier games of this genre used to have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=3519165">Expand</a></span>

Sure, the setting makes for an interesting take on the open world GTA style genre, but besides that, it doesn&apos;t add anything new, nor seem very convincing in its execution. On the plus side, the milieu certainly felt authentically Hong Kong-ish, some of the missions were quite fun and Will Yun Lee playing the main character was great (as opposed to virtually everybody else). The negatives are too numerous to count here, but include some very below-average controls (at least on PC) and some so-so graphics during day time. I found myself thinking that this would have been a great title, had it been released five years earlier. It baffles me that a game as poorly realized as this can get almost as high ratings as, say, Saints Row: The Third, which came out the year prior to this one. Sleeping Dogs is by no means a terrible game, but its lack of conviction becomes evident when, midway through the storyline, you realize that you&apos;ve been mislead and you just want it to end, so it doesn&apos;t feel like you wasted your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=3049607">Expand</a></span>

The freeflow combat, reminiscent of Arkham Asylum, combined with the KH cinema-inspired style of the game help to create a memorable experience. The only issues are probably the lack of end game content, as well as the complete lack of difficulty.</span>

<br>The combat system is similar to the Arkham series, where you can counter attack by simply right-clicking a highlighted enemy. Stuff like that. There&apos;s a  of combos and cool fighting techniques you can take, and it just gives the game so much more variety. This is probably the first game in existence where I want to complete the sidemissions AFTER I already completed the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=3685009">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I especially enjoyed a number of the side missions and the driving aspects of the game. While not a driving simulator, the variety of cars and the chance to get into trouble/incentive for not bashing up the car you just stole added an element of fun to the driving.
<br>
<br>The game really shines, though, in its sense of immersion. The city feels as real as any city I&apos;ve experienced in gaming. This realism adds greatly to the missions, the driving, and the overall plot/story of the game.
<br>
<br>While some games are a &quot;solid 8&quot;, this game is more like a 10 in some ways and a 6 in others, averaging to an 8. If you like games with a variety of missions and an open world feel and lots to accomplish, this is great. If you require an excellent combat system, then this is probably a &quot;pass&quot; for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4004221">Expand</a></span>

The animations lack weight and fail to satisfy completely; The run animation is an embarrassing example of that. The gunfight is arcade and does a  commendable job of achieving that john Woo action feel. The driving while responsive is the weakest of all the mechanics with cars, trucks, and bikes lacking any sense of weight; The chase sections can be fun. There is also a shallow yet welcome RPG element that takes into account the nature of  your actions, being good or bad, which in turns unlock the corresponding part of a skill-tree.The audio and visual presentation is competent and the story does a serviceable job of engaging the players into the Honk Kong underworld. Overall, the game&apos;s formula and blend of mechanics have potential but the overall recipe ends up betrayed by the quality of its execution. This remains a descent experience and if you feel inspired, go right ahead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=6276221">Expand</a></span>

They also should have explored the storyline better, with more exciting missions and more things to do in the world map. But it&apos;s a great game, you will certain enjoy it from the beginning into his end.
<br>
<br>The combat mode reminds Shenmue a lot. I really recommend play it with a joystick.</span>

Where to even begin...I was impressed right from the start with the graphics quality (get the high res textures!) and fluidity of the controls. I am playing with my PS3 controller (thanks again, Motioninjoy!!!!) and loving every bone breaking minute. The voice acting is superb, with some very well known actors/actresses giving the characters gravitas and the mixture of English and Cantonese lends the dialogue an air of authenticity. The city of faux-Hong Kong feels alive; vibrantly beautiful yet brutally dangerous as are the classic depiction of dragons in Oriental culture. The first thought most will have is how much similarity Sleeping Dogs bears to GTAIV, but Rockstar is definitely outclassed by this Canadian studio&apos;s near masterpiece. The graphics, vehicle handling and generally tight controls are way over Rockstar&apos;s effort. This is a game optimized for the PC, such that even with my 4 year old system I am able to get a consistent 35-40 FPS with all settings near maxed as well as using the high res textures.  The melee fighting (and there is a LOT) is very similar to the Batman series, with button combos and unlockable moves. The kung fu kicks and punches feel powerful and fluid, and every fight is dynamic and interesting using the very environment as your weapon. It isn&apos;t a cakewalk though, so be prepared to get your butt kicked in the beginning until you can gain some new moves. The camera is generally pretty decent, although I think it could use a bit more fine tuning in tight spaces but it&apos;s still fairly easy to keep track of all the action. I wish there was an option for changing the viewpoint in vehicles, but that is just a nit-pick. Maybe a patch or two could turn this from a near masterpiece to a bona fide classic. Otherwise, vehicles handle as well as any game of this genre, and they look spectacular. One of my big gripes with GTAIV was how the game engine didn&apos;t allow FSAA- now you got it, along with all the bells and whistles of DX11. Sleeping Dogs exudes AAA quality right from the opening credits, and draws you into its world surely and steadily as you navigate the streets of faux-Hong Kong as both an undercover cop and a rising Triad member. The mini games are generally interesting, and I was pleased to find some Steely Dan among the karaoke tunes you can sing. WIN WIN WIN! I absolutely LOVE this game. I hope it does exceptionally well for United Front Games, because we need more like this. You NEED this game. &apos;Nuff said. Go be the Dragon!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2567056">Expand</a></span>

<br>The music in this game feature fantastic and very popular music from Queen, Duran Duran, Debussy, etc. I enjoyed every particular radio station, especially the the Asiatic radio station and the classical music radio.
<br>
<br>As for the storyline, i think its pretty neat and well explained. I really hope they continue the story with DLC or make a sequel.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed completing every mission, side quests, jobs, hacking and collecting in in this game, this almost feels like a spiritual successor of True Crime: New York City.
<br>You gotta congratulate these guys, the job making this game for PC was so perfect that its perfectly optimized and it comes with extra features that makes the PC version, the best looking version of this game.
<br>
<br>All in all this is a must have and its one of my candidates for GOTY 2012</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2591191">Expand</a></span>

First off, I think the praise about how optimized Sleeping Dogs is for the PC is overstated: the menu system does not work with a mouse, the camera controls are unresponsive, and alt-tabbing forces the game to window mode.
<br>
<br>Despite the issues, I find the story to be the best I&apos;ve ever seen in an open ended game. The same can be said with how much more I care about the characters. Because of how much I liked the protagonist and a few supporting characters, the story had a bigger impact on me than GTA IV, which never affected me on an emotional level.
<br>
<br>The real star of the game is the fighting system. I find myself using many of the unlockable techniques, and that&apos;s a testament to how well developed the system is. It&apos;s true that the game has many rough edges, and I cannot profess to see the charms of glaring errors such as running full speed into a wall on a motorcycle and somehow staying on the bike. However, the overall experience outweighs the significant negatives to the game. From the well-made (but not authentic) map of Hong Kong, superb voice acting, and the aforementioned story and melee combat, Sleeping Dogs is a game worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2580604">Expand</a></span>

The city is small but it&apos;s looks beautiful, with great details and a lot of things to do. The combat skills and the combat style are good, is you played any game of Batman, you will be in the paradise in this one. Maybe the history isn&apos;t the better but the gameplay rescue from a 7 to 9 in the score.</span>

Hong Kong is recreated in a believable way and provides great atmosphere. provides Visuals are fantastic, the story and characters are deep and entertaining, the missions are various and fun. From the technical point of view, the game is not perfect - there some control and UI issues, mostly due to the console nature of the design, but still - it does not ruin the PC experience and the performance is well optimized. Most issues have already been fixed in patches.

With the free HD texture pack it looks amazing and the city really comes alive in a way which is quite scarey at times.   Many elements of this game have been done before with Saints row, GTA and others as clear influence yet Sleepings Dogs beats these at their own game.   The characters are really well done with great voice acting and just walking around the city you really get a sense of a living city in a way that personally I havent seen in another game.  So Sleeping Dogs does the same, only better than many similar games.  The one thing that really stands out if the combat, lots of options and fighting reminds me of an old style beat up game in terms of just being great fun.  Personally, for me it is the sand box approach and multi path character development options that really add up to a great experience backed up by the free HD texture pack.  It actually feels like a new game because of these.  I heard early patch revisions had a pretty crap options menu, that is certainly not the case in 1.5.  Looks and feels good all round.  Personally, I thought many of the other games out there felt very limited graphically but this looks a generation ahead and the gameplay feels like a step forward too.  I very much recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2702752">Expand</a></span>

I am still a little bitter that Activision completely destroyed the Diablo series.  Sleeping dogs essentially takes a lot of fun games and mixes them up.  The driving is very similar to Need For Speed where you drive around to a certain check point and accept challenges.  If you ever played one of the most underrated brawler of all time &quot;The Warriors&quot;, you&apos;ll get the experience it here.  The shooting is similar to max payne where you take cover and have cool slow motion animations.  The negative reviews here sounds like it&apos;s written by people who should go work for Activision because not one of them are able to come up with a solution that would make it more fun.  Criticisms like it&apos;s lacking &quot;wow factor&quot; is a joke because nobody really knows that means.  Rather than saying what would make the game fun, it simply needs this mysterious factor.  The first time you wrap a rope around a thug&apos;s neck and hang him to death, you will be pleased.  Right in the tutorial, you will smile as you slam a door down a guy&apos;s face.  Another issue people wrote is that it&apos;s buggy, it&apos;s actually a lot less buggy than the older true crime series when they were released under Activision.  Right now I am playing on patch 1.4 and I haven&apos;t notice any game breaking bugs.  The hotkeys for the PC isn&apos;t that bad, there was one annoying button such as H for honking but I just remapped it to F.  If you can&apos;t handle wasd and a mouse than maybe you shouldn&apos;t play PC games.  Most of the controls were very similar to many popular games and you have to be able to do basic things like holding shift or hitting F.  Worst case senario, buy a controller.  The story is definitely intriguing, it&apos;s like the movie &quot;The Departed&quot; except you can only see from one point of view.  Overall, a top quality game like this is dying out because companies like Activision are runned by people who only cares about money and don&apos;t even know what a fun game is(The current CEO described games as selling Tide laundry detergeant, just rebrand the exact same thing and call it call of duty 5).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2577538">Expand</a></span>

<br>While I find the game really interesting and fun, the technical bugs, glitches, controls and mess just keep me from fully enjoying it.
<br>The graphics in the game are nice with the HD texture pack, which shows the devs also focus on the PC platform.
<br>The camera, the aiming and the terrible lipsync is mostly what kept me away from the game.
<br>The camera doesn&apos;t listen to you. Sometimes it rotates too fast, sometimes it rotates too slow - I have no idea how I have such a problem.
<br>The aiming (with weapons) in this game is also extremely buggy - sometimes the reticle will get stuck and you won&apos;t be able to shoot whatsoever, sometimes you get locked away from the controls because of sticky keys (it seems to be an in-game problem, I have sticky keys completely disabled).
<br>The lipsyncing is decent on cutscenes, but when it comes to lipsyncing during in-game action sequences, it&apos;s terrible. If you sing karaoke, your lips will move incoherently, if you talk to someone while walking next to each other your mouth will just move like you&apos;re playing pretend-talk.
<br>The fighting system in this game is really fun, but the control glitches make it less fun, for some even unplayable.
<br>The UI is god-awfully large and will annoy the living heck out of you.
<br>I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s my hardware (it&apos;s not, this is the only game with such problems), or the devs, but the game is already in version 1.4 and all of these problems haven&apos;t been attended to.
<br>Maybe, someday, the game will be finally fixed and I&apos;ll be able to play.
<br>It&apos;s a great game at heart, while it did have a predictable story, it&apos;s fun. And that&apos;s what matters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sleeping-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=2579157">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I have lots of issues with crashes on load, and crashes midgame. LA Noire meets Grand Theft Auto. Music is dull gangsta rap only.  Gameplay gets a bit repetitive just like LA Noire. You can tell it was made for console by the way the controls &quot;work&quot;. Camera angles and control of camera are also quite irritating.
<br>If they could make it more stable this would be a nice sandbox game.</span>
