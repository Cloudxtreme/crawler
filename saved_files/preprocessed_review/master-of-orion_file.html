For hardcore fans of 4X and strategies I would advice not playing this game, but for players that always thought that 4X and other strategies are way to hard for them, this game could be just for them. It&apos;s pretty easy to learn and has very transparent mechanics.</span>

A good deal only for casual players, or to rekindle old MoO-memories without much available play time. The game looks good and starts very accessible.
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a deep 4X experience, look elsewhere.
<br>
<br>Explore (yawn) - scouts without range limits plod through a circular galaxy to map the stars. Rarely a reward beyond some credits or a vessel. Meeting races early to reap in trading boost.
<br>Two other setup options separate sections of the galaxy until midgame. Prevents early diplomacy and stresses expansion and research.
<br>
<br>Expand - planets operate separately. Their properties matter most in the beginning. Some good, close fertile planets boost growth excessively, while hostile environments cripple colonies.
<br>Much later in midgame, solar systems may pool their production and planets specialise more.
<br>
<br>Exploit - planet food and production slots are limited, with small spread and decreasing yield. Works only well at start, in the long run technology levels out differences. Planet size matters most.
<br>This is far from the old system where the galaxy might look completely different according to your race.
<br>
<br>Exterminate - Stationary defences add initiall resillience, invasion tech is delayed. Using star lanes feels more like combat along mountain passes than in space.
<br>There&apos;s tactical decisions and challenges. Still battles failed to excite me. Went to just calculate combat in the end. Invasion looks unfinished. Conquered planets don&apos;t revolt.
<br>In mid-game, portals may connect a side&apos;s systems, specialised shipyards churn out fleet. Travel in enemy territory stays slow; mopping up a war becomes a drag.
<br>
<br>Science - Instead of independent fields of research, we get a Civi tech tree with crowded nodes. The frowned upon old choice system is consciously reduced to a few select applications.
<br>This means that more than 85% of technology can never be traded, stolen or conquered but must be researched instead.
<br>
<br>Money - main source is population tax, with trade second. This is probably the biggest design change, as the forerunner used industry for taxation. Money and production were interchangeable then. No more.
<br>All ship upgrades can no longer be produced but must be bought, and there&apos;s no alternative to a large population base to fund your buildings or excess fleet.
<br>
<br>My brand&apos;s canary chokes on several features, mechanisms and concepts that often match the forerunner just in name.
<br>
<br>UI problems pop up in midgame and with huge positions. The game increasingly reacts sluggish and information is missing. MoO2&apos;s UI could handle 100-planet empires, MoO can&apos;t.
<br>Zooming into a planet looses the strategic view. Event list can&apos;t be scrolled, when overflowing you must klick through the least important items first. Some events pop up first, ignoring your selection.
<br>Planet list can&apos;t be sorted by production type, to e.g. check fleet in construction. Planet uniformity makes sorting by resource (food, science, production) way less usefull. And the list goes on...
<br>
<br>Diplomacy is listless. Incoming offers can&apos;t be put on hold and checked, no counter offers possible. Swap charts without knowing what you trade for is the most frequent offer.
<br>Get an embassy. Trade and research deals have to be continually refreshed, with the AI later often too broke to accept. Cultivating AIs is possible to get access or alliances. Otherwise the AI is simplistic with no real grasp of reality, demanding when ready to strike, or crawling when currently involved in another war.
<br>
<br>Espionage mostly consists of offensive spy micromanagent. Some Intelligence; stealing of the &apos;choice&apos; techs is best done at lowly, undefended outposts, the rest is sabotage.
<br>Sabotage works like a separate game, after succes the victim can&apos;t react, e.g. can&apos;t attack a revolting planet but must wait it out.
<br>Defense is static by race traits or expensive buildings, or dispatched spies, without a good view to coordinate.
<br>
<br>Races - Most predefined ones work, but use way more perk points though than a player gets for a custom race. Race differences are noticeable, but very timid.
<br>
<br>Ship customisation has some wellcome improvements (like scout autoupgrades or the UI layout). On the other side a convoluted system obscures this.
<br>Payload is consumed at rates differing by class by essentials. A 25% payload extension consumes part of this for itself. And so on. You can&apos;t just compare the numbers displayed.
<br>This also hurls another wave of micromanagement at the player, e.g. each new drive is slightly bigger, often forcing a ship redesign.
<br>
<br>The final result is a wasted opportunity - a good looking time waster, not without appeal - but too shallow and boring for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6705080">Expand</a></span>

While there are definitely features I would like to see improved (for example, espionage), and brought back (like the minor races), and added (like heroes), I can definitely say that this game is a true follower in the footsteps of the original MOO. It seems strange to me that so many reviewers complain both that this game is too little like MOO2 (when it only aspires to be MOO1 anyway) and that it didn&apos;t make enough changes to the original gameplay. Wut? How can you have it both ways? This MOO is a fun, fast, playable game that I thikn would be very appealing to many players. Maybe not the most hardcore and critical players, but definitely the mass of average players. If only they would read past the horrible numbers on here and see the game for what it gives you - that feeling of having to play just one more turn! And it&apos;s beautiful with great music!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6676955">Expand</a></span>

<br>2) The game-play is less complex, more tedious and boring, especially the espionage system will make you throw a little in your mouth.
<br>3) Space combat and graphics are worse, yes i found combat graphics in 1996 game better and more flashed out, even more atmospheric. The real time combat offers zero chance for players to outperform opponent with less techs and ships as MOO2 allowed, because you can&apos;t really  as player do any meaningful actions, it basically looks like a placeholder in some alpha-version. But on other side auto-simulate option is there and it&apos;s good.
<br>
<br>They changed a lot of core mechanics, like sharing food through your empire with freighters and so on, made game blend, dumbed down and uninspiring. Maybe now after so many years wargaming management will understand that it&apos;s financial success with world of tanks was lucky, and that good game developers are essential for games to succeeded.

Also the new spying system is cumbersome and specific to planets which turns it into a big micromanagement chore later in the game.
<br>
<br>Also the Tactical RTS is not really tactical. You can tell your ships where to move but you do not have complete control on how they attack or use their special abilities. This was NGD Studio&apos;s first time make a 4X game so they tried to copy features found in Civ 5 and other modern 4X games and implement them in their own special way. They have starlanes, which I did not mind, but the navigation between waypoints is cumbersome and clunky.
<br>
<br>As a comparison, if you played the new Doom game, the designers at id software did a good job capturing the original gameplay and then building new, modern features on top it.  But in this MOO reboot they threw out a lot of the old features that worked in the first two MOOs and replaced them with their own interpretation of how the modern 4X gameplay should work, much of it borrowed from Civ 5.  And the results are inconsistent and do not work well together in this case.
<br>
<br>Basically this is a 4X game to play if you do not care about balance or consistency in good gameplay mechanics. I found the game very annoying to play and could not bear more than 12 hours on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6666771">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was surprised that the priced at the game at $29.99 nstead of $39.99. but in retrospect,
<br>this just shows that the producers don&apos;t have faith in the game themselves. I recommend
<br>picking this up at $5-$10. At $30, it&apos;s still not worth it. Put your money towards Galciv3, Endless space

I tried using their horrible controls to work a battle, but it was painfully obvious they are bad.  So, you are left with an ok game for expansion, however the combat is horrible.  The AI also does not attack, it simply lets you turtle out your expansion.  Its sorta an OK version of MOO, but sorta not.  Its roughly on par with MOO I, but lagging significantly behind MOO II.   Spy missions are bad, they give you to many spies and they almost always fail no matter what tech you have, they simply become trully annoying to use.
<br>
<br>I hope the devs take the user critiicisms to heart and fix their game.  It isn&apos;t that much to take the game to an 8 or 9 with what they got now.  It feels like they ran out of money and had to release a barely viable product.  Its a 6 or 7 at best unfortunately.  It could easily had been a 9 or 10 if they&apos;d improve the AI and put in actual combat.  The ship combat is almost as bad as MOOIII, its real close to being that bad, real close.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6690176">Expand</a></span>

I am going to start off with that I do like and why followed by the big issues and what they need to do to correct this.
<br>
<br>1. Sound! Omg, I was smiling from ear to ear when I realized the music for the colony ship landing was the same from the original.
<br>
<br>2. Graphics are great and their attention to detail just amazes me, like having the ship&#x2019;s path curve AROUND the star. The races are detailed and beautifully rendered.
<br>
<br>3. The UI is clean and unobtrusive. This is great because you get the whole galaxy as your backdrop.
<br>
<br>4. I love the colony manager and how they display your information, it is a great take on the MoO 2 mananger with a modern UI.
<br>
<br>I have enjoyed playing, but I can say the same for the countless MoO clones. Sadly like them I see this getting played for a bit until the combat becomes so bland I don&apos;t pick it up ever again, usually two to three games.
<br>
<br>1. Combat - The combat is real time and I have no direct fire control of my ships. Sure I can get into tactical mode where I tell them where to go and who to shoot but that does no good if I cannot control the weapons. I don&#x2019;t want a real time combat, I wanted MoO turn based ship combat. Sure you could get bogged down in MoO 2 space combat if your fleets got really big at the end game but that is why you had AUTO. In MoO 2 you could make some really nuanced ships, and special variants, in this because of the ship combat AI you are forced to make brute force ships.
<br>
<br>2. Research - I love MoO 1&#x2019;s research, you could play multiple games and get different techs each time. I only ever saw Hand Phasers once out of countless games. This made research unique and you were always checking in on the other races to find out what they got that you didn&#x2019;t. Here I find myself making strange and unintelligible choices. Why must I choose between fusion bombs and fusion beams? This doesn&#x2019;t make any sense, all it does is make an optimal research path that min maxers will figure out and share, it does not add variety.
<br>
<br>3. Range - There is no range mechanic. In the first MoO games you were limited by how far your fuel cells would let you go. A scout now however can go all over the galaxy and find everything and everyone. So instead of a gradual expansion moving forward and meeting aliens, you are thrust straight away into contact and have to start shoring up your solar systems at the Starlane warp points so you can at least hold on to some of your colonizable planets.
<br>
<br>4. It has been brought to my attention the 500 turn limit can be turned off. It is the Excellence victory condition in the Advanced Options menu. These options need to be labeled better. I am testing a game with the turn limit turned off. (update) I got far too bored and just stopped playing.
<br>
<br>5. Star lanes - These don&apos;t belong in a MoO game at all! Part of the tactics were worrying if commiting your fleet was going to leave you open at home. You could pick where and when to attack, now you just walk right into bottleneck after bottleneck after bottleneck. These need to go NOW. I had an anomoly pop up near my homeworld in my first game and I thought, ok without a star lane it must take a while to get to it right? Nope, one turn, one turn for a distance the same distance as the star lane going to the next star system. That star lane took FOUR turns. This makes no sense. These need to go.
<br>
<br>If you haven&apos;t purchased it already I suggest waiting. I would rather play MoO 1 or 2 before touching this one again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6662372">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well despite my biased opinion, I did like the voice acting, cut scenes, graphics and general ambiance,the setting and sound tracks were immersive.
<br>
<br>My first huge gripe is the tech tree, its a disorienting mess of upgrades, structures,ship hulls and weapons jammed into some drug induced order that kicks logic in the balls; its not the first game that I have tried that did this badly so I rolled with it.Then after two hundred or so turns and not really having  done anything but watch the tech bar grow and my planet get more people, I saw that I was actually playing(to steal a term that keeps popping up in browser games) a slower and much prettier cow clicker.
<br>
<br>This highlights a general design flaw in these sorts of games, the whole game play takes place between your last turn  and some distant turn far down the line, then do it again. In a game like Stardrive the developer employed time system were by a turn would be 5 seconds, so the game would progress rts style albeit the tech tree in that game was simpler and made more sense.
<br>
<br>This game is a bore fest, its not very interactive, build something, research a tech, send a ship to explore then wait 20 turns to do it again. There are numerous over sites in the ui and presentation of menus as well as aspects that should have been included such as a tabbed list of structure on the selected planet,
<br>control scheme needs some work and the tech tree/buildings available are chaotic and full of bloat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6687573">Expand</a></span>

<br>(Civ 5 I liked even before the expansions!) I bought this game to pass the time away
<br>before Civ6 comes out.
<br>
<br>I like how the mechanics between this game and Civ5 are very similar so it&apos;s
<br>very easy for me to pick up UI-wise. Graphics is pretty like Civ5, but the alien
<br>character art is even cheezier than Civ&apos;s and some of the advisors are VERY annoying!
<br>Luckily, you can turn them off, so I would still give the overall presentation of the
<br>game a 8/10.
<br>
<br>But good graphics by itself does not make a good game, especially a good strategy
<br>game. After 6 hours of gameplay, I feel more frustrated than satisfied.
<br>
<br>Empire management:
<br>My new colonies keep starving and its very tedious to keep them fed. There&apos;s a lot of unnecessary micromanagement and trying to have even a moderately sized empire is very painful mid-late game with
<br>lots of pointless clicking around.
<br>
<br>Combat:
<br>I cannot get my ships to attack a specific ship. Instead, they just sort of glob-attack randomly the enemy which turns the entire fighting experience into a mindless click-attack. So I mostly just
<br>auto-resolve combat. I think the developer should have just used an abstract combat like Civ
<br>rather than this pseudo-rts which is time-consuming to play, but not every satisfying.
<br>
<br>Diplomacy:
<br>The game COMPLETELY FAILS for me here. Perhaps, I haven&apos;t play enough to master
<br>the optimal build paths for new colonies, and maybe other people who like RTS&apos;s will like
<br>the combat, but this game has the absolute worst, and most mind boggling AI interactions
<br>ever. For example; my fleet often gets randomly attacked by AI who I have friendly or neutral
<br>relationships with. This is almost excusable as just bad AI, but this is the first game I ever
<br>played where getting attacked is not an act of war! This is just not bad programming, but
<br>REALLY POOR GAME DESIGN and really incomphrensible. This completely breaks the immersion
<br>factor for me.
<br>
<br>Hopefully, in the future the devs will release more add-ons which makes the game enjoyable,
<br>like how Civ 5 has really grown with expansions, but as of right now, I cannot recommend
<br>this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6665665">Expand</a></span>

I consider it better than civ 6.  And what I really like is that the developer seems to care about their community and releases unpaid for patches (although not DLC on new races).  All told, if you want a decent space strategy game, then look no further.  My only observations are:
<br>
<br>1 - Space combat is a bit lacklustre.  I like the cinematic thing but when I take control, or half take control, I&apos;m not really sure what I&apos;m adding.  And my actions don&apos;t seem to be properly represented either.
<br>
<br>2 - The balance is a bit off IMO.  Techs should take longer to research, although this is adjustable.  However I like the fact that they kept he race imbalance thing.
<br>
<br>3 - I LOVE the voice acting.  Seriously, great job!  Not often you say that about a turn based game, but it is practically perfect.
<br>
<br>4 - the diplomacy is actually decent, so hats off for that.
<br>
<br>5 - Ground combat could be a bit more exciting.
<br>
<br>But over all, I think this is a good game, and worth a purchase.  Don&apos;t be put off by the purists and the fools.

Thankfully the game stays very close to the original in most things, however the real-time combat is more cinematic than tactical.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>- the game plays well overall, very close to MoO 2.
<br>- great graphics (the background is gorgeous), great music.
<br>- the GUI is excellent, a lot fewer clicks are needed to do things than used to in MoO 2, and info is presented in much clearer ways. Much of the GUI is based on the one from Civ 5 which is a standard for 4X games today
<br>- the game is easy to start, the tutorial is very helpful
<br>- a good idea to have warp points and military outposts defending them, and to restrict movement between star systems to warp lines - this introduces more tactics into the game, as it&apos;s much easier to create choke points
<br>- trading techs is encouraged: when researching a tech, you often can pick just 1 of its bonuses, and have to trade with other factions for the rest of the bonuses
<br>
<br>The so-so:
<br>- animations seem to get on your nerves after a while and the &quot;Skip&quot; button appears too late. Diplomacy and council animations are the most annoying ones. GNN news should have had an option to show the news as a text line but skip the video.
<br>- (this is also applicable to the original) Space-themed sci fi is kids- or at best teenager-oriented. Just suspend your disbelief and don&apos;t take it all seriously
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- combat is real-time, lacks control, and there is very little tactics involved. You can control movement of the ships and pick targets, but the ships fire on their own. The game doesn&apos;t really let you win in smart ways if your army is smaller
<br>- empty space doesn&apos;t offer as much tactical variety as 2D terrain in other 4x games (e.g. Civ). Though you can still get some variety of combat by experimenting with different ship designs
<br>- there is no gamepedia. Often I had questions about a specific rule, or how much something costs, or how something works - and there was no answer anywhere. E.g. how many HP do military outposts have? Where can I see their current HP? Do they repair over time, can they be repaired? How much food needs to be accumulated for the next citizen to grow?
<br>- minor GUI things, e.g. can&apos;t see the tech tree while picking a bonus from a just researched tech; they should have tested the game more for usability
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a decent, playable remake, but with too many animations and some questionable real-time combat. 8/10 for now, but it could be a 9/10 if they just fixed the minor things (e.g. the military outposts) and added a gamepedia.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6924080">Expand</a></span>

Space lanes are terrible. Each race is basically given a little cluster of planets that no other player can get to until half way through the game. Once exploration ability gets that far, every player has developed their little section. It&apos;s only possible to expand your empire by then attacking the player directly next to you. It&apos;s alike a game of galactic dominoes but with less strategy. Orion is located in one of the initial clusters so really the only empire that can grab it is the one who has it in their little cluster. Technology is pretty thin and not exciting at all. Development of planets is slow and boring. There don&apos;t appear to be leaders or those awesome little extras that appeared in MOO2. Another remake of an older game which looks and sounds pretty good but ends up being extremely poor. I will be getting my money back on this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6708652">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played just one campaign (500+ turns) which took me 17 hours. The game really sucked me in and I&apos;ve not slept for one night. In the morning it was regular 4X hangover due to overdose. I&apos;ve come back after breakfast though. Yeah, it&apos;s addictive.
<br>
<br>The AI is much better than in MoO 3 in which AI&apos;s actions didn&apos;t make sense 95% of time. During my 500 turns playthrough I&apos;ve encountered only one nonsensical AI action. The AI was my ally with high standing and was oppressed by other empire. I&apos;ve come to aid them and I&apos;ve destroyed several systems of their enemies. After that I&apos;ve established colony on oppressor&apos;s capital planet (my kind of thing). My ally was angry at me because I&apos;ve built my colony close to his empire. This is just plain stupid:
<br>1. They did the same thing building colonies right beside me and it was fine.
<br>2. I&apos;ve come to help them and they should be thankful for me getting rid of their troubles.
<br>3. It was never their system.
<br>What the hell?
<br>
<br>Diplomacy is just as horrible as in MoO 3. Most of interactions are locked behind research. When you are approached by other empire with a request/offer you cannot send counter-proposition (really, wtf?). You cannot break 20 turns cease-fire or declare war in that time which makes absolutely no sense. There&apos;s much room for improvement when it comes to diplomacy.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m also a little sceptical about Antarans. I don&apos;t like them. They regularly attack the strongest empire which usually is me. It makes me keep my forces close to my systems instead of going to wars and exploring galaxy. You often think about helping allies or conquering systems but then you realize it&apos;s been 50 turns since last Antaran&apos;s strike, they will be back soon. They are completely unnecessary. Defeating them is the only win condition without achievement on Steam. Oh, and by the way - once you go to destroy Antarans in their pocket universe, you cannot compare your strength to theirs until it&apos;s to late and you cannot cancel this action. Copy your saves before doing that.
<br>
<br>Research tree is really cool and much better than in MoO 3. Most of the stuff you research is really useful and often fun and interesting.
<br>
<br>Ship templates work fine as long as you maintain them yourself. Auto configuration often fails on stuff like parts that increase ship space and allow for installation of more weapons and/or additional systems. Why? It simply never uses them - you have to add them yourself. I&apos;d also appreciate some way to test my designs. Maybe simulation battles? It&apos;s sci-fi, figure it out. The only way to test expansive weaponry is building expansive ships and declaring wars. It&apos;s not how it works in real life.
<br>
<br>Music is much better than in MoO 3 which made me feel sick after a couple of minutes. The game itself is lighter and doesn&apos;t take itself so seriously. Graphics are a little candy-like but that&apos;s good. MoO 3 tried to take itself very seriously and it was growing tiring after time.
<br>
<br>Turns take short time to compute in the beginning but after 300-350 turns when there&apos;s a lot happening (8 empires, largest galaxy) turns take longer to compute. I&apos;d say they take about 5-10 seconds on i5-2400. I wonder if i7 (8 threads, 4 cores) would help - I&apos;m not sure how well turn computing is paralleled.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also worth mentioning that Mac client simply sucks. I&apos;ve played game on both Windows PC and Mac and there&apos;s no way to make this game work full-screen on Mac. It just displays black screen which I&apos;ve googled and turns out it is regular business with WG games.
<br>
<br>I see I&apos;ve mentioned only the bad stuff. Don&apos;t mind it - I&apos;ve had a blast with the game and will come back to it. Assume that what I haven&apos;t mentioned is really great. I just wish for some dev to read it and fix what can be fixed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6906490">Expand</a></span>

Never happened at normal difficulty settings in the originals. Well, you can win with them now, but you won&apos;t beat the Antarans. Even on &quot;Very Easy&quot; level I wasn&apos;t able to design a fleet, at turn 500+ that could best the Antarans. I had all the advanced tech you could want. For some reason though, you&apos;re limited to one Doom Star size ship in this game.
<br>
<br>Graphics are nice, but my machine isn&apos;t killer-fast. This game is SLOW. VERY slow. You sit around waiting for the AI players to finish. For ever.
<br>
<br>Sadly, they decided to do away with a turn based tactical system. That often made the diff in the originals. Now it&apos;s complete crap.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t pay for this piece of junk.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6914489">Expand</a></span>

The reason that Civilization (sid meier&apos;s civ) has been so successful all these years is that they just improve on the basic system .. not change it. With the Moo series, every single version after moo2 is a completely different game. What I really, really want is just an upgrade of the prior version (similar to what civ does) do not create a different game &amp; don&apos;t change the fundamental basic system. I want to play a turn based game (as moo2) with a semi-simultaneous turn based tactical combat system (as moo2) and with warp movement (go anywhere ... as moo2) ... why do they have to keep changing the things that made the original so darn great?? This is why every version after moo2 has been failing. Stars in shadow is the only space game that I&apos;ve played since moo2 that retains the 3 core elements that made moo2 so great, and in fact, stars in shadow is a very good game (though it needs some more work &amp; DLC before becoming truly great).&#xFEFF;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-of-orion/user-reviews?user_review_id=7700198">Expand</a></span>
