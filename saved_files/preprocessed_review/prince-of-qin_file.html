The game is set ancient china and the player will play as a cast out prince who tries to find out the conspiracies behind an empire. there are lots of side quests and lots of story line. Don&apos;t play unless you like to take your time because this game is lengthy. The game is played more like dungeon siege but overall experience is more like neverwinter nights since it does have strong characterization and quite a lot dialogue. Also you will find that there is no real structure in the game so you kind of wander around a bit. Personally, I like that it seems more realistic and more freedom. Story line pretty cheesy and reminds me of a dungeon siege 1, but cheese can be OK sometimes. Also I personally like its ancient China setting, another game from Bioware called Jade Empire has a similar setting but overall this game has more depth on role playing aspects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-qin/user-reviews?user_review_id=2085558">Expand</a></span>

I would not compare it to modern games as far as depth goes but this is an overlooked and under rated classic! It will be in my collection for some time along with more popular games. It reminds me a bit of the Dungeon Siege series but predates them.</span>
