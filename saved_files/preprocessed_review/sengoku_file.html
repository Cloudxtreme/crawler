Some gave me more fun then other and for example i love EU3 and after all expansions that i have it&apos;s just masterpiece for me - the same with hoi2. But with Hoi 3 they went to far for me making it just too big and complex. Here - in Sengoku - at least till patches and expansions (if there will be any) they went in totally opposite direction dumbing in down too much. Actually i think it&apos;s first game from series where i totally don&apos;t care about diplomacy and intelligence coz there is just no point. i use only 2 diplomacy options - declare war and royal marriage to get new breeding cow to get as much hairs asap. all other options or the whole plotting system is just waste of time. and when you even manage to persuade some neutral lord to join you, you will only get into your influence 1 untrustworthy bastard that will most likely start to plot against you anyway. It&apos;s much better (and doesn&apos;t even cost much more) to just conquer him. And this is my biggest problem with Sengoku - it&apos;s to easy to declare war - it cost you only some portion of honor points- 20 for example - and in the same time for every conquered province given to your vassals you&apos;ll get 3 points back. So basically attacking clan that has at least 6 provinces (80% of them) will cost you nothing - no tatered reputation and giving casus belli against you for every other country, no war exhaustion that would destroy you from inside with permanent war and so on. you just have to conquer those weaker than you to collect enough honor to attack another one. You dont even have to care for your own provinces as you can have only 5 of them, and every other have to be given to vassals. So you just permanently taking for yourself those conquered with best infrastructure coz computer will build them up much faster than you can anyway. So for me Sengoku is 90% focused at conquering and 10% for diplomacy, plotting and governing provinces. It&apos;s still fun but EU series was for me always about diplomacy. here you can manage with diplomacy skill of neanderthal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sengoku/user-reviews?user_review_id=1759609">Expand</a></span>

Paradox may be telling it&apos;s fanboys to upvote this game, but it has many inherent flaws most notably in it&apos;s interface. This isn&apos;t a case of the wrong person reviewing the game, and a lot of the negativity isn&apos;t because the game isn&apos;t &quot;dumbed down enough&quot;. This is a case of bad choices being made in designing the game. ================================================================================ The Positive: The game shines in it&apos;s intrigue and diplomacy, though the diplomacy itself is somewhat lacking in personality, it presents a variety of options and allows for lots of interesting scenarios. The limited number of provinces that can be effectively governed also paves the way for a vassal system that gets increasingly complex and intriguing as you progress through the game. ================================================================================ The Negative: The interface is unintuitive, and there are a lot of simple things they could have done to make the interface more user friendly. Because of how the interface is set up, the game is practically inaccessible to anyone who hasn&apos;t already invested massive amounts of time in it. Improving the interface wouldn&apos;t be &quot;dumbing it down&quot; it would be improving the interface, which has needed doing for several GSG&apos;s now. Other problems include the cities and armies being poorly represented on the map (technically an interface issue, but I distinguish it from the general UI). Between resigning and reloading there also appears to be a bug that causes the resignation and load times to get longer and longer. In terms of military might, more troops = victory 99% of the time, making the military aspects of strategy a mere numbers and deployment game. ================================================================================ Closing Comment: Behind the many flaws there&apos;s a great game, but the flaws should not be ignored by an objective reviewer. The fact is that most will not even be able to access the game, not because they&apos;re unintelligent as many Paradox Fanboys arrogantly like to delude themselves into believing, but because the unintuitive interface and lack of tool tips creates a prohibitive learning curve and most just don&apos;t have the patience or the time. Paradox doesn&apos;t need to dumb down it&apos;s games but it does need to learn to improve how it displays information, a side bar displaying information under various tabs would help a lot, as would mouse over tool tips to explain options better would be an improvement, and a better display of troops and cities on the map with more defined borders, and easier to distinguish clans on the normal map view. Paradox can&apos;t expect to get positive reviews when it makes games that are virtually unplayable without prior experience, and no amount of shameful vote rigging will negate the flaws with this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sengoku/user-reviews?user_review_id=1756094">Expand</a></span>

This time out, the Interface is slightly improved but poorly optimised for resolutions above the norm. The game in itself, requires the player to have a working knowledge of previous paradox games, namely Crusader Kings and EUII: Rome. Like most Strategy Titles from Paradox, this latest offering offers little, it&apos;s Crusader Kings set in Japan. After playing their titles for over a decade, one starts to wonder if this little company that could, offer something new other than re-skinned offerings. Sengoku is perhaps the least buggy release ever released by Paradox. No game breaking bugs, no mysterious crashes to desktop and no nagging lag after playing it for a couple of hours. Hallmarks of every Paradox title till this one. The game in itself is fun, if you enjoy managing data and nurturing numbers. Sadly Paradox still doesn&apos;t get &apos;it&apos; that the reason why many table top gamers have migrated to the digital age is to not have to &apos;roll&apos; the dice, crunch the numbers and look up statistical tables. If you enjoy paint dry by nippon 3-in-1, this game is for you,. While the gameplay is quite deep and the learning curve steep from a lack of proper documentation, the game is overall &apos;quite fun&apos; for &apos;strategy&apos; gamers who enjoy running Excel together with their gameplay.<br><br>For fans of the strategy genre, there&apos;s better fare out there.<br><br>For Paradox Fanbois, there&apos;s nothing new here, so stop coming here and try to artificially push the ratings up. It&apos;s not that great a game.<br><br>The only ground breaking thing that Paradox did was to release a game that did not crash on day one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sengoku/user-reviews?user_review_id=1757149">Expand</a></span>

If you like Sengoku, please show your support by registering your rating here&quot;. Shame on you! I have no more words to spend on this mediocrity of a game. This is one for the garbage bin, period.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sengoku/user-reviews?user_review_id=1755929">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Hey Look! Shogun 2: Total War! I think I will just go play that instead....  I tried the demo and it wasn&apos;t to my taste. I was hoping for something with a bit more action, and all I got was lots of adjusting spreadsheets. But some people will like this style of &quot;intense strategy&quot;, so try the demo you&apos;ve got nothing to lose.</span>

If you manage to &quot;survive&quot; the first couple of hours figuring things out, you&apos;re in for a treat with great strategic depth. It&apos;s one of those Paradox gems which will get even better with time thanks to its player community and lots of patches.</span>

The atmosphere and music really set the right tone for this game, you may even begin to feel like a samurai after a while. Although there are still a few bugs, and this game may not be for everyone, but if you ever wanted to be a lord feudal Japan this is about as close as you can get.</span>

It&apos;s not in the same mold as most Paradox games as it forces you to be very aggressive and conquest minded (understandable as you need to unite Japan) but it was fairly polished and bug free upon release. Beautiful graphics and a very well done atmosphere. I&apos;d like to see an expansion with the Imjin wars versus Korea/Ming in the future.</span>

Right off of Steam I knew what to do, without checking the manual. What amazed me is the absolute attention to detail and care put into the scenario: This feels like Warring States Japan. The first thing you need to get a hold of is the pacing. Let time move slowly. Pay attention to your vassals and your family. That is the true heart of the game, on top of the strategic warfare.<br><br>Anyone who is a fan of serious historical political simulations or Far East medieval history will thrill for this game. Not for children, not for console kiddies, this is a real game.

It has a similar look and feel to Europa Universalis, Victoria, Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings but the mechanisms are a bit simpler. Of course the focus of each game is quite different.  Where Victoria is about industrialization and Hearts of Iron is about the tech race, resources and grand battles, Sengoku focuses on family clans and honor.  The goal of the game is to unite Japan during the Warring States period, not an easy challenge.  This game offers 3 playable tiers of hierarchy in the dynasty system, the ability to plot within and outside of your dynasty, to break away and form your own clan or take over your clan from within.  The tech tree is very simple offering two linear trees: castles for military and villages for economy.  You control 3 operatives, your Masters of Arms, Ceremony, and Guard, which have different functions from constructing upgrades to hiring ninjas to sowing dissent.  Finally, a sophisticated marriage system ensures maintaining the family line, genetic traits, relationships between clans, and a full court from which to choose your operatives and daimyos.  Overall, if you haven&apos;t tried a Paradox title of this nature, this may be the one to jump in on.  You will still likely have a steep learning curve but the manual is very well written and the hint system is fantastic and far exceeds any Paradox game to date.  With its limited objectives, constrained set up operations, and smaller map, Sengoku offers a highly accessible title.  Veteran Paradox gamers will also enjoy Sengoku&apos;s simplicity and shorter time frame allowing focus on fewer moving parts while you race against Japan&apos;s other rising clans to claim the title of Shogun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sengoku/user-reviews?user_review_id=1755272">Expand</a></span>

In fact, the only ones worth mentioning on the PC are Sengoku, and of course Total War: Shogun. The problem with Total War though is that the cinematic real-time battles get boring after a short while and you find yourself playing on the over top map most of the time. And this is where Sengoku outshines Shogun, in the strategic department. The game puts really deep emphasis on characters, and their relations to one another, on plotting and preserving your honor. It even adds a, dare I say, roleplaying aspect to the game. Of course, warring is a necessary part of your rise to power, as well, since you need to conquer half of the provinces in order to beat the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sengoku/user-reviews?user_review_id=1756014">Expand</a></span>

The new angle of honour and Seppuku hanging over the characters head w/ every decision made makes this a slightly different challenge than previous grand strategy titles.<br><br>Havent played enough of the game to see if any issues exist, encountered none so far.

The subtle plot game to take leadership of the clan is some ways more fun than take the shogun title.</span>

Then it is simply not for you - you don&apos;t like it and you don&apos;t even have to state  reason to validate that opinion.

Most of this is inferred through the gameplay however - some imagination is required, since the user interface is all business. The overall design is like a very advanced German board game. I recommend checking out the demo first - there are also some developer videos that explain some of the mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sengoku/user-reviews?user_review_id=1772616">Expand</a></span>

Not a easy game, mostly because the Japan ambientation (almost &quot;alien&quot; for us westerners, what may have pushed aside a lot of players), but, with some time to learn the game mechanics, it can be great and give hours of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sengoku/user-reviews?user_review_id=2157513">Expand</a></span>

I&#x2019;m not a fan of games that baby sit you through every little thing, but some kind of tutorial would have been nice to guide through the first months rather than just tool tips which you only discover when you find a new area to the game you never knew existed. Regardless of the mountains of information and lack of direction after getting into this game I found myself enjoying it. The strategy and setting in the game is enjoyable, design and graphics attractive although simple and winning wars against rival clans satisfying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sengoku/user-reviews?user_review_id=3463922">Expand</a></span>

But I cannot say this game is perfect even compared to other Paradox titles, and actually this game leave a lot to be desired.
<br>
<br>The Good +++++
<br>+ The Character System is well-built, seems derived from Crusader Kings (another Paradox title) that gives you many option to built your dream character. Sadly no ruler designer.
<br>+ The Intrigue System allows player to easily overtake supposedly stronger enemy by assassination or conspiring with other lords. Also allows your vassals to easily overthrows you....
<br>+ The Troop Recruiting System is slightly improved, you can quickly exploit it to build power
<br>+ Actually easier to learn than other Paradox titles (damn you Victoria!)
<br>+ Not too buggy this time eh?
<br>+ Still Easily Moddable
<br>
<br>The Bad ------
<br>- Too war-oriented. Paradox&apos; games are not known for its warfare system (except Hearts of Iron, which emphasize on it) but for its Diplomacy, Intrigue and Economic system. Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, and Victoria (all Paradox titles) have done this admirably,  in Sengoku you will spent much time waging war without having time to improve your realm, forging extensive alliance and conspiring. The loss of casus belli system is saddening
<br>
<br>- Despite its war-oriented gameplay. The system from CK stays: Raise Levy, send to enemy province who has fewer troops, hope they win, get the province, raise more levy. as CK is more politic-oriented that would be fine. But in Sengoku? It is disastrous.
<br>
<br>- The Large Factions are simply too powerful, within the first ten years you will find Japan divided between 3-4 Superpowers while smaller nations left cannot hope to fight them.
<br>
<br>- The Interface looks derived from EU: Rome which is NOT good. It&apos;s ridiculously hard to change between diplomacy and marriage (It keep tells me that my MALE faction leader cannot marry their MALE faction leader, WTH?). Overall, the Interface is not user-friendly
<br>
<br>- Shogunate and Emperors are USELESS. in feudal japan they still exert some influence and even build coalitions
<br>
<br>- Title system is less like a political tool and more like an achievement award you get when you kill 1000 zombies in the head.
<br>
<br>- Lack of tutorial. Inexperienced players would really find this confusing
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>
<br>Sengoku has many shortcomings, but it&apos;s still got potential. I felt this way when playing EU3 vanilla and when they released the expansions it become amazing. Paradox really need to work on this game if they want Sengoku to survive</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sengoku/user-reviews?user_review_id=2886360">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I would have expected more from a paradox game. It&apos;s very poor. It seems like it&apos;s half finished, missing a lot of content. I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s hard to play having played a lot of other paradox games, but having no experience at all then I can appreciate it might be confusing. I think the reviews are pretty accurate and there&apos;s not much to say except don&apos;t bother, it&apos;s not worth it.</span>
