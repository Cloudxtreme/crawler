                                        <span>One of my favorite Episodes released yet. Clementine has transformed from a scared little girl in season 1 to a cold-blooded survivor, and is given far more responsibility than we&apos;ve seen in previous episodes. Also, Michael Madsen does a fantastic job voicing Carter, one of my favorite characters in the series thus far. And man that cliffhanger, can&apos;t wait for the next episode.</span>

I&apos;m pretty sure the developers sprinkle the story with actual cocaine, because every episode is more addictive than the previous one.</span>

<br>I played all parts from the walking dead and I know this is more of an interactive story, but the recent episode is just a poor excuse, even for an interactive story, even if you consider the quicktime events (the worlds most hated game mechanic), you are barely doing things, I&#xB4;d say you can act &quot;on your own&quot; for about 10-20% of the episode.
<br>you aren&#xB4;t allowed to search anything anymore, you don&#xB4;t combine anything, the parts where you are actually in control are always the same, go from A to B and pickup/switch on one thing, then the next 10min cutscene starts.
<br>the pacing is horrible, I caught myself yawning several times because the dialogues were very boring and took forever, without the pressure of popup dialogue options i would have dozed off completely.

That&apos;s not a bad thing though, the world is in hell right now and if you plan to survive you need to make rash decisions and this game owns it. Its my favorite episode and I recommend you get both Season 1 and Season 2 of The Walking Dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-3---in-harms-way/user-reviews?user_review_id=4189808">Expand</a></span>

Still, it is another solid episode in the series, although than from the three that had come up till now it is the weakest. It is not only short on meaningful decisions and consequences, but in the shocking moments that make The Walking Dead such a powerful experience. Still, TWD Season 2: Episode 3 &quot;In Harm&apos;s Way&quot; is brutal, wicked and just plain badass.
<br>The story follows Clementine and her group, now in the hands of Carver and its community. New characters come in, but the most special thing about this episode is how it deals with loyalty. Should you side this character, should you trust this character? The new characters don&apos;t have much of a role in Episode 3, but this episodes really questions how much you trust someone. The best part of Episode 3 is definitely the middle-end, where things start to go down south, and Clementine turns into a mercenary (There is no more innocent Clem in this episode, just merciless anti-heroine).
<br>&quot;In Harm&apos;s Way&quot;, unfortunately, fails miserably at trying new gameplay elements. QTE&apos;s are starting to get either easy or boring, and the new Stealth mechanics are neither tense nor well-developed. There is almost no way to fail. The Walking Dead repeats the error the first season committed: It gives you way too many chances.
<br>The Walking Dead is shaping up. Episode 1 was good. Episode 2 was amazing. Episode 3 was good. As a whole, The Walking Dead is a great game. Let&apos;s hope episode 4 comes quick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-3---in-harms-way/user-reviews?user_review_id=4192645">Expand</a></span>

Good job, TTG. But I gonna say that this episode lacks interactions, it seems a little bit boring but the story covers them all. 9/10.</span>

<br>It&apos;s full of action, drama and turnabouts just like every other episode but it has SO many of them!
<br>In this episode you will have to make many hard decisions and witness some of the most dramatic and painful moments to watch! I just love it and I can&apos;t wait for episode 4.</span>

<br>99% of movies and top-tier games don&apos;t even come close to the emotion and intensity this episode brings.
<br>
<br>Not only is this the best written, most intense and the most emotional Episode of The Walking Dead Season 2, it&apos;s also the best episode ever created.

<br>
<br>As is often the case, it hasn&#x2019;t been desperation that has been the worst thing Telltale has crafted in their story thus far, but ironically rather it has been hope. Giving us that hope and then more often than not crushing it, yet still having us dogging along beside the equally dejected characters could be called sadistic if it weren&#x2019;t a game, and probably still is, but I&#x2019;m certainly &#x2018;loving&#x2019; it- if that&#x2019;s even that right, related word for matters such as this. I&#x2019;m hardly enjoying myself or Clem&#x2019;s trials and troubles, but you know what I mean, surely. As much as I don&#x2019;t doubt that Telltale could or would kill Clem given the opportunity, I hardly think it would be at the end of this season- although we&#x2019;ve been shocked before so anything could happen. That having been said, as much as I want to murder Carver and many of his cronies myself, or give the other NPCs a piece of my mind, or see Clem triumph in the end, I know that inevitably and sadly so, there is always going to be at least one human and one zombie out there, and that distinguishing which is the true monster in specific circumstances may be more difficult than anticipated as well. As Christopher Nolan&#x2019;s Batman said&#x2026; &#x201C;Which is worse- being a hero or living long enough to see yourself become the villain?&#x201D; After this particular episode, I&#x2019;m drained, but I still remain hopeful against all odds and can&#x2019;t wait to see into what dark, far reaches the series travels next&#x2026;
<br>
<br>Concept: Continue the desperate tale revolving around Clementine and her interactions with both enemies such as the dead walking and other human beings, as well as her so-called friends and companions- an unknown and unexpected variable or three being inserted along the way.
<br>
<br>Graphics: As usual, the same visual scheme can be seen, however for what it is worth the animations did seem somewhat smoother this time around, so maybe there is at least some small improvement to be had thus far as well.
<br>
<br>Sound: A dark tone is easily established thanks to the chilling and oftentimes haunting melodies utilized, and the characters&#x2019; voices all fit accordingly in with their very looks, actions, and general tones as well which is definitely a plus.
<br>
<br>Playability: As with the rest of the series, the controls are never really an issue, although they do always take a little while to get a grasp on for newer players.
<br>
<br>Entertainment: This episode definitely featured more fastballs and curveballs than any slow pitches, although it remains to be seen if Clem and Telltale have hit any homeruns just yet, despite getting what is undoubtedly a great start already as the story has progressed thus far.
<br>
<br>Replay Value: High.
<br>
<br>Overall Score: 8.75
<br>
<br>As a final note, which I do not often include in my reviews, I would like to say that thus far- especially apparent in my spate of reviews for this Season alone, the series has definitely continued to improve both in gameplay pacing and storyline. Simply put, look at the progression from Episode One to now- I gave the first an 8.0, the second and 8.5, and this one has elicited a very close series high (for me) of an 8.75. I&#x2019;m excited to see if we can continue to reach new heights and what highest highs or lowest lows the story will dive or fly to. Until next time, I&#x2019;ll leave this here review for you all to peruse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-3---in-harms-way/user-reviews?user_review_id=4286870">Expand</a></span>

You can&apos;t exactly put it anywhere else can you?  This happens repeatedly, with the feel of nothing more than clicking at the right time, and in the box.
<br>It receives a seven, though if there was more multiple choice, would easily gain extra marks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-3---in-harms-way/user-reviews?user_review_id=4195614">Expand</a></span>

<br>While the episode didn&apos;t blow my mind, it kept up the good quality that we&apos;ve seen this season. Carver is a deliciously evil villain and the ending of the episode had me on the edge of my seat.</span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_4226027"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Whenever I finish an episode of Telltale&#x2019;s The Walking Dead, I&#x2019;m left genuinely depressed, and yet, always wanting more. This episode, in particular, is extremely dark and bleak, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean it is the best.
<br>
<br>When the episode starts, you&#x2019;re in one of the worst situations you&#x2019;ve been in thus far. You&#x2019;re being held hostage by Carver, and things aren&#x2019;t looking good. Clementine is scared, but strong. She can get through anything, even being held hostage in a prison-like camp by Carver and his goons. Carver&#x2019;s unpredictability kept me on the edge of my seat the entire episode. He&#x2019;s a ruthless, complex villain who could kill at any second without batting an eye.
<br>
<br>Sarah, Carlos&#x2019; daughter, is incredibly annoying in this episode. I found myself yelling at my television whenever she talked. If things in this world weren&#x2019;t the way they are, I&#x2019;m sure Clem and Sarah would be good friends. However, Clem is wise beyond her years and is much stronger than Sarah. It&#x2019;s like they come from two different worlds. Sarah was sheltered by her daddy while Clem was left all alone in her treehouse to be rescued by Lee. She may be traumatized, but she&#x2019;s a stronger person than she ever would have been if her parents hadn&#x2019;t disappeared and become of the walking dead.
<br>
<br>As far as gameplay is concerned, there isn&#x2019;t much of it in this episode. It seems there is much more watching than interacting, and the decisions you do make don&#x2019;t seem to have much of an impact on the story (I played through it twice). There is one scene toward the end of the episode that sent chills up my spine. You choose whether or not you want to witness the scene, and you learn a lot about yourself when you look at why you made the decision you did.
<br>
<br>While the 90-minute length may be a negative mark for some people, it&#x2019;s a positive for me, personally. This episode in particular is very punctual and gets right to the point. Not a moment goes by where the player is bored or wondering what to do. My time with games is limited nowadays, so, at times, it&#x2019;s nice to be able to finish a game in one sitting.
<br>
<br>Final Thoughts
<br>
<br>Gameplay: The gameplay in this episode is lacking.
<br>
<br>Appearance: What you would expect from a Telltale game. I didn&#x2019;t have as many frame rate issues as I&#x2019;ve had in previous episodes.
<br>
<br>Sound: Jared Emerson-Johnson does a stellar job of setting the mood for the game.
<br>
<br>Bottom Line: This is one of the toughest episodes to get through, as many scenes are gruesome and just downright sad. Once you&#x2019;ve made it through, though, you&#x2019;ll be anxiously awaiting Episode 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-3---in-harms-way/user-reviews?user_review_id=4226027">Expand</a></span>

But there&apos;s so much missing. Where&apos;s the 2-2h30 lenght? Where&apos;s the great character development? Where&apos;s the hub moments?
<br>I excused TTG for a while, but now the game is starting to get dull. At the time you&apos;re playing, you feel excited, sad, angry, whatever, but when you recall on what you did, you know you don&apos;t give a ****
<br>Again, TTG made Clementine look like a superhero. We all know of that embarrassing moment when Carlos couldn&apos;t figure out how to turn off the wind turbine, but this time it&apos;s worse: Clementine can perfectly sneak around adults without making noise, she can deceive everyone, and she isn&apos;t even a little afraid of looking Carver right in the eyes.
<br>Another thing, this episode features some casualties. But without character development, how can you care about when they die? In Season 1, we knew everything about everyone. We knew everyone&apos;s jobs, likes, dislikes, habits, age, last names, all that. But in Season 2, we have no indication of any backstory or info on the characters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-3---in-harms-way/user-reviews?user_review_id=4274450">Expand</a></span>

<br>Without spoiling anything, the episode centres around the group&apos;s captivity in Carver&apos;s settlement. I use the term very loosely, because they are fed, kept safe, and given a chance to enter back in to the group, and the only indication of Carver&apos;s supposed villainy (which we keep hearing about and are meant to believe, but never see) is the killing of a traitor and the savage beating of someone who was planning to destroy the settlement.
<br>
<br>In short, this episode was written with the intent that we would believe something that is not shown, implied, or satisfactorily demonstrated in any way, and believe it with conviction. Instead, the player is treated to an excruciating hour long cutscene in which they are forced to do things that make no sense, culminating in a remarkably stupid finale.
<br>
<br>Lousy from a gameplay and writing standpoint, this is easily the worst entry in the series so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-3---in-harms-way/user-reviews?user_review_id=4483216">Expand</a></span>

I liked quite a few bits and the episode was really intense. But some characters had terrible roles in this episode, if Nick is saved in episode 2 he barely says anything in episode 3, if Alvin is saved in episode 2 he barely appears in episode 3 and when he does he&apos;s knocked out and only wakes for a minute around the end of the episode where he dies seconds later, and Carlos&apos; death was stupid and a waste...his character had potential. I was also quite disappointed with Sarita&apos;s death, I thought she had potential and maybe could last at least another episode alive and well (without being bitten in the first place) rather than getting too sick to say anything in the next episode. From what I know, TellTale kills off characters way too fast - NOT a good thing.
<br>
<br>Overall I liked this episode but I disliked some parts too so I have to say I&apos;m neutral. I can say the ending was awesome as well as Luke&apos;s first appearance in the episode, Carver&apos;s character was well developed and so was Troy&apos;s...and both of their deaths were quite shocking (in a good way). I&apos;m a bit disappointed with the 400 days characters though, they only had like 1-3 lines of speech each and an extremely brief appearance (besides Bonnie) so their appearance was pretty much insignificant, all their appearance tells us is that they were at Carver&apos;s camp. Trust me you might as well not have any of them come with you in 400 days, it makes no difference at all.
<br>
<br>Season 1 is much better than season 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-3---in-harms-way/user-reviews?user_review_id=4862157">Expand</a></span>
