<br>
<br>At first I thought I was missing something but it&apos;s really that simple. I&apos;m not saying simplicity is a bad thing but for a Sid Meier title this is more than just bland. The core gameplay feels as interesting as the space age in Spore. Instead of moving spices and terraforming you get missions on each planets. About 5 different. Considering that this is pretty much all you do the entire game it&apos;s fair to say that it gets old very quickly.
<br>Research, outfitting ships and managing planets is linear and just as uninteresting.
<br>
<br>The fact that this is also a mobile game really shines through. Graphics are really basic but at least the window can be rescaled freely.
<br>
<br>It doesn&apos;t pretend to be a full Civilisation game but still, for having Sid Meier in the name it just doesn&apos;t deliver enough.
<br>
<br>4 points for being a game (with almost no content) and working very well on PC (and not being a bad port)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5153902">Expand</a></span>

You may be wondering why I&apos;m giving it such a high score when the game is so clearly terrible. Well even though this game is a terrible excuse for an anything Sid Meier at least has the decency not to charge 60 dollars for this. I got it for 15 which makes it at least somewhat worth it. That still doesn&apos;t change the fact that I&apos;m using Spore which was a huge disappointment as a comparison to this game. Spore is better in nearly every way. And I think it&apos;s only 5 dollars now.

This is 100% a Tablet Game and should have been pitched as such on the PC instead of tacking Sid Meier&apos;s name to this game and pretending it was a full fledged game. This game is not worth $14.99 and should have been sold at mobile game prices.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5072706">Expand</a></span>

<br>The UI is extremely simplistic, clearly made for touchscreens (mobile devices), lacking in anything more in-depth. Graphics wise it&apos;s okay, for mobile devices, for PC graphics it&apos;s a complete joke. There are no real options to speak of, you can switch from windowed mode to windowed fullscreen and adjust audio options, that&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll most likely find yourself bored and uninspired after 30-45 minutes of gameplay. It&apos;s repetitive, too easy and not interesting in any way, shape or form.
<br>
<br>I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game on PC to anyone, ever. Save your money for something else, anything,  as long as it isn&apos;t this game.
<br>
<br>TL;DR - The only thing this game is good for, is to play a cruel joke on a friend, nothing else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5068683">Expand</a></span>

This is clearly an uninspired direct port of a mobile game (which I didn&apos;t discover until after I bought the PC version), and even the mobile version is underwhelming &amp; shallow as a game. All the 4X concepts are there -- exploration, resources, research, diplomacy, combat -- but most of them are shamefully underdeveloped. You have only limited control over the victory conditions -- either all them, or any one, but not subsets -- and the opening splash screen is actually miselading: it says you can win by controlloing 51% of the galaxy, but you actually need either 51% of the total population _or_ every single star system. Domination victory turns into a grind, yet a simple one (hint: focus on torpedoes). As a $3 mobile game, it might have been worth it, but it is vastly overpriced at $15. Avoid this.

<br>Winning and loosing is to unpredictable, one second you are with 35% of winning condition and the next round you have lost, without even having a change to do something against it.
<br>What happens is that if you win a fight at a home world you get all the planets of that player, so in 2 battels you can get from 15% to 50+ and you have won the game, or if the AI does it you have lost and yes they do that a lot.
<br>
<br>Building up an empire is useless since you will loose the game suddenly or just win it by taken 2 home worlds.
<br>
<br>You might as well get your risk dice and if you roll a six you have won.
<br>
<br>Its to bad because if they just put some more time in it the game would have been fun.

<br>I realy would like to see somebody who gave it a score of 8 to do the review again after playing it 5 times  at a harder difficulty, i bet you think differend about the game then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5075786">Expand</a></span>

<br>At 2.99&#x20AC; this would get a 7 , but this game is too repetitive, user- unfriendly and complicated to be enjoyable.

<br>Next time Sid, keep it simple, fun and cheap.</span>

<br>
<br>In the end that game is clearly made f&#xFC;r mobile devices.Right now they charge you with around 15&#x20AC;.Many people will tell you 15&#x20AC; is not much and its ok.NO ITS NOT!There are so many games out there for less money that are better.Hell, pick up Masters of Orion, better battles, much more tactic needed and a real economy behind it.If you want just the fighting, buy FTL.Or buy other games, but not this ripoff that is just portet so that they can grab your cash because there is the name Sid Meier on it.Without the name Sid Meier no one would ever give a **** about this boring game.Its below average for me, deinstalled it after some hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5138866">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I am sure some turd-hat at 2K is kicking himself for not charging $39.99 for this because even he knows after buying this one, you are going to have to give me a free game before I ever by another Firaxis title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5069099">Expand</a></span>

<br>These days my patience for learning new and complex games are (perhaps unfortunately?) at an all time low.

<br>
<br>You don&apos;t have to read a manual 10 times the bible just to undock your ship, or learn how the economic&apos;s work.
<br>
<br>Sid Meier&apos;s Starships pretty much puts you right in the middle of things, yet giving you some help along the way.
<br>There&apos;s only a few tech-trees if you compare it to the Civilization games, and as such things do feel quite a bit simplified.
<br>
<br>The good thing about this is that it makes the game easy to get into, and still as you learn by playing, you soon find that strategy and thinking helps a lot.
<br>I would love for Firaxis to add to this game, it&apos;s practically begging for a good Hot-seat mode (Like the Old Master of Orion games (MOO 1+2) more diplomacy options ,more ship / customization options, and actually, a little more of everything.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s the first space strategy game I&apos;ve tried in the last 10 years I haven&apos;t needed to will myself into playing, but now that I like it? I want more, lots more.
<br>
<br>There positives are :
<br>
<br>Easy to get into
<br>Smooth gameplay
<br>Interesting setting / technologies
<br>The many different kinds of missions , in addition to thrilling space battles
<br>A sheer joy to play (when you&apos;re winning difficult fights)
<br>
<br>The negatives (for me)
<br>
<br>NO FULLSCREEN?!!! ...... That&apos;s uber-annoying, what are Firaxis thinking?
<br>Alt+F4 to quit!?? Where&apos;s the QUIT TO WINDOWS (or DOS) button????
<br>No multiplayer? ..b....but why???? It&apos;s a turned based game that practically begs for a Hot-seat mode
<br>GUI , this -really-really-really- needs work ......I thought they knew how to do this after Civ and X-com
<br>Lack of gameplay depth, options like setting up diplomatic treaties, alliances ++
<br>Though the game can quickly pull you in, it soon leaves you wanting more
<br>
<br>I certainly hope the game gets better With patches / fixes and addons</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5127596">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Three things I would change (or at least want to hear why they didn&apos;t take this approach):
<br>* Add multiplayer. That&apos;s so strange to be missing from a game today.
<br>* Let you actively lose ships -- other than spending energy to repair damage, the consequences of losing are just really marginal.
<br>* Have multiple fleets, instead of just one flying around. This would go a long way toward adding the strategic depth that I think is missing -- maybe cap it at 3 so the map doesn&apos;t turn into a mess that you have to micromanage (think old Total War games where by the end, you&apos;d have dozens of one-unit armies trying to get to the front).
<br>
<br>If you saw Sid Meier&apos;s name and thought you were getting a Civ-scale experience for $15, I don&apos;t think that warrants some of the negative reviews that are here. They were really up front about what this was going to be, and the price point still feels very reasonable to me for how much I see myself playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5068444">Expand</a></span>

This is a change from older 4x&apos;s like MOO and Space Empires, instead of using most of your time managing the empire you spend most of it in engagements against the enemy. Management is streamlined to be very smooth. This is much like the XCom release from Firaxis, that was not quite as harsh as the original but a smoother still fun experience. Same goes for this 4x game. I knew exactly what this game was when I paid the full $15 for it. That&apos;s not much, that&apos;s a DLC pack for COD with only a few maps. Most people are expecting a Civ or Beyond Earth type of game at $15 release date price and never researched what this was, that is where most of the negative reviews are coming from. You are simply getting a streamlined space 4x with emphasis on fleet battles and games are meant to last a few hours maybe, not take dozens of hours to finish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5066646">Expand</a></span>

Streamlined, light-strategy experience focused on tactical starship battles, big on unit positioning and angle of attack.  It&apos;s not meant to take two weeks to finish a game.  Where it succeeds is distilling classic Civ features into their basic fundamentals for a Civ-light (very light!) feel.  I&apos;ll tell you how I feel about this:  personally, I&apos;m a Total War game kind of guy, and ideally would spend days on careful worldwide strategy and minute positioning in battle.  But now I&apos;m also a parent with a full time job, and I don&apos;t have that kind of time.  So to me, getting the same general strategy fix in a fraction of the time by shaving away some of the complexity is not a bad thing.  I still wrestle with optimizing territory control, determining research tree path, ship loadout and overall playstyle strategy, preventing AI moves that could cost me the game, etc.  It just happens a lot faster.  For $15 that&apos;s kind of a selling point now.  As long as this doesn&apos;t become the future of Civ games (and it&apos;s clearly NOT Civ-6, so I don&apos;t think we have to worry), there&apos;s a place for this as a light-strategy companion piece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5081239">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you enjoyed Faster Than Light, you will enjoy this game and I&apos;d say this is a similar level of complexity.
<br>On the other hand FTL is more replayable, at least from the initial impression.
<br>On the graphics side, it looks very pretty.
<br>It isn&apos;t too demanding on the hardware side - making it a perfect game on the go - I play on a ultraportable laptop that can&apos;t handle most AAA games, this one is fine, so a big plus from me.
<br>Overall a strong 7 but a big plus from me for modest HW requirements so 8 from me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5071581">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Apparently a surprisingly large number of fans were expecting to get a deep game like a Civ or a spacegoing Pirates! for $16 on a short development cycle; they also apparently did  not even look at the gameplay footage that&apos;s been available for weeks.
<br>
<br>Going in with my eyes open, though, I have little to complain about in the gameplay itself. It&apos;s pretty much what the video promised. The tie-in with Beyond Earth, modulo the bugs I&apos;m about to mention, is no clumsier than I expected. The requirement to set up a 2K account to get the tie-in is not yet onerous - we&apos;ll see where that goes, and hope that it&apos;s not like EA&apos;s player abuse system.
<br>
<br>Where the game totally fails, though is that despite being developed in parallel, and despite Firaxis&apos; experience with PC games, it comes across as a crappy iPad port. Most of these things are inexcusable, showing either or both of a lack of testing on the PC or a lack of caring about PC quality:
<br>
<br>* It only plays in &quot;full-screen windowed&quot; mode. No true fullscreen, no choice of resolution. 2K&apos;s claimed &quot;fix&quot; for this is an ugly workaround telling you to change your desktop settings to hide the taskbar. Ugh for Firaxis and FY2 to 2K.
<br>
<br>* It crashes on exit, every time. Most of the time it crashes when you hit &quot;exit&quot; from the main menu, but last night I had it crash when I clicked &quot;return to main menu&quot; from the victory screen. Did they even test the PC version?
<br>
<br>* It has about a minute of unskppable video at game end. This doesn&apos;t feel like a victory celebration, it feels like punishment for winning. Ugh.
<br>
<br>* Right-click is treated exactly the same as left-click, even though a hover brings up a radial menu. Totally lazy.
<br>
<br>* Probably related to the crashes, the unlocks for Beyond Earth for playing Starships don&apos;t work. The unlocks in the other direction do, at least.
<br>
<br>Despite all of these issues, it is a fun little game, especially if you have Beyond Earth and either you&apos;re not tired of it yet or you use the in-game-editor mod to fast-path you to the unlocks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-starships/user-reviews?user_review_id=5083591">Expand</a></span>

Just treat it as a fun distraction and no more.</span>
