They should&apos;ve done way more with the amazing water effects they had, but I guess Bioshock 2 made up for that part.<br><br>After Fort Frolic, for me, the game fell apart and became boring, until the plot twist of course. But after Sander Cohen&apos;s part, the game became extremely repetitive and boring, even when playing on hardest difficulty.</span>

Jeez, it is only there to make ammo and other do-hickys cheaper and turn bots on your side, which you can just as easily kill. Unless you are on the hardest difficulty, then you need to hack them, but hey, if you don&apos;t want to hack the machines, get ur nubby ass to an easier difficulty and leave the harder stuff to the experienced players with half a brain and some patience. and TOO BUGGY, wow, that is a personal computer issue, I don&apos;t get any bugs at all when i play and my computer is a royal piece of s***. But hey, if you didn&apos;t like the incredible graphics, amazing and mind warping story line, or the amazing options you have when it comes to taking down all kinds of enemies, you can go F*** yourself, cuz you my friend, are a moron. It takes a brain to appreciate the incredible aspects of this game, so if you don&apos;t enjoy Bioshock, go work at McDonalds.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=425024">Expand</a></span>

I won&apos;t lie, when I bought this game off of Steam for $20, I wanted to hate it. I thought that it was over-hyped, and nothing but a run and gun shooter game. As soon as I hit the New Game button, I realized I was in for something unique. Of the aspects of Bioshock, by far the most awesome, was the story, intricately woven into the fabric of the continuity of the lore. Without giving away any spoilers, I would have to say that Bioshock is without a doubt, the strongest narrative I have ever heard/seen in a video game. The gameplay is equally incredible. Granted, as some of the reviewers have noted, the plasmids are a bit unbalanced.Two of the plasmids, Incinerate and Electric bolt, are almost undefeatable, and one could when the game with nothing but them, however the real enjoyable portion of Bioshock, is freezing an enemy and shattering them to bits, or throwing hives of bees at them, and watching them writhe in pain. The weapons, however are perfectly balanced. An combined the weapons/plasmids system is one of the most efficent combat systems I have seen in an FPS. One thing that annoyed me was the Karma system, which many called an RPG system. The whole conflict with the Little Sisters, while unique just doesn&apos;t have the moral implications that it does the first time you do it. By the time that you&apos;re harvesting/saving three per level, it becomes routine. Another problem I had with the game was the hacking system. I seemed like a good idea gone terribly wrong. Eventually you do get Auto-hack for some items, but even so, hacking vending machines and safes can be frustrating. Finally I must comment on the graphics. The water effects are incredible, some of the finest yet to grace the platform. Overall, with a pricetag of 20, I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to get this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=84939">Expand</a></span>

For those who had issues with the PC version I empathize with you...not sure what the issues were since I had none :-( but am also fairly adept at fixing problems in games when they arise ....anyway if you have never played this game and are wanting an unforgettable experience - this is it...for those who like to nitpick at games and think you have an insight into everything...please just skip it and save us your laughable comments on these review threads.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2014105">Expand</a></span>

It starts off relatively slow and mediocre, but after first few areas the experience becomes rich as you acquire a lot of weapons and special powers. BioShock definitely has some distinct strengths and a handful of weaknesses too. The strengths. It has a very unique graphics style, with bright colours, which give life to the characters. As mentioned already, there are a lot of cool and different special powers, buffs, and types of ammo which add loads of variation to combat, hence keeping it fun and fresh for the most part. The hacking mini-game is also immensely fun. This is perhaps the best hacking mini-game I have ever had to play, because I almost never got bored of it. The game also has an interesting backstory with some memorable characters and quotes. Heck, everything in the game has personality, even the vending machines. However, despite the good story, the storytelling itself is a bit average, and this brings me to the weaknesses. The reason I say the storytelling is average is because most of the story you uncover by listening to various audio tapes instead of experiencing the story as you go along. Another minor weakness is that I felt the health and EVE bars were a bit too small (even with upgrades). Whenever I fought 2 or more enemies, or one strong enemy, I literally had to keep pressing the medkit button to keep healing myself repeatedly, which takes away from the fun of combat. Likewise for the EVE bar as well. After a couple of shots of your special powers, your character had to inject himself with more EVE. And the last weakness I&apos;ll mention is that the level design in certain areas was kind of subpar. The colours and the environments are nice, but it&apos;s the structure itself that I have an issue with. Like some areas looked too repetitive whichever way you went (Arcadia anyone?) and also some other areas were a bit too big and confusing (Fort Frolic anyone?). And the map wasn&apos;t particularly too helpful when navigating through multiple floors. So, despite the few weaknesses the game has, I think its strengths by far outweigh them, because it generally manages to deliver the fun factor (although I find the average critic score to be a tad too high).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2428985">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Fun factor :
<br>
<br>I have to say it was extremely fun playing Bioshock for the PC .I actually enjoyed the nerve shaking surprises that will definitely catch you off guard.I had fun killing Big Daddys and Splicers and even saving Little Sisters along the way.
<br>
<br>Control and gameplay:
<br>
<br>I have to say that the controls were very easy to learn and even easier to remember.Although,I have to personaly warn you that palying without a mouse is like suicide if you don&apos;t know the controls.
<br>
<br>The gameplay aspects of Bioshock were very likable due to the intriging information that the recordings and side characters provide making you think about what you do before you do it.
<br>I also like the save aspect because if you&apos;re playing this game on a laptop and your battery&apos;s almost dead, you can pause the game,save where you are and when you load your saved game,you&apos;ll be right where you left off.
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>
<br>I have to take some time and briefly compliment the graphics of the game due to the fact that they weren&apos;t cheap.They had some great graphics speaking about the voices and the moving.
<br>
<br>Sound:
<br>
<br>I liked the sound alot.Due to the fact that the splicers&apos; voices were very well conveyed and kept you alert to their presense.Main characters were a big help as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3203457">Expand</a></span>

Although the enemy AI is fairly intelligent, they think as tactically as a genetic abomination can, and the artwork involved in them is astounding. On the other hand, you spend so much time fighting them it gets a bit repetitive which does make it kind of boring. The scavenging for materials in this game is essential to it, but I found it a bit annoying because you need so much ammo for so many different guns plus eve and first aid kits, but still bearable. Then there are the pros. First of all, the sound is great. The sounds of Rapture are always swimming around your mind, accompanied with the crazy screams of splicers and big daddies and little sisters. The atmosphere is extremely creepy and enveloping, combined with the fact that just a few splicers can be such a huge threat makes you always want to watch your back and immerses you in the game. The plot is very intricate and although hard to follow, if you research the game a little and listen to the diaries you find yourself surrounded by the vast history of Rapture, even though the city didn&apos;t get very far. Andrew Ryan and Frank Fontaine are the perfect anatagonists for the story since they are both wicked and evil and make you want to hate them but also make you interested in them. The graphics are great, especially for a 2007 game, and the details in some of the splicers and the ruins of Rapture is insane. The game has two endings which are decided by how many little sisters you rescue/harvest and although this isn&apos;t that impressive, the choice of either rescuing or harvesting them pops up as many times as you fend off those big daddies and can prove a challenge to decide at times. Other times you&apos;re so enraged by all the times you had to jump out of the vita-lyzer and waste even more ammo on the big daddy you don&apos;t even care anymore. The weapons and plasmids are interesting, but it&apos;s obviously the plasmids that shine and make the game even more innovative.You have many plasmids to choose from, and eventually get so many you need to start strategically thinking which to put in your plasmid slots every time you pass a gene bank. There are many different times and places to use the plasmids and can provide an extremely strategic advantage or barely damage your adversary depending on how you use it. The weapons aren&apos;t bad either, and as you progress the game you get a few more pop up and can be upgraded using power to the people stations. Overall the game is fun, (although repetitive) and keeps you moving (although you sometimes just want a break.) Bioshock is a great game, and if you haven&apos;t bought it, still might be worth the buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2924249">Expand</a></span>

Bioshock is the rare game that  perfectly blend all those elements together. The story engulfs you in Rapture, one of the most unique and awesome game locations I&apos;ve ever played. As you progress, you&apos;ll discover and explore the ruins of Rapture and learn more about Rapture and what happened and your character&apos;s involvement on why he&apos;s here in the first place.
<br>Combat works will blending survival horror elements, such as lack of abundant ammo, to great first person shooting mechanics. It also adds a new spin with Plasmids, giving your character the ablility to electrocute, set on fire, freeze, control, patronize, hypnotize,  and among many others.
<br>
<br>Such a game like Bioshock can perfectly combine everything that can shooters great. It&apos;s exciting, it&apos;s terrifying, keeps you on the edge of your seat, it sparks wonder and curiosity. The only thing that keeps this game from being perfect is the ending/ final boss. Ending is kind of out of place (meaning it&apos;s either warm hearted or a cold slap in the face that doesn&apos;t really conclude your character&apos;s journey.) and I didn&apos;t lean towards how the final boss was done.
<br>
<br>Still, fantastic game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3385527">Expand</a></span>

Sit down kids, it&apos;s time to learn about art.
<br>
<br>The first game starts in the year 1960 with your protagonist,  Jack,  the sole survivor of a sudden plane crash over the Pacific Ocean.  After seeking refuge in the lone light house surrounded by water,  Jack finds a submarine called a &apos;bathysphere&apos; and unintentionally activates it.  The submarine then locks him in and proceeds to descend into the underwater city of Rapture.  Not only does the name of the city references the bible.  But you are introduced to two of the most influential men in the game,  Atlas and Andrew Ryan. Andrew is the multi billionaire who founded and established the city after World War II representing the spoiled, and dictatorial upper class, while in contrast you have Atlas, a blue-collar worker from the lower class who is everyone&apos;s favorite and leader in the working class.
<br>Because of the way the city was set up, with such a huge caste difference, tensions naturally began to rise; it also was apparent in the years before this civil war amongst the difference in caste a new bio-chemical drug was uncovered called ADAM. The properties of this drug were breakthroughs in all levels in science, ridding residents of deformities and even gave them superhuman abilities such as  elemental control, teleportation, telekinesis, etc and those who used it were called &apos;splicers&apos; (in reference with ADAM tampering with their DNA). But in its cheapest and most common form, it doubled as a highly addictive drug that heightened violent tendencies, thus eventually sparking a civil war. Jack arrives in the city a year in the aftermath of the war&apos;s resolution. Jack teams up with Atlas to leave the city, fighting these violent splicers along the way.
<br>
<br>Bioshock 2 follows roughly ten years  after the conclusion of the first game in the same city with a different protagonist, a brainwashed man named Delta. Delta was assigned to protect a young girl named Eleanor from the splicers rampaging the city. But after a surprising ambush, he finds himself waking up from a 10 year coma and Eleanor desperate to reunite with him and escape Rapture. When he wakes up, Delta finds himself with a newfound freewill he forgot he was able to have. His time to save Eleanor is almost a race against the clock for Delta because the city is dying, and Delta chose to survive with Eleanor and find salvation in the surface world.
<br>
<br>Bioshock : Infinite has a completely different setting, cast, and story, while still twisting the end to relate to its predecessors, is set in the flying city of Columbia in 1912. Booker Dewitt is a man deeply in debt, suffering from PTSD as a veteran of the Battle of Wounded Knee, must find a young girl named Elizabeth amongst a flying city in the middle of another civil war amongst the high and working classes. This city in the sky was founded by Mayor Zachery Comstock, who establishes this city as a very patriotic district of the United States. Booker has no choice but to fight his way through the city and bring Elizabeth down the ground.
<br>
<br>The city of Columbia is almost in its bright and patriotic coloring, an American paradise, throughout the entirety of the play through, the weather is bright and happy sunlight, almost blinding in the idea of paradise in contrast to Rapture&apos;s overall  grim, gritty and abandoned darker tones in the setting. In biblical comparison Rapture is Hell; one filled with murder, savagery, drug abuse, cults and lies. Columbia, however is a well-kept with love and an overwhelming sense of American Patriotism. In each game though, the sheer amount of detail in the scenery of both an underwater city and a city in the sky were amazing and powerful in conveying messages beyond simply setting and artwork.
<br>
<br>Throughout the games, the player must make choices through Jack/Delta/Booker on whether or not to kill characters, these do affect your ending, as Andrew Ryan stated:
<br>
<br>&quot;We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us.&quot;
<br>This is a HUGE theme across all three games, because how you play, affects how your play through ends., also applying to real life where what a person does defines them. Another huge motif mentioned by the same man goes
<br>
<br>&quot;A man chooses, a slave obeys.&quot;
<br>This quote challenges all protagonists&apos; expression/ideal of free will and its definition not only to the player but to the protagonist as well. This also may relate to the earlier quote where if a choice is made, it gives him free will while also letting the choices shape him. This quote, or really the significance of it, plays a huge role in each game and potential choices.
<br>
<br>The antagonist of Bioshock 2, Sofia explains:
<br>&quot;For every choice, there is an echo, with each act we change the world. One man chose a city free of law and god, but others chose corruption, and so the city fell. If the world was reborn in your image, would it be paradise</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=4248643">Expand</a></span>

The cackle of a splicer, the groans and stomps of the Big Daddies, the garbled 1950s music, all of it is just so well done and brings the otherwise desolate halls of Rapture to life. The retro-futuristic design of the machines and Art Deco design scheme show how much the developers researched the time period and the style to get everything right. The plot was interesting enough for me and kept me avidly playing until the end although I can see why people thought that it got kinda drab after a certain point. As for the hacking - its isn&apos;t required to play the game although learning to master it will make the game noticeably easier (who doesn&apos;t want flying machine gun turret drones helping them out?). Overall a game that was way ahead of its time and still continues to be amazing today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=6943972">Expand</a></span>

First thing</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">1- Gameplay: The gameplay is monotonous and dull, the game is the definition of a generic tunnel shooter, hours upon hours of going through identical looking corridors and rooms killing identical enemies whose only purpose is to stand there waiting for you to kill them. Not even Doom 3 felt this repetitive.
<br>
<br>2- Writing: This game has the most overrated story I&apos;ve ever seen.
<br>First thing to mention is how horribly it&apos;s presented, there are no NPCs to interact with, you&apos;re just barraged with audio logs or one-way radio messages every ten meters, so you really don&apos;t care much about any of the characters or what&apos;s going on because you never see any of them.
<br>Second thing the writing is not engaging, the audio logs are disjointed and pretentious. They give off the stench of a writer thinking &quot;Look at me I&apos;m such a good writer&quot;. &quot;Morality&quot; in this game consists of either saving the children or killing the children (Oh no! Not the children!). It has a lame plot twist you see from a mile away, and it has the generic Chris Metzen villain whose only purpose is to taunt you over the radio every minute: &quot;I will kill you now!&quot;, &quot;You will never escape!&quot;, &quot;I am too powerful!&quot;, and this lasts half the freakin game (until you defeat him in the generic boss battle of course).
<br>And then the endings, unimaginative as f*ck, either sunshine and rainbows where everyone lives happily ever after &quot;and everything is right with the world&quot;, or stupid sad ending where the world is doomed and you are a big meany face. Yay for video games! Now they rival movies!
<br>
<br>3- Graphics and technical issues: Graphics are fine, a little plastic-looking and overly shiny, but generally they&apos;re good. Animations suffer from poor console porting, I mean the game runs at 60fps but all object animations are locked at 30 fps. There&apos;s also some audio stuttering and issues that need to be fixed by editing .ini files, but most PC games have these kinds of issues.
<br>
<br>5/10. Not a horrible game, not a good game, just a mediocre shooter with a mediocre story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3950000">Expand</a></span>

But in Bioshock you have to plan ahead, look at what is there and formulate a plan to get past it. You have to juggle resources just in order to survive. That and an excellent story and narrative add up to one on the most engrossing and jaw-dropping games I have ever played.</span>

The weapons and powers are fun to use and to experiment with. The Copy protection/FairUse Restriction is over the top for a Steam game, however.

All in all, I&apos;d rank it above DeusEx, HL, HL2, or even System Shock2.

Great graphics, theme, setting and all but the game was just too repetitive and boring. It reminded me of an old arcade game but with a bit more depth added to it. Lame puzzles, the same enemies over and over, linear etc...<br><br>Meh...</span>

The story lost tempo towards the end and then just plummeted to it&apos;s death. but all said, it&apos;s still loads better than most of the other junk available at the market and is definitely worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=404656">Expand</a></span>

It was touted as the spiritual successor to System Shock 2, and while it never quite achieved that, it did manage to become a fantastic game in its own right. I have to say Irrational Games have become my favourite developer due to the care and attention they put into their games. Every moment in BioShock has been polished to a high sheen, the graphics are awesome, the style is unique, the game-play is extremely well balanced and paced between shooting, narrative and other activities like exploration and growing your character. The A.I is some of the best I have ever seen. But most importantly of all for me, is the way you can play the game however you want to. If you like to get in people faces with the shotgun and melee weapon you can do that, or you can stick with rapid fire weapons and high explosives, set traps, go stealthy, use the myriad of plasmids etc. Its just a fantastic and game and so spooky to boot. Without a doubt it is one of my favourite all time video games. If you like intelligent shooters then this is a must play video game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=1694240">Expand</a></span>

Its story line is so enticing and the eerie surroundings cease to creep me out. for those who think its not scary, play it in the dark on full volume on a huge tv, then in some places, you&apos;ll be **** yourself. The game is constantly intense and its very clever. it needs strategy, and skill to traverse the ruined depths. The plasmids are very creative and aid your combat very efficiently especially in harder difficulties. The gun aren&apos;t anything special, but they&apos;re much more fun once you&apos;ve upgraded them. My personal favourite weapon is the fully upgraded shotgun; just going round blasting splicers heads off. One bad thing about the game is how its main mascot, (the bouncer big daddy) is only your enemy twice, in the medical pavilion, and in the big daddy training grounds. all the other times it comes as the less scary, &quot;elite&quot; version. A final bad hing about the game is how it is fairly short, it takes about 5-7 hours to complete.. Overall, the game is amazing, it never gets boring, I&apos;ve completed it 5 times. once on survivor, thrice on medium, and once in easy. you won&apos;t regret buying it, i didn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=1698667">Expand</a></span>

The feature was downright annoying and managed to turn a great experience into a temporarily miserable one. They should have kept the mechanic to plasmid and not weapon use.
<br>Other than that one feature, even being over 5 years old, this game felt like it was given alot of attention and was very well played out. Even the obviously outdated &apos;duel wield swap mechanic&apos; was at least felt comfortable and fluid. The world is exactly the type of bizarre world I love to explore in games, and the story had enough gripping elements to draw me in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3043442">Expand</a></span>

Journal logs work very well at telling at giving backstory similar to the PDAs of Doom 3, but done better.</span>

The story line is unique and compelling and the game play is fun. If offers just enough handholding to get those new [or renewed] to FPS games up to speed. I am really having fun with this game.</span>

Even though the plasmids are reminesent of the Jedi Knight games, the do make the fighting much more entertaining. However the environment and interactiveness of the game is nothing special at all. In those aspects, its just like any other FPS.</span>

Bioshock is a refreshing adventure in a gaming industry crowded with lacklustre, unfairly hyped games and sell-out franchises (*cough*HALO*cough cough*) turned out on a daily basis. The design is beautiful, and the music and sound effects, combined with a dark, moody environment makes for a breathtaking experience. This is the first game in years that I actually enjoy playing. So what if it doesn&apos;t have multiplayer (one of the most overrated features in gaming history)? Bioshock is a brilliant piece of virtual art that any discerning gamer should not be without. More games NEED to be like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=400788">Expand</a></span>

This game is more than just cheap thrills to give you a scare once in awhile, I actually felt tense throughout the whole demo, wondering what the heck else is going to happen and when.  I believe a good game eases you into the action and bases it&apos;s scares not on all the enemies that jump out, but on the anticipation of when and where something will happen, keeping up the suspense throughout and keeping the player on edge and making them feel the tension.  I believe by the demo, Bioshock has done this. just like System Shock has done years before it.

If you treat it like any other FPS and rush it you will miss a huge amount and do yourself a dis-service. If you liked games like Duke Nukem3D, Painkiller and alike this is 100% for you. If you are a Half Life nutter that prefers FPS simulators opposed to atmosphere then look else where, this is not for you. The reviews are spot on in my opinion, this is no Doom3 that was over hyped, over rated and sucked. Bishock is hyped and rated correctly, it 100% delivers what it sets out to do, plenty of atmosphere and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=401302">Expand</a></span>

In no way is this game better or even anywhere near Half-Life 2 - which is almost three years old by now. One particular problem I found is that, on a 2.2 GHz AMD64 with an 8800 GTS 320 MB card, the very first level (where you crash into the sea) is fast on &apos;high quality&apos;, but as soon as the next level loads, it&apos;s one frame every few seconds. No explanation is given where this discrepancy comes from. And this continues when you try to change the settings: the entire game crawls to a halt, including the mouse pointer. Ever tried to change the screen resolution, and can&apos;t click on the &apos;yes&apos; button within 15 seconds? The design is very pretty, though it is not enough to warrant such a high score. The story is basically that of Far Cry, with some dubious morality tale thrown in. There is very little variety in terms of opponents: four major types (humans, Big Daddies and turrets/bots) with eight sub-types between them. Also, they always attack in predictable patterns, jumping a little just before hitting you, etc. The hacking system gets tiresome very, very quickly, just like the fact you have to search pretty much everything if you want to finish the game. The weapon system is interesting, but a bit bewildering in its complexity. More is not necessarily better. Again, the graphics and the whole design are simply gorgeous, but a good game is more than that. It&apos;s a feast of colour and shape, compared to the sterile desolateness of Half-Life 2, but it fails to grip you as much. Hence, a 7/10 for a game that is severely over-hyped by the &apos;official&apos; reviewers who really should know better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=401485">Expand</a></span>

With that mean, you can go all Dark Side on your enemies by shooting lightning out of your hands. See what I&apos;m getting at?<br><br>Graphically, the graphics were great for when it released: Beautiful water effects, among them. But, I don&apos;t care about graphics, so no further comment there.<br><br>Gameplay wise, the game is cool:<br>You get some nice &quot;Tools&quot; to play with, and quite some genetic powers to toy with, so you&apos;ll be in for a treat. Each weapon can be modified. I&apos;m saying this becaus it mostly has pretty outcomes for your guns.<br>Now, besides fine gunplay, the gameplay, is quite bad.<br>Even on hard, the game is terribly easy, not punishing you for dying; only reviving you at some station.<br>In System Shock 2(Sorry for this), you really lost money; something that could hurt you in the game(because money was used to hack stuff to, and repair things, etc..&gt;).<br>Also something that lacks gameplaywise, is some depth. No, there&apos;s nothing wrong with mindless shooters, I enjoy them a lot, but BioShock was not intended to be a mindless shooter, it was clearly intended as a game with deep gameplay. The thing that made System Shock 2 so great, besides a good story, was the incredibly deep gameplay, being able to replay the game multiple times, and get a  quite different experience. BioShock doesn&apos;t have that.<br><br>Storywise, people who have played System Shock 2 will know it. I won&apos;t spoil anything, but it&apos;s great, and awesome. But, as with all stories; it&apos;ll be fresh for only one time.<br><br>Now, after you read this, dont assume that BioShock&apos;s a bad game. It&apos;s not. It is bad for what it had to live up to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=1969491">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I understand why people like this game. But to me is seems like a bit of a goofy mess. The setting and enemies are hard to take seriously if you think about it for 30 seconds, which makes being scared or creeped out almost impossible. Rather than being visceral as one would expect from horror game most of the combat feels like it&apos;s lifted from an arcade shooter. The Ayn Rand philosophy that pervades the story is pretty anvilicious. Sometimes I think it&apos;s a parody of games that try to shoehorn in &quot;deep&quot; subtext. Most of the time I think it&apos;s just an egregious example of pretentious twaddle. The story is mostly dull and forgettable. I literally can&apos;t think of a single characters name at this time or remember a single thing about them or what they did.
<br>
<br>About the only thing I really liked about it was the twist that explains all the things your character does that make no sense. I&apos;m trying to avoid a spoiler here but my point is there&apos;s a bit of story near the end that works as part of the narrative, AND gets weirdly meta. It&apos;s glorious. I suppose the graphics deserve mention too. They were obviously a labor of love. They are detailed and at time haunting. I find the cartoonish character style absolutely horrid however.
<br>
<br>I wanted to love this game, but even though Rapture is buried deep beneath the waves Bioshock is disappointingly shallow. I guess if you&apos;re young and never played the games this is a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to you might find some value in it. But if your a fan of Looking Glass Studios type of game this will seem like a dull echo of their greatness.
<br>
<br>I gave this game a 6 because it obviously has high production values. But overall it basically defines average. There wasn&apos;t really anything new here. Every good mechanic was borrowed from previous work in the field.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2850052">Expand</a></span>

It suffers from game mechanics which break the suspension of disbelief regulary. Looks beautiful but the awe wears thin pretty quick, ultimately suffers from the Doom3 - everything looks plastic syndrome. NOT better than Stalker, Crysis or the HL2 series.</span>

On top of this, although this is not necessarily a good indicator of a good game, i could not find a single flaw with bioshock. One part in which i did get stuck, did not put me off - i played it again and again, looking around for the code for the next level, and never got bored.

<br>
<br>There is no atmosphere or charm whatsoever, it starts out like a survival horror, and I liked that, but that feeling goes away very quickly. Then it feels like a grey post apocalyptic world that I&apos;ve seen many times in other games. The city of Rapture is boring. The lack of music also brings down the atmosphere.
<br>
<br>The plot is intriguing, and I wanted to know more about what the hell happened, but the characters are just so dull, I never felt any emotional connection to anyone. The character you play doesn&apos;t speak, it&apos;s like I&apos;m controlling a robot or something, so I just don&apos;t care about him, I don&apos;t even know his name.
<br>
<br>The graphics are nice, with plenty of detail, but everything is so grey that it doesn&apos;t matter.
<br>
<br>Also this game doesn&apos;t like Windows 7 64 bits, I had plenty of problems before I could play this game decently.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is ok, you have many weapons and plasmids, and you shoot people. But the enemies repeat a lot, and they aren&apos;t that much fun to fight. The hacking minigames are pointless and annoying, the upgrades and rpg elements are not very interesting.
<br>

                                        <span>Honestly didn&apos;t get the hype about this game. Don&apos;t get me wrong I enjoyed the story and the setting but the gameplay and overall experience just didn&apos;t cut it for me. I didn&apos;t think it was bad, far from it, but it&apos;s nowhere near as good as the critics make it out to be.The ending is especially bad.</span>

Through the eyes of Jack, a dystopian society of greed and corruption is seen underwater. Is man truly innocent and can their crimes be washed away? Such sophisticated question was never asked before in a game, and &quot;Bioshock&quot; answers the prompt back with such epicness and horror, I HAD to give it a 10.
