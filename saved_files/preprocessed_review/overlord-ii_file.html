Having the same ups; fairly straightforward, lots of stuff for completionists, evil fun, and generic childish jokes. This recipee for the first one was a great success but got rather repetative quickly and I stopped playing it. Overlord 2 on the other hand has done away with alot of the boring repatition. You may use the same means to getting the goal (IE possession) but everytime its abit different. Stealth, aggressive, puzzles. This has left me playing this game for hours on end and wanting more. You can really tell how the developers have matured from there previous game and really put something great out. This RPG adventure game is well suited for those that would enjoy some evil humor, single player campaign, and lite puzzle solving.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/overlord-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=425869">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t install it from steam, get it from a differen&apos;t site. I got mine from gamershell and it worked fine after the appauling steam demo. James</span>

They still will if you tell them to though. As for the gameplay, it has been massively improved. Sadly the spell system is pretty much gone, but in return you can do so much more with minions that you&apos;ll hardly even notice. The evil tower is bigger than ever, you can have more mistresses and there are a lot of clever puzzles. The only downside is that it makes me greedy as a player. Next time I expect more tower customization, more enslavement options and more things to toy with like putting statues of myself everywhere and turning the captured towns a little less bright.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/overlord-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5385508">Expand</a></span>

The gorgeous environments make you feel like you&apos;re on vacation--so nice after all the brown/gray settings of most games. Yeah, the minions could be easier to control., but that actually plays into their nature, and occasional accidental minion death seems appropriate. Reviewers saying it&apos;s more of the same are full of it. The game&apos;s been taken to the next level in just about every aspect. Just exploring your own castle environment is terrific fun because it&apos;s been so creatively expanded. The wolf-riding minions, the siege engines, the battle mechanics, and the organized armies you fight are further examples. These same reviewers drool over all those WWII shooters, and you&apos;d have a hard time telling them apart from EACH OTHER much less see the difference between installments within the same series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/overlord-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=425694">Expand</a></span>

Controlling the minions is great fun, with the exception of the spider temple level which made me want to break the game in two.  If I were you, I&apos;d go get the first game as well because both are easily worth the cheap price you&apos;ll find them for today.</span>

There are some great element to this game, and some really terrible. The humour in the game is not as good as the &quot;professional&quot; reviewers suggest, unless you are very easily amused. Nor is the game by any stretch deep, it is a terribly linear experience with quite monotonous quests.<br>The game featured roughly 5 spells to choose from, only one of which was of any use killing things, it was very disappointing to say the least.<br>Similarly the animations are horrendously few, there are 3 moves that you can do as the overlord, no combos and nothing exciting, just smash, smash, bigger smash.<br><br>The storyline was a bit lean, very shallow and unengaging. The ending was very dissatisfactory, a game like this is by no means worthy of such a lousy ending.<br><br>The worst things is however the control and camera, you are stuck with xbox/ps3 controls on the PC, which is completely unacceptable. The focus key serves no purpose on a PC, it would&apos;ve been much better to use the mouse. The camera is locked in an xbox fashion, which is okay, but not preferable on a PC. I was not very surprised to see this very mediocre port, since it is a growing issue in the gaming industry.<br><br><br>Among the better things is the graphics, which runs very well, I experience no lag whatsoever and it still looks neat. The game is also very stable, I did not experience a single crash whatsoever.<br>The game is lengthy relative to its price, and is absolutely worth purchasing at its current price.<br>The game gave me 16 quite enjoyable hours of game play, which surpasses that of which mass effect 2 and bioshock 2 were able to provide.<br><br>In conclusion. This game is worth buying, but don&apos;t expect miracles and be very patient with its flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/overlord-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1400184">Expand</a></span>

They really make an otherwise weak game a bit of fun. *The aesthetics of the environments, including the Dark Tower are really well down. It&apos;s nice how the tower improves as you move along in your Overlording. *Music is good. Cons: *A lot of the controls and game play suck. The &quot;sweep&quot; command in the PC version, at least, is seriously, seriously flawed and makes for A LOT of frustration when things don&apos;t work as expected. This is a really awful flaw that takes the game from being fun and challenging to needlessly irritating. This combined with the inability to save as you go (only at spottily available spots) makes for a lot of wasted time and anger. *Bugs such as walking to close to an NPC and seeing his or her hair and eyeballs floating in front of you are rather stupid, but not so distracting. *Enslaved peasants and plebs follow you to the point of blocking your way. *Other than those two serious flaws the game is pretty fun. Just the usual amount of misogyny, homophobia, and racism that are in games made for psychosexually/sociologically retarded fanboys for psychosexually/sociologically retarded fan boys. Those with a brain could still enjoy the game while laughing AT the designers and the intended audience and rolling your eyes a lot. Well you could if the game was playable. Full of typical trite stereotypes such as environmentalists are gay, women are powerless whores and sex objects waiting for the man to come save them so they can be a spoiled mistress, and fat people are evil and funny at the time (how original!!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/overlord-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=84278">Expand</a></span>

Let me summarize what you should expect. If you think this does not bother you, go ahead.<br><br><br>||-&gt; The controls are awful. After sending minions or sweeping them, the games sometimes does not recognize that you stopped pressing the mouse buttons. So the camera follows the minions (if you&apos;re lucky! Sometimes the camera just faces a wall) and the recall buttons does not work. This can easily kill you or your minions. Those flawed controls made me sometimes loose over 30 minutes of playing (because I like to explore a lot), and you can only save at check points(!).<br><br>||-&gt; While the cursor moves precisely on the interface, the focus is not always on the item you&apos;re pointing at. Double-clicking sometimes works, but sometimes you choose the wrong item. Also, there are no tool tips.<br><br>||-&gt; Overlord 1 had a really nice black humorous charm. DO NOT expect the same in Overlord 2. The new Overlord IS EVIL. You cannot be a good-natured evil ruler anymore. Also, don&apos;t expect funny stereotypes like a gluttonous halfling or an arrogant paladin. The characters in Overlord 2 are embarrassing at best (gay elven stoners) and flat as they come. The story, and especially the ending, is an insult to the audience.<br><br>||-&gt; As in Overlord 1, you can forge items, but unfortunately now the recipes are fixed. Also, the game tells you how many resources you need to forge it, but completely omits info on how much damage the weapon does or how much protection the new armor gives you. This is especially annoying, because there is no arena anymore, where you could test your gear, or farm new life force. Since the powerful items also need &quot;Dark crystals&quot; (which is a finite resource), you cannot really experiment with your equipment anymore. Same goes for minion upgrades. Maybe it was in the manual (which I did not read, of course), but apart from &quot;Your minions are now stronger&quot; I found no info on what they do.<br><br>||-&gt; Well, and there are lots of frustrating rough edges. If you let your minions carry two items at once, they might get stuck and trap you in a dead end. In the missions where you have to kill/subdue all 100 villagers, they might get stuck in their houses. In one of these missions, some of the villagers are hostile (and placed among other enemies) making it _very_ hard to subdue them. After a cut-scene, the game tends to place you and your minions in the worst possible spot, even if you were somewhere safe before. Sometimes your minions attack an enemy, but don&apos;t actually hit it (you can see this with barrels) and consequently get slaughtered. This is very annoying if you had to sweep mounted minions to take out an officer who was out of your reach. Or stupid things like: as soon as you get mounts for the reds which allow them to move AND shoot, you have to fight against a new kind of archers who ALWAYS hit their target, even if it moves, completely defeating the new ability of your reds.<br><br><br>I decided to finish the game to keep my future self from trying again in a couple of months. But I can tell you now that if you started playing and at some point have to force yourself to continue playing: don&apos;t. The game is not for you, and it does not get better towards the end. On the other hand, if you don&apos;t mind the above, Overlord 2 is a nice sequel with improved graphics (though I preferred the cartoon look of Overlord 1) and a bunch of nice new ideas, like mounts, catapults, boats, and being able to possess your minions. A a few of the jokes are actually really hilarious.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/overlord-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1394706">Expand</a></span>

As for the game itself, if you liked the first one then you will like part two. Just don&apos;t expect much in terms of new game play. I think IGN may have been the only review site that actually played the game and their critique is dead on. All the new features are solely superficial and none of the old problems of the first game have been address. In addition to these problems the game also lacks depths, content, and polish. It feels very rushed and unfinished as though the developers where under some unrealistic deadlines. A shame since at its core Overlord is a great concept with very high potential. I just wish Triumph Studios gave this title the love and attention it deserves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/overlord-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=425702">Expand</a></span>

Humorous, hilarious even at times, very well voiced, excellent music (alas not too many tracks).  Gameplay is very dynamic for the most part, but somewhat short (i finished the game in 20 hours) - a heavy hand is felt tremendously when in order to keep you playing you are asked to kill 100 villagers (to control a town or something), a process which has no effect on the game, the main quest, or your character.
<br>One thing i found frustrating is the length of each quest and lack of save-anywhere feature; so you might be struggling with a level for half an hour, then coming upon a new enemy, die - and end up rerunning the level for another half an hour.  Very tedious.  And keep in mind - without level reruns (which i did plenty) the game time would be less than 20 hours.
<br>Mistresses also feel superfluous and heavy-handed - although, paradoxically, they add to the atmosphere of the dungeon.
<br>Some minor control bugs, especially camera views.
<br>Otherwise - a solid fun game.  I listed the negatives, because the positives are outlined by others.  Overall, i enjoy the game quite a lot!

<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>It has &quot;improved&quot; very little,
<br>Arena is on disc DLC
<br>Game is very short 6-7 hours at best
<br>Customization both of the overlord and the tower has gone down.The overlord has one upgrade in the towers.you can&apos;t no longer forge your own custom armor,but you have recipes to specific items.
<br>Story is not good,it feels just rushed.
<br>Minion A.I is still bugged.
<br>There&apos;s a lot less exploration
<br>Annoying puzzles
<br>Mounts are just used for a puzzle segment then they are useless.
<br>The roman theme is a good concept with a bad execution.
<br>Magic System has been dumbed down and useless,also you have 3 spells when in Overlord 1 there were 12 spells.
<br>
<br>Like i&apos;ve already said,this game feels more like an expansion instead of a full game because there&apos;s no major gameplay element or feature,like they were developing the game and at some points cut it down and sent it to release.
<br>It&apos;s a dissapointment after that masterpiece of Overlord + Raising hell
<br>
<br>Now it&apos;s even worse,The next game is going to be a Diablo clone</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/overlord-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5437622">Expand</a></span>
