I have to disagree about puzzle directions being fixed, though; a few puzzles took one attempt (which counts against you) to determine some of the rules or behaviors. (I&apos;m looking at you, electron puzzle and rock-throwing puzzle.) Toward the end of the game, the occasional typo or lack of clarity in puzzle directions and hints left me wondering if some puzzles had gotten the rush job on the editorial process.  And at least one puzzle was downright frustrating to me, even after seeing all hints (*cough* racoons *cough*), and that&apos;s one too many to unreservedly recommend a puzzle game to friends (or be certain I&apos;d buy another sequel unless the issues are specifically addressed).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-agent-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2086478">Expand</a></span>

The story starts off promising amid the same creepy atmosphere as before but then descend about half way through into weirdness and silliness. The ending is atrocious from any point of view.  The original game wasn&apos;t perfect but it at least had the benefit of feeling crafted. The sequel feels rushed and more about exploiting art assets rather than any love for game play. The only thing that is really a positive is that the old characters (and some new ones) possess their own vibrant personalties. If you played the original game there is enough here to draw you in to see how the story ends and then by the end you wished you hadn&apos;t. The two games had potential and it&apos;s unfortunate that Telltale dropped the ball.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-agent-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2077368">Expand</a></span>

The major downside, however, is that this game is easier than the first. Even the game&apos;s hardest puzzles only took maybe 5-10 minutes. A few puzzles might be more difficult for people with no background in math... something to consider. The story continues from the first and I thought it was decent, but it&apos;s more plot-driven and loses some of its charm in the rush.
<br>
<br>If you were able to stomach Puzzle Agent 1, then this will be a welcome improvement. If you&apos;re a fan of puzzles, this isn&apos;t as good as the Layton games, but it&apos;s cheaper and still fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-agent-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2781625">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story is a bit difficult to follow at times but i was still able to like it due to the quirky characters and atmosphere. The design of it all is quite likable.
<br>Is it enough to save the game? Barely. In the end it looks like it tried to be like the Professor Layton series but it doesn&apos;t even come close due to not having it&apos;s originality in puzzles.
<br>A shame. But as i said, i still enjoyed myself enough not to hate it. I even enjoyed it a little more than the first Puzzel Agent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-agent-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3615773">Expand</a></span>
