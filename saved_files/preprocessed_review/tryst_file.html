<br>some polish are needed here and there. also there are only few  multi-player maps hope they will release some more maps with DLC.</span>

WHAT THE HECK!( and you only start at 10?) and you can only have 100 STUFF MAX! and some things take up more units spaces then others! the maps suck, but they did make it so there were capturable things on the map, so that kinda helped its rating. but as the humans, you can only build 12 units! that is the selection you get! and the buildings are way too small! so you build like a 30 foot mech from a 10 foot building! the building that makes the unit is actually smaller then the things it builds? What is up with that? and, the worst part is, THAT IT WASTED ITS POTENTIAL! i actually thought the story was pretty good. you know, how that valuable mineral was found, and they are using it to reboot the economy! that sounds cool! then they smack in the face with this awful game? how did it get past the testing? and it seems like a starcraft ripoff, and that game sucks too! so the found a bad game, and ripped it off by making it even worse! why did they do that? and they could have had a mode like maybe... mother load! there would be some mega mining machine in the middle that you want to capture it so you can get boatloads of resources and over produce your opponents! but noooooooooo, you get this bad game! so because the game has a good story line, and its customization is good (because there is nothing to compare it too) a i feel this game gets a 4 out of ten. it is a below average. if you want to buy this game, wait until tryst 2 comes out. maybe it will fix the problems it has. so for the money for this game, unless the price lowers to say, $7, the money would be better off getting something else. maybe like a BOOK</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tryst/user-reviews?user_review_id=2785267">Expand</a></span>
