No small feat. What they have accomplished has been nothing short of incredible. Not only is the game more fun and more accessible to new players than the first game was, but their source code &amp; tools come with the game, so ANYONE can make their own mods in a simple scripting language called Lua. Teamplay is encouraged by the game mechanics themselves, which forces players to play together, encouraging a friendly vibrant community. With the community&apos;s backing, the amazing game and technology you get for such a low price, this might just make NS2 one of the most important games of recent times. Not just for how amazingly fun the actual gameplay is, but for what it could mean for Modders and total conversions in the future. This game might just spawn the next Dota. A truly spectacular achievement for such a small company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2720726">Expand</a></span>

It manages to mix RTS and FPS, which alone is ridiculous, but it also has two completely different sides that are both a ton of fun to play... and it&apos;s balanced! Holy cow. The graphics are amazing and climbing on walls as aliens or flying around or teleporting is tons of fun. Easily one of the greatest multiplayer games since the original Natural Selection.</span>

Aliens are so fun I enjoy the Fade going to the speed of light is a great escape move when I found myself in trouble. Marines jet packs and Exos is also fun to play. Been playing for 8hrs straight and enjoy every minute. NS2 developers added a great feature too called Mods. Mods in a server can change the game play with endless possibilities, like for example, Marines vs Marines or Aliens vs Aliens and so on. The game has great replay and with new MODS ideas making this game have so many possibilities of game play.  I am tired of these AAA game developing companies that bring poor content with a huge price behind it, unknownworlds is indie company not even close to AAA level, but they made a great game with half the cost. highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2722853">Expand</a></span>

My only issue is the game&apos;s crosshairs, but I tend to dislike most game&apos;s crosshairs, and this game is moddable enough to allow for custom crosshairs to be out.

<br>Also, if you&apos;re a fan of the classic NS, people have already begun releasing more classic NS Maps, as well as a Combat Mode mod.</span>

At gameplays&apos; wise, designs&apos; wise, the game is almost flawless. I remember me complaining about making so stupidly bad game at the early stage of Natural Selection 2, when the game had nothing but just lag without reason. Now it has become to a game, which has great potential being so popular and famous, and be one of the best title of the game history(already as a user count it&apos;s hugh). But still the problem is optimization and animation. As the dev team seem to have great success now(6k players), i&apos;d like to see much more improved animations and flawless optimization. Then they will surely keep maintaining those 6k online players, and even grow.. Ah and again, the color of the game is just so aesthetic. Regardless of some animation issues, this game must have also one of the greatest eye candy. Definately one of the best looking game without being so realistic as a reality like Crysis or Battlefield 3. Anyway congratulations Unknownworlds and Charlie and others. You are genius.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2722301">Expand</a></span>

<br>For me, this game is an extremely impressive feat, and a game I will be playing for a very long time.  It&apos;s a fun team-based shooter that seems like a horrible gimic at first, but reveals itself to be an incredibly deep strategic game.  The gameplay is wonderful and fresh.  The aliens are fast and fun to play and have a variety of unique abilities, especially the fade with its ability to blink across the map at incredible speeds and slash down marines with its scythe-like arms.  The marines are quite enjoyable as well, with their well designed weapons and tools.  Mixing an RTS and a shooter doesn&apos;t sound like it would work at first, but is incredibly well implemented, with obvious care from the developers that really took care to make into solid game mechanic, rather than a horribly implemented gimic tacked on to a generic shooter.
<br>
<br>The graphics are very impressive for an indie game, holding up quite well compared to even AAA titles, and are a surprisingly colorful getaway from the mottled grey-brown of modern military shooters.  For the most part, the animations are very fluid and nice to look at, and the game feels very smooth in general.  The game has an immense replayability as well, not only for its incredible mod support.  Though there are only five, the maps are very large and conducive to a large number of strategies, and the random spawn points for each team add a great variety.  What really impresses me is the game&apos;s ability to constantly surpise you with new things, even after playing for a while.  The game naturally opens up to you piece by piece as you play, far more preferable to me than the standard &quot;level-up&quot; progression system.  You start as a simple unit following the commanders orders, and eventually become experienced enough to dominate the field with a jetpack and shotgun as a marine or a fade as an alien.  Once you realize the nuances of the strategy, you can assume the position of the commander and lead your entire team.
<br>
<br>Above all, what I really respect about this game is the fact that it dared to deviate from the endless stream of modern shooters.  The developers made it as a multiplayer game, and didn&apos;t waste resources tacking on an unnecessary campaign just to raise the price.  They refused to add ironsights so the gameplay would be better, and didn&apos;t try to become a &quot;me too&quot; shooter.  Unknown Worlds made an ambitious game with a clear identity and a clear purpose, and after almost six years of beta development they clearly care about their game.  This game is a perfect example of quality over quantity.  Hopefully Natural Selection 2 will set an example for shooter developers in the future. All in all, a highly recommended game that you can enjoy for a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2722439">Expand</a></span>

The Unknown Worlds Entertainment is so good to their community, the community is so good to them and new players, the steps they made to make this game is incredible it feels like a multimillion dollar game title but it was only made by a group of 7 and help from the community. If you&apos;re tired of the same old Call of Duty copy and paste from year to year, you can buy two copies of NS2 for you and a friend for less than 1 copy of Call of Duty Black Ops 2, and I guarantee you&apos;re going to have way more fun, especially if you enjoyed AVP, NS2 blows both out of the water.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2721086">Expand</a></span>

FPS/RTS design forces cooperation in order to improve your own loadout as well as others.  Your play is not completely dictated by the Commander as each person has personal resources to buy weapons with once they have been.  Excellent gaming community which discourages trolls.   Graphics are good and fast spawns, high movement speed and teleportation buildings make for low downtime.  That said there is a high learning curve and the maps are complex especially the ventilation system used by the alien side.  Can be unforgiving and cause you to lose your heavy weapons quickly.  If you play games to become GOOD, don&apos;t mind working with a team towards team based goals and not just to get high K/D and unlock awards then this game is a must.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2721407">Expand</a></span>

The shooting mechanics are more fun than any modern military shooter out there, and playing as an alien is a refreshing ton of fun.  The strategy element is amazing if you are into RTS, because you have to use voice communication to be an effective commander.</span>

Sure there are other games that are Hybrid RTS/FPS, but they don&apos;t offer the same level of quality and depth. The game is simple, but offers a lot of strategy and each game feels different. Playing as a gorge (combat engineer), skulk (sneaky fighter), fade (quick medium assault fighter), lerk (combat support), or onos (siege and heavy combat) on the alien side all feel different. Playing as a marine or exo-suit (GOLIATH ONLINE) are fun experiences. If you enjoy team game play, you&apos;ll love Natural Selection 2 since each role benefits the team in a unique way.
<br>
<br>Natural Selection 2 is basically a delicious cheap wine that will only taste better as it ages. For $25, this game is already a bargain and the developers have committed themselves to improving it post-release. Additionally, mods can provide additional content for no cost to the purchaser.
<br>
<br>There are a few issues that need work including networking and performance. If it were a $40 or $60 game I might be a bit more strict on the performance of the engine. The developers have committed themselves to improving performance after release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2725883">Expand</a></span>

The most important thing to understand about this game is that everything was made by a handful of dedicated people with an ENORMOUS modding community behind their back every step of the way. New content will be continuously released (including combat mode from ns1) on a monthly/weekly basis including: maps, models and skins, game types, etc.
<br>As with any mixed-genre game, getting a grasp of ns2 can be a challenge. Marines/aliens with sub-par FPS skills will be worse off than the counter-strike gods, and commanders that breathe Red Alert will be tactical masters in just a few games. There is variety of playing styles to suit you, whether its being a scout for your team to warn of incoming threats/enemy positions, supporting by building or protecting valuable ground, or endlessly assaulting the enemy base, you can sink hours at a time into this game without even knowing you&apos;ve killed half of your free day.
<br>Sadly, as with most online games (mostly the PC versions), teamwork is a HEAVY requirement. For some people this may make the game, for others it will break it, but regardless playing with friends and communicating with your team is HIGHLY ENCOURAGED. Remember, you could easily kill a few marines and look cool, or you could strategically kill the power and prevent many more from spawning.
<br>Now for the reason it can&apos;t be a 10, and maybe never will be... Latency scripting. No matter how &apos;professional&apos; or &apos;godlike&apos; or &apos;stronk&apos; you may be, having a ping above 100 will ALMOST ALWAYS ruin your gameplay. You might hear things like &quot;wall hacker&quot; and &quot;godmode&quot; and such, when in reality you&apos;re shooting 2 feet behind the skulk lagging like a b*tch, or biting where the marine was nearly a second ago. Sure, your damage drawer might shot -420 on a skulk, but that guy dodged every shot on his screen, and he happened to roll a 6 this time around while you got a 5. For this, all I can say is to bear with UWE until they can polish their coding. Until then, for everyone&apos;s sake, don&apos;t join a server if your ping is gnarly.
<br>Anywho, if you played the first NS, you owe it to yourself (and possibly your childhood) to buy this game. Great remix of classic NS1, with a few additional key elements to balance it out once and for all, as well as some added quirks, tech tree elements, and skills.
<br>
<br>P.S. currently $10 on steam until 1/7/13</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2878105">Expand</a></span>

Only the huge hardware hungry engine is what feels unplaced in this genre but the netcode feels so right. I guess they will fix the performance in the future.</span>

While game engine is not some sort of DX11 monster like Frostbite 2 or CryEngine 3 I can tell for sure, infestation animation is the best visual effect I saw this year on PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2852447">Expand</a></span>

And the lag is not as bad as it used to, i have a stable 50-40 fps now all the time, except i massive battles ofc. But otherwise it runs pretty smooth. It&apos;s only 22 euro on steam so you should go out and buy it!

If you do go out and buy it the game is pretty balanced, but aliens are not like most FPS so it may feel like they are horribly unbalanced. Marines play pretty straightforward FPS style. While aliens starting form is very squishy melee attacker. This means in a shootout you will always lose. But if you learn to jump around when fighting, and hide in good locations (since you can cling to walls/ceilings) you can usually start the fight up close, which is where the aliens do well. The game is basically a tug of war / map control game where you try to take control of resources on the map and hold them while taking/disrupting the enemy. Resources allow your team to generate more powerful weapons and equipment for marines, or more advanced lifeforms and upgrades for aliens. The ultimate goal is to push the other team off of the map.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2812108">Expand</a></span>

This game blends RTS and FPS flawlessly, better than any other game I&apos;ve seen to date. The game is of course full-on multiplayer, as many games are leaning toward now. The game favors the fast-twitch style gunplay of CS: Source, GO, etc. while the Real-time strategy aspect caters to all kinds of playstyles, be it turtling, rushing, or aggressive expansion. The commander makes or breaks the team, which is where this review comes to a mid-point on the goodness. If you get a commander that is New, Uncooperative, or just plain bad, you are at a very serious disadvantage, which makes the learning curve of beginning Comms steeeeeeeeeeep. The players are usually very helpful in pointing new folks in the right direction, leading me to believe that the community of this game is one of the best I&apos;ve seen or been a part of. This game is revolutionary and deserves more recognition than it&apos;s gotten thus far. Its beauty, brains, and brawn all outweigh the small aspects that bring it down from a perfect 10. Get this game, if you&apos;re a FPS OR RTS fan, you won&apos;t be disappointed, which isn&apos;t something you can say often.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2807474">Expand</a></span>

I have always been a big fan of the RTS and FPS, and having that freedom to switch between what is essentially two different games as commander or grunt is incredible. Have it be known that this game is by no means easy. A sense of team-building being absolutely necessary really starts to dawn on you as you begin to figure out the game.

It is stongly tied on a teamwork, good commander can do the match, and weak one fails it at the start. So don&apos;t try to jump to the console if you don&apos;t know what to do.</span>

It reminds me a lot of other team based first person shooters (such are Team Fortress) where you can pick from different roles and get an entirely different game play experiences. This is especially nice if you&apos;re having an off day in one aspect of the game, just jump to something else. It&apos;s also a little bit arcadey in that there&apos;s not precise aiming. I keep trying to pull up the cross hairs to score head-shots, forgetting that it&apos;s just not that kind of game. With so much going on, you really need to spend time honing skills before moving on. Trying to be a jack of all trades too early and you&apos;ll stink at everything indefinitely. Instead, practicing with the basic marine and skulk first is a good way to get a firm understanding of what&apos;s going on in a way that&apos;s always going to be helpful to your teammates because: You are heavily reliant on teammates. A good commander or a good team can overcome deficiencies in other areas. Inversely, strong deficiencies can tank a whole team. Doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re the best FPS in the world. Without upgrades and backup, your skills will be moot against  the enemy.  It&apos;s this that makes it truly a team game. When you win, it feels like everything aligned and you were part of some hand-picked dream team. When you lose, it&apos;s fun too, but for different reasons.I&apos;d highly recommend it if you&apos;ve enjoyed similar team games. One odd side point: the RTS part of this game tends to draw out the Star Craft nerds while the FPS tends to draw out COD jocks. It&apos;s a strangely diverse gaming environment (especially when people start getting upset). Reminds me of high school.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2947297">Expand</a></span>

The community desperately needs more players, who are turned away by the combination of toxic experience of being pubstomped by the pros and being berated by them.  The lack of matchmaking prevents this from becoming a more widely appreciated title. A diamond in the rough.</span>

<br>There are some quirks with balance and such. For example, one side might be able to get a cheesey snipe on important buildings in some areas. Its a multiplayer only game, so success and fun games rely on the competence of players and how well they work together.  Speaking of which, the community is super friendly despite the troll era every other game and website is undergoing.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played this for over a hundred hours. Never gets old, despite pretty repetitive maps. I do wish, though, that there were some cooler things like sealing off vents. Maybe if they had a spaceship scenario ala Warcraft 3&apos;s &apos;Parasite&apos; where engines, life support, and power can be shut down. That would be a really cool role-play environment.
<br>
<br>The RTS element works pretty well, but it takes time to learn and if you do it wrong or in a way people don&apos;t like you get a lot of backlash. The success of the marine commander depends so much on his marines that it almost makes the aliens, who don&apos;t, imbalanced. But that adds to the onslaught/zerg nature of the aliens.
<br>
<br>All in all, its a really good game and its certainly worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2958026">Expand</a></span>

With its asymmetrical combat (Aliens vs Marines), transformative maps (alien infestation), and its combination of real-time strategy elements with that of a traditional first person shooter it offers an unique gameplay experience that very few if any other FPS titles can.
<br>
<br>Real-Time Strategy Gameplay: One player on each team takes on the role of the commander building bases, researching upgrades, using abilities on his allies, and coordinating his team&apos;s movements/strategies from an overhead real-time strategy point of view.
<br>
<br>Traditional FPS Gameplay: The other players are playing from the standard first person view with respawns coming ~8 seconds after death (so downtime is minimal). The gameplay consists of securing resource points around the map for both their personal resource income (so they can buy weapons/upgrades) and for their team (so the commander can build/research things). The ultimate goal: Destroy the other team&apos;s &quot;headquarters.&quot;
<br>
<br>The Marines have the familiar weaponry at their disposal. Shotguns, assault rifles, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, jetpacks, and giant mechs. Teamwork is of utmost importance and death awaits you around every corner (especially when the power goes out  hope you brought your flashlight!)
<br>
<br>The Aliens rely on speed, stealth, and ambush attacks. Their alien lifeforms vary greatly (to suit anyones&apos; playstyle) and their ability to see in the dark, walk on walls/ceilings or even fly, as well as the ability to take shortcuts through vent systems gives them distinctive advantages over marines in many areas of the map.
<br>
<br>Both sides are fun to play and both require teamwork and skill to achieve victory. Keyword being skill. You are rewarded for good aim, situational awareness, and teamwork more than most shooters. If you lack these you will die.
<br>
<br>But, thats part of the fun and replayability of this game. Seeing yourself improve with each and every match and then having your efforts pay off as you start getting kills that you couldn&apos;t when you first started playing. It makes for good competitive play if that is your thing or just good ole&apos; fashion shoot-em-up in the standard public servers.
<br>
<br>Note: There is no single player mode. If you don&apos;t like playing against other players then you should skip this title. Multiplayer matches typically last 15-30 mins.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3074656">Expand</a></span>

<br>NS2 is a fantastic blend of FPS/RTS and this mixture makes for unique gameplay you wont see anywhere else. The developers &apos;Unknown Worlds&apos; are progressively supporting their title and have introduced a great many fixes and changes to ensure it makes an impression. I am particularly impressed with their level design, which offers a diversity that both parties (Marines/Aliens) can adapt to and use to turn the tide of a match.
<br>
<br>I have seen previous negative reviews with regards to the battles in NS2 and for the most part, they&apos;re biased. I have seen both Marines and Alien parties coordinate with one another to create strategies that ultimately win the match. Such as aliens running in packs of 3, focusing power nodes (very important power supply) to harass Marines or Marines splitting in to groups of two to harass two main Alien &apos;bases&apos; to split the opposition up.
<br>
<br>NS2 is a breath of fresh air and with the way the developers are backing this game, I would suggest that anyone remotely interested give it a try, it will only get better and that&apos;s not mentioning how mod friendly it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2916827">Expand</a></span>

Updates are weekly and the game play is unrivaled, with just over 100 hours in game, I would have given it 10 if my progress was stored and accessible somewhere. Fun, exciting, scary and so addictive.</span>

Right up there with StarCraft as one of the best multiplayer RTS games. Make no mistake about it, all but one player on each side uses a FPS point of view, but this is still a strategy game. You win by teamwork, skill and strategy  not by FPS skill alone. As an RTS player playing on a decent team, there is a really enjoyable sense of teamwork, aside from the fun FPS elements and the fact the game looks great. As a commander (someone commanding their team, who uses the RTS view of things) you&apos;ll spend much of your time issuing orders to your team via voice chat. With a team that has any understanding of strategy (and most do), this almost completely eliminates micromanagement for you, and means you can spend your time developing map control, thinking strategy, and issuing orders like &quot;PlayerOne, harass BaseName. Try to pull as many of them over there to defend it as you can. Everyone else, group up, wait in LocationOne. When you see them move to BaseName to defend it, hit Base2.&quot;. Trying to do that in a traditional RTS would be a lot of micromanagement, but in NS2, its simple. There&apos;s a lot to be said about NS2 as an RTS game, and this barely scratches the surface. The main thing, though, is that if you are a fan of team-based shooters, OR a fan of strategy games, I would urge you to definitely give this a try. The combination of RTS+FPS might seem odd, but it works well. Really well. Amazingly well, in fact.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2959393">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not the easiest game to get into if you haven&apos;t looked at any guides or something beforehand but its unusual gameplay is what makes it worthwhile. The gameplay is pretty fast paced and twitchy. You need to play as a team to succeed. If you try to go lonewolf you will die a lot, and every time you die all upgrades that you&apos;ve paid for with you personal resources are lost, so you really have a strong incentive to stay alive. The game also have mod support so this means community created maps, skins etc all free content which is great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4401189">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m not a massive FPS fan, or a skilled FPS player, but the fact that there are definite strategic elements to this game, means that even if I can&apos;t win a certain fight, I can gain a strategic victory in some way, either by scouting for others, supporting others, building items, or simply slowing the enemy down.
<br>and when a game has a good commander it becomes that much easier and more fun to support your team.
<br>
<br>Marines are fun, but I thoroughly enjoy playing as the aliens, they are very distinctive and each have their own style of play.
<br>The base alien unit, the &quot;Skulk&quot; is by no means the weakest, played properly a single skulk can zip from one side of the map to another, can ambush marines easily, and can quickly close the distance to meelay range against the better armed marines.
<br>
<br>This game has made multiplay FPS&apos;s fun again.
<br>
<br>Things that aren&apos;t great:
<br>
<br>Random teams, is not random, this could be improved so easily.
<br>If no-ones talking then the game becomes much less fun.
<br>The lobby is OK but it could be better, would be nice to have a system for chatting with players outside a specific server.
<br>
<br>A couple more game variations on gameplay would be nice, and maybe some larger &quot;open air&quot; maps would provide some variation.
<br>
<br>Overall this game is a solid 8, and I am being conservative with my rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3132688">Expand</a></span>

I would highly recommend this game to people with a taste in strategy, command, and fight. I&apos;m not sure if the graphics are good, since I had to lower them to improve my computer&apos;s performance, but I&apos;m pretty sure the graphics, fighting (PvP), commanding, and the way strategy plays a significant role makes this game completely awesome.

There is a learning curve to being an alien and thats what I think a lot of people have trouble with mostly. Being a good skulk/lerk/fade is an art, and takes some time to master IMO. There are still some performance optimizations to be made to the game to iron out some stuttering, load time, and framerate issues, but if you have at least a decent mid range PC you shouldn&apos;t have any problem, and the graphics/art are probably the best I know of right now. This is some PC gamer god tier **** a diamond in the rough, and I cant wait to see what Unknown Worlds has in store for the future of this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2743866">Expand</a></span>

Its really a shame that this game is losing players (dont get me wrong, there&apos;s still plenty of people who play - die hards at that). Unknown Worlds really dropped the ball by letting this opportunity slip away. I know people don&apos;t like microtransactions, but that could have kept the studio releasing updates consistently instead of abandoning the game and giving reigns to the community. They&apos;re a great studio with a great game on their hands - Its the most organic tactical gameplay in a team based online shooter. However, considering the asymetrical teams (aliens vs humans) constant patching and balancing is necessary. Its mostly balanced, but there are times when that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case. All in all, the fact remains that I can&apos;t play any other game but NS2. Its that good to me. Precisely why, I&apos;m so dissapointed at the Dev not capitalizing on the opportunity to really make this game big. Unkown Worlds, Please return to NS2! Enable ingame microtransactions so you folks can maintain revenue for bug fixes and new maps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874298">Expand</a></span>

The game seamlessly blends RTS and FPS elements which ends up producing rounds that have isolated, but intense firefights in the beginning, followed by all out team fights later in the rounds. Playing either side, marines or aliens, proves to be balanced and fun given all the different unit customizations the game offers. The game randomizes where the players start in the beginning, which makes for increased replay value since every round plays out differently.
<br>
<br>Having never played the original HL1 mod this game is based off of, I was really impressed by the fact that this game was developed independently. This game has a sort of &quot;old school&quot; feel to it, apparent right from the very moment you start the game with a complete lack of branding before the main menu screen. I think they did a great job at capturing what players want out of a strategy-based FPS game: fast-paced action mixed with intelligent, strategic elements and great replay value. Would be 10 of 10 if they included some sort of way to track your player&apos;s game statistics and compare against others.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2726455">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unlike modern AAA fps shooters the Devs have not &quot;Dumbed down&quot; the game, so it has a refreshing high learning curve, most others miss.
<br>No Pay to win dlc is another +
<br>Game sourcecode is open source and modders have all-ready made some amazing content.
<br>Superb balance, extremely beautiful, runs better then most AAA and the RTS elements are vary fun.</span>

The result is the source engine which is still under heavy development even after the game has shipped, they are working on improving the engine and working on new content (which will be released free and not drip fed in a never ending torrent of pay for DLC) You get the entire source gameplay source code and all the dev tools to create your own maps and mods (gameplay code is LUA).
<br>
<br>The game as it stands on build 228 (version 1.0 on steam) has now had a enough optimisations to dismiss most of the complains the people who only tried it in it&apos;s beta (which was a true beta and not a PR demo) and the servers can now support full populations for long term play with lots and lots of building and with no framedrops.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay it&apos;s a fantastic asymmetric mix of ranged and melee combat and a fusion of RTS and FPS combat for the most part works really well, overall each team is directed by a commander in RTS style and the rest of the team are playing an FPS game where weapon unlocks and creature evolutions are researched by the commander.
<br>It&apos;s by far the most original mix of gameplay elements in many years and will appeal to players of most games apart from modern grey millsim games and chest high walls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2732199">Expand</a></span>

The only reason I don&apos;t give it a 10 out of 10 is that sometimes I don&apos;t like how you know you have won or lost a game, but it takes another 20 to 30 minutes for the game to actually end. Still, I highly recommend!</span>

<br>The developer (Uwe) knows how to push all my buttons with NS2.
<br>
<br>It features some of the best and most rewarding team play you can find in any game,  A huge variation in gameplay, almost endless learning curve, the most friendly and enthusiastic community I&apos;ve seen since the desert combat community for bf1942 and shiney graphics with a good sound track as cherry on top.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t fault them for a single thing they did (and I&apos;m a huge cynic, this never happens for me). Just a shortlist of the best things about the game.
<br>-community support dialed up to eleven! Rcon tools, server build for community, open source engine, mod and map support, amazing spectator mode. good quality VOIP in game.  (actually the ONE SINGLE thing I miss in all of this game is demo recording like in quake or half life).
<br>
<br>-Uwe developed their own engine, which produces some incredible lighting well suited to the game, super clean image quality, extremely responsive mouse input (best since half life 1! ). Can&apos;t fault this for anything. It is fairly cpu heavy (but looks the part!) The game runs really well on my pc from 2008.
<br>
<br>-mod support and the sheer quality and variety of the game play ensures this is one of those games you can play for years without it ever getting repetitive or boring. It only costs 23 euros on steam too, almost ridiculously high value.
<br>
<br>-No modern game tropes like ADS, p2p lobbies, DLC map packs that would split up the community, grinding for unlocks or level ups, mouse acceleration, locked frame rates, locked FoV or any of those shenanigans that can sully an otherwise good game.
<br>They did right by the pc gaming community with this game.
<br>
<br>If you like team play, or strategy, or shooters, or feeling like some solid snake/predator hybrid offspring or fun in general then you can&apos;t possibly go wrong buying this.
<br>
<br>A lot of people will give 10 or super low scores on metacritic to influence the average because they think their opinion is worth more than others , but if I were to give NS2 an independant score I&apos;d genuinly give it a 10. It&apos;s the first game since half life 1 that I consider to be truely in its own league.
<br>Imo it re raises the bar for all other multiplayer and pc games to come.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t miss out on this gem fellas, you&apos;d do yourself a huge disservice. The joy and giggles this game brings can&apos;t be overhyped, you will not be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2732756">Expand</a></span>

It has a few issues, particularly technical glitches, but I would say they&apos;re minor, and don&apos;t take away from the main experience.
<br>
<br>--- The game has many ideas that are either new or rare in video games:
<br>
<br>-1- Distinct races, RTS + FPS: Each team has team resources, and each player has personal resources. Each team has one commander that guides the rest of the team. For marines, there is a very direct relationship; the commander places blueprints for buildings (such as resource extractors) that the marines themselves have to build (in first person view). The marine commander also drops medpacks and ammo to help his team during the intense battles, scans cloaked areas for them, and researches new technology that makes the marines fiercer in battle. On the alien side, the relationship is more passive; the commander still directs the team and the expansions to some degree, but there is more autonomy, and there are even some aliens that can build defensive structures using their personal resources. Distinct races are not entirely new (e.g. Starcraft 1/2 had distinct races) in RTS games, but quite rare in FPS games, and even more rare is it being this distinct, yet well balanced and fun.
<br>
<br>-2- Fully dynamic lighting/shadows in a multiplayer game. Marines build power nodes to power their structures and their lights, and aliens can destroy those power nodes. In the dark, the marines can use their flashlights (severely affecting peripheral vision, primarily), and aliens can turn on their own unique vision, which makes the marines and structure easy to see (but makes the environment harder to navigate, because it&apos;s a little harder to recognize in alien vision mode).
<br>
<br>-3- All the game logic/code is available. ALL OF IT! Okay, not the barebones graphics and physics stuff, but everything on top of that is available when you buy the game, and can be modded. So you can make a completely unrelated single player game with it, or add a third race, or whatever. There are already tons of mods for the game, and hopefully more to come. Yes, there are many games that you can mod in some way or another, but it&apos;s very rare that the entire game logic is available with the game, and very rare that modding would have this much support in an indie title.
<br>
<br>--- Biggest issue I&apos;ve seen people have trouble with is framerate... the things is, you are likely to have trouble getting the game to work well until you play with the graphics settings in the game (and there are many). As you change the settings, you can see your FPS change in real time, so at least it&apos;s easy to do once you know. Also, based on prior experience (and so far, true since launch), Unknown Worlds will continue to fix and improve the game, add more maps, optimize performance, etc, so this game has a long lifetime ahead and will only get better with time.
<br>
<br>--- Do yourself a favor and give it a shot. At $25 (that&apos;s less than $0.10 an hour for me at this point), it&apos;s a bargain. Just expect to die a lot at first. :) Stick to your teammates and listen to your commander, and prepare to enjoy the best team game on the market!
<br>
<br>PS: It&apos;s a shame that GameSpot tarnished the game with its review, but at least the review has been pulled since then: http://www.gamespot.com/news/natural-selection-2-review-pulled-6399748
<br>Hopefully MetaCritic will remove that 6/10 critic review and add the new review by GS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2741885">Expand</a></span>

It can be rough for newbies, but its still super fun even when you&apos;re getting your ass handed to you.  I love that this is a game where player skill makes a huge difference, unlike all the run and gun stupidity conquering mainstream FPS games. A pair of good players can totally carry a battle... but a good commander leading a squad of newbies can equally carry a victory.  And the fact that such a small team designed such a great game engine blows my mind!  I just wish all those big budget games would use an engine that looks and plays as smoothly as Unknown Worlds Spark engine.

I love teamwork.  This game rolls these ideas extremely well into one.  I loved the first natural selection and I have very much enjoyed this one.  This game is heavily team work oriented, it isn&apos;t likely that two or three really good players are going to carry a team in a large game.

<br>However,</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I really enjoy real time strategy games, I can certainly enjoy a good first person shooter.  I love teamwork.  This game rolls these ideas extremely well into one.  I loved the first natural selection and I have very much enjoyed this one.  This game is heavily team work oriented, it isn&apos;t likely that two or three really good players are going to carry a team in a large game.
<br>
<br>However, there is an aspect I honestly wish for.  An MMO aspect to this game.  I don&apos;t mean the BS lobby version either.  An MMOFPSRTS game based around this concept would be pretty amazing.  In any case, this game is pretty fantastic.  Counter strike source+starcraft 2 with a healthy dash of team work mechanics.  Delicious.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2728840">Expand</a></span>

Other than that, it&apos;s a spectacular game that looks brilliant no matter what. The learning curve is steeper than many other games I&apos;ve played, but within a day I was able to figure out the game for the most part. To start, I&apos;d pick marines. They&apos;re far more easier to pick up than the Kharaa, who took me an extra couple games to figure out completely. I&apos;m absolutely enthralled with this game, and were it not for the optimization issues it would be a perfect 10 in my book. Excellent gameplay, community, graphics, atmosphere, and easter eggs! Also PROTIP: Get a mic! Makes everything so much easier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2729730">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The learning curve is giant, and it expects you to learn things via youtube videos. Which works, but an actual ingame tutorial works 5000x better. HOWEVER, unlike Gamespot made it out to be, the learning curve is easily learned once you&apos;ve had the chance to play around as the marines and aliens enough. After about 4-5 hours, I&apos;m pretty confident in my ability on either side. Commander is a totally different field though, and you&apos;d have to watch the videos to understand that, or walk into a room and command without knowing anything.

<br>The game itself is amazing. Just hope that it doesn&apos;t lose support anytime soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2740688">Expand</a></span>

A good game can last an hour, or twenty minutes, depending on how well your team bands together to defeat the other team, be it the ranged-combat Marines, or the close combat Kharaa (or Aliens.) Each team has one player that plays from the perspective of an RTS. That player sees the game from a top-down perspective, places structures (which Marines have to build for the Marine team,) and works to guide the team. The main goal is to take out the other team&apos;s command station (that is, the Marine&apos;s Command Stations or the Alien Hives.) Thus, if the game isn&apos;t over quickly due to a Zerg-like rush from the Aliens or a stomping Marine power-play (which is fortunately rarer and rarer,) the game becomes a mix of putting pressure on the other team and capturing resource nodes and tech points. Each team does this quite differently. The Marines get all sorts of technological upgrades, like teleporters, mobile siege turrets, jetpacks, grenade launchers, shotguns, and the amazing Exosuits. The Aliens get biological upgrades, or evolutions, that provide additional abilities to their life forms. Examples of this are Carapace, which gives the aliens additional armor, Leap, which allows Skulks (the base life form that can run on walls.) to leap a good distance, and Stomp, which allows the Onos (the massive Gorilla-meets-Rhinoceros alien) to send a shock-wave through a team of Marines that knocks them down. There are many more than these, but you get the idea.
<br>
<br>The graphics are slick, the gameplay is extremely well balance (if you read anything else, they were on a bad team or fighting a bad team. Two competent teams will have a balanced match.) and the teams are fun to play. Shooting is very solid, biting a little, tiny bit less solid, but still good enough on its own. Commanding is a blast once you get the hang of it (I particularly enjoy leading Aliens to victory.) Overall, this game has a little of everything, including unmatchable mod support, and community support. Unknown Worlds Entertainment owe their existence to the community, and they don&apos;t forget that.
<br>
<br>10/10
<br>Pros: Balance, Aliens are awesome, Marines are awesome, RTS elements are well done, maps are good, graphics are slick, performs fine on an i5-750 @ 3.0 GHz, 4 GB RAM, HD 6970 2GB.
<br>Cons: Load times can be a bit long (should be addressed in a patch this week,) server browser can be laggy, occasional crashing and freezing for some users.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/natural-selection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2741120">Expand</a></span>
