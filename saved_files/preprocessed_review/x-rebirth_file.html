X Rebirth is a victim of the success of the past X games, and the fan expectations that come with it.  Fans wanted an improved version of the past game...an evolution of the X franchise.  They got a step back instead, and it feels glaring.  Rather than expand on the depth of the previous games, X Rebirth strips away much of the good, and replaces it with the mediocre.  Things in need of improvement (e.g. ship controls) are barely touched, while technical issues abound.  An unfinished product at best, a half-hearted product in reality.  One feels that the developers simply counted on pre orders and early adopters to make one final cash in on the X name, before slinking off into obscurity with their ill-gotten loot.  There will probably not be any more X games after this, the goodwill having been squandered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3802872">Expand</a></span>

Freelancer was released in 2003 and it&apos;s probably the best space sim ever, simple and with great graphics, storyline, music and a huge universe to explore.
<br>X Rebirth is insanely complex, even the smartest player would find it difficult to perform the simplest tasks. The fighting is nice but only 1 weapon and missile can be used at a time????
<br>Requiring at least 4GB of memory and a 64Bit system is kinda dumb, the game looks pretty, but there are games that require a lot less and have better graphics.
<br>Entering the stations is a nice concept but confusing and time consuming, even if all you want is just to repair your ship.
<br>My overall review is in favor of the graphics, cause the rest is a failure. Huge price, bad and confusing user interface, huge amount of system requirements, system map is also difficult to read, and confusing aswell, trading should be a lot simpler.
<br>Honestly guys, if you haven&apos;t played Freelancer, do it, since it&apos;s the best way to compare a game from 2003 and a game from 2013... I prefer the old, simple and rich in storyline games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3798352">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been a fan of the X series for a long time.  I&apos;m used to buggy releases from Egosoft so I would be willing to overlooks bugs to a certain extent if there was a promise of a good game underneath.  There isn&apos;t.  Bugs, and there a tons and tons of them, to the point where there is an entire community built around supplying save games to people that get corrupted saves, are just the tip of the iceberg.  This game is plagued by horrible design decisions that go right down to its core.  Despite repeated assurances to the contrary, this game was stripped of much of the depth and complexity that made the earlier X games great.  This was clearly done in an effort to make the game more accessible to potential newcomers (earlier X games were well known for their brutal learning curve).  Unfortunately they completely failed to make the game more accessible.  The terrible &quot;plot&quot; is essentially a really long tutorial.  Unfortunately it is so terrible and badly presented with missing prompts, straight up wrong prompts, and instructions that, if followed, can often leave you stuck and unable to continue the game, that it would be easier to learn the game had they simply dropped you off somewhere with no instructions whatsoever and let you figure everything out entirely on your own.
<br>
<br>The UI is one of the very worst I have ever seen in any game of any type.  Despite the claims that this game wasn&apos;t being made with consoles in mind, it clearly was.  The proof is in the pudding.  The UI and control scheme is clearly designed with a gamepad in mind.  A gamepad is a poor input choice for a hardcore space sim with any level of complexity.  In order to get a space sim to work on a gamepad entirely you need to strip many features out of the game (they did) and force everything to be done through layers of menus (they did).  Even with all these concessions and even when using a gamepad, the menus are so counterintuitive and jumbled up that it&apos;s painful to do anything in the game, even the most basic things.  Hotkey support is missing for the majority of functions for m&amp;kb, while many functions simply don&apos;t exist (For example, there&apos;s no target nearest enemy key... at all.  How the  do you not have a target nearest enemy key?).  Flightstick support is straight up broken, it doesn&apos;t even recognize all the axes correctly.
<br>
<br>The game constantly forces you to leave your ship and enter stations.  Station interiors are pretty piss poor looking, worse yet there are maybe 2 or 3 different layouts total.  Every station interior is an exact copy of one of these 2 or 3 layouts, right down to the placement of crates, which you can rob right in front of their presumed owners as if you were in an old school JRPG.  Character models and animations look like something out of Morrowind (definitely not a compliment), none of the characters have any personality whatsoever, and the voice acting is laughably bad.  There is literally nothing to be gained by including the station interiors.  Their only function is to make everything in the game more tedious (you have to do all your trades and hires face to face, thus you have to go through this process again and again and again).
<br>
<br>Fleet commands are basically nonexistent (have fun leading a massive fleet into battle with basically no fleet commands).  Trading automation doesn&apos;t exist and you have to babysit each of your freighters every step of the way (try building a trading empire with 30 or 40 freighters when you have to walk each of them through every single step of buying, travelling to another place, and selling, every single time).  You can build stations but only in predetermined locations.
<br>
<br>The game is a mess and a farce.  Egosoft have been good in the past about fixing bugs and supporting their games for long periods of time, plus the modding community is great.  I&apos;m not sure if Egosoft and the modding community can save this game, it&apos;s that broken that deep down to its core.
<br>
<br>Egosoft managed to not only make the game even less appealing to potential new customers, but also completely alienate their existing loyal customer base, most of which will likely be loyal customers of theirs no longer.  It&apos;s a real shame because they made great space sims in the past.  I&apos;m not sure how they recover from this, or if they even can.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3804477">Expand</a></span>

Rebirth is nothing like previous X games at this point in time. So if you didn&apos;t like the old X games you may like this one. But if you did like the old X games you may not like this one.
<br>
<br>I obviously do not like Rebirth as is conveyed through the score I give it. However, simply disliking the game is not the sole reason for such a low score on a game from a company I have been a fan of for years. The bugs are also not the reason for such a low score, and there are a lot of them! No, the reason I give this game such a low score is because of the dishonesty and deception from Egosoft about this game.
<br>
<br>Several of the company&apos;s promises about the game either were not kept, or were just plain lies. The game isn&apos;t even in the same Genre as previous X games. Sure, it&apos;s in space and the lore is the same... but that is about where the similarities end. The creed of the game (trade, fight, build, think) appears to be missing 3 of the aspects. The fighting is there (easy-mode), everything else is either missing or it has been implemented so badly that it may as well be missing.
<br>
<br>There isn&apos;t much point in going too in-depth for this review. So I&apos;ll sum it up:
<br>
<br>If you are looking for an economic simulator with combat and fleet control that can rival the previous X games in the series, then you do NOT want this game.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for an arcade game or a FPS shooter style game that takes place in the  of a spaceship, then this MIGHT be a game you will like. But with the amount of bugs in the game I would certainly wait for a few months before considering the purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3812178">Expand</a></span>

We get ONE freaking ship as opposed to the TONS of others in the previous games and it&apos;s a tiny little, half-assed 2-roomed piece of garbage.  The animations on the characters also make Fallout 3 look like LA Noir.

Most of the ingame-functions don&apos;t work properly, UI is horrible and clunky to handle (especially if you&apos;re used to the UI of the other X-titles), you can only fly one single ship ever, bad performance on good machines (I get 5-10 FPS most of the times on an i7  3.4GHz, GTX570), etc.
<br>
<br>The voice-acting is extremely poor, like they used programmers to narrate the text 1:1 from a script. Additionally voice isn&apos;t even synched to lips many times.
<br>
<br>To charge 50&#x20AC; for this and call it a successor of the X-series is an insult and joke to all the X-fans. It is unbelievable that Egosoft let this game pass Quality testing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3780819">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A locked-in universe which expands via a long and pretty awful plot (in terms of voice acting and models), lack of control over player&apos;s assets, the total opposite of what was promised in terms of interface, a single ship, gimmicky mini-games and first-person mechanics, and a general feel of un-finished-ness make the game a huge don&apos;t-buy. Coupled with an extremely buggy launch, the fact that the developers refuse to recognise it&apos;s practically X3 but worse, and the sight of 90% of the former fanbase leaving, it looks like this game may remain that way for a long time.
<br>
<br>They were aiming for streamlining and accessibility whilst retaining the previous feel of complexity.
<br>They achieved a game too shallow, lacking, and simple for former fans to enjoy whilst making it too slow, buggy, and confusing for newer fans.
<br>
<br>Their failure to admit that they took a wrong design decision, and failure to acknowledge that after 7 and a half years of game and engine development the engine is inadequate and the game feels like it was rushed in 3 months, only makes this a harder issue to bear.
<br>
<br>Egosoft have, unfortunately, sold out to the &quot;casual&quot; gamer and ruined their reputation amongst their own community quite possibly for ever, and the fact they couldn&apos;t even do it properly has left them drifting in-between genres, too much of an insult to one group and too broken and confusing for a second.
<br>Forever they will be the small developer who found the mainstream... and drowned in it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3787228">Expand</a></span>

Controls are not intuitive and very slow (most of the stuff is done by talking to npcs. This will get old very quickly. And then looking for new captain will just slow you down). And the game is buggy too much. Keeps crashing (great combination with no autosave). And there are mission breaking bugs. Me with many other players am not able to finish even the tutorial. Stuck on energy cells mission. Until there is some serious patch or two, avoid this game.

Being able to see what could have been, makes the game&apos;s short comings oh-so-clear as if against a backdrop of expectation. The interaction on board your ship is momentarily a pleasant reminder of Mass Effect, but due to the graphics quality and limited world interaction, the visuals feel flat and useless. This goes for space stations, too, where interaction is limited and looting chests like a Link from Legend of Zelda game (great series, no offense intended) cheapens the games commitment to providing a fulfilling space simulation that has been the highlight of previous X series games. Add clunky UI and, unfortunately, the immersion just isn&apos;t there. Also, with the current game breaking bugs  which are being addressed by the company  it&apos;s difficult to expect the many sand box elements that have defined the genre will save the game from it&apos;s current disappointing condition. Keep an eye on the game, but buying it now will leave you wishing Rebirth wasn&apos;t born at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3779827">Expand</a></span>

There is zero situational awareness.
<br>
<br>And on top of that there was obviously no quality control because half the missions in the game are broken and require reloading and trying over and over again to get them to luckily continue. The first hour of the game took me about 3 hours to get past due to constantly relaoding upon hitting mission breaking bugs.

<br>The campaign is unplayable, bug after bug after bug. I feel like I have paid &#xA3;40 to beta test the game for them.
<br>You can only fly one ship, there are only two commands to control the ships/fleet you buy/capture and they don&#x2019;t work. The dialog is repetitive, tedious and annoying. (You thought Skyrims &#x2018;arrow to the knee&#x2019; was bad you have not seen anything yet).
<br>All the station look the same inside, and it looks like women in the future are all undergoing cancer treatment or egosoft has no idea how to program hair physics
<br>Trading is buggy and does not work, the enemy system is buggy to the point you get punished for defending yourself from attacking enemies and so can only run away.
<br>Performance on high end PC is bad with an fps of 10-20.
<br>I strongly recommend you do not buy this game, this is not a &#xA3;40 game.
<br>Egosoft you have literally stole from you costumers and should feel ashamed of yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3788386">Expand</a></span>

X2 to X3 was magnificent; more beautiful, bigger, everything you could want.
<br>
<br>X Rebirth is absolutely beautiful, on the surface- not counting the character models. Ships and stations are intricately detailed (from the outside) and beautifully (if pointlessly) animated. A first for X games, your own ship has a detailed interior, and you can even &quot;stand up&quot; to walk around in the rear compartment. (Though not around the  and nothing in the ship is interactive in the slightest.)
<br>
<br>That&apos;s about everything positive about this game. The actual user interface is awful; there&apos;s no hotkey support, and there isn&apos;t even a key to target enemies- you have to do it all with the mouse (and how you&apos;d manage with a gamepad or joystick, I have no idea.)
<br>
<br>You&apos;re forced to land on stations and walk around the station interface (where graphics performance is much worse than out in space, surprisingly given how small these and sparse these interiors are) and &quot;talk&quot; to people, which involves engaging in a mini-game to perform &quot;smalltalk&quot; (the mini-game, at least at the beginning of the game, is laughably easy). In X3, this was handled invisibly; you had the impression of being at the helm of a major trading corporation, as you grew more powerful, dealing personally only with things like having a new station built, rather than hiring individuals to crew the ships in your fleet.
<br>
<br>Speaking of mini-games, there are other ones, as well- travel between sectors is a mini-game of switching &quot;lanes&quot; to increase your speed; using your ship&apos;s long range sensors is a mini-game of holding down &apos;R&apos; just until a sound reaches a certain point; even interacting with stations involves a mini-game of (a) literally searching it for somewhere to land before awkwardly trying to double-click on an icon, and then click again to land; and (b) searching for &quot;info nodes&quot; that somehow add up to you getting a station discount (which involves flying circles and circles around the station looking for modules.)
<br>
<br>The minigames add nothing other than annoyance to a game that already started as a disappointment; advertised as though it were X4, when in reality is&apos; beautiful but unpleasant knockoff on the franchise.
<br>
<br>By and large, the issues aren&apos;t bugs (although there are tons of those); they&apos;re conscious design decisions. The developers don&apos;t like autopilot, so there&apos;s no autopilot present, unlike previous games; the developers decided a detailed walkable interior was more important than being able to directly command a variety of ships, so you only ever get to fly the one ship.
<br>
<br>Overall, don&apos;t buy. If you&apos;re a fan of previous X games, you&apos;ll just be frustrated and disappointed. If you&apos;re a fan of hardcore space sims, you&apos;re looking in way the wrong place. If you&apos;re a fan of economy sims, this doesn&apos;t have what you want.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3785555">Expand</a></span>

There are repeats, music, characters on all docks... you can only get one pilotable ship!! which sucks... and cannot switch it. The missions, specially the escort missions, the ships are stupid and get stuck, or don&apos;t move... The game is unfinished, unpolished and purely a waste of money.

<br>This game is complete and utter trash.

For starters, it won&apos;t work. If you like trying a game because you have some desire to play every game that has ever come out, wait a few months before trying to play this. You won&apos;t be able to play it yet. It&apos;s too buggy, very laggy, crashes a lot, and many of the missions have issues.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I felt compelled to create and account just to warn people.

You won&apos;t be able to play it yet. It&apos;s too buggy, very laggy, crashes a lot, and many of the missions have issues.
<br>
<br>But okay, let&apos;s pretend it works, once you make your way through a menu that feels more like a console port than any ACTUAL console port I&apos;ve seen, you get in to the game....which looks like crap. The  looks OKAY but many effects are cheesy and the atmosphere constantly has stars flying by right next to you because apparently crawing in space at 20mph causes stars to be pulled near your ship and stretched out thin like noodles. It&apos;s like the star wars warp effect, only the stars are next to your ship, and instead of warping, you&apos;re going slower than a PT cruiser.
<br>
<br>That is the prettiest part of the game. Then you get to the back of the ship, which looks like it, and the character models, were taken right out of a sightly, and I mean slightly, higher resolution of half life 1.
<br>
<br>If you still are hoping for gameplay...Well you&apos;re SOL. All aspects currently are too buggy to fully play out, but all if it is dull, despite stripping away depth to add &quot;immersion&quot; and &quot;action&quot;. The immersion is apparently taking 5 minutes of going straight to get to anywhere you need to go, and being in a  while you&apos;re in a neck brace because you can&apos;t look around at ALL. Avoid this at all costs. Maybe get it on a steam sale for $5 this winter once it&apos;s actually playable, but you still won&apos;t actually be having fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3778721">Expand</a></span>

They are both two companies I look up to and I&apos;ve waited since the beginning of 2013 for the release of this &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Surprisingly, the sequel is nothing compared to its predecessors and I&apos;m left with no words to describe the fall of a great franchise. This game had huge potential, but something went very wrong. Adjusting the series to new players is a good thought, but the result is a complete betrayal to the loyal community and all the fans.
<br>
<br>I want to praise them for exploring a new concept with in-door exploration, but using the same environments repeated times won&apos;t keep the players around for a long time. There is also a huge imbalance in the graphics, where the universe is a lovable eye candy and the rest of the game&apos;s graphics is completely outdated.
<br>
<br>I understand that it&apos;s not easy to run a gaming company, but this is almost ridiculous. The game is nearly broken at release, and the whole sense of roleplaying is very restricted compared to the other X games in the series. So an overall summary of the game would be, broken and over ambitious. I hope this won&apos;t put a shadow over the X series, because it&apos;s one of the best space simulators ever created and also one of the best games I&apos;ve played. I&apos;m talking about X3, obviously.
<br>
<br>I asked for a refund, without any doubt. It&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve had to do that, and I hope it will be the last as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3788866">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A console game in PC clothing.
<br>
<br>My recommendation is that instead of purchasing this, purchase X2 and or X3 on steam, which are being sold for decent prices on steam.  Do not waste your time or money on this.
<br>
<br>This should be a considered a prequel for X Beyond the Frontier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3789273">Expand</a></span>

<br>A very simple thing that Ego_zac on the game discussion forums for the game on steam has not even listed in the things that egosoft is working on fixing and until they do I WILL NEVER PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN. Read on to see what my problem is with this game. WHAT I NEEED fixed
<br>
<br>I put in 40 hours in the first 3 days. I had to CHEAT to get around the game stopping mission bugs.
<br>I hate cheating in games. It ruins it I wanted to get around the bugs. Finish the story so I had access to all sectors and then play x-rebirth sandbox.
<br>
<br>That was my plan.
<br>
<br>I have little doubt that you left those bugs in the game and every time you put in a patch you fix something and take someone else out. So every time You gain the time to add the features into the game in the story so that you can complete the game.
<br>
<br>You say that your priority is fixing the crashs. I DOUBT IT. Your game is not even complete.
<br>You know it. I know it. Forget the reviews on metacrawler.
<br>
<br>How do I know that the combat is not working. Simple I cheated to give myself money and I bought ships. I bought the carrier and the destroyer. The carrier should launch drones to defend itself. As well as use its turrets even if the drone combat has not been fixed at all.
<br>
<br>I have a strong feeling that egosoft purposely has the trading buggered so people can not get far enough to see that the combat is not complete.
<br>
<br>You get a hint of it when you get the mission to defend the heart of albions ship as they destroy a station. They just sit there. You own a trader. The turrets dont fire. I dont know maybe you have fixed it I have not played x rebirth since 2 patchs ago. Because i have asked in the general discussions and when asked them Are the turrets on your owned ships actually working.
<br>
<br>Awnser a disgrace.
<br>
<br>NO!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>One of the big things for players is simple you want your own private army. You build a station you drop off a ship to defend it. AND THE THING WONT FIRE A SINGLE turret to defend itself.

Come on EGOSOFT not having even basic combat working for your owned shipsis the WORST joke on an x game. How the hell you could release a game where the most basic gameplay. Which is ships that fight with you. Simply does not exist.

You want people playing this game. People are not listing this because this is so basic that everyone seems to be assuming you are working on it already. WELL are you. Seriously. That is the BIGGEST joke not being able to actually have ships you buy to fight with you. I&apos;m sorry if I needed a meat shield I would load my ships with shield drones.

<br>
<br>Reading the egosoft forums over the last 4 months, there have been three camps of players, those who moan and besmirch the game and everything about it, the players who think positive and say everything will be great, and those who sit on the fence with the wait and see attitude.
<br>
<br>I did my best to not get too excited about Rebirth, I erred towards the wait and see attitude, for me its better to have low expectations and be pleasantly surprised, instead of high expectations and be sadly disappointed.
<br>
<br>So after seven years waiting, 1000&apos;s of hours played in the X universe, the day of release comes to pass. Time moves along a few hours of playing and what do we have. Even with my low expectations, am I pleasantly surprised? Sadly not, I feel numb inside to what has happened to X in its current incarnation of Rebirth. It feels like a chore to play, not an entertaining open ended sandbox universe its meant to be.
<br>
<br>Regards

<br>Although the game has alot of ships and feels alive in a sense, thats the only thing it has going for it. Every other aspect of the game is horrible, garbage and invokes an indescribable sense of RAGE at the fact that Egosoft would take a dump on its loyal fan base.
<br>
<br>1.No joystick support
<br>2.No Controls Settings  WTF
<br>3.Game barely functions above a 15 framerate with SLI 550Ti Enthusiast editions on lowest settings.
<br>4.Graphics in stations make me want to puke all over myself.
<br>5.How can the developers release the poor NPC models without laughing so hard they cried?? Must have been some good weed they were smoking...
<br>6.The UI is the worst I have ever seen... EVER. Clunky, Buggy... and difficult.
<br>7. no keyboard controls for targeting, no external camera views, no freelook??? WTF WTF!
<br>8. No real control over ships??? How am I suppose to have an empire exactly??? TOTAL FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!
<br>
<br>I could go ON and ON literally about how BAD this game is compared to any other X game, or just about any other space sim... even the BAD space sims from 2002 are more fun that this game and at least they worked!!
<br>
<br>I have engaged in a chargeback through Paypal against Valve (STEAM). This game is a total and complete fraud... I will fight for my refund until the bitter end!
<br>
<br>Moral of the story: I&apos;m Fu**ING PISSED OFF.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3781766">Expand</a></span>

This one will maybe be good in 1 year after the incredible amount of bugs, ergonomy failures and functionnalities loss has been corrected. For now I feel abused having spent that much. have about 12h in game, with 3h reporting and reading about bugs. Frustration and deception are the words for what I feel with that to be rebirth alpha game.</span>

Honestly if you had me play this and told me it was an alpha release I wouldn&apos;t argue with you.
<br>
<br>So let&apos;s start with number 1. This game appears to have never been tested to work by anyone. If the devs tested it they would have probably caught the fact that FPS drops don&apos;t just happen once in a while, they happen constantly to everyone. Doesn&apos;t matter if you have a $3000 state of the art PC or a six year old Dell you aren&apos;t going to have good FPS unless you get really lucky. One of the devs has admitted they never bothered to optimize for high end PCs on the Steam Game Forums. That tells you something right there about the state of this release. How do you not optimize a game before putting it out? That&apos;s like selling a brand new car where the engine has never been tuned to run properly, no one in their right mind does that. Add a mess of bugs that not only break the storyline but literally fling you millions of KM away from your destination or get your ship stuck inside of parts of the stations to that and you have the recipe right there for a massive failure of a game. That isn&apos;t all though.
<br>
<br>So number 2 is design. What do I mean by poor design decisions? I mean things like the fact that to interact with the game&apos;s NPCs and your own ship&apos;s systems and such you have to use a radial menu akin to the conversation wheel from Mass Effect. Yes a system designed entirely for a controller&apos;s ease of use on a modern day PC &quot;exclusive.&quot; Which brings us to the fact that the mouse and keyboard are seemingly tacked on as an afterthought. Where most games use hotkeys for the keyboard this game basically gives you a handful, mostly for accessing maps and the radial menu and that is it. You can&apos;t just get to your inventory with I, no, you have to go through the radial menu. The mouse of course is hard to use due to the fact that all the icons are tiny and have to be double clicked if you intend to use it. Good luck. You can click at them several times before the game actually registers the double click.
<br>
<br>Now if you&apos;ve finally managed to double click and get into dock you get to experience what might be the biggest failing of this game by far. The &quot;Walking in Stations&quot; feature. Coupled with the NPCs I will discuss in a second, you have roughly three layouts possible for interiors. Three. In 2013. In these stations you will find the vendors that let you sell the random crap you find in capsules that drop from popped ships and in the crates that are scattered throughout the station that no one seems to mind you stealing and also let you buy more random crap or upgrade your ship. You&apos;ll also find all your crew members in these stations. Mind you, you&apos;ll have to really hunt for them since each platform doesn&apos;t have each person and some of those people are not even available to hire despite being listed in the platform&apos;s little info window, who even knows why. Once you finally do hire one they go to your ship where you have to fly them to the ship you want them in, dock up, and go through the radial menu to tell them they work there now. Yes for every crew member and for every ship. Thank god you don&apos;t have to completely staff a cap ship will all the thousands of personnel it would probably require right?
<br>
<br>So one last design flaw before I move on to NPCs. Station outsides. They are big, they are beautiful, and they seem to be thriving with life from the outside. Yet their size combines with what has to be the most awful design idea ever to make them the most tedious part of the game. Seriously to dock up you have to find a platform designated by a symbol of what that platform supposedly is like a bar or something and get super close to it to even be able to interact with it to choose to dock. Same goes with scanning the station to get information, you have to get close to the little &quot;i&quot; bubbles or mission/trade icons to scan. This leads me to believe this system was designed solely to show off the pretty artwork and nothing else and makes using the stations take forever.
<br>
<br>So NPCs are downright just garbage. If you&apos;ve played Everquest those NPCs are actually better than these and those things barely interacted at all and looked nothing like a human or whatever but at least they could move. These ones just stand still all the time and repeat the same terrible dialog over and over with what has to be the worst voice acting I&apos;ve heard since the PS1. You&apos;ll hear your copilot repeat the same docking line every time you dock and your character will repeat &quot;Show me your wares, please&quot; every time you talk to a vendor. Yeah downright quality there.
<br>
<br>This all combines to make a game that is unimaginably horrid for 2013 or really even 2003. It is clearly meant for console porting and is nothing like the previous X games.

See, I&apos;ve been playing games since the Amstrad CPC 6128 all the way to the entire PC era. But this... this! I can&apos;t recall having seen such an atrocious release of a game ever, and I&apos;ve seen a few! The debacle is of catastrophic proportion both for the users and Egosoft.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s completely crippled with bugs, as is often the trend nowadays, but I never saw such an enormous lot of game breaking ones that prevents you to achieve missions in campaign thus stopping the game until you find the weirdest of alt-tabbing and game saves editing and what-not work-arounds.
<br>
<br>But far more importantly, as bugs like this can be ironed out with patches, the game totally sinks from idiotic and schockingly puzzling design decisions that makes every core part of the game, like trading, station building, fleet commanding and basically the rest to be extremely tedious, very limited, obscure and generally not working at all than again due to bugs.
<br>
<br>The UI, something the devs were saying all over the place with pride to be streamlined yet retaining all the complexity of the game, well... it is the most tedious conter-intuitive thing i&apos;ve yet to experienced in a game. You to branch into countless ramifications of one category to actually access a single fonction, opposed to old X3 where every fonctions of a category was presented in a single window.
<br>
<br>You thought X3 was hard to fathom UI wise? well X rebirth is like comparing MS-DOS vs nowadays Win7, it&apos;s this much a nonsense...
<br>
<br>You spend countless time and basically most of your playthrough actually finding the very station that has an arms dealer, in a zone that seems like 10 X3 sectors compressed down to a massive city space station were everything is scattered and that you have to scan from back to front, making sure you discovered every little docking area, then land on every one of those where you discover they have an arms dealer on board in the hope that, after having walk on foot through the entire station corridor in an environment wich uninspired graphics from 2005 are laughable at best (they really are), you&apos;ll find the right arms dealer that also happens to sell what you&apos;re precisly searching for!!! And if he doesn&apos;t... you&apos;ll cry while you get back to your ship to repeat the entire process!
<br>
<br>It&apos;s... just out of this world! It&apos;ll be a mess so hard to salvage that they&apos;re going to have to hardcode a lot of things from the ground up. Something that is far more complicated than just patches... Frankly, there&apos;s so much work that involves core mechanics that I have doubts they can really do something.
<br>
<br>And this means also we&apos;ll less be able to counts on modders because such things, they&apos;re hardcoded for a big part.
<br>
<br>In all respect, it&apos;s X3: Light Edition, and certainly not a &quot;different and new game&quot;, the excuse that those devs have been trying to pull over lately in a shameless attempt to evade critics.
<br>
<br>In a way, I pity them also... because they of course knew all along what massive let down of a game they were releasing, and that they were knowingly insulting their fan base to an extent I&apos;ve rarely seenstrictly for the money, probably in order to recoup the catastrophic failure of a development having gone crazy and off tracks. And now the lead designer and CEO of Egosoft is doing nothing but dancing around the fanbase worries and questions, in an attempt to evade the massive ****
<br>
<br>Sad day for the X franchise, probably the end of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3795336">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is one purchase I truly regret and hope to get a refund from Steam (crossing my fingers).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3805446">Expand</a></span>

How are you supposed to &quot;manage an empire&quot; with an Xbox controller? The thing is, you can&apos;t, even with a keyboard, because it&apos;s all marketing lines. The game has very little content and very little possibilities. There is so much to say about the flaws in this game I&apos;d rather direct you to the Egosoft forums. Try to ignore the hate and you will find explained many of the design flaws X Rebirth suffers.

Let&apos;s just forget about the game-breaking bugs and horrible interface for a second; I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve already heard about them. Here are some other things wrong with the game on top of the basic broken-ness.
<br>
<br>TL;DR: Everything is broken! Nothing makes sense.
<br>
<br>The dialogue: No one who actually speaks English seems to have been involved in this game. I understand that the Egosoft team didn&apos;t make this in the US, but this isn&apos;t Zero Wing. It&apos;s supposed to be AAA(ish). I&apos;ve seen translations of Japanese porn that made more sense than some of the quest briefings.
<br>
<br>Also, &quot;go boil yourself&quot; is not the correct response to &quot;where can I buy stuff?&quot;
<br>
<br>The animations: This seems to be a big sore-spot for a lot of people, and they really are bad! The animations basically look like what would happen if you put me in charge of the Egosoft animators. &quot;Yeah, looks great the way her arms roll into her chest cavity! I&apos;m just happy to be here!&quot; I wouldn&apos;t care so much if the guys at Egosoft hadn&apos;t stressed that this was an &quot;immersive&quot; game above all else. Do we have a bad interface for these &quot;immersive&quot; animations? Is that why the dialogue seems like it was written by aliens? This game was clearly aiming for something, but it&apos;s like someone important at Egosoft got a bad head injury somewhere along the line and no one else noticed.
<br>
<br>The boost system and the AI: Don&apos;t get me wrong, I like the boost system...right up until I have to wait for my npc squad to catch up with me. Yeah, the AI is better than in previous installments of the X series. My ships are not always exploding at dock like they did in X3:TC, but its not enough better that they actually behave normally without supervision. And by supervision, I mean CONSTANT supervision, not the interesting &quot;keep it on track&quot; supervision you might want from a game. So, when I boost over to a mission, I am suddenly very alone. Fortunately the enemies seem to be slightly concussed and sort of stop fighting intermittently.
<br>
<br>Everything else: This is just for all the other random upsetting stuff I ran into. Stuff doesn&apos;t render right. The interface tags random freighters in the traffic lanes as enemy targets for summary execution and then the AI station praises me for defending them from raiders. No auto-targeting happens when you are under attack, but when I drop out of the hyperlanes it targets random things for me. Weird glass effects. &quot;Go boil yourself.&quot; Quests with no markers like the &quot;collect hydrogen quest&quot;. A weird inability to give orders to trading ships not in your squad. Confusing tutorial.
<br>
<br>There is so much more, but that&apos;s all you need to read from me. Fly safe...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3779957">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. ITERFACE. It is AWFUL. All of it. Just look at the map...
<br>3. Combat is incredibly hard, dunno why.
<br>4. This is not an X game. Only a single ship available???</span>

<br>I spent all day trying to find something I actually liked in this game to justify my purchase, and after 12 hours, it still eludes me. Needless to say, after 1000&apos;s of hours in the X universe, I can&apos;t even enjoy 12 hours in this one.
<br>
<br>Its not an issue of expectations being to high, but this is NOT an X game. It may be labeled as a rebirth, something new  but its more like a stillbirth.

I would quit in a fit of anger due to something not working properly and wasting an hour of my time. After thinking I would not play this game again, I would come back hoping it would get better. After a full 10+ hours of gameplay, it didn&apos;t get better.
<br>
<br>I finished a mission to hijack a trade ship and got not only the trade ship,  I was also given a construction ship. Awesome! This game is finally taking a turn.
<br>
<br>Nope. I got stuck on the next mission to use the trading ship to bring 300 food to a station. Neither of them would move. I tried to get the trade ship to repair itself with an engineer because the jump drives and engines were down (have to take down the engines in order to board it). Instead of repairing itself, it just sat there. The construction ship, which was undamaged, also. Just. Sat. There.
<br>
<br>The two new ships that I was excited to acquire soon got destroyed  the construction ship by a passing destroyer, and the trade ship by a station&apos;s large platform cannons. All because they just sat there like morons and wouldn&apos;t move. I spent 4 or more hours re-loading and trying different things to get these ships up and running before they inevitably got destroyed again.
<br>
<br>The mission would have to be indefinitely put on hold until the game gets fixed. I&apos;ve heard this and similar reports on the Steam forums because egosoft&apos;s forums are down (probably because so many people are complaining). Having played previous X games, I was so excited to get into another in-depth space sim.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sure there&apos;s depth to this game. With the shameful UI, unresponsive ships, and broken missions, good luck scratching the surface. STAY AWAY until egosoft decides that maybe 7 years of development wasn&apos;t enough. They need to do a massive overhaul to keep this from bombing further. Incredibly disappointed and angry that my money and time were stolen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3790584">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is still no a working game, with every patch and update there comes with it an ever growing list of bugs and fixes . It is clear to me that every time Egosoft add something they also mess something up ........... 1 step forward, 2 steps back springs to mind .
<br>Its not all bad, there have been performance gains for people, there also has been a few decent things added, the only problem is anything they added is a basic feature you would come to expect in the vanilla version, nothing much to show for 9 months work .
<br>
<br>IMO and pretty much all the Steam community DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, THERE IS A REASON LESS THAN 400 PEOPLE PLAY IT</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3790582">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have been a fan of this franchise since the very first game and I must say i am monumentally disappointed.......
<br>
<br>The interface is horrible, easily their worst and that&apos;s saying a lot. The franchise was usually known for groundbreaking graphics, this game seems to have taken a step backwards of all things from the last game! I bought this game without reading reviews unquestioned because the X games were all good. This is easily one of the worst games i&apos;ve played in the past few years.
<br>
<br>Anyone who rates this anything near a 10 must not have any clue at all what makes a good game. I cannot understand how anyone can rate this at least a 5/10 this game is THAT bad. Hope they don&apos;t expect modders to fix their game again because this is an insult to their fanbase and Star Citizen looks like it&apos;s going to be great.
<br>
<br>Whats most ridiculous is this is like some kind of a console port and doesn&apos;t even support DirectX 11. This game is DirectX 9....... Just shows how little care was put into this title. Despite the Windows XP era graphics the game somehow only gets 25fps on my dual 6970 setup. They always seem to have dreams of a console port since X2 and end up releasing the game on Windows screwing the fans over with a terrible interface. Now they have wrecked a once promising franchise with their hubris.
<br>
<br>I have been playing games since 1989, I have NOT ONCE asked for a refund. As soon as their crashed forum server is back up I will be demanding a refund from them.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3797915"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">After a playtime of ~3-4 hours i decided to write a Refund Request to the re-seller i had bought the game from because of some MAJOR issues with this game.
<br>
<br>1. Incredibly poor performance. My System is neither the newest nor the best but its decent enough to run BF4 on medium-high settings smoothly. In X rebirth my frame rate rarely climbed above the 30 FPS mark no matter what i did in the Settings. And its not that pretty to say the least.
<br>
<br>2.  BUGS. Let me name a few of them:
<br>- I call it RANDOM CRASH  happened bug: Every 30-60 minutes the game decided that i obviously need a break and crashed to Desktop. Since my drivers are all latest Version and i have a 64 bit Windows with 16 GB Ram there was no apparent Reason.
<br>- Blue gate Limbo: This one seems only to happen to a few people and i was luckily one of them. Sometimes when you fly inside a blue jumpgate minding your own business your ship suddenly developes a dire need to decent into limbo throwing you out of the gateway. All you can do then is watch the screen (not the co*kpit of course) go black with white flickers.
<br>- MINOR SPOILER IN THIS ONE Tradeship worked enough: Again something that not happens to everybody but i&apos;ve seen enough posts about it. Roughly 45mins in the game you get to a mission where your goal is to buy and sell 100 energy cells. This works only sometimes because sometimes (in my case ALL the time) your tradeship has worked enough for the day and sits in a random sector doing nothing. The order remains queued but hell screw it it worked its 20min that should be enough for 1 day. There are ways where you don&apos;t have to start all over, but it includes editing the freaking save game XML file....
<br>
<br>3. Design decisions:
<br>- The Co*kpit. To be honest i thought that one would be cool as hell. but you cant customize anything. I mean come on i have 4 ****ing screens Why dont you let me show important stuff there like a map or trade infos or stock prizes or a ****ing news site if i want to. NO that would be &quot;sandbox&quot; like and is therefore discouraged.
<br>- Which leads me to the next Point &quot;sandbox&quot;: you will be able to only fly ONE ship the entire game. Well ok it can still be sandboxy somehow but i *sigh* never mind.
<br>- Dialogues and NPCs in general. You have your copilot on one hand, whom you want to kill so she&apos;d shut up after about 15min. And you have a few other NPCs who live in 3 Types of space stations doing nothing at all and somehow all look alike. The Dialogues are about as sophisticated as an 2nd grader Text book teaching children how to make friends or deal with bullies... I&apos;ve seen this done better in DOOM  3 and that was horrendous already. &quot;Show me your wares please&quot; &quot;Show me your wares please&quot; &quot;Show me your wares please&quot;.........&quot;whats in the box?&quot; &quot;whats in the box?&quot; &quot;whats in the box?&quot; &quot;WHATS IN THE BOX?&quot;
<br>- Managing your fleet: So first of all managing them is a pain in the back and not the kind of pain you start to like and want more of it. its the kind of pain you want to stop. you have to work your way through Console designed menus to give even simple orders. Oh you mis-ordered something now that&apos;s a bummer here have some XML editing to get rid of it....
<br>4. What they promised it would be:
<br>- GTA in space. I&apos;m not going in Detail here..... it&apos;s not NOT EVEN CLOSE
<br>- Do what you want Help the police for example defending a Station against pirates.... oh you accidentally shot the station twice in combat WELL F**K YOU THEN YOU PIRATE SCUM.  Oh and if you want to change the name of your ship well F**K YOU AGAIN.
<br>
<br>I could go on for a while but the bottom line is:
<br>DON&apos;T BUY THIS GAME. just DON&apos;T. go buy needles an stick them in your legs, that would be more fun.
<br>Maybe Egosoft will change something in the future but until that happened, spare yourself time and money...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797915">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I never seen such poor graphics combined with such a horrible GUI, and mix this with only one ship to fly, allot of dumb down consol features, poor combat, and a &quot;walking in station&quot; that has the worst texures in history of modern gaming.
<br>
<br>This is the worst game in the series, and due to my high expectations only dragon age 2 has come close to making me this sad
<br>
<br>Avoid this game like the plague if your a X fan, Great Story lover, Fan of Graphics,Fan of Games, basicly anyone with a working braincortex.
<br>
<br>i played almost 50 euro for this on steam. and due to gamebreaking bugs.. i cant play it even if i wanted to... My 5ghz Watercooled 8 Core CPU and my dual GTX titan cards will keep it on a stable 40 fps ??????
<br>
<br>Dont ruin your memories of X series... let this one go</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3779135">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m trying to figure out just where to begin this review because I have so many issues with what this game represents.
<br>
<br>First, the marquee feature of 1st Person navigation through stations and your ship falls well short of what it should have been given the 7+ year development cycle. The stations are copy and paste, and essentially nothing more than a series of circular corridors. A feature that should have been left on the cutting room floor as it doesn&apos;t add to the immersion, it detracts from it by having jerky movement, poor framerate, and terrible NPC interactions. Oh, and Morrowind called, they want their NPC models back. Yes they are that bad, and yes they do detract from gameplay immersion because every time I look at them I am repulsed.
<br>
<br>Second, I tried to be OK with the idea of only ever piloting a single ship, and it might have been acceptable, but the way the  is laid out, the lack of a 3rd person perspective, and the intrusion of the UI into the field of view makes this prospect simply unacceptable. Half the time I&apos;m flying around stations I&apos;m bumping into other ships and objects because I can&apos;t determine where the corners of my ship are (it&apos;s a really big ship compared to your  view).
<br>
<br>Third, the interface with the game has been completely &quot;revamped&quot; from the X3 days. I held the X3 user interface as nearly the worst UI in gaming second only to EVE ONLINE. Yet somehow Egosoft managed to spend 7 years screwing it up even further.  There is a small, slow, convoluted contextual radial menu for every interaction in the game. You end up 3-7 layers deep in radial menu decisions by the time you reach the action you want only to hear from an NPC &quot;What do you think I am, a portable map vendor?&quot;  Thanks.
<br>
<br>Also, essentially every shortcut key for every interaction in the game that actually did carry over from X3 has been removed. There&apos;s no &quot;target nearest enemy&quot;, no &quot;target target&apos;s target&quot;, no &quot;view enemy camera&quot;. For those keeping score at home, X-Wing on MS-DOS had that functionality in the early 90s.
<br>
<br>The map system for navigating your way around the galaxy has also been replaced. It went from a handy  tile-based map in X3 to a strange &quot;heat map&quot; of information that isn&apos;t really legible.
<br>
<br>I could go on about how docking with stations requires you to fly right up to the doc port and double click on them, or how firing missiles is now the &quot;R&quot; key instead of space or a mouse button, or how there&apos;s no autopilot, but I think you&apos;ve got the drift by now.
<br>
<br>Because the quality standard is so incredibly low from Egosoft on this product, I cannot bring myself to give it anything higher than a &quot;1&quot; for a score.  I see there are some people out there that like the game, and I can only surmise they are fooling themselves, or they played a different game. Or they thing 10 is the worst possible score.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m an active fan and player of the prior X games (over 480 hours played on X3 and it&apos;s add-ons). But this game I&apos;ll be requesting a refund on. It&apos;s not done and the plan I see from Egosoft on what comes next should have been part of the initial release (read the first post on their forums on the website to get a good idea of what&apos;s wrong with the game in their own words).
<br>
<br>Unfortunately most of the items I have cited are design decisions, and they probably won&apos;t reverse themselves, so I don&apos;t see a place for me in this game at this time, which really saddens me.
<br>
<br>I hope you learn a lot from this process Egosoft, and I really mean that, no smugness here.  I really wanted to sink another 500 hours into this game, but at this time, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll spend another 5 minutes in it.

<br>The Good:

<br>Sound assets and music are of high quality.
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- One plot mission requires players to edit scripts within their steam directory in order for it to activate.  For a full price release this is unacceptable and gamebreaking.
<br>- Bugs, glitches, and crashes.  In every plot mission.
<br>- Poorly implemented gameplay elements have caused players to have to reload plot missions  for example  one mission requires the player to take control of a &apos;hacker drone&apos; forcing them to relinquish control of the main ship during a heated battle.  This results in the player&apos;s ship getting shot at (while the player instead controls the drone), and then the ship gets destroyed, forcing a &apos;game over&apos;.
<br>- Dialog is very repetitive and there are already mods that have been released specifically to remove the amount of repetition there is.
<br>- Lack of laser and missile types.
<br>- NPC models are ugly and assets are heavily re-used.  NPCs also perform squats while talking to them.
<br>- Locating a merchant of a particular type (eg. drone merchant) is impossible as there is no station information anywhere to provide their location.
<br>- The player&apos;s ship can get attacked while it is docked at stations.
<br>- The player&apos;s ship can get attacked and destroyed during cutscenes.
<br>
<br>Overall:
<br>Post patch this game could achieve a 7. As it stands, broken plot missions and the requirement for editing the script files of the steam directory will infuriate players and push them away from what could be a good game.
<br>
<br>Players who do not understand Javascript and computer programming, or who do not wish to engage in this to make the game function properly  look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3790684">Expand</a></span>

<br>whats really buffling is the unbelievable bad performance that makes the game almost unplayable.
<br>
<br>If you have decent fairly recent hardware, you can forgett it. To even run without stutter on LOW settings, this game requires the absolut newest current hardware.
<br>
<br>I have a quad core CPU with a cpu clock of 2.8Ghz and a Radeon HD 7000 series graphics card. I have a framerate of about 15 fps on the lowst possible graphics settings. My CPU utilization while running the game is around 50%. The GPU utilization is even below that.
<br>
<br>There are also numerous reports of people with suprising low performance. Even people with TITAN-Graphic cards report bad framerates.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know what the game developers did, but it is apparant that this game has a huge issue with hardware utlization.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3780865">Expand</a></span>

Performance issues for me considering I have gtx770 and i74770k, game runs badly, dog fights are hard bc the whole vision just somehow blurs when maneuvering the ship, hard to keep track of whats going on. Didnt like the whole fast travel thingy, just jump gate over jump gate, they over done it,  compared to X3, that encouraged exploration, I loved the long distance flying, it added to the game.
<br>Game feels like a mess, clunky tutorial easy to miss lots of important tips and parts, horrible NPC&apos;s look like  bad voice acting, waste of time walking the ships, pointless really, it takes time I dont wanna lose doing useless stuff, Traveling the station &quot;stealing&quot; loot and crawling vents didnt make sense to me, stupid AI, the UI is behh, the side screen where u check information and such gives me a headache, each time u want to check something, the players checks it on the side screen, should have left it on the main front screen in my opinion. So ofc there are bugs and its reasonable but all those things together just ruin the experience I wanted to get, Ill be wating for updates, as for now Im not interested in the game, played for 2 hours and Im disappointed. I did tried to enjoy it, but so far Im not impressed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3781549">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphics are quite bad. The backdrops and some of the artistic aspects are done nicely, however poor lighting effects and textures that came out of someone&apos;s rear end really dampen the experience. The graphics while docked in station or large ship are simply unacceptable.
<br>
<br>In terms of your actual ship control it is quite enjoyable. The ship reacts well to joystick inputs and shooting is similar fun to previous titles.
<br>
<br>Targets... oh boy. You can no longer cycle through targets, select only enemy targets, or shoot at other ships while keeping target elsewhere. In it&apos;s current state you feel quite lost in space and navigating or fighting a swarm of enemies does not feel as immersive as a result. You would have to have played previous X games to realize just how important target management is. We&apos;ll see in time how it plays out, as of now I do suspect it will be a major problem.
<br>
<br>The interface is perhaps what could become the ultimate gamebreaker here. They have basically reduced functionality by a large margin all while making the interface more clunky and bonky than before. Where as before we had grid-like interfaces with many options available, what we are left with now is a very dumbed-down, overly flashy, unintuitive mess. The maps are borderline unusable, providing a fraction of the function the previous maps did. Ship commands, fleet commands, trading, bartering and such used to be a simple matter of a few clicks or a hotkey, but now involve pointless waiting and navigating through tedious menu options.
<br>The real kicker: They&apos;ve stripped away the vast majority of the hotkeys from previous titles and removed the ability to assign more than 1 key to a function.
<br>
<br>Ability to progress time has been removed it seems. I did enjoy simply progressing time quicker for game environment purposes. Stargates have been changed with a super highway. It&apos;s a nice way to travel between zones, you can slipstream and even shoot ships on the highway.
<br>
<br>I have not checked out much about the trading mechanics so can&apos;t speak too much to that. However having to walk around pathetically textured, identical stations and interact with poorly voiced, HL2-esque NPC models does not seem like something enjoyable in the long run no matter how fascinating the trade mechanics may be. Leaving my ship honestly makes me want to pluck my eyes out; interacting with the NPCs makes me want to pull out a gun and end it all.
<br>
<br>Inability to use more than the one ship you start with is a big let down, I prefer the slower boats that handle more poorly and for a game that is primarily, for many players, about enjoying the engine in combat, a true sandbox game in 2013 would offer the ability to use different ship types as X2/X3 did.
<br>
<br>Overall it feels like many of the core features  particularly in how they present themselves via the interface  have been dumbed-down with functionality reduced or removed entirely.
<br>I do believe there is a solid underlying game here. Whether or not the ridiculously awful interface, targeting system, and other setbacks can/will be fixed will likely decide how playable the game is in the long run. I will be giving it another chance tomorrow and we&apos;ll see how it goes!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3781538">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>2)  UI is simple, but simply tedious.
<br>3)  Voice acting and dialogue is an embarrassment.   Dialogue often seems more like filler between the rare occasions when what the NPC&apos;s have to say actually matters.   Ironically, my co-pilot telling the computer to shut-up is more grating than the ships computer speaking in the first place, a failed attempt at self-deprecating humor on the part of Egosoft, who seem to be acknowledging the short comings of past title&apos;s dialogue.
<br>
<br>4)  Game systems like trading may be simpler in theory, but turns out to be more cumbersome in practice.   This is probably exasperated  by the &quot;NPC&quot; menu system which isn&apos;t any less confusing than previous title&apos;s menu systems, andisn&apos;t made any easier by the built in short-cuts and nested menu&apos;s.
<br>
<br>5) No targeting keyboard controls? Really? (I was really surprised by this one) Target foe, target friend, squad-mates, etc?  Seems basic for a space sim.
<br>6) Game crashes.  This, believe it or not  is less of an issue for me, since it is purely a technical issue to overcome, rather than an issue of misaligned vision or foresight.
<br>
<br>I have more concerns, but those are my primary issues.
<br>
<br>Why did I give it a 4 instead of lower score?   Because I believe in the heart of the game, which at its core, captures the imagination of those who want a living, breathing world, where your imagination is the limitation of your game experience.   Perhaps as some of these issues get addressed, I would give X Rebirth a higher score.
<br>
<br>I really like this series, I am hoping future patches and improvements improve the game play.   I think Egosoft fell victim to the whining of the casual player who&apos;s needs and interests are very different than those willing to dig into the nitty-gritty details of a simulation.   Unfortunately there are more of the former than the latter...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3777756">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing games my entire life and have been a professional game developer for almost a decade.  In all that time I have never felt compelled to go to the trouble of actually writing a negative review.  I pre-ordered this game the moment it was available.  It sounded like everything I&apos;ve ever wanted in a game.  Alas, it was not to be.  Playing this game hurts me.  I&apos;ve spent about 8 hours playing it so far because I desperately want it to be good somehow.  I&apos;ve turned the voice volume all the way down so I can&apos;t hear the awful dialog.  I&apos;ve given up caring about how awkward the controls and menus are.  I pretend all the NPCs just don&apos;t exist.  Despite all this, the game is still hard to play, and I&apos;m not referring to the difficulty level.  There are so many small things wrong with this game that they overwhelm almost constantly.  So many simple things that are, best case, bad design choices, but generally feel like the developers working on them did not have enough time to finish.  It is inevitable in any game production that some corners will be cut, but this game feels almost spherical.  I am at a loss.  I&apos;m holding out hope that they will turn this ship around, but I just don&apos;t know if they can.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3786182">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It is obvious they designed it for consoles, and I&apos;d bet all the money in my 401k we&apos;ll see PS4 and XBONE ports directly. Sad, because the X series was always a pc based complex trading game. I loved them for that, spent thousands of hours of my life playing the series.
<br>
<br>They kept the game under tight wraps, didn&apos;t even send out review copies until release day. Now we know why. Egosoft will never get another dime from me. Hopefully Star Citizen or Elite will fill the void for a fun space sim, because this game never will.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3787661">Expand</a></span>

The tutorial in campaign mode is sparse and I found myself looking up the keybindings in the control settings just to find out how to do things. The menu system is vague and it takes time to hunt down where certain actions are buried within. Docking at space stations and your ship is like entering a small instance and is uninspiring seeing the same graphics with the same objects in different places. This is my first X space sim to play and honestly i&apos;m pissed for blowing $50 and never again will buy a game without checking reviews first. Yes I&apos;ve only tried the game for several hours but I have no incentive to see if it gets better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3777604">Expand</a></span>

<br>In short, a AAA (priced) game should not have blocking bugs in the tutorial.   I&apos;m an X series fan.   I&apos;ve been a gamer for 25 years.
<br>
<br>But, I have also been a software developer for 15 years:  This is inexcusable.
<br>
<br>1.   At a minimum, it shows that development was crunched beyond a reasonable QA effort.
<br>2.   It shows, at best, deeply misguided priorities.   Who cares about whiz-bang shaded info-icons on stations, WHEN THE TUTORIAL IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETE?
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t get into the other issues well explained here:  The abysmal performance,  the bizarre and unintuitive interface,  the  that wastes 50  of the screen real estate.
<br>
<br>If I was on a team responsible for a failure of this magnitude, I would be fired.    This is not AAA quality.
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t buy another egosoft game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3778445">Expand</a></span>

Most people can&apos;t play for more than 2 hours without getting irrevocably trapped in the campaign, but ignore that for a moment. This game has been in development for 7 years.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s just go through the features this game has to offer:
<br>
<br>1. Five different upgradable weapon types that go from Mk. I, to Mk. II, to Mk. III etc. That&apos;s it. In the whole game. You have 5 different weapons.
<br>
<br>2. No pilotable ships: You are trapped on the Albion Skunk for all of eternity.
<br>
<br>3. Terribly poor AI for companion ships in your squad, no clear way of acquiring new ships.
<br>
<br>4. Frankly, no fun. I&apos;ve played it for about eight hours now. What do I have to look forward to in this game? Turning my Plasma Cannon Mk. II into a Plasma Cannon Mk. III? Weeeee. Oh wait I can do fetch quests, delivery quests, kill quests and trade quests to my heart&apos;s content. Oh yes and I can do mining! Woo! So instead of turning my Plasma Cannon Mk. II into a Plasma Cannon Mk. III... I get to turn my Mining Laser Mk. II into a Mining Laser Mk. III.
<br>
<br>So I can&apos;t purchase a new ship, I can only buy incremental upgrades of my existing weapons... I&apos;m sorry but for a game with over 7 years of development where is the depth? What the heck happened here?
<br>
<br>When you fly around and actually look at your options as, say, a miner... You have mining drone Mk. 1, mining laser mk. 1. And as you mine more you get Mining Drone mk. 2. And mining laser mk. 2. I&apos;m sorry, but that is even worse than EVE mining (no offense to any EVE miners out there).
<br>
<br>The graphics are also pretty dang bad. But they&apos;re nothing compared to the voice acting. I pity anyone that tries to play this for over 10 or 20 hours. The one liner your copilot spews every time you dock loses its magic after you hear it the first 100 times.
<br>
<br>Between the gameplay, the graphics, the sound, and the music (or lack thereof)... -shaking head-
<br>
<br>I guess this is what happens when devs decide they need to &quot;streamline and revamp&quot; their game.
<br>
<br>I feel incredibly bad for them. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;d do if I spent 7 years of my life to produce... this. They have my pity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3778764">Expand</a></span>

There isn&apos;t even a  radar! (and no, despite what the dev said the game isn&apos;t better without it)  There may be lots of little ships flying around and stuff, yet the world seems lifeless, and missions are heavily scripted. I accepted a &apos;protect the station&apos;, and attackers arrived immediately. and couldn&apos;t even intercept them away from the station. What kind of living world is that? They limit you to one ship. Ok. No radar. Oook. But then you can&apos;t move your camera around even from inside the  the one that hides half of your screen... and don&apos;t get me started on the fly around station icons minigame..
<br>
<br>If this has been in development so many years why does it feel like a 2 indie guys few weeks rush in assets, game mechanics and code?  Who on Earth did you make this game for?  It was certainly not for space sim fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3780043">Expand</a></span>

<br>I also tried a random cargo mission, the game points me where to deliver the cargo but then what  Do I need to buy it first or is it a delivery mission, no idea.
<br>
<br>Then the tutorial tells you to go &amp; get some defense officer, with no clues about where to find it, I&apos;m tired of searching and docking at every possible place, and I am sure the game will be like that for about every aspect  how  where? what ?
<br>
<br>This game is a plain NO and my money was wasted. The idea was great though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3787295">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Commanding your ships is practically impossible, as you have no clean system of being able to order them around, without having to go through 3+ menus to do so.
<br>
<br>The trading system is VERY dumb. You have a ship, you set it on a mission. Half the time the ship stalls and doesn&apos;t do anything, and there is currently no way to cancel the queue and restart it.
<br>
<br>The game is also currently riddled with bugs, broken features, poor texture quality on NPCs, (e.g. eyeballs rotate in their head to look like something out of a horror movie) and many other issues, such as game crippling bugs which include those that prevent you from continuing the storyline.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m hugely dissapointed in Egosoft, I&apos;m amazed how they can even sleep at night knowing that they have alienated their core audience by dumbing down the game to such a degree it&apos;s become unplayable. I sure hope there is a patch on the way, a MAJOR one, which fixes some of the key issues:
<br>
<br>* THE MAP. OH MY GOD THE MAP.
<br>It&apos;s extremely unintuitive and terrible to use.
<br>
<br>* NPC texture quality
<br>Huge differences and inconsistencies between NPCs. The co-pilot is badly textured, while others are very well textured.
<br>
<br>* Overhaul of the trading system  at least give us the option to modify  cancel their queues!
<br>
<br>* Performance
<br>Achieving 20 FPS in a game that isn&apos;t that huge is unacceptable. I understand that an engine in the wild will vary greatly, but in this instance, EVERYONE, even on rigs far more powerful than mine, are achieving rubbish FPS.
<br>
<br>Please Egosoft, for crying out loud, SAVE THIS GAME!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3780830">Expand</a></span>

Everything has been simplified straight down to an FPS like game. Forget about controlling your fleet, managing your properties, and building your empire in the way you used to. Whole interface and complexity has been seriously dumbed down to fix in a console, so you can play it all with a game-pad and nothing else. Graphics and effects are mediocre, basically sprites, and cheap low resolution textures with lots of dirt, splattered on top. Animations are absolutely atrocious, with people moving like robots, from A to B, and doing nothing. Faces look like those of 80 yrs olds, with voices in their 20-ies. Conversations and ambient sounds are also repeated every minute, so you&apos;ll hear the same &quot;there were no highways 40 yrs ago&quot; on every corner. Also, most characters are rude, and have strangely pathetic comments towards you. Station design is one big horrible circle with few stairs, which is duplicated absolutely everywhere. Basically majority of the game is 7 years of Copy &amp; Paste. I can&apos;t believe how it&apos;s all the same absolutely everywhere. Performance wise it&apos;s not the best, but I think this will get fixed sooner or later. The gameplay though will not be fixed much, and I think it&apos;s the beginning of the end of brilliant X story. I pre-ordered the game after seeing all the brilliant videos, and sneak-peaks, but it turned out to be all so different when actually played. It&apos;s a big failure in my opinion. Going back to play X3AP now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-rebirth/user-reviews?user_review_id=3784155">Expand</a></span>
