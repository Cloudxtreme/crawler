You definitely get your moneys worth, I could have paid up to $20 for 2 cinema tickets (excluding the food) for a 1 hour and 30 minute experience or purchase the game: $7,99 for about 5 hours fun! Some of the critics are complaining that the game is too short, but I don&apos;t believe they &apos;&apos;analyzed&apos;&apos; the price-tag of the game. There are many inferior games that charge even double! To summarize: awesome story based on historical events, pretty basic but solid combat system and beautiful art and soundtracks!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cross-of-the-dutchman/user-reviews?user_review_id=5500541">Expand</a></span>

The game took me about 5 hours to finish and get all the achievements. The game also offers nice Steam features like Steam Trading Cards, which is always nice to have. The game tells the story of Pier, a local hero from the Netherlands. I am from the Netherlands and never heard of him before, but now I want to know more about his history! You can find a lot information about him on the Internet, stuff that you actually also encounter during the game! The combat is basic, but very enjoyable when you fight off multiple enemies at the time. I highly recommend this for players who want a casual experience (small RPG elements) and enjoy hacking, slashing and destroying Saxon soldiers! One last advantage was that the game is available in many languages. Normally I don&apos;t enjoy playing any game in my native language, but this one felt great!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cross-of-the-dutchman/user-reviews?user_review_id=5482758">Expand</a></span>
