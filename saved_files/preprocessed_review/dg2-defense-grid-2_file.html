Most of the towers are now ineffective against what they are suppoesd to be used for (temporal&apos;s have almost no effect on faster aliens, inferno are useless against regenerating alies, ect...).  Missile towers are now better version of meteor towers, but both are eclipsed by canon, so there&apos;s no reason to build either.  Tesla&apos;s are now completely useless.
<br>
<br>On top of that the maps are very linear, with much less strategy than in DG1.  The optimal path in now clearly obvious and there&apos;s very little strategy or tactics involved.
<br>
<br>Its sad, with almost 100 hours spent in DG1, I&apos;m already done with DG2 after just 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dg2-defense-grid-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4532075">Expand</a></span>

Instead, ,moving the mouse pans the map, so you are essentially trying to bring the map to your (stationary) cursor, rather than the usual, other way around. This is so inconvenient it&apos;s unusable for me. I found no setting to change that, and nothing on the forums suggest there&apos;s a way. I stopped playing minutes after I started. This is pure laziness on part of the developers, to stick a console interface on a PC.

<br>the aliens - some of them - do look a bit too much the same. - it is not easy on first glance to determine which alien can do what. - i am also not so sure about the balance of waves.

<br>the positive:
<br>
<br>all in all - the game is fun! yea - i am having a blast trying to get gold status
<br>
<br>i do like the AI chatter - yea, it is a big cheesy - but it is fun.
<br>
<br>there is lots of room for custom maps and expansions - it certainly is one of the very good TD games, but it does not re-invent the genre.

The level 3 towers don&apos;t feel powerful at all, the inferno tower can&apos;t target properly, and even the level 3 inferno tower won&apos;t make damage... and won&apos;t burn a lot of aliens...
<br>Tesla don&apos;t feel particularly useful. Missile too. All towers seem a bit of the same..., just spam and spam towers all over the map.
<br>DG1 was so detailed. Every one of tower you built or upgraded felt important and unique, and some very powerful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dg2-defense-grid-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4533074">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s true, the balance has been reworked, but it&apos;s actually a good thing. If you played DG, the first thing you&apos;ll notice is that Gun Towers are no longer insanely overpowered. The next thing you&apos;ll run into is that one kill box isn&apos;t going to cut it. The fast moving aliens require overlapping level 3 temporal towers to really catch them, and you just can&apos;t fit enough damage into that small an area based on the way their hit points are balanced, so the only option is to spread out across the map much faster than the original game. You have to use more long ranged towers and set up paths so that they overlap fire. Speaking of overlapping fire, the boost tower does indeed add deeper tactical possibilities, allowing you to set up towers that can fire over other towers. Great for maximizing damage in a maze.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m about half way through the game, playing on normal mode, getting gold, then moving on to the next map, and it&apos;s a fun challenge. Don&apos;t expect to be able to approach it in exactly the same way as the original, and you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dg2-defense-grid-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4542231">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Hidden Path really nailed it! DG2 is as good as DG1 in almost every way.  Some interesting changes with the boost platforms and the upgrades makes it interesting. Very balanced gameplay and has me hooked like the original.  Must play for any tower defense fans and/or fans of the original. Fantastic!</span>

<br>
<br>I only played 5 minutes until I deleted the game: your mouse cursor does not move. Instead your mouse moves the camera (intended for game pad play). Your mouse cursor gets LOCKED to only be able to move vertically when you open the build menu.
<br>There is no borderless windowed mode.
<br>
<br>0/10 because of Consolitis.</span>

In play, you are also awarded enhancements to the basic tower ammunition, which show up at the end of a round, and which you can use from then on. There&apos;s also the command shuttle, which gives you additional controls, such as heat maps of where damage is most intense, and the ability to raise hidden terrain. The gameplay is more varied than in Defense Grid 1, and there are more paths to victory.
<br>
<br>The story gets more characters and some of the unexplained plot lines in DG1 are pursued to their conclusion. The voice acting is good, but the story itself is a bit predictable. There&apos;s still some ambiguity about what the aliens are up to, but there&apos;s less of that sense of devastating bleakness that pervaded the first game. The music is lovely, but again slightly misses the spot in comparison to the dramatic score of the first game.
<br>
<br>I have no problem recommending DG2. It&apos;s one of my favourite games of all time. I hope there is DLC and even DG3 in the pipeline, because my biggest complaint is that I want more official maps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dg2-defense-grid-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4848008">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m really confused by folks that liked DG1, but not 2.  It looks to me like they gave everything people wanted from 1, including multi-player and user created content.  I didn&apos;t care for the MP, but the user content is going to be huge.  I also liked the new tower perks mechanic and engine.</span>

<br>
<br>This game is so intense and filled with so much new mechanics I had to replay entirely the first Defense Grid just to measure the improvement (true story).
<br>
<br>~ Spoiler alert : a few tips and tricks are listed at the end of the evaluation
<br>
<br>The first Defense Grid featured specialized towers and one deadly strike from the heavens. The second opus features almost the same towers, with a twist: you now can build them on top of Boost towers, and activate a special effect on them: Disrupt shields, Overcharge towers or Boost score - your choice.
<br>
<br>On top of that, you&apos;ll meet new AI on each mission, and pick one of them to support your efforts. Each AI provides you with an advantage that can be triggered and requires some time to be ready again: the classical strike from above, more resources to spend, overcharging a group of towers... - your choice again.
<br>
<br>And if you think that would be enough, think again. Not only the towers can be upgraded from level 1 (green) to level 3 (red); but you now can tweak each of them with nice improvements like: revealing hidden enemies, damaging over time, focusing on the biggest enemy ... - your choice !
<br>
<br>To keep the pressure on, the clock of each mission starts without waiting for you to analyse the layout. So you&apos;ll have to think fast and fail a lot before you nail the level and reach higher scores. Luckily, you can go back to the previous checkpoint and readjust your strategy (there are more checkpoints so you don&apos;t feel like being forced to restart entirely a level).
<br>
<br>~ And now some tips and tricks (don&apos;t read them until you hit a wall of difficulty)
<br>
<br>First, the levels can have the same entry / exit point; or a different entry and exit points. Some maps have multiple entries and exit points and can be tricky!
<br>
<br>Second, the levels can be roads surrounded by tower locations, or made of large chunks for concrete where you&apos;ll have to build a path to channel the aliens.
<br>
<br>Even if it is possible to fill a level with level 1 towers and still win, ultimately, you&apos;ll want to concentrate devastation on carefully selected spots where the aliens will walk multiple times.
<br>
<br>So, what are the best / worst towers in the game ? On my own, I mostly play using Concussion, Temporal, Laser, Machinegun and Cannon. Sometimes Missile. The Concussion is so powerful you&apos;ll eventually forget the Inferno, the Tesla and the Meteor. It&apos;s a shame but you&apos;re not here to concede anything.
<br>
<br>Next questions are: where should you place the towers, how should you combine them, and what are the best boost to give them. Here are my suggestions.
<br>
<br>First, in each level, locate the entry &amp; exit points. Then assess if you can change the path of not. If you cannot change the path, locate where you have bottlenecks and paths that can be targeted twice (or more) with a single tower. Usually, the Core Center is one of them.
<br>
<br>Once you&apos;ve located or created these bottlenecks, decide where are the best spots to concentrate damage. Sometimes it&apos;s at the very beginning of the level, sometimes close to the Core Center, sometimes somewhere else.
<br>
<br>Then:
<br>- Build a Concussion (on a boost if you can channel the aliens, or benefit from back-and-forth; and on land if you cannot change the path) then at least a second one close to the first so you can combine the effects). A good boost is Overcharge or Score Boost if you aim for the top of the Ladder :)
<br>- Right after the Concussion, build a Laser that will continue to burn the aliens. A good boost is Overcharge - unless these are far from the Temporal so Disrupt is a better choice (laser don&apos;t go through shields)
<br>- Build a Temporal close to the Concussion towers to slow down the fastest aliens and nicely melt the other ones. A good boost is Disrupt, to remove those nasty shields. (And when I say &quot; melt&quot; I literally mean &quot;melt&quot;).
<br>- Build Machinegun(s) near the &quot;entry&quot; of your Concussion / Temporal / Laser combination. A good boost is Overcharge unless there aren&apos;t close to a Temporal with Disrupt ; then Disrupt is a better choice.
<br>- Build Cannon(s) to cover either or both the entry and exit of your Concussion / Temporal / Laser combination. A good boost is Overcharge.
<br>- Make sure Cannon(s) or Machinegun(s) are protecting the Core Center. A temporal can help too.
<br>- Build Missile(s) to cover the Core Center, Kill zones and especially exits - you don&apos;t want one remaining alien on the brink of death getting away with your precious cores :) No sir, you don&apos;t!
<br>
<br>About the &quot;tweaks&quot; in the towers, here you enter the realm of preferences. Usually I use &quot;Focus on biggest target&quot; on Machinegun, Cannon, Laser and Missile since the Concussion will usually get rid of the tiny swarms. On Temporal I try to boost the slowing down effect. On the Concussion I try to raise the damage.
<br>
<br>Feel free to experiment ! You may choose to tweak you towers to slows down the aliens as much as possible, or to damage them overtime, or pierce their shields.
<br>
<br>Have fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dg2-defense-grid-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5414715">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve just finished the Containment DLC for DG1 (which I though was hard, but really fun too) and rolled right into DG2 after that. DG2 is more dynamic. The boost towers allow you to quickly block off a path without spending too much, while you can still build towers on top of them. When you do, you can then upgrade the towers, for instance to disrupt shields/cloaks, do more damage, or later on, boost your score. As some people mentioned, temporal towers are now less powerful, however they stack! so the key is to place more than one, and have them overlap. This in turn, slows down aliens a LOT. I find it a challenge to try and make the towers as effective as possible, and finish the levels with a minimal amount of towers, and the game rewards this in your score. You get points for each alien you kill, based on how much cores you still have and how many resources you still have, and this is adjusted based on your tower value. Later in the game, you can select upgrades and modifications for the towers, to make them fit your play-style. The more effective your towers are, the higher your score will be. The story is fun, and the little fly-by cut scenes in between are a nice touch. Take a little time to get familiar with the changes they made. To me, it does feel like DG1, and I like the new changes. It&apos;s quite addictive to me ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dg2-defense-grid-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6528706">Expand</a></span>
