I did not 100% it, though I did do some of the extra content.. It was alright, but highly disappointing. Wait for a sale.
<br>
<br>George Weidman (Super Bunnyhop on Youtube) described this game best: &quot;I love you, but sometimes you&apos;re a piece of ****
<br>
<br>TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE:
<br>
<br>I believe the game at on point exited to desktop suddenly without warning. However, I can&apos;t replicate this. What I&apos;m certain it did was minimize itself at points without warning, despite me only using a 360 controller. This happened a couple of times, and may have something to do with using a second monitor.
<br>
<br>There were a couple of framerate hiccups that frankly shouldn&apos;t have been there considering the style of game, but it wasn&apos;t anything harmful to the experience.
<br>
<br>You have some options for graphical settings, though not many. Understandable for the style of game.
<br>
<br>PRESENTATION:
<br>
<br>Lots of wonderful, stunning pixel art that I appreciate thoroughly. Animations are also nice, though there are unfortunately not many of them to see. Characters can emote, and Otus is a precious cinnamon bun, but after the 50th time he gets spooked or looks dead-eyed you kinda wish there were more things they could do. However, what&apos;s there is very nice.
<br>
<br>Menus worked alright, UI was fairly minimal and unintrusive. You have options to change parts of the UI, which is appreciated.
<br>
<br>There was a surprising amount of the screen going a single colour (white or red) due to shooting an enemy or something, and I found that pretty jarring.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY:
<br>
<br>This is where Owlboy just tanked for me. The first couple of hours were enjoyable, even if largely scripted. The ability to fly is nice, though it ultimately may have done the game more harm than good. In Owlboy you can fly indefinitely without consequence, which must have posed many problems for level designers trying to make a challenging 2D &quot;platformer&quot;.
<br>
<br>It is more of an exploration-based game like Zelda or Metroid, but the only real exploration is done in the game&apos;s dungeons. There&apos;s some rudimentary puzzle solving, stealth sections, and shooting enemies, standard stuff. However, I never got into a flow like you might in a Zelda dungeon, where you start being unable to do very little to progress and by the end, can do everything in it. It didn&apos;t feel like Metroid either; I never felt lost, I never felt I had to explore much more than one or two screens over to find my next path to progress. The level design isn&apos;t particularly complex or elegant.
<br>
<br>Case-in-point, there was a section where you pass some deadly moving blocks into a room with a giant screw blocking your path. I&apos;d never seen anything like it prior, and couldn&apos;t figure out the solution. There was a terminal window in the room, but all it said was a bunch of vague stuff about the story. I tried to leave the area, but found the deadly moving blocks would kill you no matter what timing you used, so all I could do was try the screw again. I did end up progressing, but from what I could tell, nothing prior taught you how to do it, and the solution was not even slightly in-line with anything shown before. That&apos;s poor level design, even if I&apos;m just bad at puzzles.
<br>
<br>The real boss fights, while good when present, were far too scarce. Several &quot;boss fights&quot; were nothing more than waves of common enemies thrown at you, which was disappointing. This also exacerbated what I feel was the absolute biggest problem: the shooting. It&apos;s laid out like a twin-stick shooter, but the weapons at your disposal either don&apos;t feel remotely satisfying to use, taking far too many shots to kill, or are just impractical for combat. A shotgun you get halfway through has a preposterous cooldown, which is awful when it&apos;s used for several repetitive puzzles. Most of the game you&apos;ll be mashing a single button to shoot, just because they found it necessary to give your gun a 3-shot burst if you don&apos;t do that.
<br>
<br>Combat isn&apos;t just repetitive and time-consuming, it&apos;s also frustrating. When you get hit, the whole screen stops moving for a fraction of a second and you get flung in a seemingly random direction. If you hit a wall or an enemy, you also slide along that wall for a period of time. This looks good to a viewer, but when you&apos;re playing, it just feels like the controls are being yanked from your hand.
<br>
<br>CLOSING:
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sure you can get something like double the time I spent out of this game, but I&apos;d never want to do so. The game works fundamentally, but it&apos;s just not very fun after a while. The art is beautiful, but the game lags behind, trying to compensate by shoving story beats in your face.
<br>
<br>If you want pretty art and a bland game that might have you dying more than you expected, but not because it&apos;s difficult, go for it. I&apos;d wait for a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6807272">Expand</a></span>

<br>Too bad it falls short on the gameplay part.
<br>First of all, the flying mechanic isn&apos;t really great on a metroidvania. Makes exploration too simplicistic and it&apos;s not really fun overall. Should have been better with classic platform mechanics... but, well, he&apos;s an owlboy, after all.
<br>Keyboard controls are thight and responsive, and THANK GOD you can rebind every single key, a feature too often overlooked by bad games with terrible UIs, but there are too many actions bound to a single key. The right mouse click can: grab something, let you fall from flying, use/read... which means that you&apos;ll often fall by mistake or do the wrong action by mistake. It&apos;s really, really annoying. Why not allow us to bind those actions to different keys?
<br>Combat is meh. Shooting isn&apos;t very precise and the &quot;spin&quot; attack is horrible: no range, too much inertia. Basically unusable. Also, why the throw trajectory is different from the actual throw? It&apos;s dumb.
<br>The cutscenes. Oh god. Probably the worst flaw. They interrupt the gameplay CONSTANTLY and they often last too long without adding any meaningful information. Let me play, goddammit, stop interrupting me!
<br>Overall a pretty decent game who fall short on stupid, easily avoidable, issues.
<br>I really hope for a sequel to fix the problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6810451">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics were made to be pixelated, but there is no Changing Resolution Option for big Monitor.

<br>Game-play is just normal and poor from start to end. It does not have much tool, skill or ability to mesh with.

<br>You know... I&apos;ve just play the game once and do not want to replay it anymore.</span>

<br>
<br>The problem is the game forgets to be the one thing any game NEEDS to be at its&apos; core to be a success - and that is actually fun to play.
<br>
<br>Too many levels are the same thing - pick up a friend, shoot a few things or whatever, and solve puzzles. The combat barely ever changes, and the puzzles all seem samey with each stage having one puzzle that sets it out, but you then do that like ten times in the space of fifteen minutes.
<br>
<br>Everything just feels far too confined - there&apos;s only one way to do anything in the whole game, and you do it over and over again. It reminds me strongly at the faults in Final Fantasy 13 - one massive, visually impressive corridor that you trundle along doing the same things time and time again.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s irritating too, as I really wanted to like this title. As it stands, it&apos;s one of those that&apos;s worth a punt if it ever drops down to around a fiver at most.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6811016">Expand</a></span>

The main problem with this game is the action is stopped far too much to watch boring dialogue and in-game cut-scenes. The game holds your hand too much, and it is too linear. There&apos;s a lot of running to new locations killing some enemies on the way, then stopping to watch boring cut-scene, repeat over and over.. There are cool boss fights, but they&apos;re not exciting enough to merit all of the forced dialogue you have to slog through. The story is alright but the characters are not interesting. There&apos;s too much story and not enough actual game. The developer designed a game for people that like story-driven experiences with minimal effort to complete. Owlboy is exactly what I do not want my 2D games to play like, too easy and boring. If you grew up on Nes/Snes/Genesis games, and you like games like Super Metroid and Castlevania: SOTN, chances are you&apos;re gonna be bored. It looks pretty, and some people (casual gamers) are going to love it _because_ it&apos;s easy and hand-held, but I personally want to play games, not watch them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6802247">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One of the things that interested me at the outset was the idea that you carry a companion with a weapon instead of using one yourself. The mechanic ends up underutilized and generally plays as if you just carried a weapon yourself. It might have been cool if companions had health and could fend for themselves or they couldn&apos;t just teleport to your location or you couldn&apos;t switch between them so easily. Anything to make the experience more than just swapping through an equipped weapon. But as it&apos;s implemented, the companions have little character and end up just feeling like weapons that talk and occasionally leave your inventory.
<br>
<br>The pixel art is well done. The music is very well made but occasionally feels off and sets the wrong feeling for the scene.
<br>
<br>Overall, not bad, but not great. Not worth the $25 sticker price in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6796895">Expand</a></span>

I signed up for a metacritic account just to review overhyped game. Everybody seems to rave about it, but as someone who&apos;s played video games for 30 years, aside from pretty pixel art graphics,I find that the game has twitchy, annoying controls, a big, empty world to explore, overly easy and boring puzzles, a lackluster upgrade system, unengaging characters, and horribly inconsistent difficulty that ranges from a walk in the park to frustrating as hell. After breezing through the first 80% of the game, I found the last couple areas of the game suddenly no longer give any health powerups, and there are a few sections that are downright irritating. There&apos;s no sense of wonder in exploring the game&apos;s world like you&apos;d find in any Metroid/Castlevania style game. Oooh, I can collect coins. Wheee. The only reason I&apos;m giving this game even a 5 is because the graphics and especially music are superb. If you like exploration games, this isn&apos;t for you. If you like even challenge, stay clear of this game. If you like tight, precise controls, forget it. I was highly disappointed with this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6864989">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The problem is the game forgets to be the one thing any game NEEDS to be at its&apos; core to be a success - and that is actually fun to play.
<br>
<br>Too many levels are the same thing - pick up a friend, shoot a few things or whatever, and solve puzzles. The combat barely ever changes, and the puzzles all seem samey with each stage having one puzzle that sets it out, but you then do that like ten times in the space of fifteen minutes.
<br>
<br>Everything just feels far too confined - there&apos;s only one way to do anything in the whole game, and you do it over and over again. It reminds me strongly at the faults in Final Fantasy 13 - one massive, visually impressive corridor that you trundle along doing the same things time and time again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6865242">Expand</a></span>

I have completed the game, including collecting the three owl medallions. My verdict? The graphics are definitely top class, but otherwise the game has many issues.
<br>
<br>For starters, let&apos;s talk about stability. The game crashed twice, and soft-locked once... For a game that lasts around 10 hours to complete all the way through, that&apos;s not very good. The steam achievements are also buggy, locking me out of tasks that I clearly completed.
<br>
<br>Now, the controls. While I can&apos;t comment on the game when played with a controller, I can say that the mouse and keyboard controls are awkward to get used to. The game definitely isn&apos;t difficult outside of a monkey boss and the boss right before the final battle, but despite being generally not difficult the game was still frustrating when the controls didn&apos;t behave the way I expected them to. The right mouse button in particular is used for too many moves. You use it to stop flying, to grab onto things (And for some reason these things have different priorities, you don&apos;t just grab to the nearest thing), to aim something, to throw something, to go through doors... When you&apos;re in one of the two challenging battles I mention and you want the game to respond as well as you want, that&apos;s a bit unfortunate. Other perplexing control choices are using the same left click button for a shotgun blast (that takes 5 seconds or so to recharge) and a harmless flame with one character. Meaning, if you have to burn something you end up wasting that character&apos;s attack. That shotgun blast is also used for padding when putting multiple ice walls in a row, for example, that can be only destroyed with the shotgun blast. You must wait multiple times for a recharge despite there being no danger in sight. In general, the game attempts to &quot;correct&quot; the player&apos;s input way too much, which can be frustrating. For example, I wanted to make a sweet zip-line from one end of the room to the other in a stealth section, but it was impossible to make the line I wanted without the cursor locking into place into a vent... Removing said vents alerts the enemies, so this was frustrating to deal with.
<br>
<br>Other game design oddities:
<br>- An underground section where 97% of your screen is pitch black, making traversal pointlessly annoying until you find light berries, torches or a flaming lamp dude.
<br>- A poorly designed section where a ship shoots at you, and you need to hide behind rocks to avoid being one hit killed. These rocks are destroyed in a single shot too. Unfortunately, the ship&apos;s laser aim and shots go through geometry that aren&apos;t on the screen, which could have been prevented with tighter level design. As it is now, the laser could be pointing at a rock right in front of you, but as you get closer to the rock the laser aim shifts to the rock in front of it that just barely appears on the screen... Destroying your next cover that just materialized.
<br>- The throwing arc shown on the screen being completely different than the actual throwing arc.
<br>- Regular enemies posing more of a threat than most bosses, to the point where two bosses in a row are 21 copies of a regular enemy followed by a larger version of a regular enemy.
<br>
<br>The story was fine, if not a bit simple. It&apos;s similar to a CliffsNotes&apos; version of Golden Sun. The game starts off with the player being forced to act stupidly, and then the game repeats a structure of:
<br>a) Attempt to do something
<br>b) Do that thing
<br>c) That thing didn&apos;t matter
<br>From start to finish. It&apos;s one of those games where the end result would have been the same if the player character just slept through the entire thing... Which isn&apos;t necessarily inherently bad, but it didn&apos;t feel like a strong narrative to compensate for the gameplay shortcomings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6793000">Expand</a></span>

When you&#x2019;re finished with an area the game often literally closes a door behind you as if to say there&apos;s nothing you missed, just keep moving &#x2013; way to kill the mystery.  The puzzles are simple and the clues to solving them are telegraphed.  The retro Art and Music are great but the gameplay is boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6794188">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story is lovely and fits the design style perfectly. The player character is charming and one might instantly want him to succeed. The game also features good music (..mind you, i am one of those players that usually turns off in-game music by default... with rare exceptions like Transistor or Bioshock)
<br>
<br>The game mechanics are rather easy to learn but can still be challenging when being forced to use those mechanics in a frantic move or in rapid combos.
<br>
<br>The only &quot;problem&quot; i experienced was subtle (and rarely not so subtle) pop-ins ... as well as sometimes strange collision detection.
<br>
<br>All in all i can fully recommend that game for people that like a casual adventure with light puzzles and a little bit of action.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6790331">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game itself is rather simple, gameplay wise there isn&apos;t really much to praise, it doesn&apos;t have any personalization/rpg elements that, in my opinion, would have greatly improved the game.
<br>The graphics are for nostalgic pixel lovers. Honestly I think they are terrible, there is nothing attractive there and are purposely forced to look like a game from 30 years ago. There are better indie (and non indie) platform games that managed to create awesome graphics (Inside, Limbo, Ori and the B.F., Child of Light, etc.) on a 2D gameplay.
<br>For me not really worth the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6808036">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Only a few hours in and I am so invested in Otus and his friends, and where their story is going that the game is taunting me when I have to go to work.  I don&apos;t want to spoil anything for anyone, so I&apos;ll keep it very simple in my praise.  The flying mechanic feels perfect, the platforming is fun and occasionally challenging, the story is beautifully well written, and this game is just flat out fun.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t complain about price (a minimum of 10 hours of fun for $25 is pretty damn good) just buy it and enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6792078">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game will probably appeal the same audience who likes typical Disney stories of loser-turns-hero, and/or maybe those ones who feel warm and fuzzy when they see pixelated graphics; the problem is that there are much much better games for every single genre you can frame this game to be.

<br>
<br>It&apos;s definitely one of the most overrated games I&apos;ve ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6812607">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>OKS!:
<br>-Your 3 &quot;weapons&quot; that are acually people you carry aren&apos;t as interesting or game changing ast hey could have been. You have a pistol, a shotgun, and a guy who can sling you across obstacles. The sling guy is utilized well in boss fights but in the levels not so much.
<br>-A few times I questioned the design choices for instance in one scene you are riding something (not gonna give it away) and you control the vehicle only using up and down but the camera angle keeps changing and the controls don&apos;t so you are constantly having to readjust mentally. It was a small part but eh, I didn&apos;t care for it.
<br>-7 hours long. I like that personally but just something I figure people should know
<br>
<br>CONS!:
<br>-None really.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: Boss fights and the charm of the characters and story really drive it home for me and make the game great even if I have criticisms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6816910">Expand</a></span>

<br>For a metroidvania, there really isn&apos;t that much exploration but it&apos;s nonetheless fun to explore.
<br>It&apos;s the really open ended levels that stand out. There are usually lots of ways to tackle a screen, at certain places your path is blocked by enemies and at others by dangerous stage hazards like thorns. You decide how you will overcome the screen.

Quickly shifting between friends and dashing across the screen because your character&apos;s pretty fast can be really fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6916811">Expand</a></span>

But I had the feeling that the story could have been deeper and more characters could have been further developed throughout the game. Other than that, I recommend this title.</span>

<br>Combat for the first few hours of the game wasn&apos;t very difficult though it was still very enjoyable and from then on it ramps up in difficulty.   The gradual difficulty curve I found to be very smooth so no fight ever really felt out of place.   There are zones where you can&apos;t just rush through or you will be punished for sure (enemies chase you outside of their screen).
<br>My only gripe is the &quot;twist&quot; in the very end is a bit silly and left me thinking a majority of this conflict could have been resolved much earlier if the characters would have communicated better.
<br>Great game, I played through it in one day which is very uncommon for me.  The last game I spent a whole Sunday playing was Breath of the Wild and before that... who knows.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/owlboy/user-reviews?user_review_id=7332135">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I really loved this game. The graphics are great, the OST is one of the best I&apos;ve heard in a while, and the characters are excellent. My only criticism is that I never truly felt like I was able to master the controls - it never felt 100% intuitive in the way that a game like hollow knight or transistor does.</span>
