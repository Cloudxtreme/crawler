A board made of cards, deck building, resource management. handling inventories. It all comes together in a satisfying package. I played for 8 hours after it was released and wanted to keep playing. The combat is a weak part of the game and unlike in 2015 I&apos;ve played a lot more games with the countering mechanic that have done it much better. They could have innovated this aspect more. It is more of the same as last game with improvements. There are some silly ragdoll physics when you kill enemies and some of the minigames are more about RNG than skill but it is one of the few single player games that keeps me coming back and playing for hours on end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7712171">Expand</a></span>
