<br>Updated for version 1.00.
<br>
<br>Summary: Fast-Paced Wizard Chess With RNG
<br>You start in an arena with one to three other wizards. You have one of several staffs and a plethora of spells. You can summon hordes of creatures and send them into battle while you support them with your magic. Or cast Divine Blade, hop aboard a manticore, and challenge the enemy wizards in personal combat. You can bluff by summoning creatures as illusions. Entrap hostile monsters with the gooey blob. Singe your opponent&apos;s eyebrows with a magic bolt. There is a great deal of strategy involved, but luck also plays a big role in the game, making every match unique.
<br>
<br>The Luck Factor
<br>Every spell you cast has a percent chance to succeed. Every attack you make has a percent chance to kill. There are no hit points in Chaos Reborn. An action is either wildly successful or a dismal failure. This makes for exciting swings in fortune! One moment you might be sitting on top of the world because you&apos;ve cornered your opponent with a sapphire dragon, unicorn, and giant spider. Suddenly, your opponent&apos;s magic bolt kills your spider, your opponent runs the unicorn through with her sword, and your opponent&apos;s rat somehow manages to slay your dragon (an 8% chance!). Now you&apos;re on the back foot and have to do some fast thinking to salvage the situation.
<br>
<br>The luck factor can create some ridiculously funny situations in Chaos Reborn. My most fun and memorable games have involved wild swings in fortune. That being said, careful planning is still a very important aspect of the game. You must be constantly aware of your chances, maximize your odds, and prepare a backup plan in case lady luck doesn&apos;t go your way. Bluffing can also help control the influence of luck. (See below.)
<br>
<br>Bluffing!
<br>Although all spells have a percent chance to fail, you can choose to cast any creature as an illusion and automatically be successful 100% of the time. An illusion behaves precisely like a &quot;real&quot; creature: it can attack, defend, fly, and carry you around on its back if it is a mount. But perhaps an enemy wizard suspects that huge dragon you summoned last turn is an illusion. He casts Disbelieve on your dragon and it vanishes in a puff of smoke. That&apos;s the downside to using illusions. If the dragon had been real, the Disbelieve spell would have failed and your opponent would have wasted his turn! If you are a great bluffer, you can probably get away with summoning lots of illusory creatures. If you are a very perceptive person you can probably deduce which creatures your opponents have summoned as illusions and Disbelieve them!
<br>
<br>Graphics
<br>I am a big fan of the graphics in this game. The art direction is distinctive and avoids the typical visual cliches associated with well-known fantasy creatures like unicorns and dwarves. Spells and creatures identifying with the concept of Law tend to have cool colors and a rigid crystalline appearance. Spells and creatures identifying with the concept of Chaos tend to have warm colors and an &quot;entropic&quot; aesthetic. If you like unique art direction, you will love this. If you prefer predictable visuals that you can easily associate with character models from other games, this will probably not be your cup of tea.
<br>
<br>More to Come!
<br>There is a great deal more to be added in the coming months. There will be a social rank system with orders (guilds), demi-gods, and gods. Have you ever wanted to be a God? Well start gathering your worshipers because you will have that chance in Chaos Reborn!
<br>
<br>What the Game Is Not
<br>Some folks seem to be under the impression that this is a deck-building game similar to Magic: the Gathering. It really isn&apos;t. Chaos Reborn does not have thousands of spells to choose from, and you will probably never have full control over the &quot;deck&quot; of spells that you bring into duels.
<br>
<br>While this game is clearly a &quot;10&quot; for me, I also realize it is not for everybody. If you do not like turn-based games, or you dislike random number generator mechanics, this game might not be your cup of tea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-reborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=5614355">Expand</a></span>

My only complaint is that as someone who likes a solid single player experience I would prefer if it had a properly scripted campaign on top of everything else.

<br>Alot of online based systems that makes playing the game a blast whether pvp or coop. There is a coop system that is darksoulesque (ally/invader function) it really is the closest thing you&apos;ll get to xcom meets dark souls which is a combination i never thought would be so awesome!

This remake has brought the game up to date whilst keeping all of the core mechanics that made the original so endlessly repayable.  I usually play games single player but this game is best played multi player as the A.I does not give you the same challenge that human opponents can.  I like to constantly have around 20 asynchronous games on the go and find this to be a nice relaxed way of playing multi player as you can make your moves when you want and can take half an hour over your move if you so wish.
<br>
<br>Most complaints about the game are down to the RNG but this is what keeps the games so interesting and makes no two games the same.  To become good at the game you have to become a master of risk management and bluffing to manipulate the luck side of the game.
<br>
<br>I would not hesitate to recommend this brilliant game and if you are a fan of strategy games and have the patience to see past the initial impression that the game is all luck then I am sure you will love this game too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-reborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=5620552">Expand</a></span>

I would describe Chaos Reborn as Chess meets Stratego with a M:tG skin. You just can&apos;t grasp the amount of depth to the game without playing a few matches for yourself. The videos won&apos;t do it justice. Matches last anywhere from 2 mins to half and hour and they are all enjoyable.

<br>Any diehard fans of the original X-com: UFO Defense</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">An absolute &quot;must have&quot; for fans of turn based strategy. I would describe Chaos Reborn as Chess meets Stratego with a M:tG skin. You just can&apos;t grasp the amount of depth to the game without playing a few matches for yourself. The videos won&apos;t do it justice. Matches last anywhere from 2 mins to half and hour and they are all enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Any diehard fans of the original X-com: UFO Defense should probably know Mr. Julian Gollop for crafting challenging, well-balanced games with just enough divine intervention from RNGesus to keep you on your toes and Chaos Reborn is no exception. At the time of this writing I have a mere 88 hours on record, easily worth the $20 I initially paid. I enjoyed it so much I happily contributed an additional $30 to support at Wizard Lord status (granting me exclusive skins, forge tools and few other goodies, but no tangible gameplay advantages).
<br>
<br>If you like turn based strategy, board games, or X-com then grab it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-reborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=5629138">Expand</a></span>

Originally created as a re-imagining of good ol&apos; Speccy classic, this title managed to bring fresh air in almost every aspect of classy strategy play.
<br>
<br>While core mechanics seems to be purely luck based with zero skill involved at the first glance, in fact it requires from player to re-flash his wetware in order to master sophisticated witchcraft and wizardry of risk management, short-term planning, bluffing and even behavioral psychology, keeping massive impact on improvisation and enthusiastic play style.
<br>
<br>This little gem does not hesitate to constantly treat you as a newbie, without concessions. Things never will work like you want them to; for someone watching his precious 90% cast failing could be a punishing experience. The key is - hope for the best, prepare for the worst! Still, if you can&apos;t wrap your wishful thinking around Chaos Reborn, it will be better for you to stay away from RNG sorcery.
<br>
<br>That said, if you&apos;ve desperately wandering around game market in search for deep and thoughtful game with unique mechanics of chess and poker - rejoice! No doubt this game has it&apos;s own flaws, but most of them could be classified as first attempts from inexperienced little indie studio.
<br>
<br>Come on, fellow wizard, join me in this zingy journey of blobs and bolts with almost infinite replay ability and tons of fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-reborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6473958">Expand</a></span>

<br>Chaos allows you to build your own sets of equipment, shaping the likelihood of what spells you receive and creating unique playstyles and almost infinite possible load-outs. There are realms to explore and co-op play with friends with social ranks and guilds to come
<br>
<br>The real strength of Chaos however, comes from the PVP aspect , I have read reviews and comments about the RNG system making Chaos overly reliant on luck, this is nonsense.
<br>
<br>% chances of spell casts and combat resolutions are displayed on screen and choosing the timing and method of attack, which spells to boost the % of or discard, when to bluff with an illusion and which tactics to use to give yourself a +expected value for victory are skills which are all required to make a good Chaos player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-reborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6475752">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>THE THEME: At the end of the 14th century, Earth shattered into innumerable fragments in a magic-instigated apocalypse. Powerful magic allows fragments of Earth to endure as habitable, island realms scattered between planes of existence. From a planet called Limbo, wizards and gods engage in eternal conflict over who controls the many, surviving realms of old Earth. Each realm holds the promise of ancient artifacts, lore, and power to fuel the ambitions of wizards and gods alike. It is a feudal, dystopic society of magic users.
<br>
<br>THE DEVELOPER: Chaos Reborn is a rebirth and reimagining of Chaos: The Battle of Wizards (1985) and Lords of Chaos (1990) by their original creator, Julian Gollop. Mr. Gollop is more known for creating the original X-COM: UFO Defense (1994), the widely acclaimed classic which inspired XCOM: Enemy Unknown and many other games. The classic Chaos and X-COM games were rooted upon deep, tactical play. Chaos Reborn is a true successor to both legacies.
<br>
<br>TACTICAL GAMEPLAY: I cannot really do the basic gameplay experience justice in a short paragraph. It has too many tactical layers. But at essence, the game involves duels of up to 4 wizards. Wizards can invoke flamboyantly magical spells and summon creatures. Yet wizards themselves are fragile and must be protected. Imagine a three dimensional, multi-layered game of wizard chess with variable numbers and types of pieces which can come and go, and where each attack has a very real chance of failure. But if you lose the wizard, then you lose the game. Sometimes you will lose despite your best efforts, and sometimes you will win because you were lucky rather than good. That said, this game is tactically deep and, over time, rewards players who come to understand and appreciate all of the many, varied tactical approaches to gameplay.
<br>
<br>TUTORIAL: There is a tutorial labeled &#x201C;Wizard Training&#x201D; in the main menu. It comprises a series of gated set-piece encounters which gradually introduce you to the fundamental mechanics and tactics of the game. Having played the game for hundreds of hours before experiencing the tutorial, I still found it enjoyable. It&#x2019;s not often that I can say that about a tutorial.
<br>
<br>ONLINE MULTIPLAYER GAME MODES: Multiplayer wizard duels can be played live or asynchronously with up to 4 players. Matches can be friendly or ranked. And matches can be played Equipped (with custom equipment) or Classic (with standard equipment). Ranked matches allow you to qualify as an &quot;Archmage&quot; at which point you will be given your worldwide rank computed by an ELO scoring method. League standings reset in monthly seasons. Whether friendly or ranked, matches generally go quickly. As for the asynchronous games, these are my favorites. You can have up to 20 asynchronous games going at any time. Each player has many days to complete their turns in a match, but I find matches generally go more quickly than that. After ranked matches were first introduced, I completed 35 ranked async matches in just 3 days, and this was gameplay I managed in bits of free time that I had rather in continuous sittings. (I love, love the asynchronous functionality.) Additionally, players can create custom private, friendly matches, changing the parameters of the game.
<br>
<br>ONLINE SINGLEPLAYER/COOP MODE: There are developer and player created Realms of Chaos which you can explore online with your wizard. These Realms vary in size and challenge and come with a rating system to help determine which are worth exploring. The essential aspect of this game mode is to explore the map to find and defeat all of the Wizard Lords (AI-controlled mini-bosses) in order to reach and defeat the Wizard King (AI-controlled boss) of the Realm. While you are doing this, the Wizard King and his Wizard Lords summon reinforcements. And if you take too long, the Wizard King can banish you from the Realm. This game mode should not be considered a full-fledged RPG. Think of each of the Realms as puzzles to be solved, and some have stories to tell.
<br>
<br>OFFLINE HOTSEAT AND SINGLEPLAYER GAME MODES: There are offline game modes which allow hotseat gameplay against any combination of human or AI-controlled opponents.
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS: The game uses the Unity game engine, which should be compatible with most computers. The custom art and animations are quite pretty. And the game really does have its own, unique graphical theme. Don&#x2019;t rely on me for too much input on this, as I was playing the game when wizards and creatures were represented by crude, unanimated placeholder graphics. But if you really care about graphics, the graphics are good.
<br>
<br>IN SUM: As-is, the game is a gem. If you like tactical turn-based games, then spending $20 on Chaos Reborn will get you one of the more fun games in your Steam inventory. If you&#x2019;ve read this far and the game still intrigues you, then you should get the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-reborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=5613938">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Build up a wizard and fight to the death against other wizards, or work co-operatively to bring down enemies.  Each spell has a percentage chance and you can boost them if you collect mana points.  Each wizard also has an alignment (Law, Chaos, etc) and you can manipulate this to favour your spells.
<br>
<br>Overall it will be the best money you ever spend as no two games are the same, there&apos;s great strategy and tactics and it has pretty much THE friendliest community of any game I&apos;ve ever played.  Brilliant stuff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-reborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=5607794">Expand</a></span>

The best players win over and over and over and not through sheer luck. Sure, some games will go better and in a really close game luck can be the deciding factor, but for anyone who has played a tabletop game like Warmachine I would say the luck dependence for high level play is similar. The single player game is more of a communal RPG then anything else, which for me has been very engaging and very a unique experience. There is progression and customization, but for the strategy purest, all tournaments are played on a completely even playing field with no pre-game customization. I won&apos;t go in to more detail, but one can find out plenty about the game through any of a number of articles that previewed the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-reborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=5632499">Expand</a></span>

The multiplayer is the highlight because of the mind games you can play against a real person, but the single player is fun as well, incorporating an rpg metagame. Overall, amazing.</span>

<br>
<br>Why 7 as a mark then? Because of the cons:
<br>
<br>- only 60 spells (of which only 24 creatures) to cast. This is ridiculously small...
<br>- from this point: you are not able customize your desk.
<br>
<br>Your desk has about 15-20 cards in combat. The cards you have in your deck are completely randomized. You can slightly adjust deck creation randomness with Talismans and Staves, some of which can provide you 100% chance of getting a certain card in your deck.
<br>
<br>This is a 20E game, not a 5E one... Why so few spells? Why not being able to customize your deck?
<br>
<br>20EUR... No real single player campaign, only 60 spells, no faction / race, no customized deck creation... I&apos;m sorry but this is a RIPOFF!!
<br>
<br>At this point I am sorry to say that Etherlords is by far superior. Ok Etherlords is a pure Card game but it has a campaign, it is a very good &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; style game (map, buildings, resources, enemies on the map) with a great combat system (card like).
<br>
<br>Etherlords has 4 races, more than 300 spells, it has heroes and battle mode allows you to fully customize your deck. And it trades for 5EUR!!!!
<br>
<br>If Chaos Reborn at least triples the number of available spells and creatures and adds more ability to customize your desk it would be a REAL 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-reborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=5944375">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll lose many tutorial battles based on missing 4 attacks in a row with a 60% of hit-chance. Other than that it&apos;s a solid game and if you like number crunching you should give it a try.</span>

<br>
<br>The game plays out like a cross between chess, poker, and wizards, you&apos;ve got a strong tactical element to game play (like chess), but with a percentage chance of each move you make working or failing. This in itself would make for a quite simple game, until you then add in firstly a bluff mechanic (like Poker, or Liar Dice), and secondly the possibilities to both store up magic and affect the alignment of the world that you&apos;re fighting this in turn lets you mitigate your future future luck (like real Wizards do)
<br>
<br>Btw - It&apos;s technically not possible for an rng to be broken, only to be programmed, a 90% cast will be successful 90% of the time. From my experience of playing the game &gt;600 hours, this is exactly what happens. The trick is to be prepared for that 10% chance of a fail and plan your game accordingly. It&apos;s like Russian Roulette, if you&apos;ve a 1 in 6 chance that you&apos;re going to shoot yourself in the head is that a chance that you&apos;re willing to take?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-reborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6128333">Expand</a></span>

The team just kept adding more to the game and suddenly it transformed from the simple little strategy gem i admired into a full blown campaign with lots of rules and multiple styles of play. It is a fun little game for fans of X-COM, Archon, or any similar turn based strategy titles.</span>
