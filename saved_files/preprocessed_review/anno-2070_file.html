However, when you start to examine Anno 2070 as an in-depth game, it is not a long lasting treat. Unlike most of the user reviews for this game, I come in new to the series. I was excited to hear that it was a blend of city building and real-time strategy. I was disappointed to find out that, while it does blend the two genres, it falls short of being rich in either side of content. As far as a city builder, it is spectacular in it&apos;s detail. I cannot say enough about the graphics, as it is the only reason why I played so long. However, as I got further into the game, I realized how limited I was to the types of buildings I could create, especially according to range. You are limited to how you would like to structure the city by how close you construct hospitals, casinos, trade depots, etc. The problem with this is that it leads to a lack of free expression in creating a city, having to structure around the peripheral buildings. This leads to a feeling that the entire game is linear in nature - there are not a lot of options to how you can plan a city. This is not helped by the campaign, which does not allow you to deviate from the orders set forth. It is basically just following instructions. While useful to learn the ins and outs of the game, it felt as if it were a tutorial rather than a story.<br><br>In terms of strategy, Anno also failed to capture my interest. There are two factions - the Tycoon and Eco factions. Although dissimilar in nature, the idea remained the same; collect resources, build ships, fight when necessary. The deviation of what needs to be done is almost non-existent - the game is structured in a way that there is only a right way and wrong way of doing things. This hurts the replay value of the game, as well as the general strategy. Both factions have the same warships, and the lack of variety leads to hoarding and mass-manufacturing being the sole keys to defeating the enemy.<br><br>In summary, Anno plays well as a resource gathering game. Looking for it to appeal to other styles of gaming, it falls well short.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1983266">Expand</a></span>

It wasn&apos;t a fresh release where the servers are new, or even an extremely popular title in which the servers are expected to have much of a load. Regardless, and most unfortunately, no one is able to log on to Uplay (Ubisoft&apos;s mandatory DRM gateway) today on 7/15/12, and therefore are unable to play this game. The forums for Steam and Ubisoft are filled with people unable to even launch the game they paid for. If this were a newly released title, I wouldn&apos;t be bothered. Sometimes the developer/publisher just needs time to adjust to the demand. This, on the other hand, is just unacceptable. Get a torrent or something if you want to be able to play reliably. It&apos;s an incredible shame that purchasing a title legitimately results in such a headache.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=2521626">Expand</a></span>

Anno 2070 is no exception. I would give this game a 9 if I were able to play it with any consistency. This really would be an excellent game, but technical issues render it a complete waste of $50. I will not buy another Ubi game, which makes me sad because they have several good titles. That sums things up, but if you want more detail, please read on... I would not be upset with this game or its developers if I had a single issue, but this game has been a constant struggle since purchase. When I first bought the game, I had a great deal of trouble installing it. It turns out AVG antivirus and the game don&apos;t get along. Fair enough, I was using the free version of AVG anyway. I simply switched to MSE antivirus, problem solved. Once the game was installed, I experienced a crash-to-desktop that occurred somewhere between every 30 seconds and every 30 minutes, a C++ runtime error. I tried many things to resolve this, which I won&apos;t bore you with. Suffice it to say, I am quite familiar with computer hardware and software, and it was not a simple video driver issue (nor anything else you commonly see with game crashes). I contacted Ubi support (this is where things really got annoying). Even though I included a great deal of information, including a DxDiag file, I got back a very generic response telling me to update my drivers and enable graphics settings like Direct3D (if you read the DxDiag, you would see that those things are already done, as I stated in my e-mail). After a game patch, the game is a little more stable. I can typically play for 30 mins to 1 hour, but even when I can the Ubi servers are constantly down. Last night I finally had some time to play, but the servers went down mid-game. Thankfully, the game simply switches the offline mode, which does hamper your gameplay but not too terribly much. I played a little while longer and exited. Now I cannot log back into the game (which means I can&apos;t play at all) because &quot;that user is already logged in.&quot; It turns out that if the servers go down while you&apos;re logged in, you can&apos;t log out and will therefore not be able to get back in later. Judging by forum discussions, this has happened several times and I&apos;m sure it will be fixed in a day or 2. But that&apos;s exactly the issue with this game...it will work...in a day or 2. I solve one problem, and another pops up. The DRM is a nightmare, UPlay is garbage, the programming unstable, the servers a constant mess. I could forgive any one of the issues, but there are an infinite amount. If companies like Blizzard and Valve can release rock-solid titles with very few technical issues, why can&apos;t Ubi? For my $50 in the future, they have to do better. Goodbye Ubi and Anno, it&apos;s been fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=2123460">Expand</a></span>

If you don&apos;t believe me look up legendcraft on steam, and add MeatyKiwi. I am a newcomer to this series and I say that I regret not hearing about it before. Anno 2070 is indeed a mix of city building games like Sim City and Cities XL, and also RTS games like Age of Empires and Empire Earth. What the developers tried to do was create a world in which you can smoothly mix the two without going overboard on one or the other. They succeeded and created a whole new genre. Rather similar to the old ways of Europa Universalis, this game thrives based on the ways in which society was based. i.e. free trade markets. If you play the infinite type game, which has no end, the game starts you off with minimal resources and a ship. You must colonize an island of your choosing and begin manufacturing goods. Each island has its own unique resources.<br><br>The game purposely makes it hard to gain gratuitous amounts of income, unless you know how trading works. When you start producing goods, if you are clever you will produce more than your island requires. By putting these items up for sale, other factions will begin to visit your island and buy these items off you for a decent penny. You could also set up your own trade routes with your own ships and force the process faster. Or if you want to isolate yourself from the other 7 factions that is fine, but you will never get past tier 4 in the tech tree. The point I want to make is that if you want to get the most out of the game you need to open a free market for your island, and trade. This is the way the human race as achieved its standing position in the world: trade. So you say, &quot;Kiwi, trading is fine and all but tell us more about the spotlights and downfalls of the game!&quot;. I&apos;ve been pretty generous with the compliments of this game, so lets talk about its biggest downfall. The campaign...is fun but terrible to go through. The campaign is separated into 3 main missions with sub missions inside each one. Each mission carries over into the next until you go to a new main mission. This is where it gets to be a problem. When I started the game I managed to get through the first two campaign missions just fine. When I got to the final main mission, I got 3 submissions into it and realized my economy was almost irreparable. There was nothing I could do to save it because my income was negative, and I had 0 money. Sure my plants were producing goods, but not enough to sustain my population. The fact is that I slacked on thinking ahead in the first two missions. So I went back through and replayed them, now my economy is top notch and I am set to do the final mission.<br><br>On the topic of buildings. Some people say that it&apos;s the same buildings over and over, not true. There are multiple looks for each house, and you can rotate the other buildings so you get a different look each time. No city in Anno will be 100% the same unless they tried to do it.  The graphics are near flawless and it runs great. I have a normal Dell and it works fantastic. Watching all the production facilities work can be fun for hours. No production facility is the same. The water effects follow superposition of waves, which means you can do interference problems. (I have a degree in physics ^^). I found myself playing with boats in order to recreate Youngs double slit experiment. (It worked more or less if you are wondering). Speaking of time, this game is long. I recently got my first monument finished and I am working on a second. It took 15 hours in a game for me to get a monument up. This can be done much faster! In fact I could probably do it in 3 or 4 hours now. (at least putting the foundation down). The point is, if you do everything right, a monument will be a great and easy addition to your city. But...we don&apos;t do everything right so you will end up destroyed quite a bit of houses to get your monument in the right place. (unless you are clever and checked wiki). Difficulty...this game is hard, but it does get easier. Most likely it will take your 5 or 6 games before you are building things efficiently and neatly. Area use is a big property of this game. If you are clever you will use the smallest amount of area for maximum efficiency. Multiplayer...is good but not great. Most people you meet online are German or American. Either are usually willing to play with the other, just don&apos;t count on long conversations. The multiplayer is fun! If you manage to get a full map full of people, the possibilities are endless! The core of this game was built around multiplayer! Trade and peace agreements are that much more fun when it&apos;s a real person accepting or declining...or declaring war. I give this game a 9 out of 10 for great gameplay, bad campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=2099513">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, parts of the campaign are more a matter of &quot;don&apos;t think about it, just do what the game tells you to (and not more) and it will all work out.&quot;  It might not be the most exciting, but it is so complex and hard to manage a game that it will take a long time before developing an overall strategy.  If you are into resource management and system creation, then this game is well worth it.  The game looks very graphically pretty if you take the time to admire it (you will hardly ever be really zoomed in to see it though).  Don&apos;t trust the hardware-auto detect for graphics settings, it greatly underestimates your power (auto-set to low, but runs fine when I changed it to high).<br>Note: I would not suggest purchasing through the UbiShop.  Its download timeframe is short and my anti-virus considers one part to be a trojan (if anyone knows how to add exceptions to Trend Micro, please tell me), so I will likely have to download an ISO if I want to later install it with my key.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1949415">Expand</a></span>

The community is able to vote on global matters, choose a new president for the council, etc. Gameplay is fantastic, sound is overwhelming and campaign is quite interesting. You will find some minor problems such as voice acting doesn&apos;t seem to be good and some small typos in the text. However, I&apos;m pretty sure such things will get fixed on future patches. This is a must buy game if you enjoy city management. Congratulations to Blue Byte!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1956230">Expand</a></span>

Coupled with the soft-focus light filters, this literally equals a headache. At some point, the number of things you have to pay attention to and incrementally adjust becomes so overwhelming that the game becomes a chore; how long that takes is dependent upon how much patience you have with civilization-building games.

<br>The only difference between the two main factions is aesthetic; the buildings look different, and you get yelled at by different talking heads. &quot;Eco-balance&quot; is just another percentage you have to manage, like power supply; the ecological management and green technologies hinted at in the trailers simply don&apos;t exist in any measurable amount.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not a bad game, it just doesn&apos;t beat the Civilization series, Sim City 4, or even Fate of the World. In fact, Blue Byte/Ubisoft&apos;s other game in this genre, Settlers 7, is vastly superior in every aspect.
<br>
<br>Wait &apos;til you can get Anno for under 20 bucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1968153">Expand</a></span>

What I got was a game that quietly blends both together, nearly seamlessly, but fails to be exceptional at either. It feels like a &quot;Lite&quot; city builder with combat and RTS elements tagged on as an afterthought. The persistent world characteristics are neat, with people being able to take live missions and vote for the world council, but in reality it matters very little. I also found that the game has a rather annoying framerate issue, which should not happen on a PC with specs as high as mine. There is no reason Anno should jitter while games like The Witcher 2 and Skyrim run perfectly, Couple this with the always online Ubisoft DRM and it starts to become a hassle to play. I bought the game hoping for a city builder meets RTS hybrid, and what I got was an &quot;okay&quot; game that excels at neither, and is bogged down by Facebook integration, social media pandering, and draconian DRM.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=2197265">Expand</a></span>

Installation of Uplay, updating Uplay, obtaining an account, logon, updating the product once, twice, then the serial numbers. More updating again to be able to log on the game servers and be heavily distracted with what is currently regarded as the holy grail of the industry: online gaming ad nauseam. And for what ? All in all, an update with a clumsy interface. Many people like it, I do not and will probably avoid being tempted by products using Uplay and other sorts of server-centered gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=4018823">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, it also has annoying DRM and requires an Ubisoft login, doesn&apos;t offer much of any flexibility in how you complete missions, and it&apos;s also buggy enough that I couldn&apos;t finish it. The beginning of the campaign was too easy, while simultaneously taking a long time because there were poorly-explained requirements to finishing quests---sometimes, just because I had finished them before they were offered, and I had to reload to try again. If it&apos;s like the other Anno games, it will get much harder by the end, but I don&apos;t expect it can make up for the poor experience I&apos;ve had playing so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=2286051">Expand</a></span>

This particular game takes you to a slightly futuristic world with underwater cultivation is a breeze and energy shields exist. For the most part however, the world looks like modern day with oil tycoons, eco friendly people and technologists. You start with a ship, settle an island, and build a city. Each step in your cities progress requires you fulfill the peoples needs be it food, entertainment, or plastic plates. This is how all Anno games play so nothing new here... and that is the big problem. There is no innovation in this game whatsoever. Graphic quality is no better than the previous game (Anno 1404) and they actually removed some very big features that make the game a lot less fun.
<br>
<br>I wont go into every problem with the game but I will highlight the two big deal breakers which cost his game a lot of points from my score.
<br>
<br>1) Competitive AI has been completely removed and replaced with a cheating AI. Single player games are no longer fun so if you are not an online person (like myself), this game will suck the big one. In Anno 1404, the AI actually played like a real player and did many of the things a real person might do. It had to settle islands, set up an economy, build defenses and it occasionally attacked. In Anno 2070, it simply cheats. It has no economy, it has unlimited resources from the start, and only settles islands as a matter of aesthetics even though it does not need any of them. It is boring and not fun because there is no longer any strategy. The only way to win is to build a fleet and take them out or wait forever to buy out their shares of an island and take it over (because they are too dumb to buy them back fast enough despite infinite resources...) In older Anno games you had more strategies such as hoarding specific resources by claiming islands of a certain type.
<br>
<br>Next, no land combat... yep you can no longer land on an island and slowly take out major resources or just take over the island. Again, since this is gone, there is a lot less strategy to the game.
<br>
<br>Last, the Ark stinks. Its basically a big cheat and makes an already super easy game into a ludicrous joke. When you equip the ark with an upgrade, it applies to everything in the game and some items are just insanely overpowered like global ship speed increases. Other make the game even more trivial such as shortening the amount of time you need to wait to buy out island shares (normally about 9-10 minutes if memory serves me which is also boring and slow).
<br>
<br>As for new additions to make the game better... well you can now settle underwater islands... but it really is not different than any other island except you cannot have a city down there. Submarines are just like ships. They did add airplanes so that was new. Other than that it is boring. I recommend you stick to older Anno games like 1404 or others. Avoid this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=4948226">Expand</a></span>

Boy was it a waste of $30 though.   This is a classic example of why graphics don&apos;t make a video game - the graphics in this game were spectacular, but the story and the game play were seriously lacking.  The story mode was awful, the characters are so utterly annoying and unbelievable, the only dialogue is basically some whiny liberal bickering with some d-bag conservative, which, I assume, was just a pretty poor attempt at social commentary.   Building your city was awful as well.   You need to build your workers some homes - do you want to perhaps build a nice line or houses, or perhaps a high rise apartment building, or how about a group of town houses?  NOPE! There is one kind of house to build and one only (per faction).  Sure, it upgrades, but you really have no choice of building the city you want to build.  All in all, the only thing this game did for me was make me want to pull out SimCity again, which is imo the standard of the genre upon which all others should be judged.  Spend your $50 on that instead I implore you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=2474489">Expand</a></span>

The problem is that it just lacks the soul or personality of the best strategy/rts type games. The graphics are gorgeous - But be warned, the graphics were a mess on my Vista/Nvidia gt 460 rig at first (excessively bright and overexposed). Be prepared to mess with the settings until you find a proper display setting - it seems the &apos;autodetect&apos; settings break the display sometimes. Once the initial irritation of the graphics issues was overcome, I made it a few hours into the campaign before getting very bored. It&apos;s just fetch-quests, interspersed with regular building tutorials. You don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re really achieving much - those looking for a futuristic Civ game or something as satisfying as Sim City will probably be disappointed. Click on this item, click on the base to deliver it. Click on another item. Hunt down resources to make sushi for your citizens (a surprisingly difficult thing to do early game...) Yes, it&apos;s as boring as it sounds. You don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re achieving much, it&apos;s all very bland and unexciting. The &apos;endless&apos; game scenarios are better. You just freely build a city according to some requirement (like get 2500 citizens etc), which is fun for a while. Developing a pretty looking metropolis is satisfying, it&apos;s just all a bit soulless. Personality is sorely lacking, which is a shame because the presentation is great. If you&apos;re thinking of buying this, I suggest you download the demo first, because even as a strategy gamer I found this a bit of a chore and a real disappointment. I paid full price for this and even though it&apos;s a pleasant diversion, it&apos;s not worth it in my view.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1988417">Expand</a></span>

The amount of time to get from installed to actually playing was so long (included creating a uplay account, logging into some service, updating the game again through uplay even though it was just downloaded.  But, I was a trooper, and pushed through.  Unfortunately, the bland, uninteresting game that followed was a huge let down.  The menu system was slick, and looked promising, but the gameplay was bland and uninspired.  When coupled with the unwanted stuff it came with, not really using the steam system (the game is tied to your uplay account after you run it, not your steam account), this is a definite do not buy.  I feel like Tropico 4 scratches the same itch in a MUCH better package and in a much less annoying way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=3647031">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are excellent and the gameplay is true to it&apos;s predecessor&apos;s form. Somewhere along the way they forgot that part of what made the series so successful in the past was the allure of history and meeting the needs of your people. Instead they chose to focus on the industrial/environmental arenas and while that is not too bad of an idea it leaves you feeling a bit detached from any sense of connection with the population in general. Everything seems a bit rushed and hectic with bells going off, indicators flashing, message tabs etc and you feel pressured to constantly advance technology. Still a worthy game if you like city builders entwined with a bit of rts and economic management but it&apos;s not as fun as some of the previous installments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=2096462">Expand</a></span>

Anno series have always been about history, i.e. city-building and economic management in various eras of human history. The graphics are nice and the usual game mechanism is still there, but the time setting ruined everything. They turned an awesome historical game into just another futuristic crap we see popping up everywhere lately.</span>

Essentially you begin with what seems like some kind of &#x201C;Mother ship&#x201D; that looks like it just landed at some random island and now you need to colonize it with either hippie or corporate inhabitants and thrive.  Fun for a while.
<br>So basically the story is that global warming has melted the icecaps and has made most of the planet, aside from the highest mountain peaks, completely uninhabitable.  Where have I heard this one before?  And wouldn&#x2019;t the highest mountains be uninhabitable too.  This game shows these areas as beautiful and the very view of inhabitable.  Really, you would still be at the same height as it always was and the people would die from the cold.  But I digress.
<br>There are two main factions; the Eden Initiative, the good guys I guess, and the Global Trust, or the bad guys.  Each has its own high and low points like the Initiative are never short on recourses, but they expand slowly.  And the Trust will quickly run out of recourses but will expand faster.  Aside from those two things and the look of the buildings, there really is no difference between the two, in my opinion.
<br>The combat in the game is much like the combat in 1702AD, clunky and slow.  Now I love strategy games.  Sometimes I&#x2019;ll get so hooked on Civilization that I lose track on the month that go by, but this system is just so bad.  In fact, it&#x2019;s downright boring.  Though the graphics in the game are great and you can see every blade of grass as it gets ripped up and scarred by the rage of war there really isn&#x2019;t much to the combat.  They shoot and the one with greater numbers wins.
<br>There are several campaigns that add almost nothing to the game, actually most tend to just play the sandbox mode and get the experience of the scenarios in a single play-through instead of restarting every time.  And there is almost no story or immersion to speak of.  You know you&#x2019;re playing a game entire time.  There is no connection to the characters, no main character that I noticed, and poor endings.
<br>The only saving grace in this game is that it is a feast for the eyes and has an equally beautiful soundtrack.
<br>To be honest, this game should get a score of about 4, but due to the beautiful music models and textures in the game and that it does have a good amount of replay-ability, I have to give it a 5.  It is an average game with an average experience.  Don&#x2019;t go tripping over the strategy fan-boys to get this one, but it is worth getting if not for early gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=3140127">Expand</a></span>

Seeing that a publisher like ubisoft destroys all the efforts made by this stupid DRM really gets me to rage. This was the last ubisoft game i bought! Thanks!

Meaning, you upgrade graphic cards or RAM 3 times and you&apos;re forever locked out of your game! It&apos;s not simply 3 installation anymore, no sir! I&apos;m throwing in 0 to offset all those attempts at ramping up the user scores.</span>

<br>
<br>You get 3 installations of the game. Hardware update, hard drive crash and reinstall, having multiple computers in the home... tough luck. You get 3, over the total time you own/play the game.
<br>
<br>Second, you get 1 profile. Ever. So if my wife and I both want to play we share one profile, one progression, one set of upgrades, one set of choices. The best we could do is have one of us play then the other load and replay missions the other already played.
<br>
<br>I have never dealt with any company selling any product or service that treated me, as a consumer of their goods, with such utter contempt. I get DRM. I don&apos;t complain about it - they deserve paid for the things they create and sell. Yet the way it&apos;s handled on this game is over the top. It&apos;s gratuitous - it&apos;s just so Ubisoft. To take a great game with some great ideas and just stuff a raised middle finger in your face for buying it. Like they&apos;re saying &apos;HA! See if you can still enjoy it NOW, sucker!&apos; We got 4 hours out of it. There won&apos;t be any more and I&apos;ve managed to talk 3 people out of buying it, hopefully this review saves anyone else from making the same mistake.
<br>
<br>At least I&apos;ve still got 1404. As someone who&apos;s given Ubisoft hundreds of dollars for games this was the last one. The game gets a 2 because of the potential but you can&apos;t rate a game highly when it is brimming with so much contempt for its would-be consumers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=4185445">Expand</a></span>

There is no reason to choose the Ecos over the Tycoons, this is very well known to the developers as it was admitted earlier in interviews with the press, and so it turned out to be, which is in my opinion a poor effort. It&apos;s sometimes very hard to see what buildings actually do and some looks very similar, this sometimes creates issue. While the graphics are nice as always with Anno titles, 2070 is very sterile and cold, all this is also reflected in the menus, which are generally improved in functionality over those of 1404, but look cold and bald, and feel like this was done during a quick break. The usual flaws the Anno games always had are once again ignored, like the lack of a good storyline, the main campaign is more like a very long tutorial, and the side-missions in the freeplay are uninspired, dumb and mostly the same. War never was as important in Anno as it is for other games, but it&apos;s usually part of the end game, this time it&apos;s even worse then in it&apos;s predecessors.  If you are hellbent on trying the improvements in complexity and the sci-fi scenario go ahead, but be warned; for most parts it is generally unimproved and robed of the charm of it&apos;s predecessors. While Anno never was the perfect game, 2070 is only mediocre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1979672">Expand</a></span>

In my 7 years of owning that Gmail account, that has never happened to me.  USE CAUTION when registering with Ubisoft, as your information is obviously not safe.  As for the game, it was a total waste of 50.00.  Calling this game a RTS is a crime.  If you want to plant tea and rice fields for hours, this game is for you.  The tiny amount of combat in this game is laughable.  If you are looking for a RTS, move on, nothing to see here....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=2286580">Expand</a></span>

I expected high-end economic simulation, with some military elements here and there. What I got  was simplistic game, with economic elements dumbed down and dialogs and missions on the mental level of a 12 years old kid.
<br>The campaign is pain to go through, mainly because of childish plot and annoying dialogues. The free play, supposedly a most important mode of the game, is only a bit better. The most important problem is, that there is no mechanic that would make you want develop your city. Your citizens always seem to be happy with the level of goods you provide them and only by your initiative you might want to push them forward. There is no needs chain like in old Caesar games, where satisfying one requirement creates another. On top of that, your citizens serve absolutely no purpose (apart from maybe production of money that you don&apos;t seem to need that much). The factories/farms/etc don&apos;t seem to require any kind of workforce, which dumbs it down even more. On top of that, UI takes time to get used to, and tutorial doesn&apos;t seem to cover it well. There is also no way to check the rate at which your resources are used/produced so organizing of your industry takes a lot of boring observation and counting.
<br>It might seem that economic elements have been simplified in order to make room for more of a military game, but the amount (4?) and usability of battle units doesn&apos;t seem to support that at all.
<br>The MMO aspect of this game is not as fun as it might seem  occasional vote over certain matters only seem to provide small bonuses in the game, or lack of them. Interesting idea, but it doesn&apos;t really have any real impact on the game.
<br>As a merit I should probably mention beautiful graphics and seemingly large amount of elements. The game might be entertaining for the first game, and seeing through possible buildings for construction might be fun, just for exploration of possibilities. It is not a bad game in general, it just doesn&apos;t seem to have any strategic thought in it other than &quot;how should I put my building around in order them to fit in on my island(s). If you&apos;re a big genre fan  sure, give it a try, if its on sale. If not  look for other game, it&apos;s not worth your money or time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=3082931">Expand</a></span>

Hopefully I can get the game to launch once Ubisoft is satisfied with my &#xA9;ompliance.</span>

Dont be confused by some of the statements made by fans or advertisers, there is essentially no combat in this game. While there is the ability to build military ships, they do almost nothing, and the game is so heavily geared toward peaceful coexistence that going to war is a practical impossibility. So if you are looking for an RTS the likes of Startcraft 2, dont even consider this. But if you like city builders, this game is a masterpiece.<br>It is very complex. there are 16 different resources necessary to maintain your high level citizens (not to mention the fact that some products require multiple steps of production), and 5-6 building resources, some of which require multiple production resources. It is complex, and yet it still manages to be fairly intuitive. It is a game that is easy to learn, yet hard to master. It is the perfect game for building and maintaining civilizations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=2022582">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played other games with UPlay integration, such as Far Cry 3 and Rocksmith, and its annoying, but relatively painless. Anno 2070 is just god-awful in every way. I doubt I&apos;ll bother with any Ubisoft games until they sort their rubbish DRM out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=3905093">Expand</a></span>

Of course, the atmosphere is not the same as in other titles like Anno 1404 or 1701, but this game is very complex and the graphics are extremely good. This opens a new era for city-builders. We have the past, now it is time for us to build the future. 10/10</span>

Then, Ubisoft takes the game back, and you have to buy it again, as the corporate DRM takes away your right to play your product.  That&apos;s if the forced-online additional layer of DRM is working...the servers are frequently down, or crash mid-game (Single-player? Its an online all-the-time party at Ubisoft!). The game itself is probably great.  But if you buy this product, you hurt other customers too, not just yourself, because you help send the message to corporations that this type of behavior is ok.  It is not.  Don&apos;t buy this crap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=5359161">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve played a lot of missions but quite never reached the end of the production chain. Every game I play has something new, some new feature or mechanic to discover. It is really big, if you look at all the structures and technologies you will have to handle in a late game, you&apos;ll be astonished.
<br>
<br>I just cannot stop playing it. Great game for any fan of economic management, production chain handling and city building.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=4018178">Expand</a></span>

<br>I made the huge mistake of buying it, and now I can&apos;t get rid of it. I made another huge mistake when I thought I&apos;d give it another change, but after 20 minutes of Uplay updating, patching and crashing I just gave up.

The only downside for this title is the greedy approach of  Ubisoft releasing stupid-priced dlc&apos;s with nothing much more than cosmetic stuff and few units.

It is visually pleasant, moderately challenging and a joy to see a futuristic civilisation grow and prosper. The fact that there is nothing in the resource production lines that seems remotely impossible really catches me.</span>

I am a big fan of the Anno series as a whole, but this iteration takes the cake. The game play is natural and intuitive for beginners, yet still challenging for experienced players. The engine is brilliant, providing balanced game play throughout and it never crashes, as was the biggest problem with previous iterations of this series. Lastly, the graphics are magnificent. Even at mid to low quality settings the game&apos;s appearance is breath taking. In my hundreds of hours of playing I have probably spent a good 10-12 hours simply admiring what is presented in the game and what is presented. As a manager and aspiring urban planner, I found this game too good to be true. In the best way possible Anno 2070 has become an alternate reality for me and, given my interests, and vastly fulfilling creative outlet for economic management and urban design.
<br>
<br>The game is extraordinarily complex. After six months of regular playing I am still learning new facts  about the game and discovering things I have never noticed before, e.g.terrain details, interfacing options, commentary and  technology. It helps that the developers regularly update and enhance the game. For instance, after having played Anno for about 3 months I noticed that the music was suddenly different. There was an entirely new track that I had never heard before. This was quite refreshing given that my expectation from other games is that you have a 30-60 minute soundtrack on a loop that never changes. As is the theme with all Anno games, the resource supply chains are by far the most intricate element of Anno 2070 except that they are arguably even better than what is in previous versions. Instead of supplying resources for essentially one civilization throughout you can and, at a certain stage of the game, must develop resources for up to 3 distinct civilizations. If you like creating and managing resources this is a game you must try.
<br>
<br>A note on DRM. I played Sim City 5 and absolutely hated the DRM used in that game. It was intrusive, poorly planned and poorly executed. Ergo, I am a critic of DRM and generally steer clear of it. However, although many are scathing of the DRM component of this the game, I have found that it is not that bad. In fact, it is not bad at all. I would say that  it is actually a boon for the game and motivates me to keep on playing given that there are new missions, campaigns and challenges that are regularly offered only because there is a regular internet connection. And, unlike some other games, you can start, play and save this game without an internet connection. Anno 2070 has demonstrated to me that a developer can plan and execute a DRM system that is mutually beneficial for both creator and user. If other game developers adopted Anno&apos;s approach the entire issue of DRM would likely diminish into obscurity. Do not be phased about what people say regarding DRM in Anno 2070. It is a reactionary response to the idea of DRM rather than a reflective commentary of how it actually is.
<br>
<br>I have played many other games of this type (Civilization, Age of Empires, Tropico, Simcity, Rise of Nations, etc.) but this game exceeds them all insofar as you are motivated to play the game from start to finish. At no point is there a lull in game play or a point where you feel like you have &quot;figured the game out&quot; and it is just boring repetition for the same types of rewards. There is a level of repetition in the game, but it is a meaningful kind of repetition that is goal driven and exciting. This game is certainly not for everyone, but if you are like me and you like to get deeply involved in your gaming experience this is a game you must buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=4212208">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Good: Its pretty. The graphics are very nice indeed. I am only on the second chapter of the campaign and it has been fun to play. I haven&apos;t played many city builder type games and am having fun so far. Really that&apos;s key to me, you know? Is it fun? Graphics can suck but still be a good fun game. They can be beautiful and have lousy gameplay.. Simcity anyone?
<br>
<br>The Moderate: Voice acting is really sub-par. There have been moments when I just click ok to make an avatar stop talking. It can be that bad. As a new player to the genre I found getting started to be somewhat difficult in that not many things are explained well or at all. For example almost every building type needs to be directly connected to a road, so you can&apos;t build houses in rows of more than 2 otherwise the inside row will go unhappy and people will leave even though you can see people wandering off-road. Limiting and silly. The tutorialfirst mission I think could be a lot better. It seems to expect you to know what you are doing already. It was frustrating at first but I found a decent lets play on youtube which helped tremendously.
<br>
<br>The Bad (with caveats): DLC spam seems to be rampant in this one with something like 13 separate DLC packs ranging from $0.99 to $29.99. That&apos;s part of why I waited for a sale to purchase. I got all the DLC in one pack for an extra six bucks. Most of it is pretty useless, adding things like hedgerows and other minor things to build that add aesthetically but don&apos;t enhance gameplay at all. DRM... We all despise DRM especially of late with the Simcity fiasco. When this game came out if you bought it on Steam you were dealing with three! layers of DRM. First Steam, then Uplay, then the hidden solidshield Ubi built in. Also there is apparently a three activation limit. If you are avoiding this game due to these things let me explain what I found in researching this before I bought it, because I don&apos;t like DRM either and wouldn&apos;t buy it if it were an issue to me. Steam is DRM but it is useful and doesn&apos;t get in my way. If I can still play it offline then I am ok with it. Uplay... I don&apos;t like it much but It hasn&apos;t gotten in the way yet. I lost my net connection for a few hours while playing it and it didn&apos;t kick me or anything like that. Some persistent world things associated with your &quot;Ark&quot; aren&apos;t available and you can&apos;t vote on things, but aside from that you can keep playing and really aren&apos;t missing anything. I had a bit of an issue when first activating the game and had to log in three times before I could actually play the game. First logged into Uplay, then started the game and had to log in with my Uplay ID again. Refused my ID so closed the game and restarted and then it logged in successfully. Third time is a charm I guess? No issues since then. Solidshield has been removed from this game. So as of this review the only DRM you will have to mess with is Steam and Uplay, or just Uplay if you get it direct there. The activation limit is still there BUT there seems to be some misunderstanding with this. You get three initial activations. You get one activation returned to you every month. So as long as you aren&apos;t reinstalling this thing more than three times a month you won&apos;t have anything to worry about. Given that I like Steams convenience, Uplay hasn&apos;t gotten in the way, and Ubi listened enough to remove solidshield I personally had no problems with my purchase due to DRM concerns. Hopefully the above info is of use to someone and clears up what seems to be some confusion.
<br>
<br>Overall I recommend this game particularly if you can get it on sale with all the DLC in one go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=3048567">Expand</a></span>

They&apos;re a good, relatively relaxing way to spend an evening with a drink or two. Anno 2070, alas, just doesn&apos;t do it for me at all. Simply put, it feels a lot more like work than entertainment. The tech tree, such that it is, contains a staggering amount of deeply naff padding (unless, of course, you get a kick of knowing your dudes have access to vegetable sushi...), and is structured in such a way as to mean you are obliged to work through all the naff stuff in order to get to anything even remotely interesting. The whole thing feels totally contrived and arbitrary, devoid of imagination and soul. There&apos;s nothing interesting or complex about the gameplay at all. Yes, sure, there&apos;s a lot that needs to be done, but it&apos;s all a case of doing lots of simple, obvious, boolean tasks in order, then setting up some simple systems - complexity, yes, but only in the sense that doing three dead easy, boring things at once is more complex than doing one dead easy, boring thing on its own.
<br>
<br>Graphically, it&apos;s rather pretty. That said, the lack of obvious distinction between building types doesn&apos;t exactly add to the fun. Playing &quot;hunt the sushi factory&quot; gets real old, real fast, especially given that the restrictions on building placement (building is restricted to a radius of certain other buildings) and the apparent disregard the population have with regards to what they live next to leads to a somewhat less than logical approach to planning.
<br>
<br>Oh, I forgot the campaign. It&apos;s got one. It&apos;s not exactly what I&apos;d call one of gaming&apos;s great memorable experiences. Do some linear stuff, follow the built-in advice, win. Yeah, cool.
<br>
<br>So, to sum it up, if your idea of great night&apos;s entertainment is working as a taxi controller whilst filling in your tax returns, get Anno 2070. Actually, on second thoughts, why not just get a job as a taxi controller and take some accountancy classes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1975903">Expand</a></span>

The game is incredible complex, and the attention to detail is what makes the game one of a kind. So many different kind of supply chains yet the interface allows you to easily keep track of which area you need to work on. A great and worthy successor to Anno 1404!</span>

Anno 2070 is dogs balls boring, dont waste your cash, the pretty graphics and eco sound track are nice but there is no game here to be had hence the score of 2.  Despite being patched to the very latest version of the game there are still bugs like a strange warning about running out of memory when I can alt tab and see there is easily 1.5GB left on my machine.  You cant even buy a unit to defend yourself until you have ascended to level 3 which takes about 3 hours! The original civilisation or starcraft games kick this game for six and they came out like 10 years ago.. ok rant over with ...

Just like the rest of the Anno series, this game presents hours of appeal and challenge for all style of sim/strategy gamers.  It can be as easy or tough as you wish to make it, and that&apos;s not even messing with the game settings.  You can chose to be one of 2 factions, or eventually in your game progression take on aspects (fully if you wish) of both AND a sub faction!  And the truly fun part about it in my opinion is that it&apos;s not just about throwing up tons of production buildings and building a massive army to conquer the world... actually, wait... strike that, it can be about that!  Or you can balance trade and diplomacy and have allies fight for you.  Or not even fight at all!<br><br>The touch of balancing an ecosystem at the same time is fantastic!  Fantastic in the fact that you don&apos;t have to necessarily balance the ecosystem at all if you don&apos;t want.  Whether you don&apos;t mind strip mining an entire land down to bedrock to grab as much resources as possible early on or tactfully balance your production and resources for the long run without having to pickup and move around in search of more is really fun.<br><br>This is one of the truly first games I&apos;ve ever played where the replayability is so high because you can completely tweak the way you play even when your halfway through a game already.  This game is well worth it to purchase off the get-go!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1991967">Expand</a></span>

It is great for city-building/management games fans: nice graphics and always something to tweak or improve. I should complain that much of the game is recycled from Anno 1404 and while there are many new things, essentially the game feels much like future total conversion of 1404. Other things I&apos;m a bit disappointed is the lack of proper AI-opponents in continuous play. Instead you only get NPC-type third parties that do expand and interact with you. I&apos;m not yet 100% sure if I like them a bit less or much less than &quot;real&quot; AIs.<br><br>Overall I find myself spending hours and hours of time playing this game which should be enough to speak for itself. This game is hardly innovative as almost 90% of the content has been seen in previous Anno-games in some form or another but it is high quality and well refined.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1969390">Expand</a></span>

I never played any Anno games in this series and only played this one, but this game is really something. The features of World President voting and Current &amp; World Events are not implemented in other RTS&apos;s on the market right now. Everything in the world affects your game! The graphic is beautiful, the music is enchanting, and the game-play will keep you up for hours just like the Civilization series. This is not a traditional RTS game where you can build units really fast and go crush the enemies. It is more than that, and it makes the word &apos;strategy&apos; more important than ever. Multiplayer is hard because this game takes time, but there is a save and load system that works for multiplayer so you can shoot up a map alone, and then have someone join you later in multiplayer. Please buy this game and support Blue Byte, even though we all know Ubisoft DRM policy is ridiculous. This game is a real gem and I have not seen anything like it before. There are lots of things you can do in the game and lots of NPC&apos;s to interact with and lots of special items that you can discover. You will not regret buying this game, because it will makes you really happy when you see your islands fill with bustling futuristic cities, pretty worker robots deliver your goods, and your production buildings busy producing things for your cities. The underwater world is also very pretty and crucial to your nation&apos;s development. Everything about this game is great!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1983307">Expand</a></span>

Even the colours used in the environment are darker to that of anno 1404. Everything feels more natural than the little cartoonish setting of anno 1404. This might be better for some, but for me this is a drawback as I play games to take myself away from reality. Rest everything is great. The underwater addition is good and having 3 playable factions is better (though you play 2 at any particular time). If you look in the details then anno 1404 had more detailed animations i.e. you saw more people working in the fields and doing stuff. Here everything seems to be done automatically by machines. So overall, great game to play but the game environment is a bit of a letdown from anno 1404.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1989402">Expand</a></span>

The main difference between 2070 and earlier iterations is the setting. They have created a believable near future where the world is mainly under water. The graphics representing the setting are nothing short of astounding. The mechanics of the game is nothing hudely different from earlier games. The production chains are similar as our the the city building mechanics. There is a welcome addition of two different factions. You can choose whether you want to be the green loving Eco&apos;s or the polluting Tycoons, both with different buildings advantages and disadvantages. You are also able to build underwater bases and Science faction buildings. All in all this makes for a diverse game. The one problem with all the games has returned with 2070 though. There is no real way of making the city your own. Like a maths puzzle, you figure out a way of working it out and then the only challenge is refining your workings out. There are hardly any decorative buildings and the area limitations on buildings mean you are limited as to how you place your buildings. I would say the lack of city customization is really the only thing holding back the Anno games from being classics!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=2104568">Expand</a></span>

I played it for a few days and just got tired of it. I can&apos;t put my finger on anything that made me tired of it, I just put it down.</span>

We are in 2070, the glaciers have melted and the water has risen submerging much of the globe surface and leaving only strips of land and islands. We find and manage to colonize these islands. We can choose 3 main factions: environmentalists, scientists, industrialists and technology. We build cities, extract resources, improve technology and colonize other islands. We will also build underwater laboratory to extract resources from the seabed, open trade routes with other players, and once colonized other islands, to shift resources from island to island (or as-game, for those who played, you had to move resources from planet to planet). Graphics very beautiful, with buildings and structures very well animated and imaginative. Very interesting that the online community game, in which (in addition to multiplayer) every time we vote for the governor&apos;s World, which give different benefits depending on the candidate. Once all players have voted the world, all of the privileges of the governor goderemo winning until the next elections. The campaign is not fabulous, but there still so much fun to do as a free construction. I was likely to buy it, but once I played there are more detached. Outstanding, very special and innovative.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2070/user-reviews?user_review_id=1995412">Expand</a></span>
