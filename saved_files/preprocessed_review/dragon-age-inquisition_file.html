After playing another 20 hours (to a total of 30) I still can&#x2019;t enjoy the game as much as I would like and as much as I&#x2019;d hoped to enjoy it before the release. The biggest problem with the game is probably that my expectations were really, really high. I still remember the pleasant surprise DA:O was; hence, it&#x2019;s difficult for me to review DA:I in isolation, without the baggage of its predecessor.
<br>Here it goes:
<br>Pros:
<br>Locations, some are really, really gorgeous.
<br>Some dialogues, especially those companion-related in Skyhold.
<br>Some quests/plot events.
<br>And that&#x2019;s about it. The game, even as a generic RPS, is generally mediocre. So it&#x2019;s difficult to list more clear advantages.
<br>Cons:
<br>Sloppy, unwieldy controls. No auto-attack, auto-loot, auto-interact (walking up to every single thing instead of just clicking on it can be tiresome).
<br>Terrible combat mechanics.
<br>The graphics aren&#x2019;t great and the game is terribly optimised.
<br>The quasi-open world.
<br>A MMO/grinding feeling.
<br>Boring, pointless side quests.
<br>Dialogues &#x2013; the choices seem pointless, irrelevant and the 3-4 word description often does not match what the Inquisitor actually says.
<br>Disappointments:
<br>Plot! DA:O made sense, you were saving the world, but in a reasonable fashion. The lore was enthralling. In DA:I they overdid it. And made it inconsistent: you are the inquisitor, the saviour of Thedas. But go and fetch some blankets for refugees and find a lost bull.
<br>Dialogues, and I mean it. They don&#x2019;t seem natural. And they don&#x2019;t give enough control over what&#x2019;s going on.
<br>The combat is really underwhelming. Paired with terrible controls in general, playing the game and advancing the relevant plot often feels like a chore.
<br>The artificial, plastic feel and look of the game. The NPCs don&#x2019;t seem natural. Just think about the grand ball (that was a potentially great quest, one of the best in the game) &#x2013; a courtyard full of nobles and nobody notices you climb a wall.
<br>Overall, DA:I, the successor of DA:O, instead of being a great RPG, is just another game. It</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4854446">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What it comes down to with Inquisition is that the game is tripping over itself to tell you how crazmazing, important, and fabulously central to the universe you are, and yet in every respect that matters, you don&apos;t feel that way at all.  In fact, in the day-to-day playing of the game, you feel like a chump.
<br>
<br>How do I mean that?  Well, example:  I&apos;m patronized and worshipped by everyone ever because of my super sweet and special hand tattoo.  I don&apos;t earn any of the respect I get.  I have no sense of anchorage to the world or my character beyond an impersonal memo at character creation.  And yet past the first twenty minutes of play, I&apos;m treated like the LITERAL second coming of Christ.  Yes, Andraste = Jesus.  I could do a whole review just about the paper-thin veil stretched over medieval Europe by this game, but it&apos;s completely beside the point I&apos;m making.
<br>
<br>Okay, meaty example: I&apos;m the grand inquisitor of awesomeness.  I sit on a throne.  I make judgments.  My fortress is a **** epic keep at the top of the world.  It is rad as ****  I&apos;m feeling that, right?  And yet while everyone else in the main fortress area gets to wear their slick armor and gear, I&apos;m forced to wander around in what I can only describe as my &quot;battle pajamas.&quot;  It feels awkward.  I&apos;m like some checked-out executive showing up to the office in a tattered bathrobe with six days of stubble on my face.
<br>
<br>&quot;Inquisition?  **** guys, we&apos;re still doing that?  Oh, ****  Two executions today?  Lemme get my sword thing you guys gave me that I can&apos;t use outside of cutscenes... **** me, my head hurts.&quot;
<br>
<br>Another example:  I&apos;m the big important inquisitor.  And yet it feels like 90% of my play time is spent bent over like a day laborer looting corpses and harvesting weeds.  While my three painfully deferential companions just stand around staring at me work.  Guys?  No help here?  No?  I&apos;m the de facto leader/messiah and I&apos;m on **** duty with the looting and harvesting?  I&apos;m on **** duty with the fedex quests and requisitions?  Really?  I can&apos;t delegate this ****  Okay.  I&apos;m starting to feel like all these &quot;I&apos;m in awe of you&quot; conversations we keep having are a little bit sarcastic.  I feel like you guys are being passive aggressive right now.
<br>
<br>The game needs a ****ing hatchet-man to come through and butcher 2/3rds of the content.  I seriously cannot walk twenty feet without tripping over some kind of landmark, objective, quest, map marker, letter with a quest on it, corpse with a quest, etc.  After a while I just stop reading things.  Which is a shame, because Inquisition is a gold-tipped pyramid of writing labor.  I&apos;m pretty sure there are skeletons sealed into the code of this game.  It has been described by many professional reviewers as &quot;monstrous&quot; and &quot;titanic&quot; and &quot;huge&quot; and I definitely agree.  It&apos;s a lumbering behemoth of sheer content.  This game will crush you under the weight of its boring sidequests no one gives a **** about.
<br>
<br>Even worse are the &quot;plot tokens&quot; you accrue to advance the story.  You earn plot tokens by doing side crap.  Yay.  Can&apos;t advance the plot without your plot tokens.  This game literally has a coin-operated storyline.  You don&apos;t get much more corporate crapfest than that.
<br>
<br>And honestly?  It&apos;s a god damned shame.  Because when I explore intricate conversations about elven history and the Fade with Solus, I begin to see some of the hidden brilliance of the setting.  I start to see in a few hidden corners the vision that could have been.  We could have had a powerful work of RPG art here, but somewhere along the line some cigar-chomping executive was like &quot;Crafting, see?  People love the crafting these days.  Gotta have the loot, see, gotta have them purple gears, see!  Make it happen, see!  And throw in some&apos;a them achievements!&quot;  And then the beauty of DA: Inquisition was buried in a mountain of superfluous **** and &apos;features&apos; while the core of the game atrophied, suffocated, and died.
<br>
<br>Mandatory level restrictions on items.  How many times have I looted a sweet item only to see I can&apos;t use it for three more levels?  What the **** is this ****  I thought the whole point of playing a single-player RPG was to get away from this kind of arbitrary MMORPG crap?  What, exactly, is differentiating this game from an MMORPG, at its mechanical core?  (Dialogue notwithstanding).  My god, there&apos;s even a giant mount collection and tons of achievements to whore.  It&apos;s chilling.  It just all feels like a gigantic waste of time.
<br>
<br>And with the removal of things like persuasion skills, the game has officially descended into &quot;why even bother&quot; territory for dialogue.  One of my fondest memories of a CRPG was talking The Master in Fallout into killing himself.  That sort of skillful master stroke doesn&apos;t seem possible in Inquisition.
<br>
<br>Whatever.  I keep trying to finish the game, for my friend&apos;s sake.  It&apos;s hard.  I feel like a jerk.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4799159">Expand</a></span>

Its games were epic. More importantly, they had heart. Players felt one with the worlds (and universes) that the company created. This was certainly true with Knights of the Old Republic, Baldurs Gate, Mass Effect 1 &amp; 2, and Dragon Age: Origins. These games are timeless and will always have a place on my shelf even as other games come and go. But DA: Inquisition lacks something. It lacks emotion. It lacks heart. Over its last 5 years, Bioware has catered to the lowest common denominator of gamers. Now owned by EA, Bioware is destroying its brand for mass market appeal. Inquisition is a boring hack and slash that is one part RPG and two parts MMO wannabe. Even worse, it&apos;s not optimized and horribly buggy. Inquisition lacks elements that made DA: Origins great while delivering tons of frustrating problems we shouldn&apos;t see from a venerable developer.
<br>
<br>Foremost, DA:I is buggy garbage. Its hardware demands are outrageous even on modest settings. On Ultra it merely looks OK. But older games like The Witcher 2 and Far Cry 3 look better and require less power. Overheating is a persistent issue with Inquisition. And I thought Shadows of Mordor was a resource hog. Nope. DA:I wins the prize. Even this year&apos;s terrible Wolfenstein performs better. That&apos;s saying a lot. Constant fps drops, abysmal tactical view, and stilted character animations break the immersion. The tactical view should&apos;ve been one of the best features of the game. After all, DA:Origins provides a pretty good template to follow. Right? Nope. In DA:I, the camera gets hung up on nearly everything. Plus, other problems with the game render it pointless. Most of the time, DA:I won&apos;t acknowledge my 360 controller. So I have to log completely out of my desktop, log back in, turn on the controller, and then open the game. If that process doesn&apos;t fix the issue, I have to close the game, disable my controller in hardware settings, enable it, then open the game again. Sheesh!!
<br>
<br>Gameplay is a mixed bag. Companion AI is stupid and useless on harder difficulties. So constant babysitting is required which makes fights more frustrating (I should say annoying) than they should be. Commands cancel each other out, and characters generally won&apos;t perform the actions you specify. The deep AI customization of DA:Origins is not perfect, but better than the tripe served to us here. Inquisition&apos;s worthless companion AI and buggy tactical camera means the game is hardly playable. These problems affect the game so adversely I can&apos;t recommend playing it on Nightmare.
<br>
<br>Leveling up is a bland affair. Forget attributes such as strength, cunning, and dexterity. The game allocates those points on the player&apos;s behalf. Bioware obviously believes more options would confuse its new mass market. Diablo 3 does the same thing, and fans don&apos;t appreciate it there either. For players who want a two-handed warrior focusing on dexterity and not strength. Nope. You want a mage with huge mana pools and low health. Nope.  A strength-focused rogue? Nope. But players can craft. Oh yes, who doesn&apos;t want to spend hours searching for elfroot or crafting shoes? Every warrior must have secret dreams of being a cobbler, or blacksmith. *Roll eyes*. Armor ought to be buried in a crypt so I can don it after an epic boss fight. Simple. Rewarding. Better.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is laughably bad. Characters sound like they&apos;re gargling marbles. Sometimes I turn down the volume so my ears don&apos;t explode. And the music, or lack thereof, is completely uninspired. The story lacks urgency. And why would should players feel pressure to save the world? Bioware would rather players craft obsidian fanny packs or whatever. The world is shallow, and attempts at depth come thru corny voice acting and hokie faux religious dogma.
<br>
<br>And then there is the tacked on multiplayer. It sucks. Dragon Age was a fine series without it. But EA ramrods multiplayer into every game. All wasted resources that could&apos;ve been used to fix the dozens of problems with the campaign.
<br>
<br>This review is not as thorough as I&apos;d like, but I honestly have nothing positive to say about the game. Inquisition is so buggy it&apos;s a beta. Another product rushed to market by EA. EA&apos;s philosophy of sale a buggy game first then fix it later is EA figuratively putting its middle finger in the face of gamers. With every release EA is saying a big &quot;F U&quot; to players.
<br>
<br>Overall, Inquisition is a failed effort by Bioware to relive its glory days. The game is a step back in all the areas that made Origins epic. Instead, Bioware pushes the same tired elements on players which have worn out their welcome in every other rpg/mmo. Namely tedious crafting, fetch quests, and stripped down leveling systems. So many elements are tacked on, I doubt Bioware and EA are trying anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4874764">Expand</a></span>

This game was made for consoles first, then ported to PC. That doesn&apos;t have to be a bad thing, but the controls is, sadly, so messy on PC. The UI is also nothing short of confusing. The quest tracking system and the map is horrendous. You can&apos;t make a game like this for consoles, then copy it directly to PCs without altering the UI. I know this is a new trend by now, but I would say that PC gamers has more or less been left behind here. We are forced to endure these horrible console-like controls (Hold Mouse 1 to autoattack? Comon man). They&apos;ve had so much time to develop this game, surely they should be able to somewhat create a proper UI and proper controls for PC. Also, this new trend with locking FPS at 30 or 60 is just complete **** I
<br>
<br>The story is alright, but not impressive. DA: O is still, by far, one of the best RPGs of our time, and DA:I pales in this comparison. However, It&apos;s still interesting enough that I will score this game 5/10 since the storyline is keeping it up.
<br>
<br>Also another thing: This game is riddled with small glitches and bugs. I can&apos;t help but think that EA might have rushed bioware to release this title. I&apos;m using the latest drivers for my system (also installed the latest beta driver from AMD for my grahics card, which have some optimizations for DA:I) but still, there&apos;s a lot, and I mean a lot of work to be done in this regard. Stuttering, micro-lag, FPS issues you name it. It&apos;s normal for a game to have issues in the beginning, but EA keeps making the same mistakes of rushing games to be released, instead of waiting so the game can receive better quality testing.
<br>
<br>Because of this game, I look even more forward to the Witcher 3. You have to respect companies like CD Projekt, whom creates games solely for PC with amazing graphics, and then subsequently creates a potato-version of that game, so the consoles can run it as well. It shouldn&apos;t be the other way around. I&apos;m tired of playing potato-like games on my superior gaming rig. :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4755731">Expand</a></span>

From the intro of origins I was captivated by the story and was left wanting more which continued as I learned more about the world during time spent playing. Playing DA:I leaves me uninterested, I could care less about anything said or written in notes or books. Origins pre expansion had nearly perfected the game mechanics for the style of game that it was. The executions were a point of thorough satisfaction. Origins had tactical and intelligent game play that created challenge for the player. Upon playing DA 2 I was terribly disappointed by the changes but it still managed to be good enough to play. I forced myself through six cumulative hours of DA:I after having repeatedly exited the game because I couldn&apos;t take playing it any longer. During this play I found myself desperately desiring to go back to the disappointing game that was DA 2 and had constant nostalgic memories of Origins and what it was. Upon reaching a town of rich noble characters that were all dressed up in Assassins Creed style masks and checkered outfits, I&apos;ll never play this again. The first boss fight consisted of right clicking a green rift in the sky to remove his invulnerability then hold auto attack until he died. There is no strategy, you are not needed to participate, your party can kill everything. Any given battle takes no thought and is over within seconds. Melee combat is awful even by action mmo standards, Neverwinter Online would have it beat hands down. DA: I is a single player mmo, with large areas for you to run around and collect evenly spaced iron deposits. Apparently they beleived people did such things because they thought it was fun. Filled with errands to kill ten rams and bring back meat for the refugees.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4867558">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is just boring. Oh and the interface/menu/basically everything is just ridiculous to use with mouse and keyboard. It&apos;s just a lazy console port.

<br>First off, look at the User Score, then the &quot;Critic Score&quot; on this</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">You! Yes, you! The person who is reading this because they correctly came to Metacritic thinking &quot;The &apos;professional&apos; reviewers can&apos;t be trusted because they are paid shills, lets check the user reviews on Metacritic&quot; I am talking to you when I write this review. Every bad user review on this game is true. Listen up.
<br>
<br>First off, look at the User Score, then the &quot;Critic Score&quot; on this site. What a friggin&apos; joke.
<br>
<br>Everyone is absolutely correct when they say this game feels like a completely empty, lifeless, dead, static, single player MMORPG. The majority of the &quot;content&quot; in this game is just collecting stupid things like flowers and bits of ore and animal meat, just to complete MMO style check lists. I mean, the quests to &quot;collect x out of x&quot; even appear in the top corner of the screen like friggin&apos; World of Warcraft! This is an MMORPG without the &apos;MMO&apos; part, and VERY little of the &apos;RPG&apos; part too!
<br>
<br>I have absolutely no flipping idea what the developers were even thinking or doing during the design meetings for this game. I cannot imagine how anyone in their right minds who was behind the development of this game could ever consider for even a second that it was a good game they were making.
<br>
<br>This game is NOTHING like Dragon Age Origins. Dragon Age II is even better than this! Yes, really! This game is completely hollow of life and devoid of any of the previous magic games of Bioware&apos;s past have. I spent money on this game, and severely regret my decision.
<br>
<br>Not only is the game hollow, and dead feeling, but Bioware decided to cram as much social justice politically correct crap in it as possible. If you DO end up playing this game, you&apos;ll see exactly what I mean. The entire &quot;romance&quot; system of this game is like fan-fiction from a 14 year old&apos;s Tumblr blog. Seriously, its horrendous, completely artificial, forced, and makes you cringe. Maybe instead of Bioware trying to be &apos;edgy&apos; with their romance design decisions they should have focused on putting real &apos;content&apos; into the game.
<br>
<br>That leads me to my next point, the lie of &apos;content&apos; in this game. If you&apos;ve looked up any promotional material for DA:I, then you have probably seen the claim of &quot;over a hundred hours of content!!!!&quot; thrown around. This is a flat out, bold-faced, bait and switch lie. The &apos;content&apos; they are talking about is you, the &quot;hero&quot; and &quot;savior&quot; running around in grassy fields collecting flowers/plants/ore pieces/animal meat/etc. for hours on end in order to complete totally pointless side &quot;quests&quot; that are there EXCLUSIVELY for filler so they could put &quot;100 hours of content!&quot; on their advertisements. Do you know the term &quot;The Ubisoft effect&quot;? If you don&apos;t, it means this: &quot;Lets throw as many stupid and useless/pointless icons on the map and call it side quests/content in order to be able to claim ridiculous fluffed up game length!&quot;
<br>
<br>The characters are also bad. Just flat, uninspired garbage. The voice actors may be the same for some of them from past games, but thats where the similarities end. When you talk to them you feel like they are there just because they &quot;have to be because its a &quot;Bioware game&quot;.
<br>
<br>I am trying to save you money. That is what I am trying to do when writing this review. And no matter what the price for this game is, it is not worth it. I feel extremely saddened having to say all of this, because I LOVED Dragon Age Origins, and even liked Dragon Age 2 for what it had. I also used to love Bioware.
<br>
<br>Bioware is gone, and that makes me very, very sad. They have joined the ditch around back of the EA building where Westwood has been laying dead for years, among a dozen other game studios. When Bioware sold out, the promised this wouldn&apos;t happen. Well everyone who promised that has since left Bioware, so what does that tell you? The name is just a shell now. A shell to slap on game covers in hopes that loyal fans of this previous great studio will purchase a game based off of nostalgic experiences.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t fall for the trap. EA did exactly what they also do. Buy up a studio, use the name to sell some games, bleed it dry, and let it die.
<br>
<br>Avoid at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4760669">Expand</a></span>

<br>In order to prevent the end of the world by the hand of little green floating demons who shoot tiny balls an ancient order called the inquisition(grey wardens) is restored with the mission to close all the rifts(oblivion gates) by exploring a map whose structure you&apos;ll be very familiar with, if you ever played Far Cry 3 or Tomb Raider,  and drinking potions(estus flasks) that replenish at supply crates(bonfires) and killing enemies by swinging their weapons in the air in a similar fashion of any modern MMO.
<br>
<br>Have fun aligning plenty planetastrosomething constellation minigames and completing mindless side missions for no absolute reason and with no absolute challenge besides running towards the marker on your minimap until you forget whatever the hell you were supposed to do in the first place and thank the gods you torrented this game and didn&apos;t waste 60 bucks on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4857099">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. The controls are horrible. It&apos;s clearly a console game ported to PC, and done poorly. It&apos;s like playing with a mouse and keyboard was an afterthought....No click to walk, no click to loot...No click to target...
<br>2. The story, is not engaging at all. Right out the gate, they throw you into these mundane MMO style quests, that although they are somewhat loosely tied to the main story, are not engaging or interesting.
<br>3. The graphics, are OK. Mediocre at best, nothing impressive for a game of 2014. Im running it max settings, and my Skyrim looks as good if not better (and how old is that game?)
<br>4. The menus are clunky, and not user friendly.
<br>5. Not a lot of variety in character creation. I know that dragon age has not been known for its character class diversity, but seriously, this is such a dumbed down, watery version of what RPGs used to be like, its depressing.
<br>6. The talent trees are very shallow and basic.
<br>7. Overall, i&apos;d say this game plays like an MMO, that was never quite completed, and just ended up being a single player game. I tried, really, really hard to like it, but in the end, I just ended up being bored. Stupid me for buying the hard copy, otherwise I would have contacted EA for a refund.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4818348">Expand</a></span>

<br>The filler &quot;quests&quot;. Collect this, collect that, collect those stones to open three colour doors. Yeah, that makes me mad. That makes me really mad, Bioware. Instead of giving us time-killing nothings to compete with juggernauts like Skyrim why don&apos;t you give us a competent storyline; something you haven&apos;t done since Mass Effect 2?
<br>
<br>The one saving grace are the interesting characters that kept making come back and playing, they made me &quot;FEEL&quot; something.
<br>
<br>The combat is dreary and repetitive, the number of abilities and customisation of said abilities is severely downgraded from the previous titles.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately I couldn&apos;t make myself keep playing, and I&apos;ve left it to fester within its case. Never again will I pay this much money for something that has disappointed me so very harshly. I&apos;ve learned my lesson.

<br>Delterius: What more can be said? Combat is mindless, exploration is tedious and what could otherwise be an enjoyable story is gated behind them. And this was RPG of the Year on countless gaming sites! Its development dances well to the status quo of the industry. It has sufficiently high production values to allow the professional blogging scene to praise it to the highest of heavens without losing face. Never mind that it brings absolutely nothing new to the RPG genre. Years from now millions of people who don&apos;t know any better will cite its name as proof that Games Are Art. But the truth is that Inquisition is nothing more than an exercise in treating players with a great deal of condescension. I can sympathize with the notion of simplifying a series in order to attract a wider audience but by God, I can&apos;t in good faith recommend Dragon Age: Inquisition even as a casual experience. It just isn&apos;t fun.

I just created my account for the sole purpose of writing this review. I&apos;ll keep is short and sweet with relevant info only.  Taking into consideration that DA:O was one of my favorite games of all time, here is my opinion on DA:I:
<br>
<br>1.) This is not an RPG.  It&apos;s an action game.  The macro system that let you completely customize your followers behavior in combat has been ruined completely.  It is not dumbed-down to 4 total options and the AI is awful.  You can&apos;t even place your own stat points when you level, making me wonder why development even bother to make them visible.  This is a thinly veiled insult to true RPG gamers that value character customization.  This would make a good game for my 6 year old son on a console.
<br>
<br>2.) This is not a PC game.  This is a console game.  I&apos;m not here to bash on console games or gamers - I play quite a few myself.  I&apos;m simply stating that the depth and breadth of granular control possible only with mouse and keyboard was not an important factor to the developers of this title.  In fact, I find the game nearly unplayable with a mouse and keyboard.  This is mostly due to the terrible camera controls and the lack of an auto-attack and mandatory animation with each (accidental) attack.  Gamepad is mandatory.
<br>
<br>3.) The story line is, in my opinion, awful.  Characters are terribly cliche without the quality back stories of previous DA characters.  The use of the garrison and war room and such does nothing to add to the quality of the story or the perception of control.  It&apos;s just clunky.  I do not enjoy any of it. Choosing and such is a confusing and pointless exercise that I find painful and wish I could skip.  The NPCs in the game are nothing more than cardboard cut-outs.  Seriously, If you enjoyed Skyrim you will probably think this game is a joke.
<br>
<br>4.) This point is probably the most important.  They hype and the reviews around this game highlight the ONLY thing that EA/Bioware have done perfectly in this game:  Marketing.  They spent a lot of money on this hype.  Based on what I see in the Critic Reviews, I have to assume that they spent a lot of money on those reviews too.  It is ALL lies.  Bought and paid for.  You have been deceived by a marketing campaign that intentionally lied to you to steal your money.  Even here on this site!  User Score 5.8?  I&apos;ve been reading through all the reviews here for hours, in utter fascination.  So few positive reviews, but somehow the game still has a 5.8.  The only thing I can think is that 0 reviews must not be counted?
<br>
<br>If DA:O set the mold, this is NOT a Dragon Age game at all.  This is an impostor that stole from the world and the story. It almost feels like the REAL Bioware should pop up at any moment and and file a suit for theft of Intellectual Property or something.....  This game is awful and I&apos;ve never felt more cheated, lied to or robbed than I did in my first few hours with this title.
<br>
<br>Right now, I am going to scour the web for true Critical Reviewers that gave this title the score it deserves and I will use them moving forward as my sole source for future reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4844722">Expand</a></span>

I just stick to companies that I trust [like, up to some point Bioware], companies whose products are reviewed by not-on-payroll-people and companies that via the Kickstarter build my trust and make me invest in future projects [Wasteland 2 recently].
<br>With Bioware it&apos;s been one hell of a ride. Their past achievements will always be something amazing, games which brought me a lot of joy and kept me from eating and sleeping night after night ;-)
<br>
<br>I understand the need to &quot;change&quot;. To &quot;targer new audience&quot; and &quot;develop&quot;. But what they did to DA franchise - starting with DA2 - is a clear sign of &quot;where the money is at &quot;. After DA2 I promised myself I will not fall for the pre-order hype again. Yet I did. Based - again - on reviews from people who were NOT end-product-gamers, based on my big love for DA:Origin and based on what Bioware kept saying. That they &quot;learned a lot&quot; and will &quot;not make the same mistakes again&quot;. But they did.
<br>
<br>After first 20 hours I can agree that the world is huge, characters are - to some extent - memorable, there is a TON of content, graphics [for me, hardly a crucial thing in terms of enjoying a great game - P:Torment anyone?] are very nice and the game has a great potential to become BIG. BUT. Answer me this.
<br>
<br>How can you take pride in a product which such broken combat system. How can you offer this game to &quot;both new and old-school gamers&quot; when the game is CLEARLY console-ready and PC gamers might feel like second-hand category. Combat tactics almost non-existant. Mashing your attack button becomes second skin, your party members act like idiots in terms of using their abilities and battlefield movement, tactical view is a joke and makes you cry. One of the PILLARS of an interesing crpg game has been stripped of anything enjoyable. No spell-follow combos, handicapped movement, poor framerate on well equipped PC rigs, mmo-like grind-fest in terms of herbs and ingredients, find-bring certain amount-get reward filler quests, no healing magic = pop-the-potion-diablo-style. I will just stop here because my rant won&apos;t make any difference. Dragon Age franchise took a certain turn and I accept that. It&apos;s their call and they have a right to do so. But I will not follow. I&apos;m just not the &quot;modern gamer type&quot; I guess. From this day on I also refuse to believe in any kind of &quot;professional&quot; review from any kind of gaming site, including - obviously - sponsored YT users. If someone, SOMEONE, at SOME STAGE of beta tests or demo-playing would simply say &quot;Guys, this really needs some serious changes, let&apos;s re-think and work on it while there&apos;s still time&quot; things might have been different. But now, at this very hour, all good sides of this game [and there are plenty!] are simply overshadowed by a kick-in-the-face combat mechanics and simplicity which offends me.
<br>
<br>Apologies for chaotic thoughts. Just tired [waited &apos;till 00:00 to launch the game] and dissapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4735516">Expand</a></span>

Lie of the year if I have ever heard of one.  When you see 100% positive critic reviews then you know something smells since everyone knows that gaming critics/websites all are in the pocket of gaming companies and they will never give a honest review; thus I have already long disregarded their reviews.  Only user reviews are the ones you should trust since they are impartial and have nothing to gain.
<br>
<br>So to the game itself, it looks pretty and graphics are decent; but that&apos;s where the good parts end.  The controls on the PC are terrible - you can&apos;t even move the mouse to the edge of the scree to rotate the view, and you have to right click on the ground everytime just to move somewhere.  Attacking enemies with the controls is almost comical, no auto attacks, just wildly swinging the weapon and clicking mindlessly.  This is not a RPG game; its more like a hack-and-slash action game.
<br>
<br>Dragon Age: Origins was one of the best real RPG games in the last decade and DA2 and DA:I are just money making machines for EA.  Clearly Bioware has taken a new direction and strategy to focus on console games and dumbed down games to satisfy their bosses.  Sad decline of Bioware from a top quality company to one that is now laughed around as an example of how a gaming company should NOT become.
<br>
<br>Anyway, in conclusion, don&apos;t waste your money on this game if u are playing it on PC.  If you really want to try it, wait for prices to fall or try it in gaming cafes.  You will save yourself a lot of money.  Use it on really good RPG games and not this piece of trash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4849932">Expand</a></span>

<br>DA:I fails miserably to deliver any of this. Whoever compares the combat of DA:I to Skyrim or Mass Effect hasn&apos;t played them for more than 10 hours.

<br>
<br>Let me start by just saying that the AI can NOT in almost any case make it through a door after you. They are going to get stuck next to the door and get teleported after you once you made enough distance.
<br>
<br>In combat, as soon as you stop controlling them directly they will do everything they can to kill themselves asap.
<br>
<br>All of the AI commands are worthless.
<br>
<br>Examples: You have 2 mages with a barrier spell enabled. They will BOTH cast it AT THE SAME TIME BEFORE COMBAT STARTS rendering one completely useless and the other one barely useful. This would have been an insanely easy fix if Barrier was cast one at a time once a character actually gets hit and not as soon as &quot;combat starts&quot; (i,e. weapons are drawn).
<br>
<br>Next: There is a 2H warrior ability called block and slash setting this ability to preferred will cause the warrior to stand idle in block stance for the entirety of the combat instead of using it whenever he is being attacked directly.
<br>
<br>Next: There is a tempest class ability called flask of fire that nullifies all cooldowns and causes all abilities to have no stamina cost at all allowing you to spam an ability over and over. I literally only had 1 other ability (long shot - set to &quot;prefered&quot;) and after using flask of fire myself and switching to another character the AI DID NOT USE LONGSHOT more than ONCE.
<br>
<br>More: The AI cant handle the &quot;interact&quot; command at all. If you try to &quot;interact&quot; with anything and then switch to another character ( even when staying in tactical mode! ) the &quot;interact&quot; will immediately be cancled and the AI will go back to auto attacks. Which is **** because &quot;interact&quot; is used to revive in combat and overload rifts and a few other useful things.
<br>
<br>There are a lot, LOT more occasions on which the AI stupidity drove me to insanity but i&apos;ll just add one more:
<br>
<br>There is a cave in the storm coast which you can cross (2nd camp from the top - going north). If you try to cross this camp from the south entrance there is an area where the AI is not able to pass through. Instead they will get stuck running into a wall left of it.
<br>What makes this worse is that for some reason you cant even give move-&gt;hold position commands into the area behind it (even though its clearly meant to be passed through). If you try to nothing happens at all.
<br>I tried for 10 minutes straight to get my allies to hold position then move one of them further in manually and hold position in the first place it was possible after this area. If i did not use hold position command at any point in time the AI instantly went back to walking against the aforementioned wall. They even found the way back to it all by themselves.
<br>
<br>All of this while being assaulted by various mobs.
<br>
<br>But not even hold position command helped. After switching to the 3rd character, the first i moved ahead simply got teleported back even though there was barely any distance between the two and proceeded to walk straight into the wall all over again.
<br>I had to cross this particular cave by just running through with 1 guy letting the others die. Then get out of combat on the exit on the other side of the cave so my dead teammates got teleported to me and then go back into the cave from the north.
<br>
<br>Terribad!
<br>
<br>Add a short boring story, gay romance only, MMO quest design... and a lot of paid reviews.

These people giving 10s and immediately saying &quot;How can these people rate it 0 after only a few hours/1 day of play?&quot; When they themselves are giving it a 10. Hypocrites are blind, it seems. Dragon Age 2 was found out for Bioware/EA hiring a LOT of people in Russia and China to fudge metacritic scores, and it seems the same PR machine is attempting to work overtime again....but anyway, on with the review!.....
<br>
<br>The fact is, DA3 is the progression of dumbing down games to the mass market, bad market research, and lazy game design. It has devolved from the tagline on the back of the Dragon Age Origins box (of which i have in front of me) that reads &quot;The Dark Fantasy Epic&quot; to what is now probably a cheesy parody of itself.
<br>
<br>The Dragon Age franchise is so rich with lore from its first game, the fact that they went down the hilariously cliche &quot;rifts open up in world, you&apos;re our only hope&quot; storyline is both unimaginative, uninspiring, and a depressingly well-trodden path. You could have had a game that literally played out between the mages and templars without that added pointlessness, and had it be just as vast, epic and enthralling.
<br>
<br>The PC version IS a terrible console port, and that is how you can tell the paid reviewers on this site from the actual real reviewers. The controls are messy, rushed, and ill thought out.
<br>
<br>Its quests DO have a hideously grindy feeling MMO fetch quest nature about them. This was even highlighted in a PCGamer video as they played through it and mentioned it as a worry of theirs, but funnily enough, now their review has come out, they changed their tune to no quests feeling pointless. Funny how a final review in a paid magazine can change so differently from their preview, isnt it? Despite only 1 month passing inbetween.
<br>
<br>It is sad that the gameworld looks so beautiful (which is what it does gain marks for), yet is filled up with all this filler. The gameworld could be more open, it does feel linear, but its real problem stems from trying to marry a WoW-esque hand holding experience to take your places and also wanting to be Skyrim at the same time. The two dont work well together.
<br>
<br>Combat is very dull. One of my chief complaints about DA2 was the fact enemies respawned and just had more hitpoints as you changed the difficulty setting, instead of placing different monsters with/and/or different abilities. The same is true here. Bioware seem to care more about the story these days than actually producing a game.
<br>
<br>The sad thing is, when the story then lets you down (and it doesnt entirely, but the dialogue does), and that was the leg you were standing on, it brings everything else crashing down with it.
<br>The developers seem to think we&apos;re scared of reading more than 5 words to choose what we want to say, despite in Dragon Age Origins you having nearly a full sentence for each option. This becomes a big problem, because a lot of the time it means you end up with your character not saying what you thought you were going to say.
<br>
<br>In a ROLEplaying game, that is hilariously bad, and extremely lazy.
<br>
<br>So to sum up -
<br>Cons :
<br>-Bad dialogue
<br>-Cliched medicore storyline
<br>-Mediocre Combat and controls
<br>-Badly ported
<br>-Pointless MMO filler questing
<br>-EA China/Russia paid for metacritic reviews skewing the real reviewers.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>-Worth a punt when its been reduced to about &#xA3;10 and you&apos;ve nothing better to play
<br>-Beautiful looking scenary and landscaping
<br>-Dragon Age world/universe nostalgia.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4742871">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pro&apos;s
<br>- Decent world design
<br>- Good world graphics
<br>- Good music
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s
<br>- Camera is trash
<br>- AI is trash (won&apos;t listen to any directions)
<br>- Tactical view is worthless
<br>- Entire game is clearly made for consoles in every way. They didn&apos;t even try to optimize for PC.
<br>- Combat is awful; they took every bad aspect of DA2 and duplicated it, then made it even a little worse.
<br>- Skill trees are a joke. Even worse than DA2, if you&apos;ll believe it.
<br>- My mages animations look like he is a **** airbender, just like DA2. I want mages to be regal, powerful. Instead they look like clowns.
<br>- Fetch quests. Everywhere, all the time.
<br>- Character graphics are oddly terrible. I couldn&apos;t make a character that didn&apos;t look retarded. Also shiny.
<br>
<br>By far the worst things for me is the total snub of PC as a platform. It was already obvious with DA2, but they have cemented it now with Inquisition. Bioware and EA don&apos;t give a **** about PC players, even when DA began as a PC title. It was lovingly crafted in every way for PC. Now, PC controls and UI are awful; barely adequate to even function, and definitely not enjoyable. Basic but important mechanics have been gradually stripped away from this series until what we are left with is a crude shell of what Origins was. Verily, anyone who can say Inquisition (or DA2) is better combat-wise than Origins truly had no **** idea what they were doing when they played it. This can be seen in the references to how Origins had too many skills that you didn&apos;t use; except of course, you did use them, if you weren&apos;t a total ****wit. Most of the skills combo&apos;d together wonderfully and if you weren&apos;t a console pleb playing on easy, it was actually important.
<br>
<br>The thing I enjoyed most in Origins, outside of the story and characters, was weaving powerful magical combinations together to take out groups of enemies. That feeling is completely and utterly dead in Inquisition. Combo&apos;s still exist, but they are largely an afterthought and don&apos;t have nearly the same impact. Magic in general feels completely gutted, and from looking at the other skill trees the same appears to be true there as well.
<br>
<br>I predicted that Inquisition would be bad. Awful, actually. I knew it from the moment they revealed they were continuing DA2&apos;s story-line about the mages and templars. All I can say is that I hate to be proven right. I wanted this game to be good, a return to Origins. Instead it is not only a continuation of everything wrong with DA2, it&apos;s actually a steeper decent to utter console peasantry.
<br>
<br>RIP Origins, the only good DA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4858878">Expand</a></span>

<br>The very few semi-positive points...its big but unwieldly so. Its pretty.

<br>The only thing more disappointing than the game is all the butt-kiss &quot;professional&quot; game critics and reviews kissing up to it because its in their best interests to do so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4870014">Expand</a></span>

Heart-breaking. . I was waiting for this game for months.
<br>
<br>I probably played DA: origins a dozen times. Maybe two dozen. Every story, every npc, every option. One of my favorites. I played DA #2 once. This one I found this completely unplayable. The camera didn&apos;t make any sense. Why not allow it to pull back so you can see your guys and at least a few of your enemies? Don&apos;t the game designers themselves play games? Why would they make it so difficult to see what&apos;s going on? To move? To issue commands to your guys? To loot anything?
<br>
<br>Really I&apos;m baffled by how bad this is. The combat consists of holding down the R key. Instead of Dragon Age, it&apos;s like playing some version of Donkey Kong. Your guys spin a lot, like a young dance troop that has only a handful of moves. I guess enemies are taking some shots (but, as I say, you can&apos;t see much).
<br>
<br>Can reviewers really be paid off? I can&apos;t believe it. PC GAmer magazine has always been reliable in the past. But unless they got some different version, I don&apos;t see how they could rate this as anything other than a unplayable bomb.
<br>
<br>Obviously some people on here love this game. I honestly don&apos;t see how they lasted 5 hours. My advice would be to buy from a store that has a return policy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4818582">Expand</a></span>

<br>JUST A REVIEW:
<br>I&#x2019;ll keep it in bullet points and w/o any unnecessary fillers.
<br>+ graphics (despite some terrain and characters&#x2019; textures issues graphically the game is great)
<br>+ vivid world and multitude of things to be done (some very nice touches with the minigames etc)
<br>+ great dialogues (interactions between the characters are awesome)
<br>+ stable gameplay, no crashes, no freezes.
<br>
<br>-	NOT MADE FOR PC KEYBOARD AND MOUSE (controls are just plain dumb, &#x2018;=&#x2019; to dismount?!?
<br>-	Tactical camera, a feature which supposedly should work BETTER on PC, is broken. Period.
<br>-	Story didn&#x2019;t suck me in (I guess it might be compelling for other people who enjoyed DAO and/or DAII)
<br>-	No facial expressions (ruins the experience IMO), uncanny valley FTW!
<br>-	No autoattack feature
<br>-	No walk/run toggle. (that is absolute immersion destroyer
<br>-	Horse &#x2018;blow of wind&#x2019; effect just to make it look faster while in fact you are probably better off just on feet
<br>-	Sometimes things spawned ON MY HEAD!
<br>-	Some unnecessary time fillers (some collectibles etc seem to be implemented just to serve as a time sink)
<br>-	Little variety of spells for mage
<br>-	AI dumbed down with very limited/non-existent tactics and commands (couldn&#x2019;t issue a command to revive my teammates if I&#x2019;m alive)
<br>-	Menus are a mess (just to find out how much HP you have you have to scroll down all the way down to check attributes or &#x2026;..rely on VISUAL representation of your statistics which does not help at all when you compare stuff like +18hp belt)
<br>-	No tooltip for skills!!!
<br>-	No innovations in the gameplay (unless you count NO HEALING as innovation)
<br>-	Quests are classical MMORPG go, fetch, kill, return
<br>
<br>POOR POOR game for PC. Looks great and &#x2018;feels&#x2019; great on the surface but on the PC it is simply not enjoyable. A whole lot of negatives could&#x2019;ve been fixed if only BIOWARE did not neglect the PC market of the game. I did preorder it and after 12 hours of pushing myself just to get my money worth back I conclude that it is the biggest disappointment in my whole gaming career.
<br>
<br>PS. big standing ovation for BIOWARE/EA marketing departments, they are good enough to sell sand on Sahara desert...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4751432">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>DA:I is the perfect example of how money can buy you good reviews in the gaming industry. They must have spent a lot of dough in this regard. If you&apos;re PC user and a serious fan of RPG games, don&apos;t even consider buying this. I hate EA and Bioware. They ruined and amazing game with DA 2, and now they did it again. I hope you&apos;ll choke on those sacks full of money you make from naive consumers.

<br>As the only one who can save the world you will spend most of your time fetching things for lazy NPC&apos;s. Get blankets for refugees, collect items to upgrade your weapons and armor, fetch horses and though technically not a fetch quest build watch towers.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t feel like a world savior. I felt like my real world self going to work. The game is a chore. Imagine if Arkham Knight came out and you could do all these cool things as Batman but instead the game forced you to go to board meetings as Bruce Wayne. That&apos;s what Inquisition does to the Dragon Age series.
<br>
<br>A better name might be World of Dragon Age Craft. It&apos;s an MMORPG without the MMO part. It&apos;s dull, non immersive and turns gaming into your real life job. You know, the one go to because you have to pay the bills only Inquisition doesn&apos;t pay you, you pay for it.
<br>
<br>The critic reviews are a joke. 5.8 user score but an 85 critic score? Don&apos;t waste your money. This game should be a free to play MMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4956595">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First the character creation was so f***ing bad, every hair model I liked clipped through my damned ears and they are done so bad that they seemed cheap wigs. In these games you have to look at your character face in EVERY conversation so estetics DOES matters. And they are horrible in DA:I.
<br>
<br>Graphics are not really exceptional, playing at ultra settings.
<br>
<br>Now comes the juicy part, ALL controls are made for consoles. ALL OF THEM. Menus, attacks, spell bar...you name it. Movement is atrocious, I don&apos;t really get why they couldn&apos;t simply implement DA:O controls, it would have been less effort and more gain.
<br>
<br>Combat is abysmal, you just press R to attack - yes you press R to autoattack and do nothing - while spamming whatever spell you want, not that it does any difference since you can barely even aim.
<br>
<br>And there&apos;s the tactical view...oh my god it&apos;s unbelievably bad, you can&apos;t control it with mouse (LIKE IT WOULD BE OBVIOUS TO) and WASD don&apos;t pan the camera....they ROTATE IT. It is actually the most frustrating thing I&apos;ve ever seen in a RPG. Uninstalled the game 10 minutes after the tactical view was introduced.
<br>
<br>Ah forgot about the story: there&apos;s a great evil, you are the chosen one to save the world, end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4959001">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Its a pretty game (except for the creepy oil sheen on your characters). I have had zero technical or performance problems. But the game play reminds me a lot of the newer Zelda games (which I also hated). It&apos;s basically a 3D platformer in a fake open world, with RPG dressing, and (ugh) constantly respawning mobs.
<br>
<br>The only skills you&apos;ll need are button-mashing and remembering where the randomly-placed overpowered mobs live, so you can come back and kill them later. There are almost no strategy, tactical, or for that matter RPG elements. Even basic tactics (kiting, bottle necks, crowd control spells) are unusable with this interface. Just hold down &quot;R&quot; and fire your special attacks when they recharge. Remember pondering over weapon choices in DA:O? No need here. There&apos;s a lot less loot, and all choices are obvious.
<br>
<br>Obviously a lot of people like this kind of game, especially on consoles. That&apos;s where the positive reviews come from. But they&apos;re not usually the same people who loved DA:O. I&apos;m 19 hours in, and bored to tears. I don&apos;t know how much more I can take.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4944993">Expand</a></span>

However, the poor PC port (why even have a PC port, just make the game for use with keyboard &amp; mouse) makes the game extremely difficult to enjoy.
<br>
<br>Also, the story, the characters, the writing, the combat, the depth, all sub par.  It seems the creators of inquisition were really only interested in putting out the lowest quality, highest profit margin game possible.
<br>
<br>Does EA really believe that PC gameplay is dead or do they only wish it were? Their are still many of us who enjoy playing games on the PC.  Ostensibly because games played on the PC offer things like roll over information to better understand an ability, skill, spell etc... The ability to map your keyboard to get the key combinations perfect for your game play control.  The ability to use the mouse to pan and zoom anywhere on a map or battlefield.  To have a &quot;free camera&quot; so you can move around a battlefield to enable ultimate tactical control.  To use the mouse to &quot;click&quot; on objects to perform a behavior, activate an option or expand a view.  Creating games on a PC gives the developer a rich toolset with which to work and gives me as a player a rich world to explore and play in.  Apparently rich, in depth and customizable is no longer in vogue.
<br>
<br>The quests, like others have communicated ad nauseam, are dull and made to simply keep you busy doing nothing.  In most cases they do not in any way enrich the experience of playing the game.  I want quests that advance the story, not my boredom.
<br>
<br>I like immersion.  A disconnect from from everyday reality.  An adventure filled with interesting characters, witty dialog, surprises, puzzles and mystery.  Inquisition delivers none of that...  It&apos;s a game for the mindless.
<br>
<br>I like depth.  I want to have deep skill tree&apos;s, to be able to craft something not only usable but unique to my play style.  I want to design each character I control so that they are unique and that fit into my battle scheme in a way that is synergistic to my party. Inquisition has none of that... It&apos;s a game for the shallow.
<br>
<br>I like tactical combat.  I want to control every aspect of the battlefield.  I want a camera that doesn&apos;t let the environment get in the way and allows me to see the entire field of play.  I want to be able to utilize the pre-designed talents, skill sets and attributes of each member of my party in a way that allows me to win a battle with skill and intellect.  I want an AI to compete against that does more than just swing a sword or cast a spell.  I want the AI to block, counter spell, use the environment and surprise me.  Inquisition has none of that... it&apos;s a game for those who like arcade style combat.
<br>
<br>To say I&apos;m disappointed is an understatement.  All of the things that made Origins and to a lesser extent DA:2 fun and engaging are now gone.  That which made Bioware great has been destroyed by mediocrity, neglect and laziness.
<br>
<br>Ultimately the promise of Dragon Age Inquisition is like very many things these days.  It&apos;s all marketing, misdirection and a drive by the developer to maximize profit.
<br>
<br>No more Bioware (EAWare) games for me until they decide to honor their promise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4763018">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First, the good. Large, open maps. It almost felt like an open world game when I was in the Hinterlands. Nothing like true open world games but I thought this was a good step forward.
<br>
<br>Good voice acting. Sure there are a few iffy moments but for the most part, the game is well voiced. Too bad the story was boring.
<br>
<br>The bad: Repetitiveness... there are not enough enemy types and even fewer combat options. There is no strategy in the game and it feels more like a hack and slash than a RPG. During my game, I found that 1 could beat the entire game spamming a single button (Spirit Blade). Playing as Cassandra was just as bad as I could beat anything with just 2 skills. It does not matter what difficulty you play on, combat is trivial.
<br>
<br>The Ugly: Horrendous AI. Unforgivable honestly. Enemies and companions get stuck in environments often. Sometimes, enemies that get hit don&apos;t react and just sit there. Companions act like idiots when left to their own devices and they almost never follow commands (such as hold position). Gone are options that you had in DA1 that allowed you to control AI behavior and instead you have exactly 4 behaviors total to adjust and 2 of them are just about when to use a health potion...
<br>
<br>Lastly, and I only add this for completeness, I hate the graphics. I am not a big graphics guy so i wont deduct points for it but I hate the ugly shiny film placed over objects. I actually think that Skyrim, without any mods, looks 10x better than this game despite this game being much smaller in scope. Again, not a big deal to me, but some people might care.
<br>
<br>Neutral: The story. The companions. The enemies. The combat. None of these things were very bad, but they are not worth complementing either. The story is tiring... the good guys turned bad, started an apocalypse but they eventually redeem themselves yadda yadda yadda. This would be fine if the characters were interesting but they are not. I did not care for any of the companions in this game nor the side characters and their dialog seemed long winded. I did not bother with any romances in this game because frankly, i did not like any of the characters. The enemy variety is very sparse. You will fight the same enemy hundreds of times. Combat is very repetitive because there are very few abilities to use. Not that it matters because the entire game can be beaten with 1 button on any difficulty (Spirit Blade once you get it). There is really no tactics in this game unlike previous DA games. You can just rush into anything and take them out easily as long as you have 1 character than can regenerate guard or cast barriers. You can also run away from anything if you want or you can shoot them from out of their range and they will never attack you... boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4854709">Expand</a></span>

I bought this game full price, brand new, and poured about 30 hours into it. Now I&apos;m giving up. I can&apos;t explain how this game has garnered such praise from the gaming community, even to the point where it&apos;s considered a game of the year nominee over games like Dark Souls 2, which clearly deserve it.
<br>THE STORY: You&apos;re the chosen one. You and only you have the power to stop evil from taking over the land. Sound familiar? It&apos;s a cliche that you can get over, sure. The remainder of the story, however, is painfully boring (I&apos;ve fallen asleep several times while trying to play through this game). It doesn&apos;t help that there is a mountain of lore that you really need to know to understand why things are happening. So if you haven&apos;t played dragon age in a while, you&apos;ll find that you&apos;re spending a lot of time either reading the in-game codex, or pressing pause to look something up on a wiki somewhere.
<br>GRAPHICS: Aside from nice light and shadows, DAI is graphically equivalent to a last-gen title. Speaking specifically to the hair design- I have never, ever, seen a game do this so poorly. I know Bioware has a long history of &quot;sucking at [designing] faces&quot; (their words, not mine), but the faces are actually quite well designed, and the character builder is pretty cool. The artist that designed the hair, specifically, did an extremely poor job, to the point where it&apos;s distracting. There&apos;s an article on Kotaku where users took a poll, and over 70% of players eventually restarted the game (some 10-20 hours in) because they simply couldn&apos;t stand to look at their character. It&apos;s really just that bad looking, and at this point I can&#x2019;t understand why Bioware hasn&#x2019;t worked to strengthen this admitted weakness of theirs.
<br>Graphically, environments aren&apos;t bad, and when the game eventually opens up they can be quite beautiful, albeit short of the &quot;next gen&quot; feel of other PS4 titles. Facial animation needs work; since Bioware prides itself on deep, enthralling stories, they should really put more stock into this area and take a page from LA Noire / Beyond Two Souls. Selling emotion is key to an engaging story, and sadly these characters are emotionless.
<br>GAMEPLAY: The environments in this game can be pretty vast and diverse, so there is a real sense of exploration. However, with dozens of &quot;fetch quests&quot; (many of which are issued to you even noticing, simply by picking up loot) the actions you take in the game don&apos;t feel meaningful, and thus, the quests aren&apos;t fun. It&#x2019;s more of a list of things to do vs. things you&#x2019;re interested in exploring. The combat system has some merit, but it&#x2019;s ultimately a mess; it becomes very hard to keep track of who is doing what. On more than one occasion, I noticed that in the middle of a battle, one character was stuck behind on the edge of a cliff or on a rock- the AI was trying to rejoin my group but couldn&#x2019;t. The &quot;behavior&quot; programming system (this allows you to automate character actions) falls very short of achieving what the gambit system in FF12 achieved, being a neutered version of what Origins used.
<br>There is a pointless inventory restriction on your characters, meaning you need to backtrack a lot to sell your valuables and free up inventory space for new loot. This adds no deeper strategy to the game, only the chore of backtracking.
<br>Technically, I&#x2019;ve experienced a few hiccups. My game crashed repeatedly when I tried to respec one of my characters.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a mediocre RPG with a generic, boring and bloated story, poor design choices, and semi-enjoyable gameplay mechanics.
<br>
<br>I wouldn&#x2019;t  recommend it, and honestly, it&#x2019;ll probably be the last time I give EA / Bioware $60.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4857191">Expand</a></span>

As a big fan of the gameplay style of DA:O and also DA2 I was reaaaaaaaaaaallllyyy looking forward to this. I didn&apos;t even bother to check out the gameplay videos and stuff before buying the digital deluxe edition because I was THAT confident it was going to be an awesome game (Clearly that was the wrong move).
<br>
<br>So I got it on Origin and started downloading it.. Took me about half a day or so for me to finish it here (we don&apos;t have very fast internet speed T.T) and was super excited to come home after work to play it. However, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to check Metacritic (and other sites) for reviews about it. I was surprised and disappointed to find out that it was not the DA I was looking forward to. A game, that was originally and CLEARLY for the PC (talking about DA:O) had been made into a game for console and they ported it to PC just to earn (A LOT OF) extra cash. Read that some users said that EA (or was it Bioware?) were gonna make time to actually make it feel like it was for the PC and not just an obvious port from the consoles (can&apos;t remember the actual quote).
<br>
<br>Well, all I can say is that DA:I is nothing like the DA I knew. The DA I knew gave me an awesome tactical view so I could control ALL my characters effectively and effortlessly. The DA I knew did not make me hold a key to auto attack. The DA I knew did not make me walk all the way loot before letting me pick it up (But apparently there&apos;s a key to pick up stuff? well, the tutorial didn&apos;t tell me about that..&gt;.&gt;) . The DA I knew did not make the game feel like a typical MMORPG.. Dragon Age: Inquisition, is not dragon age anymore.
<br>
<br>Another thing I did not like was the skillset. Damn. when I saw the same exact (or rather very similar) skills they had for the mage NOT ONLY THAT but they skill trees were even fewer from the first game (or second game? I can&apos;t remember exactly). I was really disappointed that time and did not want to continue anymore. I returned the game before the 24hr mark without much thought.
<br>
<br>I did not get far enough into the story to comment on it. The character customization made my character look a bit more ugly than I expected but all that I could look past. But the gameplay I could not. Maybe if I played a little longer I might have gotten used to the controls but I did not want to because this is not the dragon age I expected or wanted.
<br>
<br>Dragon Age Inquisition might be the best RPG version of all the other dragon ages, (according to most of the reviews anyway.. &gt;.&gt; ) but it is certainly not a dragon age game anymore. Don&apos;t buy this game if you expect a dragon age game, but if you don&apos;t mind the change in gameplay style, and you liked the characters from before, and if you think the story is okay, go right ahead but just check it out properly first before you head to store and get one without thinking just because of the hype and the good reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4760146">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- When I think &quot;maybe I should start DAI&quot;, immediately I think of &quot;The Load Times&quot; - terrible
<br>- The enemies spawn from thin air, and in same places each time you go to an area
<br>- Wait until you get to fighting - no sorry click click click (who cares what spell or weapon) it just doesnt matter. &quot;Oh I died&quot; - who cares - Continue..
<br>- Camera controls area REALLY bad, there is an AWFUL transition to &quot;tactical&quot; camera which I immediately zoom away if it accidentally snaps in - which it does constantly when trying to zoom out max
<br>- The inventory is really messy, only few lines of items in drop down lists. This is not the way to create adventure game inventory! Feels like vanilla Skyrim inventory - BAD
<br>- The map is stupid
<br>- I couldn&apos;t give LESS what happens to those people in that world it&apos;s just so uninteresting story.
<br>- I keep collecting flower, iron, items and spending time wondering who can wear what
<br>- The CONSOLE is written all over this game
<br>- Twitching, laggy, badly written engine
<br>- STUPID and awkward comments from companions
<br>
<br>I have been wondering many times how has this game won many prizes and so good reviews?

DA:I is one of those rare and terrible occasions.
<br>
<br>Let me start out by saying what little I liked about the game before moving on to the many, many cons.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>The backdrop and world are much better looking than in Dragon Age:Origins and Dragon Age 2.  There is no disputing that.  Even the models have the potential to be so much better looking (I&apos;ll get to that later).  It&apos;s a beautiful game... if you have the hardware to run it.
<br>
<br>Feels a lot less corridor constrained than DA2, though it&apos;s certainly still there, they&apos;ve managed to hide it a lot better.  Unfortunately they negate this by having nothing interesting happen in the wide open corridors, but at least they&apos;ve improved on this feature from DA2.
<br>
<br>Not half as many re-used assets.  Did going through the same dungeon 20 times in DA2 annoy you?  That&apos;s no longer the case here.
<br>
<br>And... that&apos;s about it as far as pros go.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>Let me start off with the biggest offender that I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve seen mentioned before: the PC controls.  They&apos;re an abomination and more than anything else make it obvious what a terrible console port this piece of garbage is.  No click to loot, no click to move, awful camera control.  It&apos;s just plain bad for PC players.  The UI was obviously designed with consoles in mind and is downright painful to navigate, and don&apos;t even get me started on the &quot;inventory&quot; system.
<br>
<br>The optimization for this game is also terrible.  I can run skyrim on a 500 series gtx card, max settings, zero lag.  This game doesn&apos;t look half as good, and you need a 900 series card to run it at max settings.  You&apos;ll still get horrible FPS with a top of the line 980.  That&apos;s inexcusable.
<br>
<br>The second biggest offender is the story and dialogue.  This more than anything else is both unforgivable and yet completely predictable for anyone who has been following Gaider&apos;s downward spiral since Baldur&apos;s Gate.  Like Sawyer, Gaider can be a good writer if he&apos;s kept on a leash and slapped whenever he tries to do something idiotic or push his insane political/social ideology in the game.  That clearly wasn&apos;t the case here just like it was in Dragon Age 2, and if anything it&apos;s gotten worse since Dragon Age 2.
<br>
<br>The dialogue is a good example of what it would look like if someone took Anthony Burch(borderlands, or as it&apos;s known on the internet &quot;meme lands&quot;)&apos;s worst writing and then gave it unbelievably bad accents.
<br>Half the time I didn&apos;t even understand what the characters were trying to say to me.  Like another person said, maybe the voice actors should have been allowed to write their own lines, they probably would have done a better job.
<br>
<br>The story and &quot;plot&quot; is just a bastardized version of Oblivion.  You&apos;re the hero with a &apos;insert generic and pointless drivel here&apos; background, now go close down these oblivion ga- I mean fade rifts and everyone will be okay with you doing it even though they had no idea who you were 5 seconds ago.
<br>
<br>Moving on to something I mentioned in the pro&apos;s section: the character models.  Bioware used Frostbite 3 (the engine Dice constantly lied about being unmoddable) for Dragon Age Inquisition.  As anyone whos played battlefield can tell you, this is a fantastic engine with amazing potential.  Which makes it that much more amazing that all of your companions and nearly every npc is ugly as sin.  The elf party members, Seras and Solas, are from a race constantly described in the lore as universally attractive.  Seras looks like someone mixed a pug with a hobgoblin and then repeatedly hit the resulting abomination in the face with a metal bat, and has an 80 year old&apos;s sagging knockers despite being from a race that maintains their youth longer and not even being in her 40s.  Solas looks like a bald Nicholas Cage with a melted face.  Don&apos;t even get me started on the hair, though fortunately for Bioware they&apos;ve never been good at that so at least they have an excuse for that.
<br>
<br>Anyways, moving on to what should be the meat of every rpg - the quests.  It looks like someone at Bioware had the bright idea of padding their game with mmo style quests.  This is a single player rpg, not a mmo.  There is no logical reason to have a character collect 15 wolf butts, nor a reason to have them do variations of that quest DOZENS OF TIMES.  Not unless you were trying to pad out your game so you could say it was X amount of hours....
<br>
<br>Finally, let&apos;s talk about the stat and skill system.  Or more specifically, the fact that there isn&apos;t a stat system.  Oh you certainly have stats, they simply have no effect on the game and you have zero interaction with them.  They&apos;re just numbers that automatically increase every time you level up.  Does that sound like an RPG to you?  Skills are very, very dumbed down.  You also can&apos;t switch out in mid battle.  Hope you like using the same spells over and over again.  Oh, and did I mention you can only have FOUR in multiplayer?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4744042">Expand</a></span>

The game is not oriented strategy at all and the story is incoherent (you are a prisoner, we are gonna execute you... no wait be our leader !). If it was a brand new game I should give it a 5, but there was already a deep world and a good system. Still some good points: character creation system, nice landscapes, nice to have a craft system, good idea with the mission boards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4762390">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I wanted a great story ala DA:O with some good roll-play, some stratagy and just a few meaningful choices.  what did i get? a total of 4, 2 hour story missions, which are barely connected to the pathetically easy and lackluster boss fight that comes at the end.  these  four story missions are surrounded by 100&apos;s of hours or boring pointless make work that neither advances the story nor develops your character nor changes the world nor engadges the gameplay mechanics in a fun or innovative way.  the game is a MMO pretending to be a story driven single player experience and failing at both.
<br>
<br>i spent 44 hours playing before i every reached skyhold.  i spent 95 hours before i reached the ending.  i got 4 hours worth of story and made 1 choice which didn&apos;t matter in the end.
<br>
<br>those four story missions are well done, but they are totaly dissconected from eachother.
<br>
<br>there is a very awesome story mission where you play politician and mingle at a party.  that would be awesome but after 60 hours playing i didn&apos;t know why what i was doing was important or who any of the people i was talking to were or what difference any of my choices would make becuase none of these characters had any part to play in the preveous 60 hours of playing.  In this mission you stop a civil war, which i never noticed had been going on anyway.  You end the influence of the big bad guy in the palace.... even though he wasn&apos;t actually doing anything or affecting anyone, or even really in the palace.  and you choose who will be king/queen... even though this has no affect on the supposed war or you as an inquisitor, your organization and it&apos;s abilities or the story as it developed.   and afterward i had to ask myself... why did i need to do any of this anyway?
<br>
<br>the best part of DA:I was getting my castle, the short dialog between Morgan and Flemish (which was totaly for long time players of the series) and a short dialog with dagna about dwarven magic (which again was a returning character that had nothing to do with the story) and the after credit scene which i wont spoil.
<br>
<br>those few parts i loved were awesome because they paid off choices from previous games and i seemed to have a real impact and influence on them.  The castle was awesome because i wanted to get it ready to survive a siege..... surprise there is no siege... talk about checkoves handgun.
<br>
<br>the boss battle was so easy and anticlimactic that i assumed that the game was trying to trick me.  that the real ending was still comeing and trying to lull me into a falce sence of security.
<br>
<br>i played for 90 hours and feel like i wasted my time. i stuck with it because i liked origins so much and have played that 100+ hour game 4 times and have not gotten bord.  DA:I is just a dull game that tried to save it&apos;s great ideas until late game and then didn&apos;t deliver.
<br>
<br>the combat is fun at early lvls when choices and abilities are in short supply and both you and enemies have few hit points to spare but by late game characters become absolutely unkillable.  my sword and shield character could solo a dragon and take no damage without me touching the keyboard or thinking... it just took hours to whittle the thing down.  the mages never got close to dieing and rogues are just as strong but need to be micromanaged.  i think it is simply a lack of play-testing or balancing for late game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4809749">Expand</a></span>

<br>But like a sprinter who has lost a leg, they just can jump the hurtles anymore.
<br>
<br>On the PC, the controls are buggy and clumsy.  Tactical?  I hope it matures enough to become a joke.
<br>
<br>DA:2 started the process of eliminating character customization.  DA:I nearly completes its.  Attributes are done.  Skills are eliminated.  And, taking a queue from DA:2, all armor looks the same - now including the main character&apos;s.  Only the special ability is left to the player and that is largely compromised by a combat system that really only works when you let the game AI control your companions.
<br>
<br>Mind numbing quest and useless crafting are the point of this game, not just flavor.
<br>
<br>Combat is repetitive and tedious; all fights require the same thoughtless button mashing - you fight bears just as you fight Carta assassins, just as you fight demons.  No strategy, no thinking, no excitement, just another chore to plow through as you attempt to gather ten hunks of meat.
<br>
<br>The biggest shame, however, is the potential.  It is there.  Interesting characters.  Big world.  Grand scope.  You really want DA:I to fly; not bury itself in some festering hole to rot.  EA tried, they just can&apos;t execute.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4815620">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What is shocking and shows how the industry is and each others pockets is the lack reports of this in the mainstream reviews with reflecting scores, and yes Im looking at you Giant bomb and IGN you should be ashamed.

I absolutely love the visuals, surroundings and gameplay. Unfortunately, after seven hours play I stumbled upon a game breaking bug. I suddenly couldn`t load my save games. Ea and Bioware`s forums are full of people having the same issue, and two months after release the game is still unplayable.</span>

The reviewers such as ign etc have become famous for taking bribes in exchange for good reviews on triple AAA titles. This is one of those times. The combat is so bad it&apos;s painful to play. It feels like a clunky free to play korean mmo.  The graphics in screen shots look great but the game stutters so much in cutscenes it&apos;s hard to tell whats going on. The animations are what i would expect from a game 8 years ago not from today. The quests are boring filler quests you would find in an mmo just to extend the total time it takes to finish the game.
<br>
<br>And here is the worst part, the story and dialogue are horrible. Bioware has failed at what it used to do best. The conversations are so poorly written you will skip them just to get them over with. The writing everywhere in this game is terrible. Please do yourself a favor, wait for witcher 3 or anything else coming out if you like games like the original dragon age. This one is garbage. If i had worked on this game i&apos;d be ashamed.  There honest to god is not 1 redeemable feature in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4818383">Expand</a></span>

Bioware missed the mark again and this game doesn&apos;t deserve the Dragon Age brand, just another Skyrim wannabe hiking herb gathering simulator. For those looking for another DAO, look elsewhere, this game bears little resemblance to DAO. In a nutshell, DAI lacks immersion, story and is pretty much a dumbed down action RPG. For detail analysis, carry on reading.
<br>
<br>Where to begin. I am +70 hours in on nightmare difficulty but just can&apos;t continue grinding to finished the game. The first 25 hours was exciting, thereafter got so tedious still doing the usual collecting 25 shards, find 15 letters, collect 20 blood lotus, establish 4 camps and kill  bandits in each area. There are no buildups and conversations leading up to enemy battles, just follow map marker kill bandits and quest completion achieved &amp; archived. I wouldn&apos;t even describe enemies and NPCs as two dimensional, they are just polygons populating the bland world of Thedas. No close up cinematic style dialogue with NPCs, again just about all conversation (except main quests) are distant third person with boring writing and one liners. I&apos;ve explored all areas of the Hinterlands, Exalted plains, Crestwood, Western Approach, Emerald Grave, Shallow Mire, Stormcoast and a few other smaller areas, and honestly none of these huge areas are memerable. In each of these areas its the same quests (collect/find/kill) over and over that resemble MMO games.
<br>
<br>Combat and gameplay
<br>I play as a mage and gameplay is simple, just spam enemies with abilities still they die. Lyrium potions are unnecessary because mana regenerate very quickly. No planning and tactics are required for spells casting and reserving. So far, I have yet to use Lyrium potion even on nightmare difficulty. Ignore the over hyped tactical view, the zoom is far to close to the ground where you can&apos;t barely see the entire battleground. The tactical cam is absolutely unnecessary as a result of the dumb down combat.
<br>
<br>I believe +200 hours can be easily achieved on my first play through but its the quality that counts not quantity. Pretty graphics will be outdated as technology advances. Granted, this game is huge but full of chores that reminds me of SWTOR and Skyrim when it doesn&apos;t need to be. Was so looking forward to strong storytelling and tactical combat. Why can&apos;t Dragon Age just be Dragon Age.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4859940">Expand</a></span>

If it was just another high budget uninspired action-RPG i would probably give it a better mark (5 or 6 really, nothing great), but it is not. Whether some like it or not, it is a Bioware game and one from the DA franchise. You cannot on one hand use it&apos;s lineage for commercial and marketing purpose and on the other hand ask the same people to forget everything they knew and liked about it. Sadly as a DA Bioware game it is a massive letdown, i cannot even fathom how people could argue on that point.
<br>This game should have been called Dragon Age : Funeral. As it is exactly that. it&apos;s a lavish, pricey, mundane funeral of what Bioware once was. Those who attend but had not particular conection with the deceased may very well have a good, socially interesting time, yet those who loved and mourn him wont.
<br>
<br>As any blockbuster, its main concern is to appeal to as many as it is possible, focus on looks and keep it simple, marketting will do the rest. Job well done sarge !
<br>You might want to contest that bioware did not built its fame and once-glowing reputation on simple, straightforward and good looking games, well with all due respect you ll probably be answered to go F. yourself deep in the woods with your lore-liking, tradition-respecting Dalish friends. (see, i can do background too !) Ea is in command now, and Ea do what masses don&apos;t dislike, whatever that is. As of now, it is free flowing Action Rpg with camera on shoulder action and lotsa flashy lights.
<br>Tactical is for &quot;has-been&quot; nerds, nerds are non rational unmarkettable pricks that you cannot fit into small easy to reach boxes. Hell those punks value modding ! next thing you know they will tell you that a good story is worthless without a good narrator.
<br>
<br>That is Inquisition, an heartbreaking picture of what could have been, a story that should have been great, a game that could have meant so much more to the people that made Bg and NWM into cult objects. Someone decided that the right thing to do was to appeal to those who don&apos;t give a **** about all that, don&apos;t be surprised if everyone that does resent it dearly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4910724">Expand</a></span>

<br>Every once an a while you&apos;ll bump into a pack of wondering enemies to mix things up but the combat is so laughably easy especially if you craft your own gear. To be fair I didn&apos;t finish the game but I had seen enough to know that if I kept playing it would be the same boring fetch quests and combat for another 20 hours. As far as the story - its forgettable at best.

<br>
<br>Let&apos;s forget the broken keyboard + mouse controls, 30 FPS lock in cutscenes and all other technical issues that make your games more cinematic.
<br>
<br>According to the critics, those annoying and meaningless X of Y progress bar quests are what a 2014 single player RPG should be about (bonus: escort a dumb SLOW animal with glitching pathfinding back to its farm). WoW has been more creative with &quot;open world&quot; quests even in its original 2004 version.
<br>
<br>You are expected to grind this sort of quests to obtain &quot;power&quot; in order to advance the story. No, thank you.
<br>
<br>Thank you for all the great times, BioWare. This is where we part ways.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4783200">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Dragon Age Inquisition is like MMORPG but where you are the only one person on the whole server. 90% of the game is so unbelievable boring...to continue the main story you need to kill x sheep, find x herbs, letters put flowers on the grave of some peasant, find &quot;special&quot; colorful sheep for another peasant, find gold sheep for elf and run after it as long as needed
<br>- Side quests are almost never deeper than what you see at the first glance.
<br>- There are places that I would call &quot;spots to get exp&quot; where enemies are appearing constantly like in mmo. I loved fighting with dragons, especially then when all my team had no idea what to do and was standing like frozen next to legs of the beast and I needed to became each of them one by one and start hitting the enemy.
<br>- Tactical view is useless, your characters very quickly forget about orders. Blink of an eye and Varic is inside group of enemies, why? Maybe he was lonely in the safe place with his crossbow.
<br>- Bugs, bugs bugs. Third day my top 3-4 saves became corrupted and I wasn&apos;t able to open them, 6 hours of play lost. Thanks Bioware! Game crashes were common, sometimes everything was fine for three hours and another time game could turn off three times in 10 minutes.
<br>- Even on the nightmare game becomes easy after hitting 12-14 level. I ended up having almost 70k of gold because no matter what eq I had I was able to kill everything.
<br>- Your decisions means nothing. Whatever you pick result will be the same. Your teammates dislikes them? So what? Nothing will happen because of that.
<br>- Cooperation is just a big joke. My character was jumping on left and right during run and after couple of matches I realised that more interesting is looking on the growing grass. I loved what they did with Mass Effect 3 coop. I have spent hundreds of hours running over the same areas and killing the same monsters but it was super fun. DA coop almost made me cry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4862463">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played previous bioware games (Baldur&apos;s Gate 1 &amp; 2, Dragon Age, Mass Effect 1, 2 &amp; 3) and thought that Mass Effect 3 would be the most disappointing thing to come from a once-great company. I was wrong; this really takes the cake with absolutely abysmal writing, something once considered a strength of Bioware games and stale combat.
<br>Not to mention the other weaknesses of this game such as poor voice acting and equally poor graphics, even on the highest settings. The actors sound like strangers pulled off the street, with stiff and cold voice-overs even Microsoft Sam could trump. The UI (User Interface) is a horrific butchering of DA1&apos;s, with stats reduced to nothing but bars. The entire menu miraculously feels incredibly cluttered even though it&apos;s throwing LESS statistics and overall information at you.
<br>I really wanted to give Bioware the benefit of the doubt and hope ME3 was the sign that they should clean up their act, but it&apos;s become clear that they&apos;re set in their ways. I will probably never purchase a Bioware product again thanks to this complete mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4728470">Expand</a></span>

But I must admit that playing the game just makes me more and more irritated. Trying to loot stuff sometimes feels like a damn chore... can&apos;t just click on stuff from distance... you have to walk up to it and click... oh wait.. not close enough yet? Run closer with an annoying wait time cause of animation then try loot again. Half the time you play you spend pressing V. Try to figure out where the damn thing you can loot are and get frustrated because you can&apos;t see anything.
<br>
<br>Combat is just spamfest. I know that consoles are limited by the number of buttons... but seriously... There is no tactical feel like there were in Origin. It has been dumbed down to stupid hack&apos;n slash with the worst follower AI that doesn&apos;t follow commands more than 1&#xBD; second then they&apos;re back to the dafuq am I doing commands.
<br>
<br>All in all it&apos;s clumsy, ugly and why the heck wouldn&apos;t you support mods like in Origins.
<br>
<br>If you plan on buying this. Wait for it. As it is now it&apos;s bound to be on sale for like 10&#x20AC; soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4748212">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For example, I have a gaming computer that far exceeds the requirements to the run the game at max settings, and then some. However, even turning my graphics down to low/med settings fails to increase performance over the 20-25 fps the game generally runs at, or the 10-15 fps that it runs in crowded, or forested areas.
<br>
<br>On top of the terrible fps the motions are jerky, and all the cutscenes are a choppy stuttery mess. This isn&apos;t just my personal issue. Apparently it&apos;s very widespread.
<br>
<br>2-For PC users the interface is nigh unplayable with a mouse, and keyboard. We, don&apos;t even have a button to toggle walk, and click to move is gone as well.
<br>
<br>For PC users movement is sprint, or nothing, and with the aforementioned lag issues clicking the TINY loot bags is a nightmare. The interface is nothing short of a bad console port, and it really stings after the videos they made claiming they were developing something intuitive for the PC interface. I have seen console users complaining about the controls as well. With the poor design, and all the lag spikes, it makes targeting enemies as a melee class enraging. Too often you&apos;ll be swinging at empty air.
<br>
<br>3-Design idiocy. If you like combat with as much complexity as the old arcade beatemup &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; you&apos;ll really dig Inquisitions combat. Combat has been streamlined to be so simple that I actually began to miss FF 13&apos;s combat depth...and that&apos;s bad. Really bad.
<br>
<br>I hope none of you like many buttons because 29 hours in on my warrior I have 3 attacks, and a few utility abilities, two of which I&apos;m convinced aren&apos;t working. If you normally play mages like I do, you&apos;ll probably want to reroll like I did. Your spells are few. Your spells are weak. Your weakest spells still use up almost half of your mana/energy bar. (Which regens like rogue energy does from wow.) Therefore, you cast a couple of your largely ineffective spells, go oom, and then proceed to be gangraped by, wolves, bandits, demons, npc apostate mages(lol), bigger wolves, big bug.....things, honey badgers, TEMPLARS, angry squirrels, little old ladies, and chronic constipation. I&apos;ll put it like this...if mages had always been this weak since the inception of the series, nobody on Thedas would fear them, nobody would let them in their army, nobody would have heard of Tevinter, and there would be no Templars unless they ran a charitable order like &quot;Feed the Mages&quot;, or some such ****
<br>
<br>Even DA2 mages feel like demigod powerhouses with abilities, and spells aplenty compared to Inquisition&apos;s mage garbage.
<br>
<br>Also mounts are badly animated hard to control polygonal lumps that will make reaching your destination actually take longer than just running there.
<br>
<br>All in all game play wise the story is the best thing going for the game, and yes some dislike it, but that&apos;s always gonna be the case.
<br>I didn&apos;t get a refund, because I decided to wait for the technical problems to hopefully get ironed out, and the despite all the above **** I really want to see where the story goes.
<br>
<br>I could go on, but the above is the most common points of hate so far.
<br>
<br>P.S. Console owners are reporting the same terrible frame rates now too.&#xFEFF;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4748384">Expand</a></span>

This game is just not good. Nothing about it is good. Its not a good rpg, it is not a good adventure game, it has no character whatsoever, and is the most boring experience I have had in a very long time. It is so boring, that I stopped playing around 20 hours in, left it for a month, came back and could only stand to play 4 hours before quitting again. I really want to like this game but it has no redeeming qualities. It is a adventure MMO with very light rpg elements thrown in just to be able to label it an RPG. Customization is narrow and the story... oh my god the boring story and worthless characters. Imagine the worst MMO you ever played, with forgettable characters, cheap fetch quests over and over, meaningless plot development, and classes with &quot;I win&quot; buttons. That is DA:I to the letter. Even graphics, which are supposed to be incredible are ugly except maybe the environment. I hate the shiny finish everything has but I will let that go. The worst part of this game is gameplay. DA:I forces you into a story that you cannot really influence. You play it their way or you are SOL. For instance, in the winter palace, they actually put a timer on you to finish the quest when all I wanted to do was kill everyone in the palace. I actually wanted the assassins to win because I hated the other side. Do you have a choice in the matter? Nope. This is why it does not feel like an RPG. Nothing you do matters regardless of choice and the entire plot is very linear despite trying to fool you with a plethora of side quests and large psuedo-open maps. You either do as you are told or you lose. Back to gameplay, Mages and Warriors are poorly balanced. Mages can beat the entire game on any difficulty with 1 button (maybe 2 in case of emergency). Same with warriors. Rogues are absolutely attrocious because of all the melee AOE enemies in the game and their lack of survivability. Their only choice is to be archer which is fine to stay alive but they are so weak that they cant do anything on their own. Enemies get stuck while getting attacked, and so do your allies. You allies do not follow commands when told to do so. There is no strategy at all in this game. Crafting is worthless so far (25 hours in and the stuff i found is much better than anything I can craft). The loot system sucks the big one.
<br>
<br>I have nothing good to say about this game except that it works and does not crash very much. I wish I could get a full refund.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4907370">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. Controls for PC is bad.
<br>2. Tactical mode is just awful. It is actually almost unusable if you compare it with DAO. Even DA2 was better in that sense. Camera is too close.
<br>3. Language restrictions. I cannot buy game without localization in my country.
<br>4. And localization is bad.
<br>5. Anyway I buy game with original sound/text. And for some characters voices are bad. For main character - you have only two option of sound (and they not so different). Some NPC have bad voicing. Like very young-looking and small templar commander Lucious with strong bass voice). It is ridiculous.
<br>6. Too much black skinned people in game. It isn&apos;t realistic. Why in middle-age setting in the snows half of population is black? Why it wasn&apos;t so in DAO? I for more in-game options but mixing people of all races in fantasy game only for show - it is bad taste. If in ME it was ok - because all people was mixed in the future - here it is very dumb and unexplainable. Just imagine Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings but hald of characters is black. Actually where is black elves and black dwarfs and anyway - why black and not Asians? Maybe because Asians don&apos;t complain about equality?
<br>7. Same with romance options. Bioware want to show how it is ok to be gay and how gay equals with not-gay people. And they show that equality in ... number of romance options! But it is exaggerrated. Anyway it feels more like lesson about equality than like good plot. I do not complain about gay-options at all. But in DAO it was implemented very good. And here and on DA2 it is added just for making a point. They devs. They can make all game about gays and it can be good game.
<br>8. Depth of side quests is bad. You feel like you play in MMORPG.
<br>9. Romance options - for straight male it is only Josephine she is pretty but very unremarkable as character. Cassandra is good comrade and well written but she is in her forties already and Sera is pretty ugly and dumb. And compare them to Merill, Morrigan, Leliana, Niishka, Lelliana, Jaheira, Aerie, Viconia. They was pretty and well written characters. Maybe Bioware wanted to make some un-cliched women but instead they just used another cliche. Anyway as straight man i have terrible feeling that gay-romance options is better in this game. Maybe it is done on purpose.
<br>10. Boring dialogs. Some better than others but most is boring. In big game like this it may be unavoidable and if it is only problem it is ok.
<br>
<br>Short version: It is shallow game with good graphics but without soul. It is wrong too call it RPG. It is action with RPG elements. It is ported on PC very bad. Gay and bi characters added for approval of LGBT-community and black people  added for equality but without any explanations. Atmosphere and setting of DAO is ruined.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4752019">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are indeed some people who may unfairly down-vote good games on the back of who the publisher is, but in DAI&apos;s case the low scores have it right regarding the shockingly bad PC version&apos;s / tactical camera controls for DAI and very obvious consolization / &quot;bad port&quot; on the HUD &amp; controller vs keyb+mouse inputs. The REAL trolls are those openly admitting their 10/10 scores aren&apos;t a reflection of the actual game but rather a childish fake &quot;revenge score&quot; against anyone who &quot;dares&quot; to give it more than 2-3 points lower than they did. And hating / attacking other people for &quot;daring&quot; to vote a game lower than your own score is just chronic &quot;fanboy&quot; insecurity.
<br>
<br>I love this site, and am well aware of some &quot;hate reviews&quot; spoiling some good games - but that cuts both ways and also includes high voting trolls trying to pretend that buggy games are somehow perfect works of art. Metacritic needs a huge &quot;user review&quot; overhaul starting with automatic review deletions for anyone who admits &quot;I gave a false score of x purely because someone else said something I didn&apos;t like&quot; as that isn&apos;t a serious &quot;review&quot; at all, it&apos;s exactly the same &quot;score trolling&quot; they falsely accuse the &quot;haters&quot; of. Another thing that needs bans are the sleazy personal attacks on the lines of &quot;Anyone who downvotes Bioware games must hate gay people&quot; false-flag &apos;hate speech&apos; accusations, of which I&apos;ve read by at least two childish 10/10 trolls here. Finally, there also needs to be automatic review deletions / flagging for those who vote up the same game multiple times for multiple platforms (have you REALLY gone and spent $300 buying the same  $60 game 5x over for separate PC, PS4, XB1, XBOX360 &amp; PS3 versions of the same game? No - so at least 4 out of those 5x 10* reviews are fake then...
<br>
<br>Some people are just going to have to &quot;get over themselves&quot; that not every game you personally like deserves a 10 if it has iffy game mechanics that are serious enough to cause a widespread backlash / complaint on multiple gaming forums - and that&apos;s DAI in a nutshell - a very pretty game with a good soundtrack that&apos;s completely spoiled by some messed up &quot;console first&quot; input design decisions that have rendered keyboard &amp; mouse input controls highly annoying. Same goes for stupid 10/10 reviews with simultaneous &quot;but I&apos;m just waiting for a patch&quot;. A perfect 10 should be just that - an infallibly perfect game in ALL aspects, and DAI is far, far from that with even Bioware themselves admitting some aspects of the PC version need urgently patching.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4742305">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One thing to note, get out of Hinterlands. Part of the fault lies with Bioware, as many players would probably fully explore an area before going to the next. Putting many huge maps on another overland map, and put different main quests on different maps may be fantastic for some players but not for others.
<br>
<br>Inquisition definitely has a lot of technical issues on PC platform. If a PC game plays much better with a controller than Keyboard and mouse, there is something wrong - maybe fighting games could be forgiven, but this is a sequel to lots of games which had better K+M control, which is a problem and very frustrating - actually, even more frustrating than many fighting games port to PC.
<br>
<br>Companion AI is also a problem and shows Bioware clearly did not think everything through when working with a world in which you can actually jump. AI charging or jumping off the cliff is an often occurance. AI setting is a huge backwards step.
<br>
<br>Overall these are the negatives of the game which most critical ones tend to focus on. Positives are already covered by critics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4741208">Expand</a></span>

There is absolutely no storyline what so ever, its more like do whatever you want which is annoying I wish the game had some direction... Combat targetting system is absolutely terrible. mounting is super bad. In all honesty, U guys  should be ashamed to put out a game like this.

<br>A second patch was issued to fix the UI and PC controls but it does not correct anything. To achieve the disaster it seems very difficult if not impossible to mod it so don&apos;t expect expansions from fans as you obtained with the BG series (this limitation is probably a feature : EA guys think it will boost the sales of their expensive crap DLC)

I have spent the last 3 years defending Bioware for the ME3 ending (which I was fine with) and telling everyone that Bioware is the best. But this game has done everything it can to shatter my view of Bioware. I have only played about 6 hours, and I am thinking of unloading and reloading my dishwasher as a way to add some fun into my evening. I only paid $32.00 for this.

I must admit: I`ve never been a fan of fantasy RPGs and being a completionist, but I`ve been trying to play these games and be a completionist for a past year. I`ve been doing a pretty good job at understanding those complicated skill and other kinds of systems and finishing as much stuff as I can find in maps (still hate multiplayer), but when I bumpped into DA:I I felt... frustrated. Not a lot of technical issues, but gameplay, game paste... I wanna do stuff and move to another area, but this game makes me come back if I don`t wanna miss anything. I really hate those boring sidequests, but I gave them a try. However, in this game I cannot even do many of those as some areas are locked for certain level. And why the hell they put 12 or whatever level monsters in a starting area? I wanna leave it as fast as possible, but game makes me come back and deal with those rifts and demons when I level up! And I can`t even get to some places as moving around is so complicated. People said &quot;leave the Hinterlands&quot;. I did. Same stuff all over the world. I wanna do thngs and move on, not backtrack! And I have to force my self to play this. I hate when there is too much stuff going on and I lose track of things. Those areas on war table - I`ll forget what I haven`t accoplished in some of those. OK, I think many people find it great to explore every inch of theese kind of games, but for me it`s nightmare. It seems like there is interesting stuff to see and to do, but all theese will have to be done later. I don`t wanna go back later! I wanna just move on and experience the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4874493">Expand</a></span>

<br>Resuming: is hard to play with mouse-keyboard, the isometric view is too close and confusing (seem thought as: &quot;we have accomplished to put the feature but use by your own&quot;), graphics are good to consoles but in PC I expect a bit more, and listen: Combat is Action! Yes, Bioware well done again! I must say that I have no issues with action games, I like Elder Scrolls, Witcher, Lords of the Fallen, etc, but as if there weren&apos;t enough ARPGs in the world Bioware wanted to be part of them. Bioware! One of the few studios that become famous with &quot;Canonic-RPGs&quot;, they looks desperate to lose their identity, shame of you Bioware...
<br>The rest of the game is not so bad because unlike DA2 and Diablo 3, if you approach with no expectations maybe you would enjoy it as a casual &quot;Hack&apos;n Slash with RPG folklore&quot;, but still having serious flaws: combat is not RPG (like Origins), but neither completely ARPG (like Skyrim), so is a confusing mixture without soul. There are so few dialogue options a la Mass Effect, giving the sensation of being talking with robots. And romance options are insipid, there is only one &quot;desirable&quot; male straight option and you will not want to take it, (nothing compared with Morrigan, Elanee, Viconia...), and, if all of this were not enough, gay options seem forced (you know what I mean).
<br>The worse is the lack of a toolkit to make deep modding, so all mods will be by reverse engineering (i.e. like Dragon Age 2, nothing like Dragon Age Origins), shame of Bioware to forget your bests fans...
<br>Well... is another generic &quot;Action Adventure with RPG folklore&quot;, if you liked ARPGs like B0und by Flame you may enjoy it, with common graphics, common dialogue options, a big generic world to explore, and, of course, there will be common mods (like environment, nudity, hairstyles, etc, nothing compared to Origins or NWN).
<br>Now, if you are seeking a true RPG, reinstall Origins or, better, be amazed by the new independent RPGs like Divinity: Original Sin, Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2 or Torment: Tides of Numenera, with no billionaires marketing campaign, nor cinematic of course, but you will have true RPGs that will enlighten your imagination as open books, trust me.
<br>Well, if the game is &quot;digestible&quot;, why the low rating you  may ask? Because its name: &quot;Dragon Age&quot;...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4753599">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>- Graphics is good. Not awesome for 2014 but good and qualifies as eye candy.
<br>- The game world is larger than Dragon Age 2. It isn&apos;t actually an open world as in the Elder Scrolls games but at least you won&apos;t revisit the same locations over and over again.
<br>- You can meet characters from previous games. It&apos;s fanservice of course, but who doesn&apos;t like some good fanservice?
<br>- Soundtrack is great. If you&apos;re a fan of epic music you&apos;ll love it.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- The main story and conversations feel as though they are written for teens and, which is worse, by teens. Cringe-worthy B- grade stuff.
<br>- Combat is godawful. A mix of MMO combat with console action. Button mashing . Don&apos;t even try to play Inquisition with keyboard and mouse.
<br>- The character animations are clumsy and unnatural. I know it&apos;s a common enough problem for 3D games but this time the developers didn&apos;t even try. Annoying and breaks immersion.
<br>- Serious performance issues on a rig that can handle Shadows of Mordor on High/Ultra without any trouble.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>Not the most terrible game I&apos;ve played in my life but it could be much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4750688">Expand</a></span>

Even the lore has been twisted to ...better suit the story? Add some fluff? I do not know. There are also mechanics missing entirely, such as the healer.
<br>
<br>The side-quests are MMO style hunt and gather, repetitive and dull. A far cry from their start in Baldur&apos;s Gate where you could almost always find a twist or even Dragon Age Origins where at least part of them had enough complications to keep you interested.
<br>
<br>The controls on the PC are amazingly bad, the UI is almost thoughtless in its design and while the graphics are fine, my modded Skyrim looks better and (somehow) works better. There has been no optimization and seeing as how Bio is bad at it already, I don&apos;t expect that to change. If they&apos;d have allowed for a tool set kit, I would have expected the community to fix it (as it happened for Skyrim) but alas...
<br>
<br>I am giving it a 2 because it squeezed a few laughs out of me, but it&apos;s not even mediocre in my eyes. It is not an RPG, not even an action game. It is a high fantasy hiking simulator.
<br>
<br>I would classify this game as a missed opportunity. For those of you who expected Bioware to redeem itself, I&apos;m very sorry. I&apos;m as disappointed as you are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4750913">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>pros:
<br>The graphics are decent,
<br>the english voice-over is good
<br>choices of the previous two titles get carried over
<br>you dont have to pick a healer or play as one anymore because healing magic is gone (no more wynne)
<br>
<br>cons:
<br>Combat sucks - no more tactics, just buttonmashing
<br>enemies are dumb bulletsponges
<br>the sad excuse of an up-top tactical view, nowhere near da:origins
<br>your comrades dont have any character, even varric has lost his humor
<br>the story starts boring (no origins-like character background, your background is being told via text in the character creation)
<br>you dont see the faces of people when you talk to them anymore, thus they all seem like puppets you dont care about
<br>dull mmo-like sidequests (kill 10 guys, bring me 5 animalskins, activate base x by walking there)
<br>not remotely story-driven, feels like a single player-mmorpg
<br>no real leveling up, where da:origins had tons of different skills, da: inquisition leaves the player with limited choices (especially the mages suck compared to da:origins, you only have 4 types of magic now, fire,ice,lightning and some buff-crap)
<br>stats level up automatically, making them practically useless
<br>the minimap is bad
<br>other than english, the voiceover sucks
<br>why are there 5 male romance options for male humans, but only 2 females? (one of which is pretty much a man too)
<br>
<br>In conclusion: if you never played da:origins you might enjoy this game, if you did: stay away from this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4747996">Expand</a></span>

<br>This was like playing a single-player MMO, having to grind and do sidequests for hours between every main quest.
<br>The story is nonsensical with major clich&#xE9;s, written like it was done by a 14 year old who&apos;s only experience with Fantasy is through videogames, using simplistic events to bring the story forward, i.e. &quot;use the magic sword&quot;. The story lacks basic storytelling structure and is just the good guy winning and being cool, thanks to a very bad plot device, [spoiler]    time travel.    [/spoiler]    This might seem like a stretch, but I got more out of the &quot;story&quot; in Dragon Age 2. DA2 was a bad game in all respects that had three different stories going on, but atleast I can recall what those stories were. This was a generic fight between a good guy and bad guy.
<br>
<br>Mixed in with all that there&apos;s Freemium iphone app devices like having the player wait x amount of hours to get small rewards.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s amazing that an AAA game can be this bad, and yet a game like &quot;The Banner Saga&quot;, which was made by 3 people, can make all of the same aspects for so much less and be so much better.
<br>
<br>In total I spent about 40 hours on the game, about which I assume 6 were around the main storyline. Nothing outside of that felt like it mattered, and as if it was thought &quot;more time spent&quot; = good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4815392">Expand</a></span>

Even here in Inquisition sequel, the combat system is boooooring and very worse, in tactical view you can see the 5% of battle land, characters jump... why? What&apos;s the problem with DAO system? It work, it make the game one of the best, why change it ? Biowere have lost the way with Dragon Age.</span>

After 1h of playing some simple questions come into my mind. We&apos;re on late 2014, technology has greatly evolved, developers have very strong tools on their hands that 10 years ago wouldn&apos;t dream of. Right? How come they can&apos;t design a decent inventory???
<br>
<br>Tell me, why do I have to navigate between dozens of windows to change a bloody armor? And why the hell are inventory icons so big? What are we, blind? Even on the old days when graphics were crap, inventories were designed to be practical and to offer a good overview of all your items, characters, skills etc. In DA:I its the complete opposite. You don&apos;t have any overview at all.
<br>
<br>Another thing that bothered me right from the beginning is the overall control/camera/fighting system of the game. I don&apos;t know where to start, its like the developers decided in secret to mess with their old fans. The tactical camera is only &quot;tactical&quot; by name because you can&apos;t see almost anything.
<br>
<br>No matter how much you zoom out the camera is fixed very close to the team leader and in order to see whats around you you&apos;re obliged to change the view into 3rd person!! Now imagine how confusing this can be in the middle of a battle. This poor implemented system results in many headaches making it rather impossible to create tactics and enjoy the game. You just attack the bad guy and watch out whether anyone from the party is low on health to heal him. That&apos;s the whole &quot;strategy&quot; of the game, poor and primitive.
<br>
<br>And here comes the next question. Why didn&apos;t they use the same tactical camera of DA:O which was almost perfect? Was it hard to implement? Why cant we PC users enjoy and take advantage of the keyboard+mouse combination, haven&apos;t we payed for the PC version of the game after all?? For heaven&apos;s sake I don&apos;t want to use an xbox controller for a game that should meant to be played with keyboard and mouse! I wont take it any further and speak for other flaws for the ones I mentioned are enough to spoil my experience...
<br>
<br>After this abomination of a game at best, I will turn my back on this company and never buy any of their filthy products again. Only pirate them, because that&apos;s what they truly deserve.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4751360">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is a stupid MMORPG. The dialogues are so stupid as to seem fake. The quests are the level of World of Warcraft. Combat is one of the worst things I have ever seen.

They are just contributing to the downfall of PC gaming while getting fat off of endorsing any product for loootz. Seriously I don&apos;t have any respect for any game journalist out there.
<br>
<br>The Consumer is the voice of reason and always has been.
<br>
<br>I bought DA:I yesterday (off Origin of course) because they release only a tiny portion of boxed copies locally, forcing people to go through Origin where they can charge whatever they want because of exclusivity. I paid $80 AUD for a game that&apos;s been out of months (for a Digital copy) Now usually I don&apos;t care how much a game is as long as it&apos;s quality, but DA:I is anything but.
<br>
<br>I was extremely excited to play this, having fallen in love with DA:O - (DA:2 not so much) The initial excitement lasted just past the character creation screen where it was crushed by the inevitable realization that this was another brain-dead console port.
<br>
<br>The first kick in the teeth was the stupid un-intuitive console inventory, then my disappointment worsened when I saw there&apos;s only two slots for armor (really? two!) no belts, no gloves, no rings, no greaves, no boots, no jewelry ? - way to make a dumb game even dumber and more shallow.
<br>
<br>Then there&apos;s the complete garbage skill trees, that were so generic and lack-luster I stood there for 10 minutes deciding do I want this crap ability or this other crap ability. Skipping that, I clicked on the Behaviors tab, not to my surprise, the items didn&apos;t even fit on the page so I couldn&apos;t even read them.
<br>
<br>The Graphics- This is 2015 folks, the graphical quality in DA:I meet the absolute minimum standards for this generation of gaming. It&apos;s not an ugly game, but for this generation, I expect much better and in turn much better optimization. I&apos;ve got the best hardware money can buy and I managed 40-70 fps on max, that is terrible optimization for these average graphics.
<br>
<br>To top all that off, there is a horrible mouse acceleration issue that makes the camera stagger and jitter which feels incredibly bad. No amount of tweaking the sensitivity and smoothing made it go away. More remnants of the lazy console port.
<br>
<br>Lastly, the combat is not fun, It takes me about 10 seconds to locate my damn cursor due to it being the size of an ant, and without any passive animation to give it away, I then start shooting enemies like my staff is a Gatling gun of sorts while my team &quot;blink&quot; around like idiots and everything quickly looks like a giant orgy, all the while I have 4 guys on me as a mage and they can&apos;t take aggro off me due to getting stuck on terrain, so I have to run at the pace of a sloth until they get their **** together.
<br>
<br>The animations are bad, the effects are something you would expect from a 1999 RPG, and the path-finding is crap also making combat in general very unsatisfying.
<br>
<br>Lucky I am able to get a refund for this POS. RIP Dragon age. (probably not thanks to console casuals gobbling this crap up)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4904416">Expand</a></span>

<br>Bioware: You lost the ability to create immersive games. And No, I do not think that these days games need to be shallow, easy to consume, with tons of simply time consuming side quests. The success of Skyrim and Bethesda show that the majority of RPC fans think that way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4787766">Expand</a></span>

I have both Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age 2. I wasn&apos;t too found of DA2, but I did enjoy the story line. Now on to my review of DA:I.
<br>
<br>I have to agree with other critics and say this game has a feel of a single player MMO. This game feels like as if EA was working on an MMO game and then felt as if it wasn&apos;t going to sell because of games like Destiny and Witcher 3. So at a last minute they changed it to a Dragon Age game with the same characters. That is why I have a feeling there is no Warden in this game. Then they delayed it another year because they need to fix the kinks from the original format to make it work as a Dragon Age game.
<br>
<br>Second part that supports my theory above is the fact PC keyboard and mouse support is awful. This game feels like it was ported from a console to PC instead of the other way around. I generally try to press F5 to quick save and it doesn&apos;t work.
<br>
<br>My other beef with this game is the fact you can&apos;t distribute attribute points like the other games. Your best way to increase your attributes is your equipment. I have even found rare equipment that I can&apos;t use for another few levels. Which goes to my other beef is XP is so slow in this game compared to the other games.
<br>Even carrying limited 8 potions is lame and when you run out, you run out. They said your health bar would increase slow after a battle, but wow talk about it is really, really slow.
<br>
<br>My last beef with this game is the fact that there is no healing spells. There is a skill that lets you revive and heal them, but it is so far up the tree that it is hard to get to especially with low xp rewards you get. I have ran into a high dragon already in the game at level 4 and got killed. They say you have to use strategy and I had no choice to face them. Even if you ran they follow you till you are dead.
<br>
<br>Fanboys can&apos;t fathom the fact that this game has it&apos;s flaws. All they seem to care is that the fact this game has good graphics and it&apos;s a Dragon Age game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4738927">Expand</a></span>

It has obviously been dumbed down to the nth degree for the console crowd, so if you have a console and simplicity, this is for you!
<br>
<br>The recruitable characters have all the personality of a potato, from Cassandra&apos;s one dimensional sneer, to the tofu-like Solas, they are all very boring. Even Varric, a very interesting character from DA:2 is bland in this game.
<br>
<br>Looting is a chore, every field has elf-root spread all over it and every cliff numerous mineral nodes. Again, the console crowd will love it, it feeds the console OCD, but as a PC gamer, it was just monotonous. I spent more time running around picking stuff up than I did fighting, which was almost a blessing considering the boring combat.
<br>
<br>I am just glad that Origin is refunding my purchase or I would be really unhappy. As it is, I am just sad that such a great series has gone so far downhill.
<br>
<br>Speaking of combat, it is just a huge disappointment. In DA: Origins, mages felt powerful and two-handed weapons felt beefy and hit hard. In this game everything is just homogenized with truncated skill lines and very boring combat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4748441">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is pure frustration on nightmare. Not because it&apos;s actually challenging but because NOTHING **** WORKS!
<br>
<br>You will have 3 main enemies on nightmare:
<br>
<br>- terrible terrible camera, sweet mother of jesus i can barely interact with rifts when using this. It doesnt show anything! It&apos;s ultra zoomed in and you have to awkwardly move the middle of your screen to do anything.
<br>
<br>- NO usable Tactics menu! YOU GET 5 TACTICS OPTIONS WHICH ARE PRETTY MUCH ALL RELATED TO POTIONS AND YOU CANT CHANGE THAT!!! You cant tell your party any useful &quot;if ... then cast / use ability -&gt; .... &quot; commands THEY SIMPLY DO NOT EXIST IN THIS GAME! DA FAK????
<br>
<br>- The AI is the dumbest group of idiots i have ever seen. Sure they will autocast their spells if you allow them.. but da fak!!! There is a spell named &quot;Barrier&quot; that gives a massive second life bar for a short duration to absorb damage but when does your AI companion cast it??? Not when someone in your party is actually dropping low on health ohhh no no way THEY CAST IT BEFORE THE BLOODY START OF THE BATTLE WHILE YOU ARE WALKING UP TO THE ENEMIES SO IT RUNS OUT BEFORE YOU HAVE EVEN TAKEN ONE GODDAMN HIT!!!
<br>
<br>Seriously the combat is broken! Not fun at all pure frustration. Maybe if you play on easy and nobody is even able to die from anything ( Ohh btw there is a spec in the game that is designed so retardedly op that it solos nightmare difficulty by just tapping 2 buttons repeatedly! Just throwing that out..)
<br>
<br>And the Story OOOHHHH MYYYY GOOOOD!
<br>Imagine a world where everyone only says the most obvious things ever. &quot; I am a healer. I am in need of herbs. It&apos;s dangerous outside so please collect them for me.&quot; Response: &quot;Ohh so you&apos;re a healer and in need of herbs?&quot; &quot; Yes look at the list of herbs on the table&quot;
<br>
<br>^This is an adequate representation of all dialoge in the game even the story missions. Speaking of story missions.. The story in this game progresses like ever 4 hours with a single 15 minute quest that is more ultraobvious talk.
<br>
<br>GOD ITS SOOOOO BAD. Words can not explain how bad this game really is. How much worse it is than it&apos;s predecessors (YES THAT INCLUDES DA2!!!!)
<br>
<br>I have seriously waited to buy this .. read a billion of reviews most of which were positive and I LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW ANYONE CAN GIVE THIS DUNG HEAP MORE THAN 6/10 . Geeeezzzz it&apos;s sooooooo baaaaaaad.
<br>
<br>If you want to play a good RPG, buy Divinity Original Sin instead!!!

I also advise against buying Dragon Age: Inquisition any time soon if EA keeps their present pace and disposition towards actually FIXING the problems.
<br>
<br>There is apparently a fundamental coding problem that causes AMD Radeon as well as several Nvidia GPU&apos;s to &quot;HANG&quot; and cause a DX error. Overclocked processors also seems to have issue with the game. My system far exceeds the minimum requirements as well as the recommended requirements and I am completely unable to the play this game.
<br>
<br>EA has already tried to say this problem is &quot;SOLVED&quot; in their &quot;Answers HQ&quot; site. They said an AMD Catalyst beta driver patch 14.11 would fix this problem. Untrue. They have since rescinded the &quot;SOLVED&quot; on that particular issue, but I see &quot;SOLVED&quot; popping up on other issues I know not to be.
<br>
<br>There are also a host of other issues people who can actually play are having. They range from bonus items promised for the Digital Deluxe version not being DL&apos;d to gameplay mechanics issues. The problems run the full gambit in between.
<br>
<br>I can honestly say I have never been so excited for a game and then so let down. This is my first MetaCritic review and I am bummed it has to be a negative one.
<br>
<br>Save your money, and save yourself some frustration on this one. I am going to ask for a refund and maybe a year from now when they FINISH this game I will consider it again for PC. Seems to make more sense to just buy it for a console though. I am now suspecting strongly it was intended for and written for consoles with PC&apos;s as a port afterthought..though that is only a suspicion as I have not actually been able to PLAY the game for more than 2-3 minute increments. I am basing this opinion largely on other consumer reviews I have read.
<br>
<br>Does anyone else find it a little fishy this game got such RAVE reviews by critics without a whisper of any of these issues? Who owns these gaming review magazines and web sites I wonder?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4744198">Expand</a></span>

This game has so many flaws and problems. For me the bread and butter of every RPG is character progression - since DA1 and DA2 it was significantly dumbed down. No attribute points, no specializations. Only 4 trees for every class.
<br>Quests: the main body of quests simply consist from go to point A and kill x enemies, take their claws/meat/skin and bring it to point B or go to point A, find 10 flowers there and bring them to point B. You do not want to do this? Oh well, then you are screwed since you need points generated from these quests in order to be able to play the main story campaign.
<br>Minimap: It is completely blank. There is in arrow showing in which direction you should go to find the quest area - you cannot go straight forward because you have huge mountain in the way - too bad, because there is no terrain displayed on the minimap. So you have to press &apos;M&apos; to open the large map and check it. You have to do this over and over again just to check you are heading in the right direction.
<br>Combat: There is no auto-attack, so when you are fighting larger boss enjoy crazy clicking. Detection of hits is clunky as well. You are 1 m far away from the enemy - enjoy swinging your sword/daggers in the air. Do you like pausing the game and issuing orders to your companions while solving difficult combat situations? Forget it, it is not possible here. You have to have tactical camera enabled. Which is buggy as hell. That eventually lead me to no pausing game at all (even when I was pausing zealot in DA 1 and DA 2). You want  to loot something on the ground? Hmm there is icon of hand displayed, but caution - you have to be like 1 cm away from the object, otherwise you character is not able to loot it.
<br>Conversations had been simplified as well. There is no clever writing as it was presented in DA 1 and DA 2. Despite being huge fan of Bioware and their previous games (I have all expansions to DA 1 and DA 2 and I have played it multiple times) I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I just wanted to warn you - do not spend your money on this game. It is not worth it. If you had the strength and continued to read this &quot;review&quot; till the end - thank you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4762924">Expand</a></span>

<br>On my first post of this thread, i had played around 3 hours.
<br>
<br>After playing another 4, i think its time to give up and just put the game to one side and forget about it,
<br>in disgust of my own foolishness to buy it without waiting for threads like this with honest reviews.
<br>
<br>None of these issue&apos;s are mentioned in what i used to think was a reputable and trustworthy site, pcgamer,
<br>who give the game an unjustified 87/100 score.
<br>For once, the metacritic user score and comments are the closest to the truth when it comes to the state of the game.
<br>
<br>The story is terrible, it really is.
<br>I couldn&apos;t get hooked into it like previous games.
<br>The characters are soulless and the plot is just plain wrong, boring and unbelievable.
<br>
<br>The graphics are ok, optimization seems ok, but if this had the gameplay of the original, i wouldn&apos;t mind if it looked like pong.
<br>
<br>Im a bit gutted that i purchased my game through G2A, which offer no refunds, right when i didn&apos;t need to waste money,
<br>but this was truly a waste.
<br>
<br>It feels like im playing a really bad version of World of Warcraft single player, with better graphics.
<br>The gameplay is just as brainless, and your on your own.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know whats happened to bioware, i really don&apos;t.
<br>But i definitely won&apos;t be so hasty to dive straight in and expect good quality games again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4761278">Expand</a></span>

<br>Bad PC port with several technical issues especially problems with SLI and frame rates drops, FPS as low as 25-30 despite GTX 780 SLI.
<br>Bland and badly written dialogues that appears random and make no sense. Stupid AI where you have to issue commands to your companions then pause and issue same commands after a couple seconds, lest they became mutinous. The companions can&apos;t be assigned scripts and clear instructions on how to use their already cut down and simplified abilities, and the combat have been severely dumbed down and simplified even in Nightmare difficulty with no tactical challenge whatsoever, and consist of spamming buttons and hoping to connect a hit and learn to hate the long and stupid attack animation that plays even if you misclick. The GUi is a mess.
<br>Use a gamepad? Useless as it doesn&apos;t prevent the problems already mentioned and I&apos;m a keypad-mouse player and this is a fricking RPG game ffs, or a least it pretends to be.
<br>The amount of fetch quests and MMO like game sequences is too damn high.
<br>The animations and character designs are ugly, Dorian and its sentient moustache are a joke, Varric is ruined in design as well as his humour, and Solas look like crap, and there is no single good looking female character as even Leliana appear wooden (although you can feel her sadness to be part of this game :)). Romance? Plastic + stupid dialogues = no immersion. No thanks to Gayder and the hack writers who ruined romance and characters development trying to please every poor sod and their dog, the design team dealing the finishing blow to what used to be an important part of Bioware games.
<br>The story is bland and as boring as closing the oblivion gates in Elder Scrolls minus the epicness of said game, as DA Inquisition may look nice but the world is lifeless, and even fighting a dragon in a franchise where dragons used to be a big part of the story and lore became a chore now.
<br>Bioware tried too hard to please everybody and expand its market to MMO buffs and action games fans, failing to focus its efforts in making a proper RPG, it completely lost its ability to make good RPGs since DA Origins and Mass Effect 2. I find it moronic to rehash the same crap time and again and hope for the best, they said they learned from their mistakes and accepted fans feedback, I highly doubt that. I&apos;m also amused by the discrepancy between professional reviews and scores and the users&apos; ones. Surely we failed somehow to grasp the hidden EA greatness.

I have had such a horrible time just getting to the rift, trying to find loot, trying to fight the boss at the rift, trying to figure out which way is up.......utterly fed up, you can have my money, I am going back to play through Origins again.  Your Inquisition sucks.</span>
