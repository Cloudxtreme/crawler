<br>
<br>There are several factions to work for or against...  Plenty of missions to undertake - again, in search of rez.  Plenty of ships to blow up, technology to acquire, star systems to explore...
<br>
<br>The galaxy itself is as large as you&apos;d like it to be.  Randomly-generated.  Very expansive.
<br>
<br>The storyline is actually halfway-decent.  It does more than enough to provide an excuse to shoot battle your way across the galaxy.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is downright addictive.  Simple twitch-shooter mechanics coupled with RPG-esque upgrades and treasure-hunting.  Some simple fleet mechanics.  Some resource management.  Lots of explosions and some humorous commentary along the way.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve sunk absolutely ridiculous amounts of time into this game - and I can&apos;t see myself stopping any time soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=2805328">Expand</a></span>

Beams work well against shields but not armor, point defenses stop missiles, scanners negate cloaks, and so forth. Somebody put a lot of thought into that space combat system, and it could have been the foundation of a great game similar to Faster Than Light. But then there&apos;s the second game, an arcadey space shooter in which you blast your way through endless waves of enemies while amassing experience points to acquire better equipment with which to defeat bigger enemies. So the delicate rock-paper-scissors of the first game gets trampled by the second game&apos;s rush to XP. There&apos;s no point thinking too hard about ship layout and other tactical decisions, because most of the time the fleet with superior tech simply crushes the opposition. And even when the battles are close, there are no tools to help you understand why you won or lost. There&apos;s no combat log, no slowing of time, no rewind to review the battle. I often lost ships and battles without having any idea why. Was my fleet poorly designed? Did I use the wrong tactics? Was the enemy fleet simply too powerful? I didn&apos;t mind losing, but it was unsatisfying not to know why I had lost. And it was even more unsatisfying not to have much reason to care. There&apos;s no risk of losing in this game. There are no real setbacks. You just spend ten minutes fighting a battle, and if you lose then you spend ten minutes in tedious resource acquistion so that you can try the battle again, or try another battle. There are no real defeats and therefore no real victories. No emotional arcs. The flashy lasers and explosions become drudgery. You don&apos;t win this game with superior tactics or loadout decisions. You win this game with raw patience. If you grind away at battles that are not too easy and not too difficult, then eventually I assume you&apos;ll win. After 32 hours, I don&apos;t have any more patience for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=2834244">Expand</a></span>

On the bright side, it can be quite rewarding to out-maneuver and crush fleets far larger than yours, steal blueprints, blow up space stations, and leveling and tech-ing up on top of it.  The technologies are quite balanced, well thought-out and rewarding, and resource acquisition is simple and easy - especially if you choose to fly with large cargo hold ships and lose ships minimally.   Therefore even if you do suffer a crushing defeat, you can always bounce back for some revenge without too much hassle (mining is very boring however).  The usage of specialists is an interesting and nice twist on fleet capabilities.<br><br>However, there are quite a few nuisances.  I don&apos;t know what people are talking about superior AI.  Ships you aren&apos;t immediately commanding will frequently rush off to their immediate deaths.  While you may choose certain ships in your fleet because they can theoretically create a superior combination, in reality the AI will be controlling them most of the time and frankly uses them terribly (not firing as much as your reactors support, terrible evasion, charging through bullet/laser salvos, targeting things they have no hope of destroying or ignoring things that are pwning them), therefore its important to consider how the AI might use the ships you include in your fleet.  The becon which serves as your base when visiting space stations ALWAYS spawns right next to the space stations.  This can be convenient if you are friendly with the station, but absolutely stupid and annoying if your aim is to blow the station to smithereens (a very cheap way to acquire tons of tech).  If the becon is destroyed, you cannot repair or drop off captured resources/slaves, and can&apos;t rebuild...and it spawns right within range of station weapons.  Frankly, as a pirate, I really think its lame if I&apos;m expected to bribe every single time as the range of the becon indicates I should.  People have definitely got it right when they say the game is repetitive.  As you move from star system to star system, its basically rinse and repeat the same actions with a very short list of mission variation.  If you&apos;ve traveled 5 star systems, you&apos;ve probably seen every single mission except ones that progress the plot.  There&apos;s also an annoying feature where you cannot leave a scenario so long as there as an enemy ship on the map, which means you will be using the mass retreat function for 9/10 engagements just to end it within a decent amount of time.  You might think, well why not blow it up?  Well, its about 17000 of whatever distance units they use away from me when a typical engagement is about 2000 distance units.  If every battle requires some amount of minutes just to chase down one mostly dead fighter, it really starts to add up the time I&apos;m drumming my fingers on my desk.  Mostly dead fighters will often do this much to my annoyance in chapters 3 and 4.  There are a few other things I could critique, but thats probably too much to ask from a 2-man company mainly in terms of story line, dialogue, ambience and general mood.  Overall a decent game - I&apos;ve spent over 100 hours on it already and intend to spend a bit more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=2326958">Expand</a></span>

Do yourself a favor and grab this title now, while it&apos;s still just $15 bucks.

You have reputations to raise, generated missions, random events, levels, ships, ship pats, ship customization.... I hate linear games with an end. This game has a finish, but it is played like a sandbox.</span>

One of the best indie game AI I&apos;ve seen so far. The AI is very responsive but has some hiccups, but very very little. The voice acting is also good. The only thing that was not too good was the difficult spike, but you get used to it in about 10 minutes. I highly recommend this game for any person who likes a strategy or shooting game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724119">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s more like a casual space exploration game that integrates action based combat. As you progress, the battles can get pretty intense, but there&apos;s no pressure because you don&apos;t lose the game if you lose a battle allowing you to experiment and move at your own pace. Usually you just have to reassess your ship configurations if you get into a situation you can&apos;t handle.
<br>
<br>There is a slight learning curve, but nothing overwhelming. The galaxy is very large providing hundreds of hours of potential play and the game always seems to throw you a new challenge as you advance, so it doesn&apos;t get repetitively boring. There&apos;s plenty to do between the main story mission, side missions, and the variety of faction objectives in each system. Hands down, SPAZ is a game that should be in your collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=2198124">Expand</a></span>

Combat gets old fairly quickly, shooting the same weapons at the same handful of ships who utilize the same tactics over and over, on missions you&apos;ve already done 5+ times. With more variety, more AI programming, and more upgrade mechanics, this game can be something great. The first few hours, I loved the game, but it felt much more like grinding after those few beginning hours when there was a strong sense of novelty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=1782569">Expand</a></span>

Very rarely have i seen an indie game by such a small dev team hit the mark like this game does. Reminds me of an old school asteroids with a modern rts feel. The last time i had this much fun in a space game was Freelancer. Only one patch into release and its already easily one of my favorite games to hit steam this year. To the guys at MinMax You really hit the spot on this one keep up the good work. If you havent checked this out i can assure you its worth every cent of the $15 it costs, do yourself a favor and pick this up you wont regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724954">Expand</a></span>

Game is easily a 7 or so until you reach the final quarter of the game when you reach the core with different enemies and it just gets annoying.  I found the game extremely easy but found it annoying that my Beam build was given the shaft on the last enemies and was forced to switch.  Annoying and once I switched to an alternate weapon the game was ridiculous easily and the last quarter consisted of me raiding enemy outposts and pressing the fire button repeatedly.  The last quarter of the game really just showed me how little there was to the game and really brought out the repetitive nature of it.  Decent game but don&apos;t go playing full price until they add some content to the later levels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=2090292">Expand</a></span>

It is a top-down view space shoot em&apos; up like the old school games from the 80s and 90s on PC. You upgrade and buy new ships, secure territory, steal some pirate booty, and eventually you&apos;re the only thing standing in the way of an invasion that could destroy all life-forms! The gameplay is stellar, the story is astronomical, and the graphics are out of this world! (see what i did there?) The gameplay and story are both very deep; the story is full of twists (just when you think the game is getting repetitive, everything changes), and there are a lot of different upgrade paths and tactics to choose from when you build your fleet. I can&apos;t imagine why or how anyone could ever regret buying this game, unless of course it becomes so addicting that you catch the infection and turn into a SPAZ zombie (like I did).

At release I immediately wrote the game off simply because it had &quot;zombies&quot; in the title. I am quite honestly just tired of the lazy way that zombies are getting pumped out in games these days. During one of the steam sales I decided to watch the trailer and it turned me around. I played it and fell in love. As a kid I grew up playing classic space shooters like Life Force, Gradius, Darius, R-Type and all the big 16 bit era games. While there have been lots of great games in the genre since then none of them seemed to take the next logical step, depth. S.P.A.Z. does just that. Adding a level of depth to the genre that I have never seen. Now there have been some games that added some of the management systems and rpg like elements. They just tend to be centered around those elements and ignore the flight and battle elements. Now of course there is room for improvement but it does so many things well. The battles are fun, intense and usually pretty challenging. The management elements have depth and require thought and skill but aren&apos;t as daunting as you would expect. Un-lockable hull types with the ability to customize those hulls, weapons, shields and more. A very pretty game graphically, especially for an indie game with a 2 man development team. I&apos;ve spent time just watching the A.I. battles that play in the background on the main menu screen. Now the ship controls can feel a little odd at first but once you get used to them they make sense.  In short, if you have any interest in space battles and fun sci fi stories you have to own this game. I love it and have even bought copies for my friends. Good luck and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=2118909">Expand</a></span>

So after playing for awhile you&apos;ll run into the same missions quite a bit.  There is also no point in exploring either since missions and star systems are the same.  Because of that I found no reason to play on any map size besides the smallest available.  Also with larger maps it spreads upgrades far apart, so it forces you to travel and repeat everything a lot more if you want a certain upgrade.<br><br>Towards the mid of the game I grew frustrated with the repetitiveness and rushed through missions; blowing everything up regardless of faction, not caring about relations.  It got interesting again when zombie were introduced along with new missions.  Again though, there are only handful of zombie missions, and it starts to get repetitive.<br><br>It may sound as if I hated  the game but I did enjoy it.  I am impressed that it was only made by two people, but I wished they compressed the world size (even smaller than the smallest available) or added more variety of missions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=1736090">Expand</a></span>

Premise: Have you longed for the joy of 2D Space RPGs like Star control or Masters of Orion? Well, after years of waiting, two man company MinMax have released S.P.A.Z. with the intention of reviving that sense of adventure! However, does it live up to the standards set for it, or fall into its own black hole?<br>Review:<br><br>Plot: The plot of S.P.A.Z. revolves around a somewhat dystopian future, with earth a backwater planet and scattered colonies all but cut off from each other by blockades. It&apos;s here that a group of pirates set out from earth in hopes of reaching the galactic core in search of a motherload of Rez, a transmutable element that serves as one of the game&apos;s currencies. While this plot is amusing and quite humorous at times, it won&apos;t win any Oscars. It features voice-overs on the &quot;cut-scenes&quot; that explain the plot, but the majority of the story will be delivered by RPG-esque text boxes. However, the plot is engaging and more than exiting enough to drive you to complete your objectives, if not only to blow stuff up! Overall: 8/10<br><br>Presentation: While S.P.A.Z. might look like a well made flash game at first, the true beauty of this game is in the details. Backgrounds are bright and colorful, often containing a myriad of nebulae, planets, and other cosmic beauties to catch your eye. The ships too are numerous and well made, having visible maneuvering thrusters (unlike many other games) and exploding with great fanfare of hull-breaches and escape pod ejections. Without revealing too much, I can say that the zombies too look fantastic, bits of ships mangled together with goo-like zombie &quot;stuff&quot;, popping when you burst through them with weapons. The weapons too look great, especially beams! For a game like this, the eye-candy is almost never ending. Overall: 10/10<br><br>Gameplay: An RPG at heart, S.P.A.Z. features all of the feature you love, ship customization galore, research and leveling, even multiple currencies in the forms of Rez and goons (ship crew collected from escape pods). S.P.A.Z. also features an RTS-like tactical window, where you can give orders to your ships and tweak AI behavior. The UI is simple to navigate and easy to use, a rare feature in a game as deceptively deep as this. Controls are also responsive and easy, though it may take a bit to get used to the side thrusters as they are oriented to your ship and not the camera. There are currently five ship classes, ranging from tiny to huge with a wide variety of modules and upgrades. Each system in your randomly generated galaxy of up to 300 stars has two factions, Civilians and the UTA, that you can complete missions for (or stab them in the back for the loot). Gameplay starts fast and furious and gradually slows down, never quite descending to a grind-fest, but as you would expect with an RPG there is a certain amount of grinding. There is quite a lot to do in S.P.A.Z., and you would be hard-pressed to find a time with nothing to do. Overall: 9/10<br><br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>Overall, S.P.A.Z. is an absolute steal for $15 on steam. You can easily find your weekends and free time lost to this game, but you will love it. As an added bonus, MinMax is still actively developing new content, so it can only get better from here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=1732031">Expand</a></span>

On the front screen of the game are details of upcoming new features and you get the feeling that the devs care about their game (there&apos;s even a winter mod available in the game at the moment). Well worth the money - the way the good indie games are piling up on steam at the moment I may give up buying full-price games altogether...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=2077492">Expand</a></span>

Yes you might have to do some of the same old missions over a few times, but if you loved shooting ships and watching things blow up the 1st time, why would that change the 10th time?  It won&apos;t replace star control 2 as one of my all time favorites, but its a near enough miss to be worth 20 bucks, easy, much less 4 on sale at steam.

The game starts off promising, shoots itself in the foot. The game is Repetitive, with a capital R, with such abysmal lack of content I don&apos;t understand how it got released in like so. You get maybe a handful of ships to play with, and the majority of them you will never use. At no point in time through playing the game did I ever concern myself with resources, as there was never any need. If you play well you&apos;re given everything you ever need. The missions feel tedious and the grinding for blueprints is aggravating, not to mention the restrictive modular system it presents. Why make such an amazing modular setup, then take it away, forcing specific pieces on the ship designs? So instead of getting a massive fleet of awesome variety, you get... cookie cutter setups. It makes the whole system feel a waste.<br>Perhaps I am too hard on the game. It gave me 2 hours of entertainment! But afterwards, it felt so old, so repetitive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=2076626">Expand</a></span>

As fun as the first couple of hours will be if you&apos;re into space, zombies and all that good stuff, it becomes repetitive real fast. especially if you&apos;re having a blast and progressing faster than normally but I guess that&apos;s what Indie games are made for. Other than that, It manages to be a bit linear with unlocking new goodies along with a few balance issues here and there but nothing that heavily affects the actual game-play.

You control the direction of your ship with the mouse cursor and forward, backward and side thrusters with the keyboard. So you can spin your ship, make it move backwards, side to side, all while controlling turrets to still shoot at your enemies. Really cool, allows for a lot of variety in gameplay. A lot of ships have fixed guns too, not turrets so you can do quick hit and fades, strafing etc. There&apos;s a lot of ways to play out the battles.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s also a ton of customizable weapons and ships. You level up throughout the game and pick different weapons to upgrade, as well as collecting new schematics for new weapons and ships. Ultimately the quest to collect all the weapons and ships in the game kept me really involved. The hours just flew by playing this game. I have over 140 hours on it through about 4 play throughs.
<br>
<br>It also randomly generates the galaxy based on some input from you like size, density, difficulty, so it has a lot of replayability. The only reason this game doesn&apos;t get a full 10 is it gets a bit grindy, especially on the hardest difficulties. Though I do like that the devs put some insane difficulty settings in there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=3169805">Expand</a></span>

Usually you always wanna play as your biggest and toughest ship, but not always. There&apos;s several types of weapon that you can focus on using, and the game allows you to &quot;rebuild&quot; your level ups for a cost if you realize that  you made a mistake.
<br>
<br>The writing in this game is pretty deadful though, and the gameplay gets very samey after just a few hours of play. Some of the time you have to take a break from constant space fighting to go and restock on your resources, which gets a little dull.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a good game to play while listening to a podcast or audiobook or something like that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=3852612">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I loved this indie game, the genre is one of my favorites. It was a long journey to finish it, but worth every second  It tends to get slightly grindy and repetitive, but it&apos;s so damn catchy you will be playing until the very end and lick your finger afterwards. And lastly  Total Biscuit as a story narrator  Hell yes, shut and take my money </span>

The battles are involved and entertaining until you progress the storyline far into the &apos;space-zombie&apos; end of the game  Then it just becomes more difficult than it is fun.  So this one will sit in the &apos;almost complete&apos; basket labeled &apos;too hard&apos;.  Shame that, could&apos;ve been better.</span>

<br>This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a &#x201C;feel&#x201D; for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.
<br>
<br>The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no &#x201C;half&#x201D; or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.
<br>
<br>The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.
<br>
<br>Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, if a game has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a &#x201C;feature quota&#x201D;. Games that excel in both areas of a section don&#x2019;t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section
<br>
<br>The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; section. This section is for how the reviewer &#x201C;feels&#x201D; about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797157">Expand</a></span>

The game itself is good, although it can get repetitive. When playing through I tend to do it over an extended period of time, so I don&apos;t get bored. But for the cheap price that it costs, it is more than worth it.
<br>The actual game-play is simple, and working out how to customize your ships to get the most out of them in a certain situation makes it enjoyable. You can get put into a position where the game is a challenge. And when you&apos;ve beaten it, step it up a difficulty level and try again. It will be far harder, and renew the enjoyment.
<br>One of the few criticisms I have of it is the ship choice. Once you&apos;ve found a good ship, you&apos;re unlikely to replace it with another of the same class. This means that of the ships you collect, you won&apos;t use many.
<br>Overall though, a good game, worth the small cost and if you&apos;re a fan of space games, enjoyable. A hail-back to a slightly older era of games, and who doesn&apos;t love a classic?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-pirates-and-zombies/user-reviews?user_review_id=3873383">Expand</a></span>
