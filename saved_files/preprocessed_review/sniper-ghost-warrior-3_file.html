<br>
<br>First, after 8 hours of playing it, it randomly deleted my savegame despite me exiting the game normally.
<br>
<br>The fool that I was, I decided to play it again, and this time, after the third mission, the &quot;repair&quot; function just stopped working on the silencer on guns, making the game useless and pointless to play (imagine your sniper shot being heard loud and clear each time you shoot someone.)
<br>
<br>Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
<br>
<br>As for gameplay, the game has a ridiculously long load time and the much-touted &quot;open world&quot; is pointless. It&apos;s mostly empty and the only thing you get to do is drive around in your buggy. It&apos;s like the devs heard that &quot;open world&quot; is the big thing and threw it in there. Unlike Far Cry, you cannot climb up most hills unless the surfaces have special ledges for you to hang on, which appear only when you press Ctrl near them. Buildings too are a pain to climb. Most can&apos;t be climbed.

<br>Save your money. Buy another game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7285160">Expand</a></span>

<br>A great game held back by performance
<br>Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 is a first person shooter that takes place in Georgia, the country
<br>You play as American Marine Captain Jon North attempting to prevent another cold war&#x2026;
<br>The story sounds pretty generic, but things do start getting interested, and I did care for these character despite how generic they actually are.. one of them is basically elana fisher with longer hair and an accent..
<br>Despite the game being called sniper, this isn&#x2019;t a sniper simulator&#x2026;
<br>The words ghost and warrior hint at options&#x2026; and that&#x2019;s exactly what you get here
<br>This is an open world game with a base that you use to buy new weapons you unclock from completing missions or picking up off of enemies, as well as buy ammo and gear and choose your next mission&#x2026;
<br>But this open world isn&#x2019;t vast, it isn&#x2019;t connected&#x2026;
<br>it just exists&#x2026;
<br>it&#x2019;s a world to put missions into and nothing else..
<br>You have a buggy to drive around, but there are no other vehicles on the road and the ones off road are all locked&#x2026;
<br>There are points of interest around the map though if you are into the ubisoft style clean up&#x2026;
<br>Or you can stick to the 11 hour campaign
<br>The campaign is fun to get through, and challenging&#x2026;
<br>Its satisfying scoping out the place with your drone, sniping out enemies from a distance and then going in for the objective, or being a ghost, sneaking in, taking enemues out silently while you try not to alert anyone or be caught on camera.. and then theres the warrior option of just going in guns blazing&#x2026;
<br>There are mandatory do not get detection sections of the game, but for the most part.. youre free to tackle a mission any way youd like..
<br>You can even mix your play style up like I did&#x2026;
<br>This means youre going to be unlocking perks in all 3 skill trees for sniper ghost and warrior, but if you prefer one play style then that means of course youll be more decked out for that style with the skill tree..
<br>Missions are what youd expect&#x2026;
<br>Get a point on the map to go to and complete the objective.. nothing more..
<br>And despite the missions structure being the same throughout, the missions all felt unique thanks to the great level design this game has&#x2026;
<br>The game felt fresh throughout&#x2026;
<br>However the performance of this game brings all of the great parts down&#x2026;
<br>For starts the load times&#x2026;
<br>Theyre painful&#x2026;
<br>Some missions take place on different sections of the map.. and to get to these sectiosn you have to deal with the games initial load screen..
<br>Which is 4 minutes long, I wish I was kidding, but the load time for this game is longer than this review&#x2026;
<br>Its painful&#x2026;
<br>The game also froze trying to load in 2 times&#x2026;.
<br>And the game would freeze and crash mid shot probably 3 or 4 times&#x2026;.
<br>its just not reliable&#x2026;
<br>and its only made worse by again the 4 minute load time to get back into the game and the fact that checkpoints in missions are so awful&#x2026;
<br>Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 is enjoyable,
<br>The calculating, the scouting, the turning the dials of your scope to adjust to a targets distance..
<br>All of this makes the campaign so satisfying to get through&#x2026;
<br>But the freezes, the crashes, the load times&#x2026;
<br>Theyre going to annoy&#x2026; so be prepared&#x2026;
<br>I Give Sniper Ghost Warrior 3
<br>a 7.0/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7260766">Expand</a></span>

<br>1.. People have complained about framerate issues and slow loading times.  This has not been my experience.  Could be a hardware thing?  Also, I know that PS 4 version may be experiencing this, similar to Just Cause 3 where loading times would take up to 2- 3minutes...  Not for PC in my experience.  I have it up on Very High  3840X2160... whatever resolution and it&apos;s gorgeous, no issues.
<br>
<br>2.  This is a mix of Farcry 4, Assassins Creed and Crisis.  Better than all IMO.  I just really enjoy the Critek Engine for shooters and if you add that with some Open World, RPG-like elements for character leveling up, then it makes for almost a perfect FPS for me.
<br>
<br>3.  World so far seems to be diverse enough with characters and enemies to keep me &quot;wowed&quot; and entertained for some time (I&apos;ve only completed 2 missions).  I own Sniper Elite 4 and Ghost Recon Wildlands, but I think GW3 beats them both hands down in terms of fun factor.
<br>
<br>PC version is the way to go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7258065">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game seems to get quite alot of negative reviews but i think its a very underated game.
<br>The game looks great also especially in the rescuing of civilian missions, walking around in swamp like area looks brilliant.

Porbably CI have not much money to buy journalists. dont leave that negative opinions stop you to try this one, expecially if you like sniping, infiltration game ecc. there is a lot of stuff here that will make you happy. Not all gold yes, there are some issues but are not so dramatic as someone say. Best CI title ever for me.</span>

<br>I really have only one issue with the game and it&apos;s the auto save feature. The game auto-saves at some really weird places. For example, at one time, I was almost 97% finishing the episode, one mistake I got shot. When I reload the checkpoint, I had to start the game at the beginning.
<br>Other than that, no issue whatsoever with this fun game. Some reviewers say the characters are dull...come on! Who gives a sh*t! It&apos;s a sniper game! Not opera! And one of best I have played. I also bought Sniper elite 4, and I have to say SGW 3 is better. And the ghost play style is also great. I love to do headshot up close with side arm. Close quarter take downs are also very nicely done, like Splinter cell.
<br>If you like action game with diverse playing style, but mostly sniping and silent takedowns, give this game a try. You will have a great time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7284853">Expand</a></span>

I even stopped playing FarCry 4, which I&apos;ve acquired lately with all DLC, just to have more time to play your game. It has a very gritty dark feel to it in contrast to FarCry 4 which is too colorful - almost fairylike. I bought SGW3 during a sale on steam and was very careful at first because of the bad reviews but now I wouldn&#x2019;t even think about refunding it. &#x3000; The sniper mechanics and the first person view are unparalleled. I would strongly advise you to release a downloadable demo on steam and other platforms with one of your missions just to show how cool it is to spend 4-5 minutes preparing before taking a perfect shot. It would allow people to see for themselves that the game is worth buying. I&apos;ve owned the game since after the release of patch 1.2 so I haven&#x2019;t encountered any of the game breaking bugs which were listed since launch. The loading screen is about a minute and only in the beginning.

<br>This might be the right way for C.I Games to make this serie be more thrilling, interesting and better. The opening world could be strange to some of gamers but if you had played MGS or FarCry, you would have seen it rather easy to approach.
<br>
<br>Therefore, I love the Challenge Mode with dozens of threats you have to face. Just imagine that you are the real Marine, you could be trained well from this game, lol...
<br>
<br>The graphic is acceptable part. It&apos;s not the best but better than others. The only thing I see the uselessness is the Instinct illustration, haha...You can do the missions done without using it too much...
<br>
<br>My final rating: 7/10 for motivating</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7315268">Expand</a></span>

At first it seems that before you really the AAA-project, then just good game, and in the end there is a wish to throw the gamepad in the monitor from an ending. At SNIPER: GHOST WARRIOR 3 was the huge potential and a game initially was faceless, it is just a compound of practices from Far Cry and S.T.A.L.K.E.R and other games. But the physics and sniper firing were worked perfectly out, there was an interesting setting (Georgia after all the former Soviet Union). The setting also distinguished a game from others. Why to do the open world if it the dead and in it nothing to do? But a plot totally ludicrous, characters straight from a cheap sitcom, the principal plot - a baby&apos;s dummy in the form of beautiful promotion of the USA. And a plot decoupling - silent horror, so in B-projects that isn&apos;t done, action and directly titles. And for the sake of it I spent 12 hours of the time? A spittle in a face of players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7376838">Expand</a></span>

<br>City Interactive tried, but the game is not optimized out and boring. We used to interesting worlds Ubisoft, GHOST WARRIOR 3, the world is completely empty and not interesting. You don&apos;t want to learn it, and just ride from job to job. Georgia they came out beautiful, but it&apos;s too grey landscapes that you depressing. In the same Far Cry 4 was much petee ride and admire the scenery. Here everything is gray and dull.
<br>In this game we can quietly kill enemies with a sniper rifle or loudly barge in and kill all of the machine. Sniper gameplay I like, we need to calculate the distance to the target, but if hit in the head, pluchery slowmo when the bullet in slow motion pierces the skull of an enemy. Ballistics in the game are normal. Here, the weapons felt.
<br>The plot of the game is. Developers sometimes even try to present a drama or reveal the relationship of the protagonist and his girlfriend. But the game has no really interesting characters, and silently kill enemies from a sniper rifle or noisy machine can be in the same Far Cry. GHOST WARRIOR 3 loses creature Ubisof in all respects, and I just don&apos;t see the point to play GHOST WARRIOR 3, if you have Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4. Even if you played these games, that GHOST WARRIOR 3 will be a poor substitute - you will quickly get bored. If you want to buy up to the 75% discount, it is not longer necessary.
<br>In addition to ballistics and sniper rifles I liked the animation. When the hero karapetsas, realistic touches, klogd edit in the car includes the ignition key and so on. The game has such nice things, but it&apos;s boring and not optimized.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7375032">Expand</a></span>

The &quot;CryEngine&quot; has always been a resource hog but this game is using 10Gb+ of physical ram and will continue to use more if I add more sticks. On-top of the horrible frame rates which admittedly could be my GPU&apos;s even with two Geforce 650TiB im getting under 25fps with everything set to low and resolution at 1600x1080 thats right I cant even run at 1900+ yet my gpu&apos;s are only at 50-60% usage.  Moving on this game has its share of bugs with in the first 10-20minutes of game play I was hanging on fences not a full foot off the ground. Falling through church roof tops trying to get a vantage point while evading mines that dont stay marked after you &quot;Scout&quot; them. This game goes so far as to have a gear reset quest, nothing as bad as giving you all the awesome gear then taking it away after a lengthy and unnecessary prologue that frankly I don&apos;t care about, which if this foreshadowing is any indicator the &quot;Ghost&quot; is the main protagonist&apos;s baby brother. The game actually has a quest that makes you give up all the gear that you have acquired and purchased and has at no point a POI, Quest (side-quest or main) that allows you to go back and pick everything back up that you put in a random dumpster under a windmill that has no discernible marker! I would have given this game a much higher score had it not forced a silencer mechanic into the game that didn&apos;t even need to be there in the first place! Having said that I really had high hopes for this game unfortunately I personally feel it feel 9ft short of a 10ft hurdle; thus I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone that enjoys first person shooters especially with the memory leak</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7358887">Expand</a></span>

However when using assault rifles, I feel that the gun mechanics are a little rough, would have been nice if this game had a peek system instead of exposing your body as the enemy AI react fast and kills you fast too. The game has a similar system as Far Cry 4 where there are outposts in this game and you can clear the outposts.
<br>I didnt really enjoyed the story as it feels slow at the start and the ending was rushed but what kept me playing this game was the variety of modern snipers which you dont get in the Sniper Elite games. I would recommend this game if you play it for the modern weaponry but if you play it as a story rich game, you would be disappointed.
<br>
<br>Thumbs up for weapons and sniping physics. Hoping Sniper Ghost Warrior 4 will be a huge improvement!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-ghost-warrior-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7543461">Expand</a></span>
