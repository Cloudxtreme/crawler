I think the game lacks depth, in no time you find yourself doing the same thing over and over.
<br>
<br>The target/lock system... today, XXI century we have missile defense systems, projectiles that bend in the air, snipers that can hit a target 3 km away with a led bullet, but in the galaxy, in a distant future, you need to aim with your mouse in a moving tiny little spot repeatedly to do damage with a gatling gun (invented in 1860) at 2 km (avg range when weapons can actually shoot), no.
<br>
<br>To me is like FTL in 3D with great graphics and little of the gameplay. Ways to improve it? Change POIs and anything important relevant to another color. Make the lock-target area bigger, it is the future, computers are smarter!, allow more missiles or make them more destructive, instead of pausing the game when opening the craft option, allow this between jumps only, add a repair/refuel station option between jumps that takes credits, allow ships to carry more weapons usable at all times, something automatic at short range would be great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everspace/user-reviews?user_review_id=7376561">Expand</a></span>

<br>I liked the exploration  at any stage, flight coud be tho sometimes and combat mechanics didn&apos;t feel perfect or smooth but fun afterall , the devices and weapons are just great... but there are couple of things in it which I really don&apos;t like.
<br>
<br>1. The permanent upgrades you get after each death.
<br>
<br>I would MUCH prefer a system which would allow me to upgrade my ship as I go along, during a single run so that I have to improve to face the final boss over time, rather than one which makes the game progressively easier every time I play it, so that, in the end I more or less make it by default.
<br>
<br>Yes, I could up the difficulty, but that&apos;s not the same, because it&apos;s not about making the game harder, it&apos;s about the sense of accomplishment which the current system removes. I&apos;d like to start off being bad at the game at one difficulty level and then master it, feel I have improved and then, possibly, up the difficulty level and try to master that.
<br>
<br>Rather than being a reward, I feel that every upgrade I apply robs me of more and more of that sense of achievement I might have had when finally winning the game.
<br>
<br>2. The inventory [and now I discover weapon selection shortcuts] pause the game.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t count the number of times this has saved my life, I get to consider the situation, manufacture and use consumables, all in my own time, no pressure, no stress, easy! But I still don&apos;t like it. It breaks immersion, lessens the impact of the action and generally slows things down.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d much prefer a set of effective keyboard shortcuts which allowed me to use ships systems, devices, weapons etc more effectively in real time than anything that paused the game. I could always retreat to a safe space to manufacture components if required.
<br>
<br>afterall is a good game and worth the shot at least a try before to buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everspace/user-reviews?user_review_id=7339483">Expand</a></span>

A new breed of space game, I was sure since the first time when I met this game but after around 40 hours spent playing my jaw is broken. Revolutionary gameplay is so useful, enjoyable and what is mostly astonishing, how they arranged movement and fight in this 3D space environment. I know... there are no sounds in vacuum and spacecraft should be subjected to a force of inertia... but this what gives us an unforgettable experience is reasonable compromise between the laws of physics and usable model of flying and fighting. Graphics - I have no words to tell about graphics you just have to see this, feel this... For praise deserves balanced level of difficulty and also we have a vast influence on our performance. There are various opponents which require many particular tactics and weapons - sometimes you can have the heaviest weapon but for example it&apos;s weak for shields, therefore if you have no resources to produce &quot;anti-shield missile&quot; you are in trouble. You can always find the other way - one time I didn&apos;t have a proper gun to hit small and quick-moving drones which were loading a shield of &quot;Okkarian Corvette&quot;, I will not forget my joy when I found solution - I produced the &quot;dron takeover module&quot; then they started to load my own shield. From that moment it was far less hard, to change hostile ship into stardust :) I loved this game from first moment but I can&apos;t wait for continuation and development - there is a short story line and only three available spacecrafts. At greater length of time spent in enjoying the space adventure would do well more content, I mean: more type of ships both for player and for opponents and more different &quot;things in space&quot; because they may become repetitive. I hope for a massive DLC with new ships, guns, missiles, modules, appliances, sectors, opponents, amazing landscapes, cooperating in group of ships and of course development of storyline, or maybe something like EVERSPACE 2? :D At the end I want to congratulate to the authors from ROCKFISH GAMES, thank you for this divine game - it&apos;s the best which I ever played, good luck and see you in space!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everspace/user-reviews?user_review_id=7488153">Expand</a></span>
