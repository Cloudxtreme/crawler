It&apos;s quite obvious that only the race tracks were tended to with love and care, but the other 99.5% of the map seems randomly generated with some minor fine tunings. Collisions are terrible, I will crash into a tree even though I&apos;m 5 feet away from it. The redeeming factor is the graphics, they are rather beautiful, but in many areas if you&apos;ve seen it once, you&apos;ve seen it all (particularly the rolling plains). Now that the price has gone down, I recommend this as a &quot;free ride&quot; game, but don&apos;t expect it to hold your attention for more than an hour or 2 per sitting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fuel/user-reviews?user_review_id=1977011">Expand</a></span>

Sort of like Al Gore&apos;s version of Global Warming upon which the backdrop for this game is derived. Ok you have the latest in gorgeous backgrounds and all manner of technical effect afforded to you in video gaming today. However with all the advancement in graphics there have been those same advances in physics modeling and artificial intelligence; the deficiency of this game being in the latter two. Ok is the game fun? Yes, it can be. Nearly all games are fun in some way. But with video gaming there&apos;s a bit more involved with the need of a console or a PC, the costs involved there and then the cost of the game itself. For all that cost, and the hype with it, a game like this should deliver. I&apos;d rent this, try it out then forget about it. Oh wait I did, except for writing this short review. So with throwing at you graphics and variety Codemasters and Asobo Studio are giving you just the same kind of useless and costly package that Al Gore and Congress are giving you with Cap and Trade. Better to save your Federal Reserve notes to buy a few ounces of real money like silver bullion than spend them on the retail asking price of this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fuel/user-reviews?user_review_id=83258">Expand</a></span>

Like other people I was not too sure about it because of all the reviews, but I sure am glad I got it. I do see the shortcomings, especially the engine sounds are disappointing, 3 out of 4 vehicles sound like scooters. The racing is satisfactory anough, even spectacular at times (weather effects!). But what I really enjoy is the &quot;pointless&quot; driving around, hunting for everything that&apos;s out there, trying to reach this roof or the top of that cliff... admittedly, I&apos;m probably weird. But I suggest you give this game a try before you give it up.

It is an imaginative racing game that reminds me of my youth when I would ride motorbikes through the Australian bush. My children spend hours exploring in search of all the hidden surprises thoughout the landscape.</span>

Just an observation from a few posts. I love this open world, it only seems like theres not much in there because of the amount of area there is to drive! I for one cant stand the games that can be beat in a day or a week then they never get played again, this game is sure to give you months or years of gaming. Now for the not so good, the physics is garbage, shame on you for borrowing that physics engine from an outdated game and put it in this beautiful setup. I would have to say to keep this big of a map a constant thrill would have taken an army of programmers. Cut these guys some slack for a good effort and lets support them so they may release something a bit more tuned next time instead of bashing them and causing their sales to go to hell.

Yet I am quite a fan of race games - like more than a decade - and intuitively this game feels just right. Personally I like to drive the huge open ended world even though it is a bit &apos;empty&apos;. But the races make everything more than good. Unlike Burnout Paradise which goes way to soon way too fast, FUEL has just exactly the right speed. Maybe in the beginning the cars and bikes are a bit slowy, but I think the programmers want players to focus on steering/ drifting which is exactly what the challenge is in races. Also unlike ANY game I&apos;ve played before the races have a certain bigness. You&apos;re not cramped up in a city, but you&apos;re driving these big plains, rolling down mountains is just superbly done. I have not seen anything like this before. So even though there are some theoretical flaws (they&apos;re not really obvious or an annoyance while playing like in most games), I find myself just being extremely excited everytime I play, not knowing exactly why.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fuel/user-reviews?user_review_id=83147">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a big open area, with nothing really worth seeing. All of the few buildings are copied and pasted in other locations, and everything is really quite bland. As mentioned, it feels like a tech demo to see how such a world would work. Well, point proven, it runs. As for things to do, there&apos;s not much. The open-world aspects are really more limited than you&apos;d think, as driving off steep cliffs can get you reset so easily. Just very boring, and often it asks you to drive these long bland trails to get points access new bland trails to drive. Rinse and repeat. Snooze in between. Glad it was only in a big pack of other real racing games including Grid, which made it worthwhile.  If you want open-world racing, get Burnout Paradise and have some fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fuel/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606409">Expand</a></span>

The cars haveno interiors for those of us that likeground level 1st person racing. Handling is Arcade only. If they were to take the best elements of Dirt 2, If Codemasters took the cars and other best elements from Dirt 2 and combined them, they&apos;ed have a blockbuster.</span>

This is a game that can really test your nerves, but then when you take a look at the beautiful scenery rushing past as you hurtle across a landscape at full throttle, you can become instantly relaxed. There are many, many different vehicles to choose from, each with the varying statistics and strengths. The huge area makes exploring one of the major things to do in this game, with hours and hours of enjoyment simply by trying to collect all of the game&apos;s pieces. Mountains, rivers, hills, sand dunes, forests, tornadoes - these are the sorts of things that really separates this game from the rest of the pack. However, what draws me back from giving this game a better score is the way that it can be quite repetitive in the tasks you are required to do, and the fact that one needs to be quite the racing expert to be able to complete the game up to the final area. But if it had touched up the graphics just a smidge, and set up a broader range of things to do, I might&apos;ve been persuaded to give it a nine or a ten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fuel/user-reviews?user_review_id=747621">Expand</a></span>

<br>original review 12-20-2011:  I am so glad I downloaded this game from Steam and played it. I was interested in some things I read about the huge world, free rides in an open world, and it just sounded cool to me. This has become my favorite game on steam for a while now. I can&apos;t explain why, but it keeps pulling me back. I like the races and challenges  it&apos;s particularly good to help the learning curve for someone like myself who&apos;s not a hardcore gamer or hardcore racing fan, but the pacing is great and the free ride aspect in a big open world makes it fun for me just to go ride around and get better driving my different vehicles.
<br>
<br>I remember riding around in a thunderstorm last night and pulling up under an abandoned barn on a faraway hillside and just watching it rain and watching the thunder and lightning light up the landscape. It really is a beautiful game that gives a lot back if you like to explore.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve only played about 8-10 hours on steam so far, but something about the game makes me want to get better, and driving around the countryside, be it on-road, off-road, make-your-own-road approach is rewarding in-and-of itself. BTW- there a tons of races and challenges for those who are goal oriented, but if you&apos;re free-riding it&apos;s also fun to try to figure out how to jump that old building on the side of the road also.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fuel/user-reviews?user_review_id=2040898">Expand</a></span>

Many have said it all looks the same I disagree, you need to drive and the scenery changes. The demo should have been red rocks zone, they would have sold a lot more games. Yes the AI is hokey and there is no hood or  view. Sill many of the races are quite epic. The racing is very arcade, while the world is Sim. Some races are tough and almost have a puzzle quality to them. Some races require the right car and take the right short cuts to win. Some races are easy. There are over 70 different tracks, one review said there were few tracks, what game is he playing? The graphics on PC with a good card are very good, setup in card configuration overriding the games settings. Immediately download the mods from the internet, which corrects many car handling and AI issues, as well as gives you accesses to all cars (when you can afford them) and free fast movement to all tracks, helipads, etc. Its not completely cheating, you still have to win the races, but you see what this game has to offer quickly. I first played the xbox version and put in about 120 hrs. I opened all areas and did 90% of the races. Then I got the PC version with my new gaming pc and it is fantastic, especially with the MODs even more so.  I just love driving around and have spent most my time doing that. Although racing can be quite challenging and fun. Its cheap, give it a shot I love it, and I have nearly all the other racing games too, like dirt, grid, forza, etc, etc. Oh yeah, I use a playseat and a cheap wheel. It really is different then any game out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fuel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3330706">Expand</a></span>

The landscape may be huge, but it&apos;s insanely boring. Fortunately, you can fast-travel to different regions (and I&apos;ll leave it up to debate whether that defeats the purpose of being open world). The physics is lacking, but seeing as it&apos;s an arcade racer, that&apos;s not exactly all that damning. However, there is a complete lack of any sense of speed; you rarely have any idea how fast you&apos;re going unless it&apos;s obviously under 20 mph.
<br>Really, though, the biggest problem with this game is the number of races required to unlock new areas, and the computer AI. You need to perfect (three-star difficulty) about 55 races to unlock the whole world, which may not seem bad at first, but the races are repetitive and the AI seems to be more interested in wrecking you than it does winning the race. Oh, and I should also mention that the AI racers explode off the start line at speeds you literally cannot match, and then you play catch-up for the rest of the race.
<br>As a slight addition to my earlier review, I&apos;ve been playing this game a bit more in my free time, and I have to say that the AI has really driven me to loath this game.  Allow me to present a specific case: I&apos;ve been working on one of the races you need to beat on the highest difficulty for an achievement, and the gimmick to this one is there is a tornado in front of you that obscures your view and occasionally drops some obstacles onto the road ahead.  Now this may sound cool, but let me assure you, it is not.  Imagine if you will, leading for the entire seven minute race--but suddenly, 20 feet from the finish line, the tornado drops a car literally right on top of you (you have no chance to dodge it), causing you to crash and lose the race (since this game considers anything other than first place a loss).  Sound bad? Well imagine that happening four consecutive times at varying points within the race.  There&apos;s something to be said for having a challenge, and then there&apos;s the game giving you the finger and wasting your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fuel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3352472">Expand</a></span>
