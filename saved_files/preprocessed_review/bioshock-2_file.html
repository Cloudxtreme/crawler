For me the game worked, not in the same ballpark as the first but it did indeed work. Just not as well as the original, not by a long chalk.</span>

I&apos;m not gonna talk about the gameplay its obvious and its not the winning side of this game. Its the FEEELINGS that this game made me taste that is worthwhile.

<br>The game&apos;s single player campaign is slightly lacking.  It has enough substance, such as new weapons, powers, and enemies to keep the player somewhat interested during the majority of it, but it was not varied enough from the original game&apos;s formula.
<br>One of the redeeming factors of the game as a whole is the multi-player.  It takes place before the events of the original game, and retains the weapons and powers from the first.  It gives the player something to come back to after the single player game.
<br>Overall, the game had some problems, but the game was still descent enough to keep the same charm of the original game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3561130">Expand</a></span>

I mean how can you rate the game if you havnt played it... Awesome game though the combat is very fun and enjoyable with a excellent single player and multiplayer experience. Do not vote if you havnt played the game.</span>

I guess what I am saying is that it takes more than two games set in the same world for genre fatigue to set in. This game also makes some mild improvements to the gameplay and mechanics, it&apos;s story is solid - although not as masterful as the originals - and the game still maintains a sense of emotional weight. It&apos;s major downfall for me is it&apos;s length, and a more enclosed world that feels a little more like a rails-first-person-shooter than bioshock has any right to feel. I enjoyed the heck out of this game - although it&apos;s absolutely a step in the wrong direction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2157059">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s because MATCHMAKING is bad, no dedicated is bad, which is the same problem with MW2. So far most of the matches I&apos;ve played have been lag city for everyone but the host who could &quot;see all of US lag.&quot; I&apos;m tired of sacrificing &quot;ease-of-use&quot; for a crappy multi-player experience. Matchmaking itself isn&apos;t my major complaint here, its the lack of dedicated servers. L4D and L4D2 have matchmaking and dedicated servers, so why is it so difficult for other developers to implement this system? The most disappointing part is the fact that based on the GAMEPLAY of multiplayer alone I could see myself playing it as much or more than TF2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745578">Expand</a></span>

It carries over the extremely high production values. The sound, the voice acting, the ambience and forboding are all there in spades. The gameplay is just as compelling as before, with added layers and possibilities that broaden your options without saddling them. This was to be expected, as the original recipe was ripe for exploitation. What I didn&apos;t expect was a truly immersive, heartwarming story that took my breath away at the end. Maybe being a parent helped with that, but I don&apos;t see how anyone with an ounce of compassion could not be moved by what unfolds.<br><br>BioShock 2 is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.<br><br>Maybe its because I played a patched version, but I encountered none of the technical issues many other reviewers alluded to. I ran the game at 1050x1680 widescreen with no trouble. Loading times were under 10 seconds, often just a couple of seconds. How people can say Bio 2 looks worse that Bio 1 is beyond me, it may not be better, but it most certainly is not worse. And looking the same as the first game was probably intentional, it is after all the same place is it not? It does take place ten years later, which is why Rapture now appears to be falling apart, so in that way it is different. It is also a measure of just how well thought out the game, as a sequel, is and I believe it was executed extemely well. The only real complaint I have is that it can be a hassle to manage all those weapons and plasmids in the midst of combat, and that ammo to be found is a bit too plentiful. Other than that the game absorbed me from the beginning and kept me engrossed for several days. Those of you finishing the game in 8 hours simply are not &quot;experiencing the game&quot;, you are merely playing it at a superficial level, probably so you can brag about how fast you completed it and get to writing a cursory review that imparts nothing of substance.<br><br>I really wish people would put more thought into thier reviews, if you say &quot;it&apos;s buggy&quot; then tell us how its buggy....if it&apos;s &quot;a great game&quot; tell us why its a great game. And this notion of &quot;the game has no innovation&quot; claim is crap. When you think about it honestly...what was the last FPS game that was truly innovative? Remember, you are doing a service by posting a review, make it worthwhile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1710295">Expand</a></span>

Story wise I was a bit leery of a sequel to the impressive work of the original Bioshock. For my thoughts on it, in many ways I enjoyed the story of the second one better. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the first one had impressive characters and some unique twists and turns. However the first one always seemed to keep the heart of the story at arm&apos;s length, never full investing the player in the plight of the protagonist. At the end it came together nicely. Bioshock 2 kept me going, eagerly devouring levels to complete the next step on the journey. As someone else posted, perhaps it&apos;s the difference of theme of what it is to be a parent. Playing as a dad, perhaps I could identify more with Delta and the drive that keeps him going. If you truly enjoyed Rapture from the original Bioshock, you would be remiss to skip playing the second. Take the critical reviews with a grain of sea salt and jump back into the depths with both feet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1722534">Expand</a></span>

With touches of role on the management of items / powers / enhancements, this first-person game one of the most engaging, although it is recommended to play the first one to understand and enjoy 2. The game very well optimized, has excellent graphics and an incredible atmosphere, addictive gameplay and duration of the campaign is quite long (about 20 hours and a bit more). The changes between the previous (That was one of the best games of 2007) are not very noticeable, and this does not mean it is bad, and that remains the highlight of the first delivery. The only criticism is the multiplayer, not because it is bad (although I miss a bit to at least be &quot;addictive&quot;), but that all servers are empty. But the singleplayer and is a gem, so it should not be a problem this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2104912">Expand</a></span>

This expectation of a better game than the first brings down many games or at least for me it does. But Bio shock 2 managed to pull it off. The story telling was much more in depth and holes where few and far between almost unnoticeable in some areas. It excels in this area that Bio shock struggled to get around. But the gameplay is not as good, the first game put story aside to bring you into this mysterious and powerful place where pretty much everything can kill you with ease if you don&apos;t use tactics. This changed in the second one where practically the only thing more powerful than you and you might struggle with is the big sister but any any gamer with OK hand eye co-ordination will not struggle at all. The plasmids are brought to mind whilst playing Bio shock being just one of the many defining features, in the first they had this method of one at a time where you would have to change from plasmid to weapon, this brought a new level of tactics to the game as you must think before you act, Bio shock 2 turned this feature into a button mash as you through as much at your enemy as possible with the knowledge that they will die.The weapons themselves however have been smartly updated and changed to fit a big lumbering monster. This brings me to the final point I wish to make the little sisters, they turned the most annoying part of Bio shock 1 into a common place event. But now for the rating 9/10 because even through all its flaws I still play it over and over because of it amazing scenery, epic story line and gameplay that just makes you feel like your the boss and everyone else has to work up to your level. Would i recommend it definitely. Should you think of going for infinite yes and if you have not played Bio shock 1 yet I think you should give it a go, but don&apos;t go in expecting to rampage through everything like your a tank it doesn&apos;t work on the original.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2217973">Expand</a></span>

I felt very satisfied with the amount of gameplay (about 8-10 hours), where I was content with the story ending when it did but also at a point where I was not sick of the game and just wanted it to end. I actually feel like playing through the game (taking different actions this time too). Now while the graphics where more like the first Bioshock that didnt bug me. I liked the look of rapture and this gave me more of the same. I didnt feel like I was playing a different game, I in fact liked the idea of being able to play Bioshock then start playing Bioshock 2 right away and feel like Im still in the same decaying city of Rapture. I dont see why a game series always has to up the graphics in each game to the point where there is a significant difference. Now I see it as a good thing if theres a significant difference between games but we see games from other companies (IE valve) where continiuing with the same graphics really give you sense of the environment. Now I also see it as a good idea to update when you change that environment such as with Bioshock Infinite. There was a few story elements that I didnt like but not to the point that it bothered me. But I really liked how you learn more about Rapture and they even tied in the main character from Bioshock. I went in expecting a game similar yet different from Bioshock, and I got that and more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1379519">Expand</a></span>

The Mult-iplayer seems to be riding upon CoD&apos;s best parts but overall it&apos;s original elements keep it solid. This is probably the first game that I&apos;ve had a great single player and multi-player experience with.</span>

Multiplayer. Since multiplayer was pretty much a &quot;add-on&quot; feature i wasn&apos;t expecting revolutionary gameplay, which it definately isnt. The multiplayer is...generic for lack of a better word, you shoots the enemies and they falls down. Gamemodes are all simply rehashes of other already existing modes. Plasmids are as fun as always and add their &quot;spark&quot; to the playing field, making it a unique experience. Voice acting is surprisingly just as good as the single player and overall I enjoy playing the multiplayer, which is pretty much all you want. I would rate this game a 10 if not for the matchmaking problems in multiplayer (e.g. if the host leaves while midgame, everyone is disconnected, ranks are not matched to similar ranks and matchmaking sometimes moves you AWAY from a near full game).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745486">Expand</a></span>

Yes the game looks and feels very similar to the first one, but there is so much new, lengthy content in this game that makes your visit back to Rapture captivating and memorable. The story is not QUITE as epic as Bioshock 1, but is still intense and keeps you interested until the very end. The combat has changed just enough to feel very new with just slightly modified elements (eg. the &quot;dual wielding&quot; plasmids + guns). The weapons are fresh, and I love what they did with the hack system. Bioshock 2 stands as an amazing single player experience, but they also added a very fun multiplayer made by a different company. The multiplayer isn&apos;t earth shattering, but has enough content and excitement to stand enough on its own. In other words, don&apos;t buy this game just for the multiplayer. My only complaints about Bioshock 2: multiplayer is laggy, and a little sketchy. It needs one HUGE update/patch to make it smoother and more internet friendly. Oh, no dedicated server list. Secondly, the with so many things going on like switching out plasmids and guns, and having a hack tool in the middle of your weapons is just a little difficult to manage in the middle of a battle with splicers trying to eat your little sisters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745555">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer could seriously use some dedicated servers though, I&apos;ve played games where 1 person would literally be almost impossible to hit because their connection was so bad that they warped when they tried to strafe around me. But overall it&apos;s fun and rewarding to play multiplayer. Single player, there really isn&apos;t much to say, it&apos;s just fantastic, a lot of people who were fans of Bioshock 1 may not like this one, simply because there&apos;s not really a whole lot that is new, you&apos;ve been to Rapture before, you&apos;ve seen the citizens before, you know about all the denizens of rapture already, why this new single player is so good is because of the story. A lot of people criticize bioshock 2&apos;s story as being worse than the first, I respectfully disagree, I think this one is so much better. Back when I was following the bioshock 2 forums I remember someone trying to argue about the characters and moral decisions to be more intense in bioshock 1, I really did not think this was true, BIOSHOCK 1 SPOILER AHEAD when Sander Cohen appeared in person in the first game, I always killed him, why? It wasn&apos;t because I thought he was crazy, it wasn&apos;t because I had extra ammo and just didn&apos;t care, it was because I thought I had to. He looked like a splicer, he sounded insane and I simply assumed I couldn&apos;t progress unless I killed him, to me it was just another kill in the walk through rapture, SPOILER END. Bioshock 2 keeps me emotionally invested in the characters, so the moral choices are actually there, and I don&apos;t instantly kill someone because I thought I had to, there&apos;s no confusion. Bioshock 2 may have had a shaky launch (lots of crashing/graphics issues) but it&apos;s a solid game, it doesn&apos;t FEEL like a terrible console port, best of all, and it is for someone who wants more of Rapture, not just some new gimmick. It&apos;s another story in the Rapture world, not necessarily a sequel. Just a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1666279">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a bit disappointing for me to see that the score is not at least a 90, but an 88. I find the BioShock series to be the best series ever. Did a BioShock 2 have to be made? No, but I&apos;m damn glad that it is. It does lack some atmosphere and originality that the first game had, which is a hard game to top anyway. BioShock 2 makes up for these lacking factors with the improved combat, quicker hacking, more flexible plasmids and increasingly interesting story as you reach the end, unlike the first game which sort of got stale and repetitive toward the end in some parts. The concept of the multilayer is very well done, the actual playing of it is not, as it seems to be the laggiest thing I&apos;ve ever played. It&apos;s also painfully unbalanced. Overall, BioShock 2 may not be groundbreaking, but it&apos;s still an enjoyable game that no gamer should pass up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2007623">Expand</a></span>

And also from  the fact, that game settings are not saving, possibly because of the fact that I did not enter the MS Live, but it just puts the game in a worse light.</span>

All the wonder of the first game has been lost however since this is your second time through. All the fear is missing aswell since your character is basically an armoured tank, making you feel impervious to most of the dangers.</span>

I didn&apos;t find the hacking change to be an improvement at all and the story didn&apos;t hold my attention in the slightest. As far as I was concerned the story was just trying to get through a level whilst making yourself more powerful. Voiceovers and fighting got very tedious towards the end. Having said all that it was enjoyable to jaunt through Rapture again even though it was with a sense of post mortem deja vu. New weapons and enemies are decent enough, but the trips along the sea-bed seemed very pointless. And where the hell were the soundsets for the vending machines? Anyway, a reasonable buy at current prices and a good buy if you are a Bioshock maniac.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1827958">Expand</a></span>

Not entirely the case sadly. Pros: Combat flow has improved greatly, the simple addition of using both hands freely was a great start, and the evolution of staged plasmids was a good choice. Additionally the Insect Swarm and Cyclone Trap plasmids are actually viable tools this go around, in particular the swarm. Cons: Most everything else. The story is toned down, with much least of a impact or moral debate to be had over who was right and wrong this time. Additionally not many surprises to really be had, barring one near the end that does show you another side of Rapture that is nice to see. Overall however the biggest part of Bioshock is lost in the second one, the atmosphere. It looks like Rapture, it sounds like Rapture, but it never FEELS like Rapture. It doesn&apos;t help that they tried to make the Big Sister look &apos;sexy&apos; or the Little Sisters look &apos;cutier.&apos; Oh, and the multiplayer is an utter mess. Unbalanced as possible, horrible netcode, terrible peer hosting system without host migration; about as bad as it could of been. Swarm + Grenade Launcher = easy free kills. Unless you&apos;re the host, then it&apos;s Electro Bolt + Elephant Gun = easier free kills.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745881">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Incredibly short game at 8 hours. Multiplayer is bugged on the PC version, i dont know how the devs didnt notice it, it was obvious right away. It seems they rushed this one out the door bugged and unfinished. The game is worth maybe $20 for its good single player. But its length is too short and with the broken multi, dont expect your monies worth.</span>

Bioshock 2 unfortunately does not have the substance of its predecessor but comes across as a some what cash in. The original makers had nothing to do with bio 2 creation. The gameplay had its improvements but Bio 2s story was pretty lame, the main villain pretty empty and a missed opportunity, and the ending meh.  I had some hopes for Bios 2 and wanted to give it a chance but in the end feels lame and falls into the towering heap of video games with mediocre stories.The 5 points I give to the technical improvements of the game play but not for the forgettable story and design. I do not recommend bioshock 2, with all the other great games out there I almost wished I had not played it at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1697073">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s less sense of wonder, but they ramped up the pace, so it&apos;s not as noticeable as I had feared. The gun play, plasmids, and voice acting are all solid, and make for a very immersive game. There is no noticeable graphical improvement over the first game, which is somewhat disappointing. Bioshock 1 was such a beautiful game 2 years ago that this isn&apos;t really a problem. Now onto the problems. The default controls were horrid, and don&apos;t make much sense. It feels like they just shout out random keys at times. Normally this wouldn&apos;t be something you can complain about on the PC, but there are some big problems with remapping them in Bioshock 2. Certain actions will only work when mapped to their original keys, and the onscreen notifications show the originals. The horribly limited mouse settings are unusable with high DPI mice. This required about 30 minutes of .ini file hacking to get to a level where I could actually play the game. Once again the DRM in this game is just mind boggling. They apparently didn&apos;t learn their lesson the first time, and are back in full force. All users (who want to save their game anyway...) have to install Games for Windows Live, which is quite simply a joke. All in all Bioshock 2 is an amazing game, that suffers from the same problems as many other PC games right now. Poor keyboard and mouse support, - which honestly makes me sad - and horrible DRM. It&apos;s still worth buying, but only if you can put up with the DRM.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745493">Expand</a></span>

Bioshock was great because when you walk into a room you get the feeling that someone is going to jump out at you from another room, but in bioshock 2 all the splicers are in view most of the time and there are no surprises. If we could have more twists the game would be perfect.

I think that compared to many other games that were good Bioshock 2 definatly comes out on top. It was an imersive and enjoyable game, and I haven&apos;t quite finished it yet or even played multiplayer! The one thing I really didn&apos;t like was the integration of Games For Windows on the PC. I bought the game on steam and I thought it was a little unnecessary that I HAD to sign up for GFW. I wish they had taken that out. Other then that, I loved the game, and saw none of the storytelling issues that everyone is complaining about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745636">Expand</a></span>

And you do get very powerful.<br><br>One of the greatest moments in the game is when you actually get to experience what a scary and horrible place Rapture really is.

Gameplay-wise, BioShock 2 is great, surpassing BioShock 1. The gameplay is much more refined, and being able to wield a weapon and plasmid at the same time makes the game feel less clunky compared to its predecessor. However, some parts get repetitive, such as protecting the little sisters as they harvest the ADAM from &quot;angels&quot; (you can skip this almost entirely, but will not be able to get as many plasmids or gene tonics). Besides that, expect similar gameplay to BioShock 1. Story-wise, both games are about equal. BioShock 2&apos;s story is more emotional and personal, and has better pacing and stronger endings (almost every single person I&apos;ve talked to, including ones who prefer BS1&apos;s story, agree), while BioShock 1&apos;s story is more intriguing and mysterious, and has the character of Andrew Ryan, which by itself is a huge plus. Both games have side-stories (and one in particular in BioShock 2 which I found very depressing) that you can uncover through listening to audio diaries. BioShock 1&apos;s story collapsed on itself in the last act, whereas BioShock 2&apos;s story has a build up of tension to the very end, and the resulting end levels and sequences are some of the most memorable moments I&apos;ve experienced in a video game. I&apos;ve spent much more time thinking about BioShock 2 after finishing it than I did with BioShock 1, and very few games remain in the back of my head after finishing them (BS2 is one of them), so I must say it impacted me much more than the first. I made a thread on the official forums discussing the story of the two games that has gotten many well-thought and detailed responses (includes spoilers, however): http://forums.2kgames.com/showthread.php?106933-Story-wise-which-game-do-you-prefer. The atmosphere of the second game will not be as memorable as that of the first game if you&apos;ve played both, since you&apos;ll likely have seen everything before. There are bugs. The mouse control, like all Unreal Engine games, is not perfect, and needs to be tweaked in the configuration files to feel right. I also had a persistent bug where graphics options (or just the vsync option - I&apos;m not certain) would not save. Also, widescreen FoV is improper in the multiplayer... but hopefully you aren&apos;t buying a BioShock game for the multiplayer. I personally enjoyed BioShock 2 much more than the first, and would give it a perfect score if the bugs were ironed out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1594752">Expand</a></span>

Sadly, one bummer was that I blew up the &quot;F&quot; on my keyboard from collecting SO many items but w/e I needed a new one anywise.  Blew out every 2011 game that I have played this year.  Thanks 2K for giving us a very enjoyable sequel.</span>

<br>
<br>Bioshock 2 on the other hand had a weaker story compared to the other two, but it really wasn&apos;t so bad. The atmosphere was just as good if not better than the first and was way better than infinite. Now what sets apart Bioshock 2 from the rest of the pack is that the game play mechanics were superb, the atmosphere amazing and not too linear while there were the best guns, plasmids and upgrades. Bioshock 2, in my opinion, was by far the best game out of the trilogy. I loved it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3146277">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I enjoy this game more, overall the game is much more fun. I don&apos;t feel bored playing it like I did with the first Bioshock. I like the story of being a Big Daddy, the story is very interesting and gameplay has improved you can now use both a plasmid and weapon at once, it makes things quicker instead of feeling so sluggish like the first Bioshock was so slow having to switch between a plasmid and a weapon.
<br>
<br>And I like that hacking seems better and you can now hack cameras as well instead of just destroy them.
<br>
<br>I reccomend having several saves as saving can be glitchy. I saved my game and it crashed in the process deleting the save that I was saving over, I previously had 4 saves and now had 3, so it must of deleted the save which caused it to crash or the crashing caused it to delete?? Iam not sure.
<br>It&apos;s a joy to be able to alt tab out of game without getting a black screen of death.
<br>
<br>When you open a map, you can&apos;t close it again by pressing the map key, but by clicking on a button at the bottom of the screen that says close or by pressing B on a XBox controller with no way to remap the key for PC controls. Controller exclusive controls on a PC game is annoying.
<br>
<br>I like this game much more than the first Bioshock.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5469229">Expand</a></span>

The haunting, beautiful visuals of the first were lacking. The story was simply less compelling, absent the wonderfully crafted Ryan. I cared about the characters less. I felt like I was playing a competent,  first person shooter. The first time around, I felt like I was taking part in a masterpiece. This...was just a video game.

Apparently not because you had the same amount of health as you did in the first game when you were in regular human form.  Hopefully Bioshock Infinite can bring back the great, original feeling that the first gave us as we played it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1476943">Expand</a></span>

Firstly, the graphics are actually a downgrade from the first Bioshock, textures are markedly lower in resolution, absolutely no support for Anti-Aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering, those cannot even be effected upon the game from outside the game with ATI Catalyst. This is 2010, Win7 is on DX11 and this game runs natively on DX 9 - What the hell is this nonsense? why the hell graphics menu offers &quot;run DX10 textures&quot; option is beyond me, because as far as the progress of technology is involved, shouldn&apos;t option be a &quot; Enable DX 11 Tessellation&quot; instead? I was, and am deeply let down by this release, part of the reason why I upped by rig was because of the anticipation of experiencing the great Bioshock on awesome DX11 rendering, and I cannot possibly feel more cheated at this point in my life. Tech aside, nothing in this game breaks new ground, everything else is pretty similar as before with the exception of one new splicer, the big sister, and new big daddies. The playthrough is noticeably shorter, and the storyline wasn&apos;t as creative this time round, but it was still all good and decent fun. I didn&apos;t bother with the multiplayer because my main appeal was to the bioshock universe. This should&apos;ve been an expansion release instead. I am disappointed, I really am.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745828">Expand</a></span>

However, the story was a bit different and it was a bit more emotional in a daddy-to-daughter relation (since I have a daughter of my own). The weapons/plasmids weren&apos;t all that better. Most of the levels(environments) didn&apos;t get any more interesting, though some actually did. The &apos;flat&apos; graphics didn&apos;t improve, which they should have, since it is the 2nd game in it&apos;s series. The biggest issue I had (and many other users, from what I heard) was the screwed up mouse control/sensitivity! (I mean come on 2K, there are serious PC gamers out there still!! Why create/sell a game if you&apos;re not going to make it work right for every user ?!) ...and the &apos;jittery&apos; light reflection usually seen on floors (with slight mouse movement) has not been fixed (also seen in the first game.. anyone know what I&apos;m talking about?.. it&apos;s not a big issue but it&apos;s still just &apos;ugly&apos;). ...And to top it all off: The Windows Live integration is Total bull-$hit!.. Seriously, it should only be an Option NOT a requirement, since most people probably don&apos;t have any use for it... not all users have an Xbox or internet access to do those sorts of things, especially in order to SAVE their own game progress! WTF!?.. The Windows Live crap is just another pain in the a$$!... (Newer games are suppose to simply get better with NO hassles!).. BS2 was a let-down :( .....IMO the original BioShock is still better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1596480">Expand</a></span>

Now with bioshock 2 it is somehow like hearing the same joke twice in a row. It fails to deliver enough new elements to be interesting. While i would really love to tell positive things about this game since i generally really like the combination of 3d shooter with slight rpg elements i just honestly can not do so. I did not even manage to finish the game, just got bored after a while and stopped playing it. Sure will give it a second chance some time and maybe even enjoy finishing it than, but at its release it just disappointed me. 6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2084099">Expand</a></span>

I daresay the story is a little more simple and less inspired, hence the reviewers who trash this title.  Still, it&apos;s a little inaccurate to give this an atrocious score.  It still has its assortment of interesting little baddies and nostalgic tapes.  You can still catch yourself laughing while cringing at the snatches of conversation you hear between the other inmates of your little slice of hell.  You still scan the walls for bits of nostalgic flavor - you just find yourself less surprised and less effected because it all feels like you&apos;ve been here before.  And you have...both your character and you... in Bioshock 1.  And there the story was just a little more gripping.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2510051">Expand</a></span>

Or bioshock megablast.  (bigger guns).  Personally I was extremely disappointed with this version.   If your thinking of buying this I would recommend you get Bioshock 1 instead.</span>

It took me 8 hours to complete it in a day, but still you should get this game.</span>

Namely, the story, of which there is almost none. Perspective takes a turn as you now play, 10 years after the initial Bioshock, as a Big Daddy. Early on, the Little Sister that you are bonded to is taken away, and the entire game involves your efforts of trying to rescue her. Whereas in the original, 2K provoked thought and the formation of opinions on matters of ethical issues, they failed to deliver anything akin to that in the sequel. I know that a game as good as Bioshock is incredibly hard to live up to, but I can&apos;t help but feel that the effort put into the second one was minimal at best. Graphics have improved, thankfully, as has the combat system, but that doesn&apos;t make up for the fact that I had to sit through an uninteresting story with characters (specifically Eleanor) whose voices weren&apos;t emotional enough to get me to care about them. This game was a letdown from the first, but it wasn&apos;t a complete waste. It&apos;s still worth getting, so long as you don&apos;t pay too much for it. On the plus side, the multiplayer is strangely addicting, and very underrated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2020964">Expand</a></span>

More of an underware Tomb Raider with Art Deco, instead of the vibrant and stylised Bioshock original. The sound is superb but what else is to be expected in this era of gaming and digital audio files. 7/10 Fluff but tasty fluff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745794">Expand</a></span>

Off the bat there seems to be no real changes to the major game mechanics or graphics which came as a small disappointment as the game could had used at least a few improvements on the overall physics system I however can assume this was an attempt to keep game play level for the PC and Console versions of the title.  The game environment offers a lot of fresh areas while still keeping the same overall feeling as the original and even makes a few open improvements by offering some more open, less claustrophobic areas.  the story is where I felt I was a little let down on here.  The ending of the original presented a very real challenge for a sequel so I understood this but the real shortfall was the lack of painting detailed portraits of the new characters.  Moments in the original gave you a true feeling of how unhinged the characters were and gave you unsettling thought process to digest while trying to unravel your own and that was slightly lacking in this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1366012">Expand</a></span>

In my opinion the graphics or even the environment isn&apos;t what makes a good game good, it&apos;s the storyline.<br>And the storyline in this game is very good, and pulled off in an excellent manner. It might even be better than the first BioShock. The interface has gotten a lot of improvement from the first game, making it very smooth to play, there&apos;s never a moment where you panic because you can&apos;t find the right power or weapon. However, just like the first game, there are weapons that are much better than others, removing the incentive of upgrading other weapons.<br><br>And last but not least, the ending, it&apos;s perfect, very emotional and absolutely worthy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1458974">Expand</a></span>

Honestly, I think people just had unrealistically high expectations for this game due to their experiences with the essentially perfect original Bioshock. I would suggest that if you liked the original Bioshock, you should definitely give Bioshock 2 a try - just don&apos;t expect it to be as unique and interesting (obviously) as the original was. Just think of it as a very well made FPS/RPG, and don&apos;t expect it to be so amazing like the original was, and I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1942049">Expand</a></span>

No. The problem is that this was exactly, and I mean EXACTLY the same thing all over again. It felt like playing the same game again, the differences were so slight that it reminded me the cosmetic differences between Doom 1 &amp; 2. Once again extremely overrated title that many people consider to be something more than what it really is and the game that almost destroyed all my faith in the series, but the Infinite fortunately saved the reputation 3 years later. 4/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4392435">Expand</a></span>

It seems that the Rapture could have done something better this time, but nothing sounds like a masterpiece. Too dated to be a universal acclaim...this game still remains in 2007 for both concept and technical aspects.

I loved the first game; it was the game that made me finally like the fps genre. I was very excited to play the second one and I knew that I wouldn&apos;t feel the same about it because Rapture is no longer a mystery. However, this is not why I rated the game so low. The rating comes from 2K&apos;s complete lack of product testing. After I beat the game, I tried out the multiplayer, and I thought it was enjoyable. Then, the next day 2K came out with a patch to &quot;fix&quot; problems they forgot about in the 3 MONTHS they delayed the game. And, what does it do? Bugs the multiplayer to hell and now after nine days they still have done nothing to fix these problems. How do you do that? Did no one at 2K have a copy of the game to test this patch on? Did they just ignore some aspects of the game when testing just to save time? I don&apos;t know but I am very disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745880">Expand</a></span>

For clarification this game was not developed by the team that made the original. When the team declined to make a sequel because &quot;Why?&quot; The publisher 2k went forward with subsidiary studio used for making maps. They handed them the original and said &quot;Make more&quot; and that&apos;s really all they did. The engine and environment is mostly the same although PC players will notice a downgrade and texture quality. the campaign is something like 8 hours long and very very redundant. You spend the entire struggling with boredom and a feeling of &quot;been there done that.&quot; The original game story focused on the flaws inherent in Libertarianism. The idea that you need no social structure other than the basic values found in the ten commandments. Logically the next game would play the devils advocate and focus on the flaws of Libertarianisms polar opposite Socialism. This would require some serious thought so instead the studio just shucked in a generic villain with no motive other than control. Nothing the characters in the say have any meaning or baring on the story even the main villain has very little to say. The game is pretty free with weapons and ammo making the game exceedingly easy.I rarely needed to reload other than from crashes which btw are constant and really the one true antagonist. The game has no SLi support and is rampant with bugs. For this reason alone you should stay away. With everything else available avoid this game. Do not bother. Not even for free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1950103">Expand</a></span>
