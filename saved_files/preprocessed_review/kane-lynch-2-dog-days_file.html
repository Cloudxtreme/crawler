The latest game in the Kane and Lynch series definitely improves upon the first with better shooting mechanics and a better cover system...but that&apos;s not saying much. I died countless times because Lynch either didn&apos;t want to get into cover or decided to hide behind the wrong object. Gameplay consists of 95% gunplay and 5% pressing &quot;E&quot; to open doors. It&apos;s not varied but it&apos;s somewhat enjoyable IF playing the game in co-op. A solo run is incredibly tedious and the A.I. partner is nearly useless. The 4 hour game length is also pitiful and is extended by a couple of multiplayer modes that have NOBODY playing them. It&apos;s not a game that&apos;s worth full price (not by a long shot) but TRUE fans of the series will enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=2113367">Expand</a></span>

Well, that&apos;s what this game was for me, it&apos;s a really unrefined shooter and would never pay $10 for it, I got it in a bundle but wouldn&apos;t pay more than $3 for it, and even then I would rather expend the $3 on an indie game who will be over 5h of fun.</span>

The atmosphere is spot on and the amateur camera filter is a nice effect. The story is super short, finished the game in 3.8hrs. I just like how much effort the devs put into the atmosphere :)</span>

Although graphics are nice and I salute the effort it must have taken to emulate the handy cam, this game is just half baked. The cover system is broken but above all, the aiming system is awful. You can unload clips on an enemy that is 5 feet away and spray your bullets all over without a single hit. However, the enemies have dead aim at 500 feet, killing you almost instantly and they can take 4-5 bullets in the head without dying. They can also shoot you accurately hitting 90% of their shots while blind shooting from cover. And I played on easy... You survive between 5 and 30 seconds and then restart over and over again until you get so frustrated that you just dump the stupid game. Kane &amp; Lynch?

It&apos;s almost like you are watching some crazy documentary. There is also a fair amount of gore in the game. They cover up some of it with a censor mosaic which to give it that documentary feel.<br><br>the game is also pretty short. but multiplayer is fantastic, and extends the life of the game. Someone said the cover system is broken, and this is partly true. to go into more detail, sometimes you take cover and will slip out of cover. It&apos;s never been so bad that I died because of it, but it&apos;s a little irritating at times. Also, you can adjust your control scheme pretty easily in the options to suit your gamestyle, but if you are used to wasd then you have the basics covered.<br><br>The story is also no Homers Odyssey, but it&apos;s still fantastic. I don&apos;t see how it&apos;s &quot;boring&quot; as it&apos;s more/better story than 90% of shooters out there today. and last, the graphics are amazing. the guy saying they look like ps2 graphics needs to go back and play ps2 again and maybe install his graphics drivers (or not play it on a 486).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=1440902">Expand</a></span>

For the veteran gamers who&apos;re more into game play, this may not be for you.

This is very much a PC game, and it&apos;s for people who like genres like pulp and wuxia, and films like Sin City and Watchmen. It&apos;s a game in the style of a violent, amateur documentary and it&apos;s a blast.  A stylistic and over the top, ultra realistic and horribly violent documentary where you get to play the antagonist is really the best way I can think to describe it.
<br>
<br>No running, jumping, quickscoping and knifing, cover and actually being able to aim is a must on the highest difficulty levels which provide some decent AI. Utilize your environment, explosive barrels are still useful.
<br>
<br>Granted, if you&apos;re playing on the easiest setting the game is dead easy, which you know, the whole &quot;easy mode&quot;. Be kinda stupid if easy was hard ey. The film grain and shaky camera are for effect, some people dislike the shaking which you can turn off. The graphics are quite decent when you max them out, of course if your system can&apos;t handle it and you turn everything off then, well, it&apos;s going to look like you&apos;ve turned everything off.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s quite a nice selection of guns, more for multiplayer if you get some of the DLC. Not as many people online as there could be due to things like not knowing that Options&gt;Turn Shaking Off exists but still enough for a match. The multiplayer modes too are quite fun, none of this Deathmatch nonsense, here we have a group of robbers attacking a vault, stealing money and gunning their way out through guards. More cash means you can buy better weapons for the next round, which is a nice incentive to level your shotgun at the back of a players head and pull the trigger, looting the money from his corpse.
<br>Which gives your teammates full authority to waste you, and the person you just killed has now spawned as a guard and is coming back with a vengance.
<br>
<br>The game only took me six and a half hours to complete on normal, and that provided a reasonable challenge but slack enough to enjoy the story. And the story is reasonable, not the greatest around, but not &quot;The Russians are attacking!!&quot; which is getting kinda old now. The dialog had it&apos;s repetitive moments but on the whole a nice touch to the game. As others have pointed out, the language can get a bit coarse at times, which for mercenaries and criminals actually works.
<br>
<br>AI, on the hardest level will aim for the head, flank, and provide covering fire with assault rifles and sniper rifles while their shotgun equipped allies move in to waste you. On normal... Pretty much the same thing, just at a slower and more manageable pace. On easy, well, it&apos;s pretty easy. Level design isn&apos;t too bad, some of the missions are fairly linear, and some are full on scripted, but MW2 was worse.
<br>
<br>tl;dr/dc
<br>
<br>If you think jumping for a helicopter, missing and a sergeant grabbing your wrist every 30 seconds is good story, don&apos;t buy this game. Don&apos;t buy it if you dislike over the shoulder documentary style, over the top violence, or have a dodgy computer. Don&apos;t buy it if you like console style games, this isn&apos;t one. Buy it if you&apos;re looking for a gaming experience unlike any you&apos;ve seen so far, and are open minded enough to enjoy it for what it is. If you&apos;re one of those people, you&apos;re going to love it, if not, it&apos;s going to be the worst thing you&apos;ve played since whatever Medal of Honor last came out because it copied CoD. :P</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=1462286">Expand</a></span>

Film grain and shakycam can be disabled, so all that whining is useless. It&apos;s like the first game, but with better gameplay and shooting controls. I loved it.</span>

Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog days is a mess of crime gaming put in with a shaky camera, bad controls but fun game play and interesting storyline. If you didn&apos;t play the original Kane and Lynch, it was about two crooked crime gangsters who are betrayed by their leaders and forced to recover an amount of money for the clan. The first game does not land on my positive side as the story was less good written and the controls destroyed every fun aspect of the game. This game instead fixes it&apos;s controls but only slightly and many times I find myself slipping up and messing my concentration. Dog Days tells the tale after Dead Men in which now the Schizophrenic psychopath James Seth Lynch now living in the slums of Shanghai with his new lover Xiu. Now working for a criminal named Glazer, Lynch invites his old pal Kane to come to Shanghai and help him with a weapons trade. Things go to hell as the duo accidentally kill the daughter of a corrupt government official and are targeted by many gangsters and crooks. The story is more enjoyable as it reminds you of an old time crime movie. I have to say though as the whole game rather falls short and the ending had me cursing wildly with it&apos;s stupid and idiotic cliffhanger. Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is not a great game and was never expected to be. I can appreciate it&apos;s try to be a thrilling action shooter but fails badly but measures up to a short game that will probably take a week to finish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=2448725">Expand</a></span>

This time you play as Lynch, and oddly, there&apos;s a problem with him: he doesn&apos;t have the problems he had in the first part. He used to be a medicated psychopath, falling into killing sprees at times, but now he&apos;s calm and even got a chinese girlfriend. Kane, who arrives to help him in a heist, also lost his gruesome charm: now hairy, bearded and without his nose patch which made his appearance memorable, he doesn&apos;t have an impact on the story at all. In the original, they were Dead Men, a Traitor and a Psycho in cool suits, two awesome anti-heroes, and now they&apos;re just 2 aging men in the dirty suburbs of Shanghai. The new visual style, mimicking the Youtube-like amateur camera, hides the outdated graphics and looks great, action is gory and fast, but the problem is that the game&apos;s no longer story-driven. They even haven&apos;t shed almost any light on what happened to Kane&apos;s daughter, Jenny. (There&apos;s more about that in the official comic tie-in, but why not in the game??) And to make it worse, the second half of the game gets just plain boring, with endless waves of asian mobsters to kill, with even the characters wondering &quot;How many more are there?&quot; Another thing that made me sad was lack of soundtrack. Instead of memorable tunes by Jesper Kyd, it&apos;s just got some featureless ambient. Speaking about multiplayer, it has an interesting concept, but lacks players. To sum up, basically it&apos;s a mediocre gory shooter with unusual multiplayer modes. I&apos;d give it a 5, but I&apos;m a fan of the series and characters in particular since the first game, so I still enjoyed it, and am hoping for the third part that&apos;d note the mistakes of its predecessors. Besides, IO&apos;s now got a brand new engine, so there is hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=2450423">Expand</a></span>

The shooting is a bit inaccurate at times (especially when using lower tier weapons such as SMGs and some of the weaker Chinese pistols) but it helps add to the feeling of chaos that runs throughout. Enemies come at you in droves and the AI is reminiscent of FEAR, swarming you and generally displaying a lot of aggression (when the AI doesn&apos;t fudge up.) The clunky shakycam can get a bit tiring on the eyes but you can turn it off. Visual design is awesome and the environments are in equal parts rich and dank. The sound is probably the best I&apos;ve heard in a game, the gunfire is deafening and the timbre changes according to the environment.
<br>
<br>This is meat and potatoes action gaming, just killing upon killing upon killing. Whilst the gameplay is not super polished or innovative, it draws you into the world in a way that few games do.
<br>
<br>Biggest problems are it&apos;s short length (4/5 hours) and the fact that it crashes like there&apos;s no tomorrow. It&apos;s going cheap on Steam, and at it&apos;s current price it is certainly worth your time and a lot cheaper than going to the cinema.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=3245985">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>-good voice acting
<br>-good graphics
<br>-better gameplay than the first franchise, which include the running and the cover system
<br>-the main characters are lovable
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-poor story
<br>-poor A.I.
<br>-few and poor weapon choices
<br>-shooting mechanics is pretty dumb
<br>
<br>Kane and Lynch is a good franchise for my opinion and IO interactive and Eidos should put it on their priorities, too bad they cancelled the 3rd one.. I&apos;m still hoping and waiting for the next franchise for an improved gameplay experience :)

I never played the first one due to so many bad reviews, and I have only played this one for 3 hours so far.  The AI is usually clever, and I think playing this game on anything other than easy level would be quite a challenge for your average gamer. I like to experiment and experience different effects on the game play experience. I am using the film grain and camera shake effects on easy level for the first run through the story, and then I will up the difficulty without effects for a second run. There are no other games like this. It contains some disturbing scenes, and these are handled as tastefully as one could possibly achieve without actually editing them out. This title deserves high praise. I recommend it to mature adults that can handle and sometimes enjoy something outside the square.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=1362912">Expand</a></span>

You either have the choice of spraying bullets and hoping to get that lucky head shot or you go for the (fairly rare) 1-shot kill sniper type weapons, either way it still takes way too long to kill the AI enemies. What&apos;s worse is that half the time, after emptying half a clip into them, the enemies end up getting back up and running off seemingly unscathed.<br><br>The cover system is also terrible. You tend to spend most of the time hidden behind the most solid and out of the way cover possible because if you don&apos;t, the enemy can hit you through just about anything, damaging you ridiculously fast and causing you to sit and wait for your health to replenish slowly before you dare pop another couple shots off.<br><br>The story.... well..... they jump on a plane at the end after shooting lots of people and the credits roll. That&apos;s about the most interesting part of the story, so you try and work out what the other 75% of the game is. And yes, the credits probably account for about 25% of the gameplay time.<br><br>Please trust me and avoid at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=1486532">Expand</a></span>

You just get two mangy, aggressive **** and a great big mess for them to stumble through, and I like that.

It&apos;s made for two players and this is where the game shines. The visual style of the game is rather uncommon - you watch from a third person perspective, but the camera movement, film grain and such are done to give it a feel of watching a movie. While many dislike it, I find that it adds a nice, realistic mood and helps avoid one of the problems of third person shooters: that the same guy is doing the same thing in the corner of the screen for the entire game.<br><br>The movie-feel also comes out in the firefights - the characters will yell and scream at each other and it does a lot for the combat. Another good feature here is a developed cover system, that makes two guys shooting at each other look more like an action movie than a bunny hopping idiot-fest. The cover system sometimes gets annoying when the character decides to take cover behind something else than what you expected, but it&apos;s fairly rare when you get used to the system.<br><br>The story is very grim, fairly realistic and more akin to a movie than a game (there is no Russian uranium, no stereotype middle-eastern or south-American dictators that need American lead or such) and you get the feel that the game is based on the story rather than the story being based on the game. The game is best for two players, and the highest difficulty was a cool challenge for me and the friend I played it with. The game won&apos;t last long though, but there is plenty of variation for the relatively short duration - I didn&apos;t manage to get tired of any of the things the game wanted me to do, even at second play-through. Definitely worth playing through, but make sure to get hold of a friend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=2333540">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s like a film with all the shaky camera and grim environment, but terribly used within the game. The graphics are straight out-dated and gameplay is very linear. Hell, the multiplayer doesn&apos;t even get support! How the **** do I play this game?!</span>

Hiding behind covers is bugged, shooting difficult due to high &apos;drunken factor&apos; of weapons. Although I liked the main characters and Die Hard like style, the game is treating them (which makes player wonder, how much they can take), it just wasn&apos;t enough to keep me playing from beginning to end on a single run... which is just another flaw, because finishing the game takes 4-5 hours on Medium difficulty. Speaking of difficulty, developers haven&apos;t taken any original approach - it&apos;s just more and more enemies at once with every level, which reaches it&apos;s ridiculous apogee at the end of game, where game throws at player 20-25 enemies at once.<br>Graphics aren&apos;t that bad, but they fill empty without post-processing, with it the game looks more like a movie recorded with bad digital camcorder - it&apos;s kind of beautiful, but very annoying at the same time. Not everybody likes such a style of graphics, but unfortunately everybody will find it annoying sometimes - post-processing just makes the game hard to play. Also the level design is far from perfect - the levels aren&apos;t that original! They are flat and even destructible environment doesn&apos;t help them much.<br><br>Overall - For the first hour, I had quite a good time playing it, until I&apos;ve started to realise how linear and finally boring it is... and then in one level the game faded to black and the credits rolled - in the most unexpected moment, I&apos;ve ever witnessed in video games. I wouldn&apos;t call it a bad game (I&apos;ve played worse), but even with such a greatly designed characters as Kane and Lynch and a cooperative mode,  the number of flaws is so overwhelming, that it makes it barely even a mediocre game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=1362173">Expand</a></span>

Of course, I have to tell everyone that now Shanghai is far more beautiful than it looks in the game, the scene is actually more like old Shanghai or other old Chinese cities, but it does remind me of my childhood in China (except the violent part, because my hometown is very peaceful).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=3013715">Expand</a></span>

Cover system is broken most of the time, enemies can hit you from extreme distances but you won&apos;t be able to hit them back unless you get real close most of the time. Weapons feel like cheap toys and the combat itself is extremely annoying. The games throws dozens of waves of enemies at you throughout different levels and it gets old real fast. Simply put, as a cover shooter, this game is fundamentally broken and doesn&apos;t deserve to be on the store shelves.<br><br>Onto the more positive sides of the game: The atmosphere is quite amazing and Shanghai feels realistic and alive. Shaky camera effect coupled with bright neon lights of an Asian city make for a really amazing experience and it often feels like you&apos;re watching a Youtube documentary rather than playing a video game. The game is quite gory, the characters are extremely believable and that makes for a very realistic experience. If you&apos;re into crime thrillers, you&apos;re likely to like this part.<br><br>That said, it&apos;s a shame that boring gameplay and broken mechanics ruin the massive potential of this game. This game is truly innovative in many aspects and it&apos;s a shame that developers didn&apos;t fully utilize that potential to create something amazing, instead of creating a 3rd rate bland cover shooter (and a broken one at that).<br><br>Even though the game is pretty bad, if the atmosphere and character development are your cup of tea, it&apos;s probably worth sitting through. I personally uninstalled it after a couple of hours and couldn&apos;t bring myself to finish it, which - again - is a real shame because the game had so much potential. I got it for $3 on a Steam sale and it&apos;s not worth paying much more than that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=2269939">Expand</a></span>

<br>Some of the scenes in the game also feel very unsettling thanks to the music design. Especially a shootout early in the game where police sirens is mixed into the sound and music makes for a very nice, hopeless and unsettling feeling.
<br>
<br>I would love for Rockstar to get involved in Kane &amp; Lynch. It would fit their style perfectly. If they can just keep the feeling but polish up the gameplay it could be truly amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=3864768">Expand</a></span>

I played the first Kane &amp; Lynch all the way to its conclusion and knew what the developers were going for, but they never really hit the high notes with their first effort. Kane &amp; Lynch 2 is completely different in that respect as this game is raw, brutal and very violent...
<br>
<br>It still has a host of missed opportunities gameplay wise regarding controls that could have been tighter; the cover mechanic work  but only just and the weapons; while most feel good, there are a few that don&apos;t really feel under powered. The game also suffers from a very short story mode that severely hampers the overall product on offer.
<br>
<br>The positives do make up for the negatives above in some respect. The story maybe short but what we have is two desperate men fighting their way out of China&apos;s criminal underbelly. From the first mission where Lynch needs to &apos;talk to someone&#x2019;; the whole scene is turned on its head in seconds. What entails is a desperate struggle for survival for our two main men. Although the quality of dialogue varies it is still nice to hear Kane and Lynch communicate with one another. Lynch, who has deep lying mental problems, can be heard talking to himself more frequently over the course of the game. Kane tells him to pull it together has he knows what a loose cannon he can be but this fuels Lynch even more. Also, when the s**t does hit the fan, the characters sound like they are clearly fuelled by adrenaline when talking... This is a very nice touch and in some fire fights, it adds momentum to the scene. Graphically, this is where the game stands out to me! The handheld video effect is amazing and adds the grit that this story needs for player immersion. When you see naked people or shoot someone in the head, the camera goes blocky just on the 18+ parts. The brutality of the killings is better overall and I was pretty bored with other games that had gratified enemy&#x2019;s heads exploding up walls. With this kind of game, this sort of graphical execution is great and differentiates it from the pack.
<br>
<br>There is other stand out moments in the game but I wanted to just mention Arcade mode and multiplayer. On PC the multiplayer is dead which is a shame has the modes on offer where great and a lot of fun to play. However, if you and your friends have this game, you can do coop through arcade mode and story mode using HAMACHI (program that lets you connect to friends over the internet but tells the game you are playing it through LAN). Arcade mode is fragile alliance which is a great and it will keep you busy for a while. It&apos;s a bank heist with 8 other players, AI or friends and you; the mission? To escape with the money but friends can turn on you at any point in the level. It&#x2019;s nice being on edge all game as an alliance in one round can be forged by helping a team mate out if they are caught in a sticky situation, however; due to the nature of the levels you can sometimes shoot a heist member accidently meaning you are labelled a traitor for the rest of the round. It is a stand out feature but is lacking further development as the 7 levels can be completed in around 5 hours. The only drawback to such a feature is the guns that you unlock as you gain new ranks.
<br>
<br>In conclusion it is a package that should have been developed better as a single player game with the multiplayer additions adding weight to the product. Instead, what the game has is a under developed single player and good foundations for multiplayer. Combined it is a game that would be a good pick up from the bargain bin for under a tenner given that the online multiplayer is dead. The single player game is worth a run through twice if you like collecting achievements but a once through is suffice. I do like Kane and Lynch 2 I just wish the single player had a few more chapters and because of this, it gets a good 7/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=3139675">Expand</a></span>

<br>Works even on weak PC&apos;s even thought  it has pretty nice graphics .
<br>Story is better then on Dead Man  and cover system was fixed *Was impossible to take cover normally in Dead Man*
<br>Actually  this part is also funnier .
<br>Co-op if really fun .
<br>
<br>But IO interactive has messed up with Multiplayer part of the game</span>

<br>First of all this game is bad. Bordering on being complete garbage. The graphic does feel a bit outdated now. The envionment looks pretty generic as well. If they didn&apos;t tell it is located in Shanghai I would have assumed it&apos;s New York or Hong-Kong or something along those lines. It looks just generic. The levels are rather linear and with noting special to them.
<br>
<br>Most terible thing about it is probavly how the camera works. It&apos;s stylised after reality shows. It&apos;s shaky as hell and you can&apos;t turn it off. That coupled with over the top visual effects which makes it very hard to tell what&apos;s going on at the moment and you will be lucky if you don&apos;t get sick while playing.
<br>
<br>The story is very unclear and I was having a hard time to work out what is going on. It almost felt like some cut sceenes were missing. The characters hinted different things that were never explained. It&apos;s unlcear what exactly transpired to get the two main characters in to the fight they ended up.
<br>
<br>The game is a standard cover based third person perspecitve shooter. You follow a pretty obvious path and just shoot people as you go along. And while some guns feel nice, there is a lot of terrible ones. Especially the SMGs with their terrible aim are worse than a normal pistol. As those are the guns you will be dealing with early on it gets really tempting to throw the damn thing out of the window.
<br>
<br>So why I liked in the end? No idea. It&apos;s fairly short, a bit brutal and definitelly mindless. Provides a challange at times but it&apos;s rather on the easy side. And I do like the Kane and Lynch characters and have fond memories about the first game featuring them in. So the nostalgia might have played a role in me liking the game. Subjectivly I&apos;d recommend staying from it as far as possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=7465206">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story is still pretty much non existant and cheap B action movie genre stuff, both main protagonists still are unlikeable but you supisngly can see some humanity in them which wasnt a thing in original.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise its a slight step forward from first one, but still nothing particularly good. Shooting still is very unprecise. Now i dont have issues with more realistic shooting mechanics where you wont be able to place every bullet in your enemy like kids in games like Gears of War, but what brings it down is that the enemy AI compared to you is extremely accurate when it comes to filling you with bullets making the difficulty curve very unbalanced. Game has decent amount of guns, but they lack any weight or mechanical feedback and their sounds seem like ripped from generic sound effects library.
<br>
<br>The action camera approach at start seems like a cool gimmick, but when your head gets dizzy you hate it instantly. Also i cant stand the agressive screen effects used to make the gameplay feel even more cinematic, they also unssuccesfully try to hide the not so impressive graphics of the game where the only color is either grey or light black with flat texture work and plasticky looking character models.
<br>
<br>Easily the biggest draw back is the game&apos;s length, its only about 3.5 - 4 hours, other game modes are not worth your time since no one plays it online.
<br>
<br>Its a very average action game with a dark gritty feel that kinda feels unique, but theres a much better game similiar to this called Max Payne 3 which also has something called replay value. Get this game only if youre really got nothing better to play in given moment and only if its sold for bargain bin money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=6902094">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>KL2 is a third-person action shooter, with a couple of gimmicks throw in to try to make the gameplay stand out from other entries in the genre. The gameplay certainly stands out in this genre for being a prototype for the worst cinematic, linear, action shooter.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s world is presented through a visual filter, which admittedly, looks nice on first sight. Unfortunately, it makes objects in the distance look hazy which did effect the gameplay negatively. For example, when the enemies were  firing at me from a long distance, the hazy vision made it difficult for me to aim and fire back at them.
<br>
<br>To make matters worse, the bullet detection is unreliable. You will find yourself emptying a clip of ammo at an enemy standing square in your line of sight, only to realize that not a single bullet has registered. This is especially frustrating against some of the bullet-sponge enemies that appear later in the game. This game also has a dysfunctional cover system, where I was still taking damage from fire even if when I was completely covered behind a wall. The frustrations are dampened slightly by the &quot;down but not out&quot; mechanic included, which gives players a chance to recover once their health drops low enough. All in all, the gameplay is full of frustrations and the most basic mechanics do not function like they are supposed to.
<br>
<br>The story in this game is quite poor as well, the cut scenes are well produced, but they start and end  awkwardly, at times it looked like they were interrupted. The locations in the game lack cohesion, at some point I found  myself running in an airport without knowing how or when the characters got there, due to a lack of exposition. The characters and voice acting kept me somewhat engaged through the first hour of the game, but after that it fell apart.
<br>
<br>I did not experience the multiplayer in this game, but for what it is worth, it was considered the brightest aspect of this game when it came out in 2010.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/user-reviews?user_review_id=7708092">Expand</a></span>
