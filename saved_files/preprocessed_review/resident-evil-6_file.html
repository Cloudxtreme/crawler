<br>It&apos;s amazing how a game which starts so similarly to say, RE3, fails to convey any basic feature which made such an old game fun. You can&apos;t feel alone (you&apos;re not), you can&apos;t feel lost (press the Q key), you can&apos;t feel in danger (&quot;Continue?&quot; As if it were Tekken), you don&apos;t feel scared. I&apos;ll never even try a RE game again after this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3054671">Expand</a></span>

<br>Having played the console version before, i can easily assume that the PC version is easily the best looking version and its perfectly ported. There are things that could have been improved, but still.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve had a bit of problem getting familiar with the cameras and the gameplay but after a while you&apos;ll get along with it.
<br>The storyline is quite good and i like how you play it with 4 different characters from different points of views.
<br>The MP is also great, a lot of gamemodes but Mercenaries is so much fun.
<br>Also the game has Split-Screen in coop and the other game modes to play with your friends.
<br>
<br>I gotta say i&apos;m an old school Resident Evil fan, but i liked this game so far, regardless of how much it has changed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3059254">Expand</a></span>

From the constant frame rate drops, to AMD video card crashes, to the fact you can&apos;t mute the voice chat in co-op games (there is a function but it doesn&apos;t work), and there is no push to talk button.
<br>
<br>The game itself is not a linear game, and in this case I use that term in a bad way.  The characters have 5-6 campaign chapters, and really only of them provides any sense of terror.  The others seem to be explosion after explosion.  What I liked about Resident Evil 5, was there was a storyline, and a mystery.  I don&apos;t get that with this game at all.  Overall, bad programming, a bad port of a generally flawed game.

Graphics are pretty mediocre, as can be expected from DX9 technology, but the game runs rather poorly on my AMD 1090t and 4gb 2000mhz ram and a 6970 2gb GPU.  It bogs down and stutters randomly.  Oh and there&apos;s plenty of screen tearing too if you disable vsync, which with it enabled, induces input lag.  Not a bad game.  I just hope they start patching the bugs soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3050839">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s everything to love and nothing to hate. If we consider the last trilogy, Resident Evil from 4 to 6 this is easily the best of them all, the culmination of the action Capcom offers. You can do all sort of new moves which are awesome, you can slide, dodge, land on your back and shoot from the ground (which can be done when enemies drop you too), you can fight in melee with combos or switching to a melee weapon. I really like the fluidity of the game and it&apos;s even more fun with a friend. The coop of this game is great, you are not helpless per s&#xE9;, you can counter enemies&apos; grapples, you can even &quot;stand up&quot; for yourself if you survive long enough in a down state, but, of course, it&apos;s a lot easier if there&apos;s a team mate helping you out but that may not be always possible due to tactics gone wrong or levels where you have to stay apart for some time.
<br>There is much to explore, some campaigns have more exploration than others, graphics are really good for my standards (which may be low since I don&apos;t really care) and it goes at 60 fps even if the benchmark told me it would go at 20-30. The campaigns are a great idea, different enemies, different characters, different playstyles and it&apos;s a hard game too! I play at Professional difficulty, invested 23 hours in the game right now and I&apos;m something as halfway through (I&apos;m doing chapter 3 with Chris now after doing 3 chapters with Jake and Leon). I really can&apos;t find anything wrong with this game, it gives me the challenge I seek, the adrenaline, the fear (the fear of dying but there are some jumps too), the gameplay is perfect as I see it, this was much more than I anticipated, I&apos;ll definitely play this multiple times. I&apos;m giving it a 10 because as I said before, I can&apos;t find much wrong with it and I didn&apos;t have such fun with an action game for a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3063907">Expand</a></span>

The only reason i am not giving 10 is the fact that i don&apos;t like QTE and there is a bit too much of them here :P. Fighting system  boss fights are awsome. That&apos;s why I would really recommend everyone to play it before reading other comments because i thing this game is really worth buying. Keep up the good work Konami :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3671610">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is TERRIBLE, an absolute embarrassement of the RE series. The RPG element capcom added in RE4 &amp; RE5 was exactly what the series needed, so they totally destroy it with this new stale skill system. I&apos;m sure it looked good on paper being able to switch 3 different sets of skills around, but just doesn&apos;t work and it&apos;s not fun.
<br>
<br>I get that this game was set to be more action packed...but the QTE&apos;s are just a total buzzkill. If I wanted to play &quot;track n field&quot; every few minutes, I&apos;d fire my NES up.
<br>
<br>When you figure in the bad camera angles, and controls into the mix... you have a pile of hot garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3849817">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>It&apos;s sad. Capcom does not know what they are trying to do. This game is nothing and still everything. The story has plotholes. It&apos;s filled with QTE which suck. It&apos;s not even remotely scary. But the graphics are good.
<br>Well Dead Space 1 and 2 are much better then this. Looks like the Survival Horror genre can only be saved by indie developers.</span>

Too much action oriented, a bad inventory not letting you fix and organize your weapons and items and many campaigns that actually take place the same time ruining the immersion factor. I would definitely prefer one big campaign. Technically the game looks and feels good.</span>

Everything that was unique about it was junked for a cookie cutter shooter plagued with an endless string of button mashing qtes and about 300 miles of chase scenes. The only RE tradition still intact is the terribly cheesy dialog.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=4085636">Expand</a></span>

This game could not have been less fun to play, its no longer a survival horror game. This is a action adventure game with more quick time events than I care to count. There are multiple stories playing out in this game at the same time. Somehow they all manage to converge on each other in someway or another. Yet somehow the original game in the series started off with zombies and actual scares this game seems to make me laugh more than scare me.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: Overall controls are easy to get the hang of and its not a difficult game by any means. It is however a terrible and boring and if you are familiar with the series at all then I don&#x2019;t know how you can even consider this game worthy of the name Resident Evil. It&#x2019;s a confusing mess with quick time events and stop and shot tactics that get old very quickly.
<br>
<br>Graphics: Game runs smoothly and is up to date on todays graphic engines, isn&#x2019;t anything you haven&#x2019;t seen before but it maybe the only saving grace this game has is the fact that it looks decent.
<br>
<br>Replay Value: None, beat the game and you will never want to touch it again. That is if your lucky and do manage to play through the entire game!
<br>
<br>Overall this game is a complete waste of time and money. Wouldn&apos;t even want to play this game if it was free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=4152008">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t believe people keep saying that Leon&apos;s campaign is the better one. What the hell? It&apos;s just as actiony and crap as the rest of it, except made worse by Leon&apos;s absolutely brutally unfunny dialogue and boring partner. At least Shelly x Jake had some fun little chemistry to them, and had some tense moments with the nemesis knockoff.
<br>
<br>Anyways, really can&apos;t recommend you buy this unless you have a friend with a good sense of humor. You can have fun with this game if you have 0 expectations and laugh at everything it tries to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=4622867">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Lots of confusing and useless quicktime events (seriously, a QTE to help Elena on her feet???)
<br>-Bad aiming, with pointer completely off, ALWAYS
<br>-Bad controls, half of the keyboard is wasted for dodging
<br>-The Action button and the run button are the same button, enjoy climbing stairs up and down over and over because you want to run but instead he climbs back up/down.
<br>-Ammo/Healingwares drop/position is unbalanced crap. Sometimes you&apos;ll be loaded with ammo with your buddy having none, sometimes you will be completely out in front of a really strong enemy.
<br>-bossfights are all repetitive with the boss coming back over and over even if you blew him up to the sky 100 times.
<br>-The skill system is lacking and absolutely NOT rewarding, costs a lot for barely useful skills.
<br>-There&apos;s no weapon upgrade (HUGE LETDOWN)
<br>-The &quot;secrets&quot; are few and dull.
<br>-There are an awful lot of &quot;running&quot; stages where your life will depend exclusively on how the AI will behave.
<br>-Zombies who can barely walk and say *bwgrbhgbh* will be able to fly military choppers like veterans.
<br>-You&apos;ll have your gun ready to fire a bullet straight in Ada&apos;s head blowing her damn brain everywhere but *SPOILER* you won&apos;t.
<br>-The invasion mechanic is broken, because it alters the amount of enemies and the player controlled ones aren&apos;t just more dangerous but will respawn indefinitely and if you die they&apos;ll restart the mission with you like a living nightmare. So if you want to play this piece of **** game, be sure to turn that off.
<br>-The ending is pointless.
<br>-the team actions are plain dumb, they&apos;re not bad or anything they just look so stupid. You&apos;ll often have to lean against a door with your buddy to proceed just to get teleported 10 ft away with a cutscene of a totally random guy opening the door for you will play.
<br>-The enemy placement is very bad, sometimes there will be enemies shooting you from behind walls or grating that you won&apos;t be able to spot.
<br>
<br>Overall, the worst resident evil by far. Clunky, very annoying, stupid on so many levels and just uninspired, with trivial plot twists and average cutscenes/acting.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t buy unless you won&apos;t to get your testicles torn asunder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=5366597">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The controls aren&apos;t unintuitive, they are counter intuitive. The story is vague and bland and death occurs due to controller glitch far more often than player mistakes.
<br>
<br>Worst for me is that they reduced a once great franchise to a more boring version of Dragon&apos;s Lair-They made the whole thing a slightly dolled up, linear, rail-shooter. What&apos;s next, midi soundtracks?
<br>
<br>There is no excuse for this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3636128">Expand</a></span>

<br>Essentially this is a step back for the series; where as Resident Evil 4 and 5 had horror and action elements, this has almost only action.  The best way I can describe it: whether you are playing RE1 on the PS1, or RE5 on the PC, by the end of the game you are far more skilled at dispatching enemies.  The cheap hits preclude this skill curve and you will feel no more adept at the end of the game than in your first hour.  I can say that this was first Resident Evil that genuinely not fun to play a few hours, which is surprising considering the obvious expense and time it took developing the game.
<br>
<br>Capcom; please enlist more play-testers from multiple nationalities if you want to continue this franchise, preferably some who can give you the raw truth as to whether your game is fun or not before pushing it out the door.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3642775">Expand</a></span>

I felt demystified and I sincerely doubt that the developers took the time to imagine themselves in zombie apocalypse situation before they scripted some of the dialogue and events that happen here.  The game looks pretty, but like I said it is lacking in so many other ways that I would never suggest this game to any kind of friend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3353863">Expand</a></span>

Unbelievable how terrible game can be in present accepted as &quot;good&quot; game. Lets face the truth. Resident Evil 6 is boring, its parody on Call of Duty and Helen Harper is always like: &quot;Not now, its complicated, I wont tell you a sh*t until we came there.&quot; Leon S. Kennedy campaign is embarrassing. When bus drive off the road because on the road was one half-dead zombie, you will laugh really hard. Then you will wander through cemetery few times from start to beginning like a fool and end up in some ridiculous underground catacombs.
<br>But the best has not yet to come. Campaign of Chris Redfield is pure joke. Truly this is some parody on Call of Duty or I don&apos;t know. In some eastern Europe village you shoot probably some ugly zombie-communists armed with guns and you feel like you play everything else, but not Resident Evil.
<br>So, finally you can walk when you aim or shoot, but that will not change anything this game is pure crap. I don&apos;t even finished Chris Redfield campaign, because it sucks really hard. This is typical game for naive new-gamers who don&apos;t know and never played finest old Resident Evil games. Remember Resident Evil is dead, this new Resident Evil is just fake. Ugly, bad, horrible fake. Don&apos;t dare call this game Resident Evil, its offensive. Rename this on: Call of Zombies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3185932">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve rarely played a game that was so poorly designed that I got stuck on the graphics options.

<br>
<br>Once I started playing the game I couldn&apos;t grasp how poor the graphics were (for such a big title). Textures look washed out, overly dark and the 3d models look clunky.
<br>The lag on my gamepad made aiming (and hence the whole game) worthless. Now gamepad integration is a hard thing to get right  at times but bare in mind that this is a game primarily designed for consoles.
<br>
<br>This game manages to do the one thing worse than boring its audience, it manages to frustrate them into turning the damn thing of after 5 minutes or gameplay.
<br>Speaking of turning the game off this is roughly the process:
<br>
<br>1)Disconnect the controller battery pack
<br>
<br>2)select &apos;end game session&apos;
<br>
<br>3)go back to graphic properties
<br>
<br>4)select no for &apos;full screen&apos;
<br>
<br>5)close the game window by clicking the &apos;x&apos; on the window with your mouse.
<br>
<br>Complete waste of time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3178891">Expand</a></span>

I CANNOT understand how they have managed to obliterate the main series while RE:Revelations is so much better. I hope Capcom realizes, in turn, what path they should follow hence forth. Also a little fun fact about the directors name (I always love those); Sasaki in Greek is the dimunitive for the girl&apos;s name &quot;Sa(n)sa&quot;. As I am referring to the director (he also directed the &quot;RE: Outbreak&quot; series), I have to give him my most profound congratulations for, finally, creating his personal masterpiece.

The feel of that game was unique to itself. Such as the way you had to hold down a button to run, or not being able to move when shooting, which in turn made the player back away from any enemys before proceeding with firing again. Even RE5 had this feeling, it may have lost the creepy environment, but it felt like RE4 which was a good thing. Hell RE: Revelations should of been RE6. Cause that was a GOOD RE game.
<br>
<br>RE6 throws these away for some kind of cheap action experience. No longer is the player in much danger when he is constantly running, no longer does the player have to back away from fights. It all comes down to the way it plays. If RE6 played like Revelations, 5, or 4. I would of loved this game.
<br>
<br>Capcom seems to be confused on what they should deliver to it&apos;s public. They better figure out quickly before shoving trash like this out to us again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3613636">Expand</a></span>

This game, while visually stunning, is hardly worthy of being called a Resident Evil (it&apos;s more like those cheesy films that share the name).

I could spend ages listing all of the reasons this fails as a game, but I&apos;ll just summarise them here instead;

<br>My how far the Resident Evil franchise has fallen.
<br>
<br>This game, while visually stunning, is hardly worthy of being called a Resident Evil (it&apos;s more like those cheesy films that share the name).
<br>
<br>I could spend ages listing all of the reasons this fails as a game, but I&apos;ll just summarise them here instead;
<br>
<br>- You&apos;ll spend most of your time running around looking for ammunition and health, while collecting an inordinate amount of skill points.
<br>
<br>I know item scarcity is a hallmark of survival horror, but this series left survival horror behind long ago
<br>
<br>- Pretty much every enemy can knock you down, and it happens for too often (also accounting for my rubbish gaming skills)
<br>
<br>- I know what the serpent embent emblems are used for, you don&apos;t need to tell me every time I collect one damnit!
<br>
<br>- Stupid AI. And I really mean stupid.
<br>
<br>-  Stop moving the damn camera! Seriously, when you are running from something or another and the camera decides to focus on something when you are trying to run, which throws off the control scheme, it gets ridiculously frustrating.
<br>
<br>- Bosses that get recycled over and over. Here is a hint for you game developers, how about making us kill them only once, then try tasking your imagination to come up with something other than &apos;Let&apos;s have them kill it again!&apos;.
<br>
<br>- Without warning, if you are stood in the wrong place, something will kill you and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it! Ect when you pick Ada and you try to hide from Chris in a shaft like (ok it&apos;s like a tunnel of metal) and these things crawl around but they come from out of nowhere they drop from the sky they is no open space for them to drop on your head anyway they drop on your head then you fall in the gap in the celling then Chris holds his gun to your head and you see you are dead screen see uncool guys.
<br>
<br>And the list could go on, but I prefer not to waste too much time ranting about rubbish!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3276556">Expand</a></span>

<br>Resident Evil 5 made so much money (probably because Resident Evil 4 was a massive hit) and never truly lived up to the hype of Res 4. In my honest opinion they sold out to make more money and break into the COD target audience (12-16 year males) with action, action, action.
<br>Then there was Resident Evil 6, with 1700 different playable characters (where lets be honest 95  of us just wanted to play as Leon and maybe the other 5% as Chris) and more quick time events then you could handle. It seems they are just more interested in making a action based game for the yung&apos;uns to make money then making a horror survival for a smaller audience.
<br>
<br>You would think they would of learnt their mistake with Res 5 but nope they saw that it took loads of money so decided to stick with that action horror genre (and even calling it action &apos;HORROR&apos; is being grateful)
<br>
<br>If you enjoy playing as characters you don&apos;t care about and you have to have action every 2 seconds and just wanna shot some zombars then go for it, this is the game for you.
<br>
<br>If you are a fan of the series (well until Res4 that is) then i suggest that you don&apos;t go anywhere near it as Capcom are not catering for your needs anymore.
<br>
<br>They had such potential with Leon &amp; maybe Chris that they could of done something so much better but as i read from a critic on this very website that apparently 600 people went into making this game then it is literally like a game where they didn&apos;t know what direction they wanted to take so just chucked random stuff together and then went &quot;taaa daaaa&quot;  &quot;please buy this game, we have explosions and quick time events for all you kiddies that don&apos;t have to work out any puzzles or even think a little&quot;
<br>
<br>i get frustrated because they had it all and once again like EA they wanted to make as much money as possible and stick two fingers up at you..
<br>
<br>I apologize for keep repeating myself about the action and quick time events but imagine Res 1 when you first encounter the dogs through the windows in the hall way or the Licker on the ceiling or either res 2 with the zombies at the beginning or that bastard on the bus and it was all quick time events and you had to press the shoulder buttons to move left and right, it wouldn&apos;t feel the same now would it. They dumbed it down and made it in to a movie and lets be honest who gives a f about Jake or whats her name.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3282224">Expand</a></span>

La historia es impresionante, esta vez han preferido contarte la historia en vez de encontrarte notitas y leerlas durante el juego.
<br>La verdad es que la historia est&#xE1; muy muy bien, la aparici&#xF3;n de tantos personajes y alusiones al pasado son la leche.
<br>
<br>En cuanto al gameplay, tiene el mejor gameplay de la saga sin duda, con much&#xED;simas posibilidades, el movimiento es fluido, est&#xE1; muy bien optimizado para Pc y est&#xE1; muy logrado el sistema de apuntar.
<br>Puedes cambiar las c&#xE1;mara de la espalda y aumentar tu rango de visi&#xF3;n (fov). Cabe destacar que la posibilidad para jugar a pantalla partida se agradece mucho, as&#xED; como poder jugar cooperativo online.
<br>
<br>Muy grande por parte de Valve regalarnos los personajes de Left 4 dead 2 jugables para el modo Mercenarios Sin piedad, y gracias Capcom por no cobrarnos por ello, los DLC gratis son siempre bienvenidos.
<br>
<br>Finalmente es un juego que es muy recomendable para jugadores nuevos, o jugadores cl&#xE1;sicos de RE.
<br>
<br>Podr&#xED;amos decir que la campa&#xF1;a de Leon es la m&#xE1;s fiel a los Resident Evil Cl&#xE1;sicos, m&#xE1;s zombies normales (no soldados mutantes), y luego especiales y puzzles.
<br>
<br>En cambio tenemos la de Chris Redfield, m&#xE1;s enfocada a la acci&#xF3;n en plan Gears Of War con tus soldados, escenarios de d&#xED;a, etc.
<br>
<br>Luego tenemos un poco la mezcla de Jake, con m&#xE1;s toques de aventura. Y la campa&#xF1;a de Ada impresionante, muchos toques de sigilo e infiltraci&#xF3;n.
<br>
<br>Lo recomiendo much&#xED;simo, no le doy un 10 porque me parece que se han pasado con lo de &quot;Caza de agentes&quot; y no tienen un sistema para controlar el VoIP. La gente entra a als partidas con el microfono abierto y los altavoces a tope, y se escuchan ecos terribles que arruinan la experiencia de juego, lo dicho.
<br>
<br>Gracias Capcom por el regalo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3101504">Expand</a></span>

They never let you immerse in the experience or get engaged, because they felt the need to distract you every five minutes with an annoying cutscene, which are pain to watch thanks to the shaky camera movement and the dull content. The little stuff you have to do is pushed in your face, even the most obvious goals. Feels like it was made for mentally challenged people (and I think it is really the case).

I don&apos;t even wanna do this review but I feel obligated to. BTW this game is not horror at all. It&apos;s pure action. As many explosions happen in this... it&apos;s just... yeah.
<br>
<br>If it had a decent story I&apos;d talk about it but right now I&apos;m still trying to figure out what I just played and why I played it. Maybe it&apos;s because I paid money for this turd. It&apos;s extremely generic. Bad guys are at it again. Go stop them. No idea how they got their resources or who the bad guy really is I&apos;m still confused about a lot.
<br>
<br>I only remember the characters that were in Resident Evil 1 2 and 3. Beyond that I don&apos;t know who the hell was in this and nor will I ever be able to recall them. The voice acting was poor, their impact was poor, the overall placement of them was poor.
<br>
<br>Well the game has decent graphics and visuals so I gotta give them credit for that. The zombies and monsters were really well detailed. Only everything was exploding everywhere. Just like an American action film. Can&apos;t figure out good plot? Blow everything the hell up! There were at times polygon errors. One time Ada&apos;s dressed stretched into the ground, my gun disappeared, and I fell through the level a few times.
<br>
<br>Gameplay was just polished RE4. Nothing new or something to talk about. It handles really well and overall it was great feeling. The controls on PC were a tad wonky at times like I said with poor porting and what not. It has multiplayer? I don&apos;t know. I was so disgusted after the campaign I uninstalled it quick.
<br>
<br>This game presented little challenge. I had no problem beating this game on... what was the highest difficulty at the start? We&apos;ll just say Very Hard. Ammo was barely enough so it has some prretty good challenge there.
<br>
<br>Would I recommend this game. NO!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272766">Expand</a></span>

I suffered through half of Leon&apos;s dumb but kinda-ok gameplay-wise campaign and through two chapters of the 3rd person Call of Duty mod that is Chris&apos;s campaign and then just gave up. Writing and plot are just missing, even RE5 made more sense. Characters and dialogue are bland and annoying  as hell too. Gameplay, especially with Chris, is absolutely terrible. Leon is kinda ok, only the levels are mostly boring. No weapon upgrades, costumes in the retail game, mostly horrible gameplay. Sorry, Capcom, but just... no.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3055821">Expand</a></span>

<br>For all of you that want a horror game then don&apos;t ask for a new game set in future... ask for a game set in the past! Its not like RE when they didn&apos;t know what was going on or the virus was in early stages, the BOW are evolved and there is a WAR, an all-out BOW attack for cut the crap about the horror element.
<br>I got to tell you that I loved it too and I miss it but the game and the story has evolved... the virus has evolved... its not that scary but dangerous.
<br>The game is totally worth buying (at least on PC as its the only version of RE6 I have played)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3067616">Expand</a></span>

<br>The aiming is utter and complete BS. You will either take literally up to 10 seconds to line up one headshot or misfire when you spray before your aim is aligned, your choice. There are better ways to make shooters harder. Messing up your aim by giving you a handicap that a bottle of wine straight up would give you is not a good way to make a shooter more challenging... overall very bad gameplay mechanics and design.
<br>I&apos;m still oughta check the aim issue with a x360 controller, but, ya know, KB+mouse is supposed to be... yeah...

I will preface this by saying firstly that I never liked the RE series.  As with 99% of video games, the idea is a pale rip-off of a book or movie infected with the most ridiculous plot twits and lame attempts at sap-filled dialogue.  HOWEVER, on top of that, the horrible controls/gameplay of the first 3 RE games were as frustrating as trying to move a retarded American WW2 tank (which sucked compared to the Germans) in tight corridors where you never knew where exactly you would ignite a collision box.
<br>
<br>ANYWAYS, then came along re4, with again God-awful plot and bad guys but a great atmosphere (at least the first half) and great gameplay/surprise moments.  Since then I have followed the series.  RE5 was a disaster of laughable proportions.  But I chipped in and bought RE6.
<br>
<br>RE6 is a movie where you ride in.  Regardless of what you do, the game is the same, it is linear, and lots of quick time events.  BUT, if you know this going INTO the game, then you know not to be disappointed!!!  It is a fun movie that finds all new ways to jump the shark (or nuke the fridge) with over the top ways to try to kill you or blow things up and so on.  This game is again a new departure for the series, and as is often the case- horror game series only stay horror games if they were finite and short.  Once everyone becomes familiar with the game, the fan base becomes broader, it is very hard for the company to feel compelled to shrink the game and return to its horror &apos;roots.&apos;  Although I would be hard pressed to ever call the first few RE games horror, since they were campy as hell and stupid-predictable.
<br>
<br>They seem to have ripped many ideas from other genres, and game titles such as l4d- in fact I would think that is the direction they want to go into from here on.  I would not be surprised if they had more crossovers in future titles after the l4d2 crossover coming out soon (capcom versus steam anyone?).  But all these parodies and rip-offs work, and the good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad and they take different styles of RE gameplay and separate them in the different missions- Leons is more horror, Jake is more combat survival, and so on.
<br>
<br>Finally, the side games- agent hunt is silly as monster control is very very awkward and dare I say a little frustrating.  COOP!!!! Super kudos to the game for allowing LOCAL COOP!!!! A tremendous boon, making the PC once again feel more dominant than the consoles for the graphics, HDMI cable or wireless support to my big screen tv and keyboard  controller support.  Not to mention the fact that all the added content got unlocked since we all pre-ordered the dam thing :D :D...
<br>
<br>All in all, I support this game, it is a fun movie ride, takes a long time to finish, and since I do not sit here for hours playing games at a time, this game will last me a long time before I get bored.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3079916">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I saw a lot of negative response to Re6, i felt sad.  I already spent 40 hours in this game now and  It was a very nice experience to me. The difficulty level is great, i need to figure out how to avoid enemies attack and give them a counterattack.  What make those guy felt so bad? I think they were wrong</span>

<br>+ Play time, It&apos;s took me 60hr+ to complete all chapters for all characters in Story Mode alone, good enough
<br>+ Price, $39.99 on Steam cheaper than other Big title. they could put it on $59.99 and most ppl still buy it so lower the price got my score.
<br>
<br>= Game Mechanic, a bit too much FPS but in time when FPS ruled game industry, I guess it can&apos;t be help.
<br>
<br>- Terrible camera angle in some area, such as Christ chapter 5, it&apos;s impossible for me to progress with Keyboard and mouse because camera keep changing backward and forward. I&apos;ve to use my Xbox controller (analog stick). this is example of bad pc port.
<br>- too much cut scene. I don&apos;t mind long cutscene(cus I can skip it) but do it every 10 mins is not ok for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3100582">Expand</a></span>

<br>Sound and themes are very good, some of the soundtracks are very touching.
<br>Design &amp; interface, i have been playing RE games since 4 years ago, once i login to the game, I felt it is very Resident evil... It is well designed.
<br>Story, Japanese type of story, it&apos;s more like a game and fantasy, it&apos;s very encouraging.
<br>Control, Camera, once u get used to it, it&apos;s awesome feeling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3115381">Expand</a></span>

<br>What others have said is true, the game is 100% action and the action part isn&apos;t really that great compared to games such as Gears of War 3. Literally every 10-30 seconds theres some kind of gigantic explosion or random harrier jets crashing or cars flipping. The game attempts to wow you by throwing gigantic scripted explosions at you similar to CoD but if your a little bit older gamer it gets boring fast.---- Gamers these days might be won over by giant explosions 24/7 or random nonsensical violence but I&apos;m simply not. I think in all genres like comedy, action, horror and others need to have correct pacing or the viewer becomes disinterested. For example a sitcom can&apos;t have a joke after a joke for 20 minutes because after awhile people are overwhelmed. The same principle applies here. When every 2 seconds the side of a building is blowing up, followed by a tanker exploding, followed by you jumping into a helicopter, then crashing said helicopter in a giant explosion all right after each other you can tell really fast these scripted sequences are the main game.------Instead of supporting the characters, story or plot the action BECOMES the plot. The story takes a dive yet again with the typical &quot;Evil bad man releases t-virus on city/world&quot;.------------If you are looking for true survival horror look up The Evil Within being developed by Shinji Makimi, the original director of RE1-4 and inventor of the survival horror genre itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3122017">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s amazing how a game which starts so similarly to say, RE3, fails to convey any basic feature which made such an old game fun. You can&apos;t feel alone (you&apos;re not), you can&apos;t feel lost (press the Q key), you can&apos;t feel in danger (&quot;Continue?&quot; As if it were Tekken), you don&apos;t feel scared.

<br>
<br>I loved the hell out of the series before this game, i still play my PSX copy of RE:DC and RE 2, I play Raccoon city somewhat regularly, because i love the atmosphere, feel, and the story of the game... But this Abomination we know as Resident Evil 6... Does not deserve to be called a Game, It should be called a torture device, Where someone invites their friend who does not know better, For some &quot;Co-Op&quot;.
<br>
<br>-The good:
<br>
<br>-Graphics: 7/10 are not as good as you would think, but they get their job done, and are not overly polished Except the ice, and snow (after a certain snow mobile chase) which sometimes looks like polished marble or &quot;desert glass&quot;
<br>
<br>-Sounds: I would rate them 7/10. They are good, but they could be better, especially some of the weapon sounds... just sound odd.
<br>
<br>-Atmosphere of the game,6/10 (Jake and sherry 9/10). the campaign with jake and sherry, has a nice atmosphere, and i think they nailed it with that one.... the others, not so much.
<br>
<br>Now the bad....
<br>
<br>The controls: Are just awfull, and most of the time you get screwed over by them, not to mention, you do not have the freedom of opting out from key combinations, you have to have some Combined keys in bindings, othervise the game snarles at you and tells you &quot;some keys have not been configured&quot; and does not let you get out of the bindings menu until they are -.-
<br>
<br>QTE: I like a good QTE here and there.... But when they shovel them down your throat at the same pace as you goble minutes for game time.... That is just too much. Not to mention alot of the QTE&apos;s and action scenes, have elements which you have no control over, which end up killing you, either due to crappy level design, or bad camera angle, or colliding with your partner.... Yeah, even when running, you touch your partner = you get slowed down a bit -.-
<br>
<br>Weapon and inventory system; Just fugly, cant say anything else about, you have to experience it yourself...
<br>
<br>The skill point system: not only is it reduntant(you in no way need to have skills to beat the campaigns)
<br>You wount be able to acces most of the skills during your first 2 campaigns anyway, Take for example Melee skill upgrade, level one takes 11K skill points, does not sound that much, except the character you want to use it with, jake, hes campaign will be about 50% done when you get that... Yeah, level 2 takes 22500 points if i remember correctly, Yeah... Get the point?
<br>
<br>The physics of the game; This is the one have the most grief with, Imagine a hole, You see it, You step closer, you get to 2-3 meters from the hole... And you get an animation that shows you falling down to it -.- that is basically the physics of this game in a nutshell... Anything even slightly dangerous looking, assume it is alive, and has telekinetic vortex or something that sucks you in if you go anywhere near. Oh and holes and ledges, assume they are blackholes during the action sequences.
<br>
<br>Last but not least, The stupid combat system: Unless you take the combat block upgrade... You are out of stamina after 5-7 melee moves -.- this is especially annoying with jakes campaign, since he has some awesome moves :( like a piledriver.
<br>
<br>If you are a resident evil fan, Dont play this game, unless you are into Masochism</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=4433590">Expand</a></span>

This game has extreme value,a lot of content for a considerably smaller than usual price, f.e. you have 3 campaigns and each lasts longer than quite a few latest releases (every campaign was longer for me than Bioshock Infinite,though I played on veteran or professional difficulty,can&apos;t remember). It&apos;s very entertaining,especially if you play in coop,even with a random mate. While every RE fan would wish this would be a survival horror,it&apos;s not,it has some atmosphere and scarce ammo,but that&apos;s about it. That said,if you like shooting,I found the game shooting mechanics to be very satisfying,even though there&apos;s a small camera lock at the start of aiming.That should be enough of praises,though there are a few more things I could point out. On the other side,environmental textures are very bad,sometimes even on RE4 level,most noticeably in Chris&apos;s campaign. Believe me,they&apos;re terrible. The game is a bit too fast paced to get immersed,it&apos;s not Devil May Cry (the earlier ones,not that crappy &quot;reboot&quot;), but it&apos;s really fast and there aren&apos;t enough places where you can take a break,explore a bit,like in RE5. Enemies are seemingly neverending,while with the zombies it creates a pretty dense atmosphere,with the Javo mutants it just pissess you off. Yes,there are zombies,and very well done at that,in Leon&apos;s campaign(oh and mutants,pretty much enemies in his story remind me of the first RE&apos;s) ,proving you CAN make a zombie game without those running wannabe zombies. Plot is on the the usual Resident Evil level,meaning it&apos;s idiotic,naive and plain stupid,though there are less corny lines when compared to RE5,at least it seemed like that to me.
<br>Music at a few sequences gets incredibly dull,but in general it&apos;s not bad,it&apos;s just average. All in all,I definitely recommend buying this game,just don&apos;t buy it blindfolded,check it out if one of your mates has it,it might be just up your alley or it might be the complete opposite. For me,this one comes right after RE4 and RE2 as the best in the series (I do not count 1,cause it&apos;s a bit different game: D)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3072284">Expand</a></span>

I had been closely following the reviews from both critics and users alike when this released on console late last year and the polarizing views made me think this was going to be worse than RE5 (which I can&apos;t say appealed to me as much as RE4 did). When the game launched on Steam at $39.99 it was a done deal. Having completed the game I am still trying to understand the backlash. I did not play the first 3 games in the series which I hear focused more on survival horror so I don&apos;t carry that baggage along with me and neither am I a CoD fanboy (I could not be bothered with that mindless crap) but I felt as an over the shoulder 3rd person action adventure with horror elements, RE6 succeeded admirably. If I have one complaint it would be the chase scene with Chris and Piers trying to avoid the HAOS as they escape the B.O.W. That was painful as the animations triggered by button presses were often the reason we (my co-op partner and myself) were dying and we died a lot during this part which was not fun. Other than that the game has been an off-rails-experience and with 4 lengthy campaigns you really are getting your monies worth and with a solid co-op partner that has your back, it was one of the most exhilarating experiences ever. Yes you could argue there is an abundance of QTE&apos;s, yes the game is like a Michael Bay version of Resident Evil but despite all this it was still a far more thrilling game than Bioshock Infinite (which I got at the same time as RE6). Well worth the money and time invested.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3095579">Expand</a></span>

Resident Evil 4 and 5 both looked through the prospective of one character, with the help of a companion (or not so much help in the case of RE4). Both games are fantastic, with RE4 at the top of the list because of its third person shooting aspects along with scary monsters and a dynamic story. RE6 had all of these, but it took out everything else that complimented the gameplay in an attempt to add prospective through different characters.
<br>
<br>What the game has that is completely different is the separate stories. Each follows there own character, and includes bits and pieces of a larger picture that is the story. This was a bad move, because it seemed to make Capcom completely overlook the things that complimented RE 4 and 5.
<br>
<br>There is no longer a way of buying and selling things in RE6. Any and all RPG elements were taken out, making the use of only a few weapons that are basically the same through the game. You eventually find new ones, but you end up using only the guns you have ammo for, making the need for some weapons vanish. Each character in the individual stories have their own weapons and the stories give them new weapons accordingly, however it all follows the same basic agenda. There is a shotgun, sniper, assault rifle, pistol etc.
<br>
<br>Well maybe the new story idea panned out, and it worked by including a gripping tale right? RE6 does nothing but show you a generic story that is very predictable if you are a fan of the series. When you complete a story, it just feels like you played a game but skipped levels, and the ending of each story isn&apos;t enough for me to really get excited over playing another 5-7 hour campaign just to have to wait again. Sure some new plot is revealed, but all in all, the pacing just doesn&apos;t work. It would have been better if there was one campaign where you felt like you were actually getting somewhere.
<br>
<br>Some of the things they kept from the previous titles were turned into overused events that did nothing but make you want to turn off your computer. The MILLION of button mashing events will annoy you, and detract from the gameplay a lot. There is also the new inventory system which is annoying to use, and rather small (it is even a step down from RE5) There is also the ability to kick and apply your body more. This is a pretty cool addition, that would have been welcomed in the previous games, but it just isn&apos;t enough to make up for everything.
<br>
<br>There is a lot to say about this game, and if you can look past the annoying gameplay, slow and anti climactic story, and no way of seeing anything new other than a few kicks, than this is the game for you. If you liked RE4 and 5, chances are you will not like this</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3113203">Expand</a></span>

Whether you be a Skyrim with over 15 million copies sold. As a Dead Space 3. It&apos;s all ****
<br>
<br>And I would like people to think that there are people, and not the companies but the designers, engineers, etc. Passed between three and four years developing a game for your squeeze two buttons on the couch in your home. And at least deserve respect. There are also games that are pure crap. But throughout all this evil that seems excessive  this witch hunt. Because the only thing we get is that eventually companies start to think that is not worth more games out. And it is very sad that after getting so much ended.
<br>
<br>A bit of judgment and personality please.
<br>Before you judge, try to investigate and get informed and not be guided by the criterion of a comment in a forum.
<br>
<br>I played all the RE from PS1 to RE6. And people say that because there is nothing RE 1 is that they have criteria with pixelated graphics, to minecraft, dokier errors and system approach shots that were shooting at the head and the bullet was gonna take the ass.
<br>To say nothing of the RE.Code Veronica with the &quot;novelty of the puzzle&quot; in a time where every game with puzzles ranging (Tom Raider, Soul Reaver ...).
<br>
<br>And this game even though people say it&apos;s bad offers a lot of versatility to the game system of each. Want survival? Want to go kill hordes LFD2 type? You have 5 campaigns, extras, unlockable secrets, weapon upgrades, online co-op mode and split screen, stunning graphics, amount of weaponry. The AI &#x200B;&#x200B;of the game will give you more of a headache. And above a script that will keep you on edge from the start, both veterans and rookies.
<br>
<br>But let&apos;s see now may be a Survival as a Left, a DE3, that if you get infinite bullets and god mode, with easy difficulty that half to 3 loads you fart. You may strive Capcom ...
<br>
<br>But it seems that if you do not have the system of Call of Dutty everything is ****
<br>As for my opinion about this saga died when he lost the essence of 3 apartir becoming a Deathmatch without rhyme or reason. But that&apos;s another story.
<br>
<br>The RE6 has innovated a lot compared to other editions.
<br>Have improved targeting system and added coverage.
<br>You can shoot while walking, which in previous games could not. Both the keyboard-mouse game as the game controller (and play with a Logitech RP2) is very elaborate and is silky smooth.
<br>The companion AI is consistent and reacts 90% on time and as you play.
<br>They have added many improvements to the character, from improving targeted to less damage, more items  etc
<br>There are still very many extras on maps, porcierto, immense, for those who like to explore.
<br>Enemies with good AI, flank, cover, looking holes where the group break defense  etc
<br>And so much more but I will not describe here the whole game. Whoever you play it more, and see who brings the same impressions that I have played if previous editions.
<br>
<br>People think that just looks at the graphics, and I say that RE6 not have good graphics, because it does, and more than one PC touch him run (also quite sure) the minimum to play, but, what I use that to my character is ass see smoke when pulling a fart, or oscillation of the hair (hair hair) while walking, or drawing of the fingerprints on the hands, if after 2 days I have the game on the shelf?
<br>Guion and less graphic. Because games as renowned as Dishonored, Hitman, Dead Space 3, DMCry  etc. In 3 days and 3-4 hours playing I finish them. Why? Because of the installation 15GB 10GB are for graphics and so on to the content ..
<br>So in essence asking for more games and less hollywood. Because companies do what people ask for, and to see HD content, I go to the movies, or I see one in my Blueray DVD with a 60 &quot;screen.
<br>
<br>CONCLUSION:
<br>
<br>But all are unique and resident evil with its essence, not by enemies but by the characters in the series, Leo, Chris, Helen, Sherry  etc. These are characters that have a history, if you&apos;ve played previous games, like home already, and have his personality and his half soul.
<br>
<br>Resident Evil is not always true that good games out, I think the worst and all agree, the Racoon City, which took him out for people to take off his overalls while dise&#xF1;avan Resident 6, but it is better to have finger in the ass before sending him to sell but did not remember such Tomb Raider Anniversary? Painkiller, postcard or Call of Duty: Black Ops II
<br>
<br>RE6 has had a very good reception, but people are hurt by the incident in Racoon. And that Capcom knows. And you see, it shows that it has played all the cards in this game. To save the franchise.
<br>But as I say, if you spend the game on easy mode with infinite bullets and put god mode and by mod or cheat No essence of the game that can bring these characters. Why make this game a walk between aisles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3051330">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After 75+ hrs so far finishing 56% of the game im still playing it, only departament its really lacking its the graphics they could add higher resolution patches and fix those 2 broken camera angles in chriss chapter 5, and the cameras in some scenes and chapter other than that pretty solid one of the best RE iv played since 1999.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3072129">Expand</a></span>

But this is unplayable for me, only because of the camera angle and controls, the controls are incredibly awkward with no chance to chance some of the stuff to mouse button keys, thats fine, ill get use to it. But mix these bad controls with a camera that constantly spins this way and that way, jumps from angle to angle.
<br>
<br>Let me give you a example, playing as ada, im runing through the sub, i jump up to kick a enemy, i juck, kick him, the camera switches from one angle to other, now i turn around cause i got a mass following behind him, camera switches around again throwing off what should of been a fluid action. I died as a result of a enemy running up on me and i couldnt quite adjust just right to fire on him.
<br>
<br>I plan on uninstalling it cause the camera jittering coupled with goofy controls only because it gives me a headache, if it wasnt for that id probably suffer through it.
<br>
<br>(just another example, i was trying to figure out how to equip the pipebomb arrows, i assumed it was a secondary ammo, i hit a few of the generic keys, nothing worked, went into the options to look it up, i saw a command that sounded like it would do just what i was after, so i hit G, it only switched from sub machine gun to crossbow.....i still have no idea how to switch ammos out).
<br>
<br>Just to show you where im coming from, im not a cowadooty kid, i stopped when it lost its way after united offense.
<br>
<br>Games a easy 8/10, but with my issues id throw it as a 5 or 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3049667">Expand</a></span>

It does many things fairly well, the zombies look and act like zombies. The lighting and atmosphere are dark and oppressive.  Then come the &quot;escort quests&quot;, in the prologue and first chapter alone there are 2 escort quests.  But I could have dealt with that.  The graphics aren&apos;t to bad, though I was saddened at the lack of effort on certain textures (i&apos;m looking at you papers that are omnipresent and grainy).  But I could have dealt with that to.  The camera controls just somehow don&apos;t feel right giving the character a feeling of being perpetually dizzy when aiming.  But that again I could have dealt with.  The default keyboard and mouse control scheme is horrific (Z S D X for movement? really?) but that can be rebound without to much of a hassle. The clincher for me is the quick time events.  They are legion, without fail every time that I was grappled by a zombie (which was often since i&apos;m not particularly good at RE games) there were 1-2 (yes 2) quick time events(QTE) to get the zombie off and that I can not deal with.  I appreciate the cinematic qualities of a QTE and they have their place in games, such as the end of a major boss fight, but not every single flipping time a zombie gets close.  For me that just comes across as busywork and a lack of creativity on the part of the developers.  I would rather play a game where if I so much as get touched by a zombie I die than have QTE&apos;s constantly bombarding me.
<br>
<br>The sound the sound quality is pretty nice as are some of the atmospheric animations (like the character wincing at a surprise lighting crack outside).  Sadly however the game is nigh unplayable for me due to the depth of my hatred of the terrible practice that is QTE&apos;s they ruin any possibility of fun for me they occur with such regularity.
<br>
<br>If QTE&apos;s and a slightly wonky control scheme don&apos;t bug you you&apos;ll probably have a really good time with the game the atmosphere is by far the best in the business.  If however either of those things is a deal-breaker for you then save your money and pick up Left for Dead 2 if you don&apos;t already have it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3069633">Expand</a></span>

<br>Whatever. This will help improve the game&apos;s camera angle.
<br>
<br>And also here&apos;s the skills you have to purchase to help beat the game, but it&apos;s up to you cause this is how I play it: Melee, Firearm and Increase item drop. Max up those two and you will be the ultimate badass. If you play offline or with an ai partner, it&apos;s important to buy the first aid skill, where your partner will always heal you after you are in last stand mode. Again, leveling that thing up will increase the chances of survival.
<br>
<br>Lastly each characters are separated into different timelines, so Leon&apos;s first campaign will take place 6 months after Jake&apos;s campaign and so on, so I&apos;ll give out the recommended chapters for you guys so the story will connect well: Start with Chris&apos;s chapter 1 till 2, then Jump to Jake&apos;s chapter 1 till 2. Afterwards it&apos;s up to you if you want to start Leon&apos;s chapter first or continue either with Chris or Jake. Not Ada&apos;s campaign though, that one&apos;s after the other 3 is completed. Now onto the game.
<br>
<br>Suffice to say i see people just mocking the game by giving it a low score, but that&apos;s an utterly unfair and completely biased review of the game as it offers so much. I mean sure if you&apos;ll hate it if you love RE so much that you want it to return to horror form, but there&apos;s already RE Revelations released in the same year 8 months before it to compensate for the lack of horror, and there&apos;s it&apos;s going to be released in May 2013 in consoles. So why not just treat RE6 as it&apos;s own game instead of what you want it to be? Don&apos;t be biased and don&apos;t be a dick about it, especially the spammers who gives the game a 0 and 1.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t get the other reviewers who just put 1 score for the entire game. There&apos;s 4 campaigns in total and each are different in style with a total of 25 to 30 hours to complete once. This is a great deal of a game where every campaign is like it&apos;s own game. So I will review the game accordingly with each campaign and I will include the average length of the game with a description of how it plays out, and also the qte in the game so you people can watch out during each.
<br>
<br>Leon: 8-10 hours and it feels a lot like RE2. QTEs in chapter 1, 3-5 but it&apos;s just easy button press of spacebar or a if you&apos;re using the xbox controller. The fourth mission has one that&apos;s super quick after a very scary &quot;run as fast as you can&quot; scenario with one of the most disgusting monsters in RE, so watch out. Overall Leon&apos;s campaign is 90.
<br>
<br>Chris: 5-6 hours and it feels like either Gears of War or RE5 with a badass twist in the end. Though it is generic, if you play RE5 you will feel right at home. Surprisingly there&apos;s no QTE in this campaign but it&apos;s replaced with slow motion shootouts, except if you count the hanging from a ledge minigame in the first mission as QTE but that&apos;s it. Overall it&apos;s 75.
<br>
<br>Jake: 5-6 hours and it feels like Uncharted RE3 with that Ustanak. The final boss is so awesome I pump my fist to the air and clap because it&apos;s so satisfying. Beware though, there&apos;s a super quick QTE in chapter 1 in the end, qte&apos;s in chapter 2 and 5. Chapter 3 is one of my favorite part of the whole game because it&apos;s straight up beat em up with a bunch of enemies in the first minute of the mission. Overall it&apos;s 85.
<br>
<br>Ada: 3-4 hours. This campaign is normally unlocked after you finish the game with the 3 other characters, but now it&apos;s unlocked immediately. I recommend playing this campaign the last. This campaign is like her campaign in RE4 in that it intersects with the other characters...... except this time if you play during a campaign where you intersect with someone else, for example Jake or Leon, you&apos;ll be able to jump into a human player and help them. It&apos;s awesome. Unfortunately there&apos;s one annoying QTE section in Chapter 3 where you have to do 4 QTE&apos;s at once or else you will die. Overall it&apos;s 80.
<br>
<br>There you go, my review of the game. It&apos;s an awesome game to be had and a great deal, considering you get 30 hours the other extra modes like mercenaries and agent hunt mode where you play as the enemy to kill other human players in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3051040">Expand</a></span>

Then again I have no idea how does it feel to play it alone it was obviously made for co-op. It has a certain atmosphere I think (certain campaigns a lot more horrorish at least at start), but generally it&apos;s an action game with Michael Bay explosions everywhere. The plotline is enjoyable the multi layered interliked campaigns are all a plus. However sometimes the story is just plain STUPID.  As a little spoiler: I don&apos;t know how on EARTH can a guy who survived SEVERAL zombie apocalypse already can think of getting into an elevator with TWO obviously infected person is a good idea. Even at the end he doesn&apos;t put a bullet into the head like he should. These and small stupid obvious plot holes try to ruin the fun a bit time to time. Another mixed thing is the graphics. Some thing looks absolutely stunning (like the main character&apos;s texture, the lighting and the shadows sometimes), while others look downright HORRENDOUS (pixelated objects mainly). I personally don&apos;t have issues with the QTEs. They are better than in RE5 anyway. On a completely personal note I kinda miss Sheva. Heck maybe Jill too. Anyway since it still has a plethora of recurring characters it&apos;s not that bad. All in all for some weird reason it is a very entertaining game if you have someone to play with. Also it isn&apos;t overpriced at all so I kind of hope they will keep making more in the future. Just maybe try to tune up the weak points a bit...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3050777">Expand</a></span>

Capcom delivered excellently! If you didn&apos;t like RE6 on console, you probably won&apos;t like it on PC, but If you liked it on console, you&apos;ll really like it on PC. 60 fps and HD resolution is a no-brainer to have! HD is a must for local co-op. The kbm controls work pretty well, snappy response even with vsync. One gripe I have is the misleading brightness adjust screen. The &quot;6&quot; is visible on any level and it&apos;s pointless to play without it cranked up to at least 35 cause it&apos;s too dark in most places. The lights become washed out at that level but it&apos;s worth it to see everything. RE6/Bio6 is a great addition to the series, but 4 is still my all-time favorite. The inventory and merchant was a genius idea in 4 and I wish one of them will make a return in a later game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3084023">Expand</a></span>

<br>Chris  Like CALL OF DUTY  BIO-WARFARE. If you like RE 5, you might also like this campaign.
<br>Jake  RE3  Nemesis  RE 4. Because the chaser &apos;Ustanak&apos; constantly chase you (like RE 3), it scare you...
<br>Ada  Classic RE meets sneaking. It&apos;s like Separate Ways in RE4.

<br>Especially I like Leon and Ada campaign most. Those are true RESIDENT EVIL, i think!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171716">Expand</a></span>

Combat. The first problem I had with this game was that the identity of the combat was lost to me. Is it a shooter? Is it a brawler? If they focused on one aspect I think it would have been much more successful. In the old games, melee combat was a last resort option and it worked very well. Range combat feels so weak in this game. You can empty an entire mag into a zombies head and they still do not go down. Reading a faq, it seems you need to melee the zombie to death, using a combination of stuns and melee finishers. Would be ok, but the camera does not give a good overview, no room to maneuver, low stamina and low health, which result in too many deaths.  It almost feel as if they looked at a number of successful games and wanted to implement a mix of all these COD/Batman/Darksouls/Random fighter game. In the end they fail and create a very unrewarding combat system. I cringed every time Leon did a wrestlers slam with a zombie. If you are going for melee combat, at least but more melee weapons in the game, like a baseball bat, axe, crowbar. Hell the zombies have them, why not the player? Oh and inventory is a horrible console port. The controls are all over the place.
<br>
<br>Helena. Talk about an over sexualized design, she just looks like a blow up doll with glossy lips. I get it, sex sells and this game is probably for younger players. For me it backfires and it&#x2019;s very off putting.  She just doesn&#x2019;t feel real. Even the nuns in Hitman absolution feel more real than this poor excuse for a heroin. Japan, please go back to the 80/90 and bring back those heroines, they were bad ass. But I guess this is an East vs West thing, they just see women as sex objects after all. I love new outfits for characters. I when through linking hell to check out the previews and my worst fears were confirmed. I just face palmed. School girl outfit? Stripper cop outfit? Really? I much rather have seen a combat/commando outfit. Again very off putting.
<br>
<br>Story. This will probably appeal to the younger players among us, lots of flash and boom. I also started Chris&#x2019;s campaign and after seeing the intro, I just stopped. It&#x2019;s been used to death in many movies. Pretty cut scenes don&#x2019;t make a game and they also don&#x2019;t make a movie. A  movie is more than action scene paste together.  The game also conviently kills off NPC&#x2019;s you save so they don&#x2019;t need to be factored into the rest of the story, this shows a lack of skill and inability to create a rounded story. In short, they tried too much and failed at the basics, A for effort, but this one is a 4 out of 10. If I can&#x2019;t even get through the campaigns why do the extra stuff? Japanese Devs really need to see women in a better light. Come on, we are in 2013 and I keep asking myself why there thinking is still so backwards. And as a result the final score becomes 2 out of 10.
<br>
<br>Result in the long term for me, I bought this game because I liked the previous games, I looked at the reviews and didn&#x2019;t believe them, I&#x2019;ll know better in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-6/user-reviews?user_review_id=3083269">Expand</a></span>
