                                        <span>An extremely nostalgic third person shooter with robots. And its not bad either. The firefights are fun, the weapons are easily recognisable after a few plays, and it feels well made. Compared to past Transformers games, I would give it a 10. However, its not THE BEST third person shooter out there so it ultimately gets an 8 from me.</span>

I only got into Transformers like many today because I enjoyed the movies, and so I decided to pick up War for Cybertron and give it a try. After playing through it and seeing everything it had to offer, I can wholeheartedly say that this game made me wish I would have been a Transformers fan all my life. The story telling in this game is absolutely fantastic, and really includes some nostalgic moments such as how Optimus and Bumblebee met during the war. The voice acting is very well done, anchored by none other than Peter Cullen himself as Optimus Prime. Gameplay wise, the game feels incredibly fluid and works well as a third person shooter. The transformations are great, and I really like how High Moon Studios made fighting in both transformer and vehicle mode viable. Multiplayer plays well, but it is unfortunate that not enough people are still online so the only game mode really available is death match. Escalation mode is a nice addition and plays very similar to Call of Duty&apos;s zombie mode, but it&apos;s anything majorly noteworthy. All in all, not only is this a terrific Transformers game, it is a terrific shooter game all in it&apos;s own. Hardcore Transformers fans should not miss this by any means, and even if you are not a Transformers fan (as I wasn&apos;t really), it may be time to pick this game up and see what the robots in disguise are truly all about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-war-for-cybertron/user-reviews?user_review_id=1955802">Expand</a></span>

The multilayer is addictive but sadly ended when the big shot games came out right after it like black ops and halo reach. If it wasn&apos;t for those games the multilayer would be full right now but overall the game is amazing and the plot is excellent</span>

My only real complaint was that we finished it far too quickly, I wanted there to be more. The player-versus-player element wasn&apos;t bad, wasn&apos;t fantastic, but PVP has never been my thing. As co-op players we could protect each other, work together, and generally maximize our fun together, and that&apos;s really all I ask for in a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-war-for-cybertron/user-reviews?user_review_id=2079930">Expand</a></span>

<br>While I was expecting a very bad game support or simply using the word &quot;Transformers&quot; to sell, I found a nice game, well thought out, with good playability and an eyeful !
<br>The best &quot;Transformers&quot; game ever, I give 10/10 rating encourage publishers to get out as good games, but I give him good 8 or 9/10 in reality.
<br>You can buy with your eyes closed !</span>

Yes it is locked at 30 fps but it is both fast  paced and smooth. It also feels very much like a console game but that just means you can get into straight away rather than gradually realising how good it is. In feel it is similar to Gears of War although not quite as polished. There is no snap to cover like there is in Gears of War, instead you simply hide behind rubble or bits of debris. On the other hand Marcus Fenix cannot cannot transform into a car nor fly about and I always thought the vehicle levels in Gears were a bit of an afterthought and didn&apos;t really add much to the game. Conversely transorming is an integral tactical option when playing War for Cybertron and great fun too. The game itself i reasonably long with 10 levels each taking about an hour. The game is full of nice touches like the affore mentioned tranformations,  the voice of Optimus Prime and various references to the 80s cartoons and movie and thankfully it is free of any reference to the live action movies. A special mention for the boss battles which are a lot of fun. They can be agonisingly long but there are much appreciated checkpoints along the way. Overall the game is really good. It does leaving you wanting a bit more, the jet levels in particular are massive fun but there are only two of them. Hopefully it will be a success and they can make another one which addresses this and adds a little more polish. It is by miles the best Transformers game ever made and, credit where it is due, a very good action shooter in its own right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-war-for-cybertron/user-reviews?user_review_id=1394712">Expand</a></span>

Single player looks good, but the graphics are outdated and you&apos;ll be annoyed to know in the campaign I didn&apos;t see a way to keep Optimus Primes melee weapon out. Because it does so much more damage, instead he swings it once and spends half a second putting it away- while you&apos;re getting shot. For games overall it&apos;s not good, for Transformers games- apparently- it&apos;s the best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-war-for-cybertron/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769036">Expand</a></span>

While I can say I&apos;ve gotten $5 worth out of the game, I would be remiss in pointing out the inherent problems. As others have mentioned, it&apos;s really just a typical third person shooter (think Gears of War) with a Transformers wrapping. The great part for aging Transformers fans of the 80&apos;s (like myself) is the voice over work and the fact that several of the original actors are back and reprising their roles. At the end of the day, though, it&apos;s just a generic third person shooter that plays almost identically to Gears of War with heavily scripted events and linear level design. The PC version is clearly a shoddy console port, with a hard lock of 30 FPS, a poorly designed keyboard and mouse control scheme, and lackluster textures, even with the game set to high. Sure it runs smooth but a modern system would be able to run it smooth without the need to have a hard frame lock (I mean seriously, why even offer a vsync option in graphics options if the game locks itself at half of the typically minimum 60Hz rate anyway?). It&apos;s clear the game was designed for controller play, and the PC version supports controller play but has cut out any mention of the controller in either the tutorials or in the settings  leaving users mashing buttons or seeking out the user manuals for the console versions online. All told, I don&apos;t regret spending $5 on it, but it&apos;s an ultimately forgettable experience. Good characters, lackluster story, bad console port, and generic gameplay make for a game doesn&apos;t really leave me wanting more and also serves as an example of everything wrong with the way many developers perceive the PC platform.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-war-for-cybertron/user-reviews?user_review_id=3032660">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a lot of detail packed into those textures and the character designs are fantastic.  --- Sound: 6 ---  It&apos;s top notch quality sound but the character comments get old and the background noise can often drown out the conversations between characters.  --- Game Design: 8 --- It&apos;s a shooter but you can turn into cars and jets and stuff.  The levels are well-made but too linear.  More importantly, there is variation in the game as you get to play through many different Autobots and Decepticons.  The jet levels are my favorite.  ---  Fun Factor: 10 --- The fun factor is Optim(us)al.  Take the most fun action-packed tight-quarter levels from Halo and give me the ability to turn into vehicles and I will give you a 10 9 times out of 10.  It&apos;s awesome! --- Overall: 8 --- Play this game.  Even though I rated it an 8, it&apos;s a must buy.  Especially considering the low $15 price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-war-for-cybertron/user-reviews?user_review_id=2877560">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>BAD: I am very disappointed. This is the first Transformers game I have ever played. I tried single player decepticon campaign to see what is going on, but for me it is boring: grey colors everywhere, the transformation is not spectacular, gameplay is just go kill, go kill, open the next door, kill etc. nothing special. You cannot see opponents vitality. GOOD: Unreal engine, fast.</span>

But War for Cybertron is one of the rare examples of such: An amazingly fun third-person shooter/vehicular combat hybrid that is enriched by it&apos;s setting rather then hindered by it. Setting the game on Cybertron itself, millions of years before the Transformers took their war to Earth, was a stroke of genius (as was setting the Decepticon campaign before the Autobot one: villains act, heroes react)- there are no annoying kid sidekicks or shallow love interests here. This is pure metal action, with an impressive array of iconic characters and weapons, re-imagined in their native Cybertronian forms. War for Cybertron does an amazing job of portraying the brutality of the Cybertronian wars, and making the planet and it&apos;s inhabitants feel truly alive- constantly shifting parts and glowing energy lines pervade the art style. Make of the Michael Bay films what you will- in my mind, THIS is Transformers for a new age.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-war-for-cybertron/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507930">Expand</a></span>
