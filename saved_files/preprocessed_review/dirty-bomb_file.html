<br>
<br>Very fast paced and objective based, making teamwork key to win. At first, you might find it hard to get used to the fast movements, but after some hours of playing you will be interested into keep playing it.
<br>
<br>Some aspects can be improved, but we need to take into account that the game is still in Open Beta.</span>

                                        <span>Dirty bomb is a great shooter game, because of it&apos;s  fast-paced gameplay and bright, colorful graphics. It&apos;s somewhat similar to Counter Strike, a lot like Call of Duty, but don&apos;t worry - it&apos;s not just another generic FPS game you&apos;ll play for 20 minutes and forget forever.
<br>Plus, the f2p system in the game works perfectly fine - yes, you have item cases you can buy, but they are 100% free to open.</span>

Lucky for you Wolf ET fans out there, it&apos;s also made by the same team! I will note that Dirty Bomb is aimed at a more casual crowd, but it&apos;s still the closest game you&apos;re going to get in the current market that matches the gameplay of Wolf ET. While the game would have been better off buy to play, the free to play monetization is very fair and easy to utilize to your advantage. Within a few matches of play, you&apos;re given enough credits to purchase any merc (character) in the game. You also have the option of buying any loadout (weapons and perks) in the game as well. So within a day of playing, you&apos;re going to have exactly what you want and I think that&apos;s pretty dang fair. A common misconception as seen with negative reviews is that loadout rarity somehow translates to better weapons and stats. That is not true at all. In reality, all loadout rarities feature the same weapons with the same perks and the same stats. The only difference being the number of perks (maximum of 3, which caps at bronze tier) and your character / weapon skin. But really, with the game being free to play, what are you doing here, reading my review? Go out and give it a try on Steam!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5352452">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Objective based gameplay similar to Wolfenstein Enemy Territory and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.  Player movement is very fast, wall jumping is a thing, and head shots are almost a necessity.  It&apos;s not a game like Call of Duty that you can pick up easily shoot first and always win.  Skill is involved, believe it or not, and it takes some getting used to for people who are only familiar with modern shooters.  The game is still in beta so new characters are still being worked into the game.  That also means there are some balance issues that have to get worked out.
<br>
<br>Characters fill specific roles from medic to support to front line fighters to objective specialists.  There are multiple choices for each role.  Loadouts are determined by character cards that have up to 3 perks.  Perk and weapon choice fall to random chance, unfortunately, but you can use in game cash to buy specific ones you want.  You can also trade up cards to a higher tier that has all three.  Bronze tier fills all 3 perk slots and all higher tiers (silver, gold, cobalt, obsidian) are simply cosmetic differences.  People who are saying you have to fork out a bunch of cash to be competitive are full of it.  You can be competitive through just a few hours of play without spending any real money.
<br>
<br>The maps so far are really well designed but there are very few.  Can&apos;t wait to see more.  Also can&apos;t wait to see the new strategies new characters will introduce.
<br>
<br>All in all, shaping up to be a well rounded competitive shooter with a fair business model.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5378981">Expand</a></span>

Although it&apos;s very grindy, there is enough diversity avaible right now through plenty of different mercs and things to do in-game (repairing or  destroying objectives as an engineer class, supporting and reviving teammates as an medic class, going on a killing spree as any aggressive class). Also there&apos;s new content constantly being released like new mercs and the Execution gamemode. (Counter-Strike style) The other gamemode is objective-driven and needs one team to repair and escort an armored vehicle for example, while the other trys to stop them at any cost.
<br>
<br>In contrast to other F2P titles it&apos;s not P2W in the slightest and balance is always worked on and gets improved as far as I&apos;ve noticed. Only downsides are, as I&apos;ve already stated, a rather grindy nature and a questionable business model. Boosters are fine since they only count down if you play, but their effectiveness is minimal. Also 10 bucks for one merc is rather pricey too and then there&apos;s the gambling.
<br>
<br>Your merc&apos;s equipment comes on randomized loadout cards which you can get in cases you earn every 3rd match. The highest rarities are bronze, silver, gold and cobalt. And even despite just offering just cosmetic advantages starting at bronze, there&apos;s no way to guarantee that you&apos;ll ever get one anytime soon. Even if spending money on Elite Cases, since it&apos;s completely random and the drop chances are small.
<br>
<br>In the end gambling always just turns out to be very unfair for quite a lot of paying costumers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5404212">Expand</a></span>

<br>Commen&#xE7;ons par la haine. Dirty Bomb, c&#x2019;est Wolfenstein : Enemy Territory sans les nazis. C&#x2019;est Quake Wars sans les v&#xE9;hicules. C&#x2019;est Brink sans le parkour. C&#x2019;est un jeu Splash Damage d&#xE9;pouill&#xE9; de tous ses artifices. Difficile de faire plus g&#xE9;n&#xE9;rique comme ambiance : on ne sait pas trop &#xE0; quelle &#xE9;poque se d&#xE9;roule l&#x2019;action, qui sont ses bellig&#xE9;rants et pourquoi ils ont choisi de s&#x2019;entre-tuer&#x2026; Et &#xE0; vrai dire, on s&#x2019;en fiche, ce qui est fort dommage.
<br>
<br>L&#x2019;autre point qui risque de vous rebuter est li&#xE9; aux armes. Entre l&#x2019;absence de recul et les sons qui manquent de p&#xE8;che, vous pourriez avoir l&#x2019;impression de tirer avec des pistolets &#xE0; billes. Si ce sont des choix justifiables pour le gameplay, &#xE7;a n&#x2019;en est pas moins pr&#xE9;judiciable pour l&#x2019;impression de puissance que recherche l&#x2019;amateur de simulateurs de meurtres en qu&#xEA;te d&#x2019;un exutoire.
<br>
<br>Enfin, vous risquez d&#x2019;&#xEA;tre perdu parmi la foule d&#x2019;informations &#xE0; analyser au cours de vos premi&#xE8;res parties : entre les air strikes qui vous tombent sur la tronche, l&#x2019;objectif secondaire qui clignote sur le HUD, le mec qui vous demande des munitions et les deux jauges de vos facult&#xE9;s sp&#xE9;ciales &#xE0; surveiller, &#xE7;a fait beaucoup d&#x2019;info &#xE0; appr&#xE9;hender alors que l&#x2019;action se d&#xE9;roule &#xE0; cent &#xE0; l&#x2019;heure.
<br>
<br>Et si cela n&#x2019;a pas suffi &#xE0; vous rebuter, il y a &#xE9;galement le mod&#xE8;le &#xE9;conomique qui demande de jouer de nombreuses heures pour d&#xE9;bloquer les classes et les facult&#xE9;s qui vous permettront de jouer &#xE0; armes &#xE9;gales avec les autres joueurs.
<br>
<br>Et &#xE0; pr&#xE9;sent un peu d&#x2019;amour. Bien s&#xFB;r, il y a le gameplay rapide, skill&#xE9;, riche et n&#xE9;cessitant du teamplay, mais ce n&#x2019;est pas tout. Le mod&#xE8;le free to play est souvent critiqu&#xE9;, mais il n&#x2019;a pas que des inconv&#xE9;nients. En effet, le jeu n&#x2019;est plus assimilable &#xE0; un produit fini, mais &#xE0; un service en constante &#xE9;volution.
<br>
<br>Vous vous souvenez de Brink ? Il y a de nombreuses hypoth&#xE8;ses sur les causes de son &#xE9;chec, mais il est certain que l&#x2019;&#xE9;tat dans lequel il est sorti et la fa&#xE7;on dont il (n&#x2019;)a (pas) &#xE9;volu&#xE9; y sont pour beaucoup. Il est peu probable que Dirty Bomb suive la m&#xEA;me voie. D&#x2019;une part parce qu&#x2019;il est &#xAB; sorti &#xBB; il y a d&#xE9;j&#xE0; un an et demi et que de nombreux b&#xEA;ta testeurs ont fait les frais du manque de stabilit&#xE9; et des pi&#xE8;tres performances des premi&#xE8;res versions. Et d&#x2019;autre part, parce que sa rentabilit&#xE9; sera directement li&#xE9;e au nombre de joueurs ce qui fait que Splash Damage s&#x2019;appliquera &#xE0; am&#xE9;liorer le jeu tout au long de sa vie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5367163">Expand</a></span>

The result of this concoction is a very fun and fresh tactical team shooter. The biggest complaint for many is the progression system, which has the uninformed shouting p2w, but under the surface it is hardly unfair. For reference, you can buy any of the most competitive loadouts for any character for free in just about 2 days of earning in-game credits. Actual rating is 9, but 10 to offset the uninformed low ratings.

<br>Summary:
<br>Extremely good shooter similar to old days where the game requires skills. By skills I mean real fps skills and clear head for map awarness, objective focused gameplay in competitive mode.
<br>p2w?: No, default weapons are extremely competitive. RNG can tick off some people, but I am sort of fine with it.
<br>Play to Grind? : yes to some extent. If you have hours of free time each day to play this game, the progression is very reasonable. However, if you dont, then don&apos;t expect to play this game for free.
<br>Cash shop rip off?: the price is reasonable, you can get the full time with maximum $50 and minimal play time
<br>
<br>Very good fast paste twitch shooter. If you are struggling in cod or bf, don&apos;t touch this game. You will be eaten alive, mostly by me. This game is a extremely good at what it does which is objective based fps, by objective I don&apos;t mean let&apos;s throw 5 flags on a flat map and call it objectives. But compared to WolfenStein Enemy Territory, this game is a step down in objective game play department. But it is ok, ET had all the wrecky and complicated objectives no other shooters to date has replicated EVER.
<br>
<br>Now the bad:
<br>1) graphics is a little out of date, and there&apos;s some werid art styles Im not extremely comfortable with. Minus .5
<br>2): cash shop price is a little redonculars for each character (though none of them is OP). But if purchased with a bundle it&apos;s cool. For those who has spare $s for a refresh of the old days good fps this game is for you. But if you want to play this game completely for free? Unless you got time, don&apos;t. -0.5</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5355661">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game itself is really fast paced. You can basically parkour through the map to reach certain spots quickly and easily. Furthermore the guns really feel good and the abilities that the mercenaries offer really feel balanced and they update the game quite alot with balance changes if needed. They really listen to their playerbase and i hope they will continue doing this later on.
<br>My score for the game is a 9 because i think it&apos;s a good Fast paced shooter that some people were really trying to find out there in the F2P genre. Give it a try i&apos;m sure you&apos;ll like it .
<br>
<br>@PetriK93 Have you even played the game before writing your crappy review? Also this AngryJoe is totally wrong because this game is NOT pay2win. You can get everything without spending a dime. It doesn&apos;t even take long to get whatever you need really.
<br>
<br>@Davidkimyy Cobalt and Gold Cards are just for cosmetic purposes they have the excact same stats as Bronze cards which are freaking easy to get your hands on. Thanks for giving this game a 1 u weird prick. get your **** straight
<br>
<br>Anyone giving this game a score lower than 6 must have something stuck up their tiny brains.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5352177">Expand</a></span>

The best (non-cosmetic) cards for each merc can be bought for 17.5k credits, so that can be done in just a few days of playing and doing quests.

<br>
<br>Dirty Bomb is one of the best FPS games I&apos;ve played so far this year. It is fast paced, objective focused and is only won by playing as a team and choosing the right mercs. Mercs are different kind of characters with their own weapon sets and abilities that can help the team with ammo, healing, repairing etc.
<br>
<br>The game is using a loadout card system which works perfectly fine and can be bought with in-game currency. You can buy boosters if you want and also Silver, Gold and Cobalt cards (which are only cosmetic and do not give you benefits against players) with real money, everything else can be bought with in-game currency and are not hard to get if you enjoy the game and play it a lot. You can also trade up low cards to get a card of higher rank, so in the end you don&apos;t even need money to get the cards I mentioned!
<br>
<br>Do not get scared by people saying some mercs are OP, because they are all OP in their own way. Some could need some tweaking but overall the game is quite balanced. After all, it all depends on how well you play with a merc.
<br>
<br>This is a game for you who love FPS games that are focused on skill and good team play. There is even competitive matches if you&apos;d like to take it more serious.
<br>
<br>The game is still a Beta build and runs like a dream, the graphics are more than good enough for a free game and so far I&apos;ve never noticed any lag. Just make sure to choose a server withing your region. I&apos;ve never met any hackers either, not sure why some reviews complain about that.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d say you should download and give it a try. It is in my opinion a game that is enjoyable for anyone who like fast paced shooters.
<br>
<br>Have fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5376599">Expand</a></span>

Keep in mind, Open beta release was in june 2015! So this is not really a review, since the game can&apos;t be considered finished! It is more like a point record of what can be expected, when you dive into the game atm.
<br>
<br>This is the best F2P Shooter I have come across. Dirty Bomb can even compete to a certain degree with AAA Titles. After years of CoD, Battlefield and CSGO dominating the market, it brings fresh wind into the game! If you ever played Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Dirty Bomb is as close as it gets!
<br>
<br>First about the F2P model. Every player can choose between buying mercs with real money or ingame credits. Everything obtainable in the game, can be fully bought with ingame credits. Of course this involves quite a time grinding, but this way you can plan step by step which merc you want to unlock more. You can fulfill missions for extra credits. Double XP/Credits events are also there, to make it faster.
<br>Also skins can be bought with credits, unlike in other F2P games.
<br>
<br>The booster in the game is atm not worth buying. I recommend only to play the game, unless you want to spend 10 euros on one character. But Skins does not cost additional credits/money because they are included in loadout cards. Unfortunately 10 euro for a new merc is a little bit expensive but this is not a problem of Dirty Bomb, rather more a problem of the F2P Model game industry standards. All F2P games have horrendous prices, e.g. LoL 1 Skin for 5-20 euros! A new hero costs slightly over 7 euros/dollars.
<br>
<br>The loadout card system is something new and can get you in some collecting fever. For every merc there are loadout cards, each with different weapons and combinations of augments (perks). Every can can be uptraded, so you won&apos;t keep the low tier cards for long.
<br>
<br>Perks in this game are not that important, you have a good chance even without them. They are only the cherry of the ice cup. But still there is some variety and every merc can have different ones.
<br>
<br>They are 5 Maps and 12 Mercs available, each with their own abilities. There are different ways of supplying ammo and health, airstrikes etc. There is more content to come, open beta was just released.
<br>
<br>For the competitive hearted offers Dirty Bomb 5v5 Matchmaking and it&apos;s own ELO inspired ranking system.
<br>Ingame team voice (can be muted) and Spectator mode is also featured.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is solid, smooth; Movement feels good and authentic. Gunplay is very simplistic but challenging. There are Iron sights in the game but only for the kids. Old school hipfire is the best way to play the game. Graphic lies over F2P Shooter average  and the brink-esque art style adds to the setting.
<br>
<br>Dirty Bomb is the best Shooter alternative for the mainstream annual released franchises!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5319970">Expand</a></span>

If you enjoy team based combat and playing a role in your fireteam then this game is for you. Lets clear the air on a few things that the critic reviews and a couple of user reviews completely missed the mark on. First of this is NOT pay to win and the game did a great job of making this the goal. You CAN pay to unlock loadouts or new mercs if you are a lazy gamer who appreciates immediate gratification over earned saltiness, HOWEVER , you can earn every last item in the game by playing/performing well/completing assignments. The users and critics blasting this as pay to win are abusing their status/opinions. Above the bronze level (pretty easy to achieve) the only difference is cosmetic and offers NO damage or ability boost whatsoever so this is NOT in any form pay to win. That said user PetriK93 last logged into steam in 2012 , not surprising that his review simply references a youtube video and offers nothing but a 0 score for a game (s)he has likely never even played. Game is free is and still in beta , come join the fun I doubt you will be disappointed!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5337623">Expand</a></span>

Taking youtubers like angryjoe for granted is like injecting yourself with HIV. Idiots like him and his subscribers wants to get everything in 50 mins of gameplay. Lemme tell you, i havent spent even a $ on this game but i love the game. The best part is that nothing is lockedout from a f2p player, you can literally get anything on this game as long as you PLAY for it. All the items in the game are balanced, except the match making, which will always be unbalanced since new players or lower/higher skill are joining everyday.
<br>
<br>Just a note for any other readers, &apos;Please dont take review from idiots for granted&apos; half of em dunno what the heck they are even talking about... Game is PERFECTLY FREE 2 PLAY and nothing is lockedout from a normal f2p player.. And in the end, thats the only thing that matters !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5352467">Expand</a></span>

A little bare-bones at the moment, with only 5 maps and 2 game modes, but I assume that loads of new content will be added by the time the game is done with open beta and becomes a full-fledged FPS. It doesn&apos;t bring a whole lot of new things to the table, but I can forgive that because it takes what&apos;s already been used and makes it damn good. It is definitely not p2w, because you can obtain everything there is to get in the game without paying a penny. This will surely take a long time to accomplish, so for those that aren&apos;t so patient, there is the option to purchase credit boosters to help you get to the good stuff faster. I was glad to see that the option to pay money is not shoved in your face; the game never nags you to buy something, the option just sits off to the side in case you want to make a purchase. Out of the 100 hours that I&apos;ve played, I&apos;ve maybe seen 2 blatant hackers at the most, so no, the game is not overrun with hackers. And if it is, well, I never noticed. All in all, there&apos;s tons of fun to be had with this game just in beta alone, and I am very excited to see what the devs have in store for us down the road.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5372730">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>An important point to make is that some reviewers say it&apos;s pay2win, this is simply not true. It&apos;s actually pretty well balanced and the guns you can get at the start are not much different from &apos;buyable&apos; loadouts.
<br>
<br>TL:DR
<br>+
<br>Class-based system(need to work together)
<br>Hitboxes/gunplay --&gt; feels very smooth
<br>Maps: Balanced and competitive
<br>Need Skill(No random spraying etc)
<br>
<br>-
<br>Mercs are a tad expensive
<br>
<br>Sometimes teams are very unbalanced(not much you can do about), which results in a walk-over. Well, it happens and you have to accept it, use it as target practice and just hope to win your next game. This does not mean it&apos;s pay2win, but like Enemy Territory you can gain momentum and suddenly it&apos;s a blitzkrieg walkover
<br>
<br>A little bit more diversity in maps would be great, currently there are only 5 but I&apos;d love to see a bigger open map.
<br>
<br>Everything should be buyable with the ingame coins you can gain(currently only MERCS / Basic crates).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5376347">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics: Weak textures here, and there. Several graphical bugs, but nothing bad for a Beta. Overall looks clean.
<br>
<br>Audio: Some of the best audio design, with distant fire making you feel, well.......distant. Amazing non-deceitful surround sound. Impact sound from bullets feels impactful. Competitive worthy, that&apos;s for sure.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: Great gunplay, hit registration isn&apos;t the best, but strangely I found open cases, and collecting/trading cards was funner, and it felt like a whole new game within a game. Others may not feel this way. It&apos;s definitely not pay2win, but I still don&apos;t why devs don&apos;t just make it all cosmetic, it just makes MUCH more sense that way.
<br>
<br>Fun factor: To me this is all that matters, but it definitely varies, and depends on your favored play-style.
<br>It is a SOLID 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5295619">Expand</a></span>

If you were to personally ask me what P2W is, I&apos;d say, &quot;Games with weapons or unlockables (Generally ones that give you an advantage or are just overpowered) not obtainable through playing the game for free, instead using real world money to unlock it.&quot;
<br>
<br>How this game works is entirely different, you get loadout cards, now while you might think, &quot;Oh, well that must mean that everything Silver and Gold is better than things that are Bronze.&quot; This is not correct, every
<br>
<br>Now with these loadout cards, you also get different weapons. These weapons on the loadout cards will change how you play your character. By default you have good loadouts, you can destroy anybody with the basic loadouts so long as you can aim, your guns make you, not your perks. You can get a different gun for every rarity of loadout, even the worst rarities come with guns that can change how you play by a lot, but for the most part all the guns are relatively balanced.
<br>
<br>The crafting system is next and it&apos;s pretty simple, put in cards you don&apos;t like of the same rarity and get the next loadout rarity up, you also select any of the characters that you want a loadout specifically for. Essentially trade up contracts in CS:GO. Pretty easy to understand, gives you another chance at randomizing and it&apos;s a way of letting you get loadouts that are Silver and higher without the RNG chance, however the weapons and perks are randomized each time.
<br>With that being said, if you find that you can&apos;t be bothered to open up cases for 1000 ingame credits, you can simply save up enough to just buy a bronze loadout that you like.
<br>
<br>To end this I&apos;m simply going to put it. The game is fun, not Pay 2 Win, and it&apos;s starting to take up time I would spend playing Team Fortress 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5372539">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is the best shooter I&apos;ve played in years.  If you like TF2, Enemy Territory, and Battlefield 3, you&apos;ll probably love this.  Very skill-based.  More balanced every patch.  Better performance every patch.  Backed by a developer who arguably _created_ the F2P shooter market.  I&apos;m in love.</span>

Anti Cheat software was just added to cut back on the hacking issues they were having. Many people say this game is Pay2win, but paying only gives you more selection of weapons and load out options. While some of these are more advantageous then others, 2 to 3 shotgun blasts will still take almost every character down regardless of their rank. If you are looking for a FPS where you can maximize variations of speed and agility, heavy weapons and armor, long distance kill shots, or perhaps turret defense/offense this is the game for you!

This is just a breakdown of how the game is at this point. Dirty Bomb is a free to play FPS with micro transactions and extremely fast paced team based combat extremely similar to Counter Strike:GO but much faster. With the ability to jump off walls and parkour it lets you find hidden paths and new ways to flank your enemy, But must remember all the different Mercs haddel different and some are better then others when it comes to moving and jumping around. There are quite a few Mercs to choose from ranging from Medics,Engineers,Heavy&apos;s and others with the addition of new Mercs every few weeks.Your gun and bonuses are determined by your load-out card, there is 5 different kind of cards ranging from slandered starting cards to cobalt cards that give you some good bonuses. This is where the game can start to feel pay to win, People with the Cobalt or Gold cards seem to have a fairly good advantage over people who could just be starting with default cards and can push some new plays away from the game . Once you get some decent cards then you start to enjoy the matches a bit more.But one thing to remember to is that Mercs rotate like heroes in LoL and if you have a Merc you like a lot you will have to shell out 10 ish dollars or save up quite a bit of in game money to buy it. Once you get a few good cards and get into the play style you will start to enjoy Dirty Bomb but it&apos;s a bit of grind at the start so if you looking for a FPS you can just drop into you may want to stick with CS:GO for now. But I&apos;m curious what changes come to the game in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5387824">Expand</a></span>

Maps are shorter now, but with 3 gamemodes and 8 maps its playable for quite some time. If u think some **** just cheated on you with godmode, report him and he will lose all his game on steam for 5 years (yeah i wish). Reporting is in, not sure if it does anything. Cheater population seems quite low. You can have a quickie here for under 15 minutes per map. Jump in and out, no problem. The only game worth playing these days, i think.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5661513">Expand</a></span>

<br>-I wonder what game requirements need to be met in order for it to be classified as &#x201C;competitive&#x201D; (as this one is occasionally advertised as being).  Pragmatically speaking, within the realm of other multiplayer FPS games considered by most of the gamming community as &#x201C;competitive,&#x201D; this felt moderately easy and a tad unaggressive.
<br>
<br>-Various bugs, glitches
<br>
<br>-Region lock issues
<br>
<br>** Dirty Bomb certainly seemed decent.  Sadly, I think there are many other first-person shooters that arguably capture the &#x201C;important&#x201D; aspects of Dirty Bomb and implicate them a bit better (be it large maps [battlefield], objectives/classes [tf2], or competitive depth [CS]).  Personally, the things that were unique to Dirty Bomb I did not find all that gripping or addictive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5353027">Expand</a></span>

Content: Yes, I know it&apos;s a beta, but you cannot justify each class only having the option of two or three primaries, two secondaries, and two melee weapons, and if you&apos;d like many of these weapons you can either pay 17,500 credits, or pay $3.50, which brings me on to my next issue-
<br>
<br>2. Pay2Enjoy: This game is fun with the base classes, but as it would seem at the time, when the release comes out you will only be allowed to start with Aura, who is a fast-moving character with medic abilities, similar to a mix of Scout and Medic from the Team Fortress series. This is no issue, aside from that the only way to unlock her only other weapons, a semi-automatic shotgun based off of the M1014, or a very slow-firing sub-machinegun based off of the Kriss Vector. Now to get these weapons, you can either pay 1,000 credits and take a chance at unlocking it by random selection with chances similar to CS:GO&apos;s case system, buy the loadouts for 17,500 credits, or pay $3.50.
<br>Another issue with money is the actual class purchasing. You have two current class prices. For some, the class is 30,000 credits, or $6, and others are 50,000 credits, or $10.
<br>There are also boosters in this game, which lead to &quot;Pay2Enjoy&quot; or &quot;Pay4Convenience&quot; style of gameplay. A 6-hour credit booster for $3, a 12-hour credit booster for $6, or an 18-hour credit booster for $8.
<br>There are also character bundles in this game which can cost anywhere from $15-$20.
<br>As well as those, you can buy greater cases, called &quot;Elite cases&quot; for money as well. These go for $5 for one, $20 for five, or $35 for ten.
<br>
<br>3. Class balance: I will list my issues on this in order of class.
<br>Rhino: Lots of armor, still good at medium range, but incredibly unreasonable at close range due to their minigun which cannot run out of ammo.
<br>Skyhammer: Has a base M16 which does seemingly miniscule damage even with headshots. Has the ability to call in an airstrike with a thrown beacon, meaning in an open map you can simply throw an airstrike beacon into the enemy spawn, killing several people who have just spawned back due to the fact that teammates NEVER revive each other.
<br>Vassili: Equipped with a bolt-action sniper rifle which is only useful if you can hit a pebble at 500m with a BB gun. Almost useless class unless you&apos;re a god at getting headshots. Comes with thrown heartbeat sensor which people like to spam near enemy spawns and *attempt to) kill them before they can get close.
<br>Bushwacker: I feel this class has the worst base gun in the game. 45 round magazine and feels like it takes the entire thing to kill even a low-health player. Only upside is that he can place a turret similar to the engineer&apos;s turret in TF2, except that it&apos;s so weak it probably could get killed by dust flying too close to it when it fires
<br>Aura: I feel is the only nearly-balanced class in the game. Shotgun takes two hits to kill if aimed at the chest, one to the head at close range. Fast-moving and fair-healthed character.
<br>
<br>The community: Most people likely caught wind of this game from YouTube, and that&apos;s fine, but it&apos;s not what it&apos;s cracked up to be, almost entirely due to this. In the matches I was in, I only really found children, which isn&apos;t necessarily an issue, but.. I only found young, immature children who didn&apos;t play the game as it was designed- as an team and objective-based game. You can be directly next to the objective and die while your entire team is there. You will very likely not be revived. Nobody truly gives ammo, or heals anyone but themselves.
<br>
<br>Is this game good? No. Is this game bad? No.
<br>I&apos;ll tell you what this game is: A way for Nexon to make more money.
<br>It&apos;s fun, but not addicting. It&apos;s okay. Mediocre at best game that I think will fall off the fanbase rather quickly as soon as YouTubers stop playing it.
<br>
<br>Overall? I don&apos;t think it will be successful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5365255">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t listen to ppl saying its skill based game. ATM most players use  2-3 OP classes. Remember martyr perk form COD? Well they build whole class around this lovely mechanic. Avoid at all cost.</span>

To get the best the game mechanics have to offer, you have to spend at least $20, so it really isn&apos;t free to play - who wants to spend hundreds of hours grinding for the extremely low chance to get something that they don&apos;t already have? This game is nothing but a series of poorly concealed attempts to milk money from the player, and the actual gameplay is nothing new or different, since Team Fortress has been around since the 90s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5360370">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>THE BAD -Phantom
<br>
<br>They put in a merc with cloaking among us mercs who barely have body armor and rarely a helmet.
<br>
<br>He is invisible when he cloaks, 1 slash kill with the Katana, has a shield, Oh by the way, he has more hit points then most players, has the best SMG in game and can out run you. Kills 3 players with NO PROBLEM while they are trying to kill him. An invisible tank.
<br>
<br>Game has timed objectives, so if you move carefully to watch for invisible Phantom - YOU LOSE.
<br>
<br>If you rush, he runs you down from behind and YOU LOSE.
<br>
<br>If you take the EMP package or cargo to the objective, it takes a few seconds to load it. Phantom lurking in corner &amp; kills you while you are helpless and YOU LOSE.
<br>
<br>To add to the fun, there is no limit to how many people can be a Phantom - YOU LOSE.
<br>
<br>He appears to be able to recloak in just a second or 2 versus the longer load times for Nader or Proxy&apos;s mines. Seems to have no power limit.
<br>
<br>He can be detected by the Heart Beat sensor by the sniper (You can throw only 1 and then has a long cool down before next sensor appears. What, your team doesn&apos;t have a sniper - YOU LOSE.
<br>
<br>It WAS a great Beta, but if this is NEXON&apos;s version of game balance - can&apos;t wait for Fallout to invest my money and time in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=5375555">Expand</a></span>

Dirty Bomb reminds me most closely of their original smash success, Enemy Territory- and that is a very good thing, but still suffers from common problems endemic to modern team shooters, most egregiously the unforgiving damage model. While you are better able to hit enemies shooting from the hip then most other FPSs, the inconsistent network speeds common to a beta game combined with split-second-bang-your-dead damage means you will be staring at that reinforcement timer a whole hell of a lot. Dirty Bomb commits further sins by freely distributing wide-radius, near-instant kill explosive attacks to several of its playable characters, eliminating a large degree of skill from most engagements. Dirty Bomb is designed around fast-respawning waves of players and quick deaths, but boneheadidly welds this with objective-based maps and class-based loadouts, and further layers on daily grind quests and randomized progression hinged on &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; &quot;booster packs&quot; obtainable for real money, leaving the whole experience feeling cheap, indecisive and ultimately unrewarding. I wanted to like Dirty Bomb, but it needs help, and quickly. Step one I think will be to drop the Nexon association before it turns into a game worthy of their name: a forgettable one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507884">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The main issue with this game for me is the randomness of loadouts. There is too much RNG in what items you end up equipped with. You win a loot-card that has a main-hand, sidearm, and melee weapon. Each of those items can be completely different. Then you have up to 3 traits on each card as well. On top of that you have different tiers of cards, this recipe ends up leaving you with a lottery based reward system that I would consider a disaster.
<br>
<br>The abysmally low currency gain you get from actually playing the game compounds the issue. No doubt it was an economic decision from someone over on the Production/Development team to leave players in a constant grind or starved for currency. The whole point of the game is to push you towards micro-transactions. Micro-transactions fuel your crafting and crafting lets you take a stab at the lottery system to end up with that 1/10000 perfect loadout.
<br>
<br>You are forever chasing that dragon, it may as well be some kind of drug. Leaves me really disappointed, I think the characters have a lot of heart and the maps are fun, but these people have killed their own game with the money making model. Also, it takes way too long to actually get into a game. Work on the down-time.

Los gr&#xE1;ficos excelentes, las opciones de mercs son variadas y las constantes actualizaciones con mejores escenarios, lo hace una muy buena opci&#xF3;n para el entretenimiento.</span>

                                        <span>i think is a good game, a mix of different famous games like cs or battlefield and i like it but it needs some new updates for fix bugs and change the matchmaking system and the team generator system.
<br>the idea is so good and i like it but also i think that the characters are expensive and you get just a few credits for each game</span>

<br>Now, of course, there will be bad games, and there will be sore losers and bragging winners, but that is to be expected in all games. Most people who leave bad reviews only focus is on those games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=6334493">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well, I still remember, I was playing BO3, with one of my Friends. (PC version), then I saw loads of players Just equipping Assault Rifles (1 Shot, any range), I was... something like 1/19, trying to play with Controllers (I use to play FPS, with Mouse&amp;Keyboard, But Two players and one PC.)
<br>
<br>Me:&quot;This things don&apos;t happen in Dirt... I mean, A Good game!&quot;.
<br>-Few minutes Later-
<br>My Friend: &quot;Yeah so, Do you want to play Dirt... I mean, a Good game?&quot;
<br>Me: &quot;I guess I want something where skill is needed&quot;.
<br>
<br>Anyway.
<br>It&apos;s a really funny game, so you can play with your friends anytime, I mean It&apos;s Free To play.
<br>The game it&apos;s skill based, Funny, You need Teamwork and communication.
<br>
<br>The way its made It&apos;s really good.
<br>Thanks Humble Bundle (?)

<br>I think that Loads of FPS, need something from Dirty Bomb.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=6482865">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>People and critics say it could have been more, but remember. It is still in BETA, OPEN BETA. Of course there are things that can be better! That is why it is in open beta, so people can enjoy the game and provide feedback on the go, so that the devs can fix or adjust things. Also, you can often find a couple of devs playing the game (You can recognize them with the orange SD tag next to their name) and than you can ask em about things.
<br>
<br>Some complain about certain mercs being over- or underpowered, whilst I can agree on that some mercs don&apos;t really deliver as promised, 99/100 times it is just that person not playing how they are supposed to.

<br>Whilst I think this game has lots to improve, there also is a lot at the moment and it holds great promise I think.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=6777347">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is very skill based, with a high Time To Kill.  Skill always wins.
<br>
<br>Also the payment model is very fair - you can unlock weapons through credits earned in-game very easily.  The rarer &quot;loadouts&quot; only offer cosmetic differences.  (All loadout cards above &quot;Bronze&quot; rarity are ONLY different in how they look.  They offer the EXACT SAME functionality.  And bronze cards are easily obtainable)
<br>
<br>I was a huge fan of Wolfenstein:Enemy Territory, and this improves on that in almost every way.
<br>
<br>The game is not perfect however.  I would like to see:
<br>
<br>1) Skin/Loadout trading
<br>2) More maps
<br>3) A map editor
<br>4) Private servers
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a great game though, and you should give it a try!  It&apos;s totally free so you&apos;ve got nothing to lose.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirty-bomb/user-reviews?user_review_id=7141733">Expand</a></span>
