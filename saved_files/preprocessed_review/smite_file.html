<br>Some people may say SMITE is a MOBA for casuals....if that means it&apos;s a game that is actually fun and doesn&apos;t force you to learn a clunky mechanic simply because of tradition, then yes, SMITE is for casuals.

This being said, unlocking one god seems to take forever, I&apos;ve about 3500 flavors after at least playing at least 8 hours while a god is 5000. I guess that the best to really enjoy this game would be to play in a real team (clan). I can see how powerful it can be to make smart use of powers (one freeze the opponent while the other use a massive slow attack) and to be many to attack a single opponent. I would probably really enjoy playing competitive and learning all Gods skills. This being said, without having a clan to play with and being limited to only a few Gods (free to play), the game becomes quickly repetitive and boring. I prefer to play a game like battlefield where you can revive other players, heal yourself and where the attacks (guns) are more clearly defined. Indeed, in SMITE, it&apos;s often hard to understand how you got killed because there are some many Gods/attacks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=5226330">Expand</a></span>

However, after playing SMITE for a few months, I can say that it&apos;s one of the best ( in my case ). Considering I came to SMITE after a few years of playing league and DOTA, the lack of insults and snide remarks really caught me off-guard.  However, like all games it has it&apos;s downsides,  mainly directed to the lack of items and the overall unbalanced feel the game has. Many of the gods can start snowballing at very low levels while others (Mainly stealth related ones) get a free pass to attack or escape due to the lack of vision granting items in the game, sure there are wards and such, but the fact that there isn&apos;t one to reveal or detect and alert you of invisible enemies can really cause people to get pissed off ( I&apos;m talking about you Loki.)
<br>Anyway, I give it a 7/10. It gives people a fresh and more strategic look at MOBAs while keeping the basic elements that LoL and DOTA players are accustomed too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4340453">Expand</a></span>

<br>After trying my hand at LoL i really couldn&apos;t get into the MOBA spirit and this was because of LoLs control system so after a good friend of mine said to try my hand at smite i did and it is fantastic the w,a,s,d keys system worked perfect for new players like myself that use w,a,s,d to move on a daily basis the 3rd person view made it feel refreshing to although the fact you can&apos;t see behind you unless you spin the camera can be pretty frustrating if an enemy good flanks you it is also free to play which is a plus for people who want to try something new there is a nice selection of gods on a weekly rotation the tutorial system covers everything you need to know as well so you&apos;ll be set to go straight away the only downside i did find was some of the players don&apos;t allow you to learn and think it is fine to talk down to you which isnt cool but you can always ignore them by muting them in game which makes things more pleasant
<br>
<br>Overall if you want to try your hand at MOBAS and like nice and simple key binds then try smite after all its free to play</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=5712170">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve tried a few MOBAs in the past and never played more then a few weeks. But Smite&apos;s 3D take on the MOBA really grabbed my attention. Being able to miss auto attacks and abilities is what sets this game apart from other MOBAs. The character choices are fun and every god feels different and unique to play. You can earn favor from playing games to purchase gods, skins and player icons, or Gems which are purchases with cash. What I like about about Smite is that spending more cash will not increase my abilities to win in game, sure I can buy the gods all at once, but it won&apos;t give me any advantage in game. I hope they keep to this formula. The different modes are limited but fun. I give Smite a well deserved 9 and see myself playing it for months and hopefully years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4085229">Expand</a></span>

<br>1)HiRez staff never bans those who paid even if they hack
<br>2)there are hacks.
<br>3)there is no level balance in match-making thing that makes you stuck with lowbies forever
<br>4)too many non-english speaking players so well you sometimes feel alone in the game
<br>5)ticket support answers are always.(and when i say always i mean it) indirect and actually never answered..well it&apos;s robot answer all the time..so there is no support for players..(unless you paid)
<br>
<br>These were the reasons it got so low score from me..the reasons it&apos;s above average is because of the common MOBA genre with the unique style of 3rd person shooting.it also has good graphics..well..the cons of this game are more than the pros..but it worths just the experience..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4521130">Expand</a></span>

Through the lengthy beta period there have been constant updates to the game that has made it into what it is today which is vastly different to what it was. Smite features unique MOBA gameplay by changing the perspective to third person and giving you familiar wasd movement where 1 2 3 4 are used for he abilities. Everything about this game is simply amazing. It has it&apos;s unique and fun gameplay not just in the standard 3 lane format as other MOBAs it also features a variety of other modes, including, Arena, Assault, Joust (1v1), Joust (3v3) and the ever changing MoTD. The sound in the game is also very well done. The community isn&apos;t so bad as in other games and toxic players are easily ignored using the mute option.  The developers are constantly interacting with the community and providing content through Youtube and Twitch, mainly twitch as they run two official channels that has a line up of streamers that fill up a 24 hours each week day, with the tournaments being streamed there on the weekends. What also adds to the fun of the game is the use of mythological gods as opposed to champions and such from other games, it features many gods from many different pantheons all interesting, unique and well designed. Overall the game really doesn&apos;t have any real downsides other than the lack of servers for regions outside North America and Europe which really isn&apos;t a problem with the game and will probably be rectified eventually. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4085948">Expand</a></span>

Overall, great game and amazingly designed. The developers, Hi-Rez Studios, listen to the community incredibly well and better than any other devs I&apos;ve seen, you can trust me on this since I&apos;ve been apart of the community since the closed beta. Hi-Rez is always trying to give us new content, upgraded content, and overall a better game quality, which i enjoy greatly from developers. 10/10, this game has been the best I&apos;ve ever played for this last year and a half.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4081353">Expand</a></span>

<br>Here are some of the highlights about SMITE:
<br>
<br>-3rd person view gameplay
<br>-lots of tough skill shots
<br>-easy to learn, TOUGH to master
<br>-Great community (most people have been very friendly, a few trolls and idiots but thats always happens)
<br>-GREAT dev team and community managers
<br>-Consistent game updates
<br>-Beautiful graphics for a multiplayer game
<br>-In depth itemization during games
<br>-Over 50 gods and counting
<br>-THE BEST VALUE OF ALMOST ANY MULTIPLAYER GAME. You can buy the ultimate god pack (all previous AND future gods for 30 dollars!)
<br>
<br>Gametypes:
<br>There are many competitive and FUN game types so if you don&apos;t want to always try and compete at your best ability, you can play some of the more &quot;chill&quot; game types.
<br>
<br>There is room for improvement, especially with matchmaking (sometimes teams aren&apos;t very even).  But, these small problems aside, I haven&apos;t had this much fun playing a multiplayer game in years!

<br>2) Skill shots only. Unlike other MOBA games, you will not find an ability that is auto-fired. You need to follow a running target, shoot it like it&apos;s a Third-Person Shooter. It takes real skills to hit that target. Even passive attacks are skill shots.
<br>3) Hi-Rez Studios (developers) care about their customers. Rarely to no server downtimes, good updates, balanced gods, ...
<br>4) Good community. League of Legends is known for the worst community in gaming. Smite is not like that.
<br>5) No masteries and runes. Means it takes skills to kill somebody.
<br>6) MANY more reasons, but these are the most importent.
<br>
<br>These reasons make SMITE the best MOBA game out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4095171">Expand</a></span>

The 3d model and wasd controls sealed the deal for me as I was growing tired of all the point to click games out there. Don&apos;t get me wrong, smite is no where near as polished as other games like dota 2, or league, but its only been up and running for a few years now. So it can only get better and  I consider it to be the most fun out of all of them. There are many global ults in the game, in where you can fly in the sky and attack enemies from below. The community is small, so its not as bad as other mobas, but as it gets bigger expect it to get worse. That being said, I rarely encounter them as of right now, but it just goes with the territory of being a moba. If you want to try something new and fun, I would suggest smite as its really an awesome game. Dont get discouraged at first, the skill cap is a little high for beginners but once you get the basics down the game will be a lot of fun. There are a lot of different game modes so your not stuck on playing only conquest. The matchmaking is a little disappointing hence the 9 rating, but it should get better over time. Last but not least, Smite offers the best deal known to man. You can buy all the gods in the game INCLUDING ALL FUTURE GODS RELEASED for only 30 dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4080183">Expand</a></span>

If you took the smooth game play of WoW and turned the PVP into a MOBA with everything pretty much becoming a SKILL SHOT(No Locked on Targets like WoW). This is everything a MOBA&apos;s play style should be. DOTA and LoL are in there own league this is not even comparable for many reasons. Awesome game!</span>

SMITE is known for standing out among most MOBAs, using a behind-the-back view as opposed to a top-down view. This new perspective alone makes the game feel much more action-packed and if you don&apos;t think you like MOBAs, you need to play SMITE just for this new feel.
<br>
<br>If for whatever reason you didn&apos;t know, SMITE uses different kinds of gods as playable characters. These gods vary from Roman gods to Mayan gods to Chinese gods with everything in between. Many of them are familiar such as Poseidon, Aphrodite, and Cupid but you&apos;ll find yourself knowing about many more like Ah Muzen Cab, Chaac, and Scylla. Though it is neat to see familiar faces in the game, it&apos;s even cooler seeing what attacks they use. Every god you can play as feels very different prompting you to want to buy them all. And this can be a problem with SMITE. There are so many gods to play as and you will want to try all of them but it is quite hard to earn money in the game. However, you can pay to get Gems which let you buy more stuff. It&apos;s not necessarily pay-to-win, but you will see yourself spending money on the game. Large amounts of money.
<br>
<br>Going back to the abilities, every god has a unique set of attacks that do unique things. Again, this makes it very interesting to see what new things that new gods introduce such as being able to switch weapons instantly which no other god can do. It creates a very refreshing and otherwise great feel for the game. Because of this, SMITE will be the reason you don&apos;t get homework done and why you go to bed at 2AM, the game is extremely addicting. Which is great because it&apos;s so action-packed and rewarding. Every kill you get feels huge and when you&apos;re on a long killstreak or winstreak, you will keep playing so you can only improve upon yourself and once you do, you&apos;ll be one happy camper.
<br>
<br>This again, leads to another problem is that you can almost always improve upon yourself. It is good and bad really, as you will always be striving to become better. However, you won&apos;t really feel like you&apos;re &quot;complete&quot;. With SMITE being a MOBA and getting constantly updated, it isn&apos;t a surprise that this happens at all but there will be times when you just feel like you can be better and you keep trying. Again, you may succeed which is a great feeling but you may also fail which is frustrating as SMITE games do last a while and it isn&apos;t rare to get a crappy team.
<br>
<br>With all the fresh and unique things SMITE does, it easily earns a 9/10. Just get ready to lose some cash and experience a bit of rage. If you want to know if SMITE is worth your time, the answer is an absolute yes. In fact, it could be worth TOO much time because it will eat up all time you once had in your life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4087306">Expand</a></span>

Smite is a small-time game that deserves my voice, and other players&apos; voices, to vouch for it on its behalf. It has to compete with huge powerhouse players in the MOBA market.
<br>
<br>Smite is a great game, that for me, raises the bar for the MOBA genre. Personally, the combat and perspective just feels so right. Its fluid, allows for insanely skillful plays, and responsive. Every time I die, I can tell why I died and the balancing seems fair. When you&apos;re having a good game, you really feel like a badass versus a traditional moba, due to the enhanced action combat. I think the movements do seem SLIGHTLY floaty, and would love to see a more powerful physics engine if they were ever to make a sequel. Overall it feels very kickass to play though and when you&apos;re having a great game you feel like a GOD.
<br>
<br>There are several competitive game modes offered. My favorite alternate game mode is the Arena, where Hi-Rez absolutely nailed the gladiator coliseum experience. The roaring crowds after plays are made....the aesthetic....the straight up 5v5 brawling from the beginning of the game....It&apos;s all there.
<br>
<br>Also the Ultimate God Pack is such a great value for your dollar. I recommend purchasing it if the game grabs you.
<br>
<br>Please give smite a try, especially if you&apos;re looking for something &quot;new&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4115897">Expand</a></span>

Think League of Legends (bought out by the same parent company) but with a 3rd person perspective view. You don&apos;t know what can come out from your sides or behind you during game play. Helps lots to have surround sound to detect audible cues of sneaking opponents but I still get ambushed. Absolutely love this game. Sooo much fun with friends too. Plenty of different game modes to keep things fresh and exciting. Never the same game twice, ever.
<br>
<br>Also, the team behind this game do a great job of involving and connecting its fans with tons of out of game content such as comical in house videos with its staff, or streaming their games on their homepage with their admins playing while chatting with fans during games, or amazing live streaming of flashy grand tournaments with classy commentators during and after matches, also excellent and fast tech support for this game, etc....

<br>I paid for the ultimate god pack to unlock all characters but this game is absolutely completely playable being FREE. Yes, it&apos;s a free game. You can&apos;t beat that. In game purchases are their driving monetary income such as character skins and items.
<br>
<br>My only complaint is sometimes a player may lose connection to the game and their character will run back to base. Hopefully one day that character can be a bot with the team at least to keep it fair. Sadly their bot AI is weak at the moment and would likely hurt its team instead of help.
<br>
<br>Give this game a try and be careful not to get too addicted. Have fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4285694">Expand</a></span>

And even more impressive a guy like me who normally doesn&apos;t like games in the DotA genre can still enjoy this particular one. That alone is worth an 8/10.</span>

<br>Ok, sure you have</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This MOBA deserves your attention. LoL and Dota are not the industry standard of MOBA&apos;s...Smite proves that. It&apos;s a genius mash up of a 3rd person action game with the mechanics of a traditional MOBA. In my humble opinion, this is the BEST F2P title out there on any platform. The funny thing is, I am not even a fan MOBA&apos;s and yet I have spent over 400 hours in Smite.
<br>
<br>Ok, sure you have lanes, towers, minions (creeps), and lots of characters to choose from but the big difference here is that you actually have to aim your shots/skills manually using WSAD and the mouse. This little mechanic adds an enormous amount of depth to the combat and makes you much more involved in every second of the game.
<br>
<br>The character selection is great! You play as many different gods from mythology like Hercules, Hades, Anubis, Neith, Cupid, and Thor just to name a few. Each god is very well crafted and feels very unique. Every time I purchased or earned a new god, I found myself dumping endless hours into learning the skills and play style of that god. It feels like a new game every time you decide to master a new god. Along with many characters to choose from, there are a handful of solid game modes and maps to choose from as well. Don&#x2019;t feel like playing the traditional 3 lane map? Well you can choose from one lane maps, arena team deathmatch, control point maps and my personal favorite, the Assault mode (one lane, no jungle and random gods). Another positive worth noting is the amount of care and attention the staff at Hi-Rez has put into this game. It seems like every month or so they release a new god and/or patches and cosmetic changes. If you log out of Smite for weeks on end, expect lots of new additions to the game when you come back.
<br>
<br>MOBA&#x2019;s are known to be highly competitive which usually means you will find a highly competitive smack talking community. The good news is Hi-Rez reacts quickly enough to player complaints and has no problem issuing bans. But there in lies the problem&#x2026; I have been wrongfully issued a three day ban before with no warning that my account was under review. They just simply banned me and told me to deal with it. After a few emails back and forth, I found out it was because I had too many disconnects mid game. That was only due to my shoddy ISP at the time. Solution? Maybe Hi-Rez could send out emails or in-game messages warning players that their account is under review.
<br>
<br>This next issue I have is a strange one that seems to be a big grey area with not only Smite but most Early Access games in general. I purchased several gods with real money in the past. Sometimes Hi-Rez will make major changes to gods that I have purchased including re-skins and skill changes. Well that sounds fine and all but the reason I bought this god was because I liked it for what it was at that time. Some of these changes completely transform the god into something I no longer like to use. This has happened several times in the Beta which I guess is understandable (being a Beta) but it has now happened outside of the Beta which seems to be more of an issue. I just hope that&#x2019;s not going to be a common thing to do.
<br>
<br>Those minor gripes aside, I can&#x2019;t say enough good things about Smite. With so many low quality fremium games out there, Smite&#x2019;s content and support make this a diamond in the rough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4122822">Expand</a></span>

People generally said that DotA 2 and/or League of Legends are better, and thought about this as I started the game up. After playing over forty eight hours of the game, I can clarify that these statements are false. SMITE is by far the best MOBA that I have ever played. It takes the good aspects of all MOBAs and puts them into a more action-packed, friendly, and generally much more interesting game. It features the classic tri-lane gamemode while also adding several others to break up the monotony of one singular map. This was a problem that DotA 2 had, and SMITE has surpassed it in that respect.
<br>It also features a gigantic character roster of over 90 gods to play, each one purchasable either with an in-game currency or with real-world money. Each god is very unique, has their own way of hacking, slashing, and hitting B to warp back to base.
<br>Its graphics are very nice also, they&apos;re just as high-fidelity as DotA but are more realistic than both League and DotA, and so personal preference decides which you prefer. This game&apos;s community is far better than DotA 2&apos;s, and makes League&apos;s look like the final circle of hell. People are always happy to help players out, work together, listen to voice commands and so on.
<br>This game&apos;s biggest negative however is that it&apos;s held down by a ton of the classic MOBA rules that have League of Legends twitching on the floor covered in bees. It keeps the whole &quot;purchasing gods&quot; aspect, albeit bypassable by the Ultimate-God-Pack, but it also has unfair voting mechanics, unchangeable characters once locked in, and the last hitting rule. But if those are not bothersome to you, SMITE is an absolutely wonderful game with plenty of potential to keep growing and growing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4332875">Expand</a></span>

There is currently enough gods to play to not get bored after a few games.
<br>
<br>Right now however, the game still suffer a few imbalances (which will probably be fixed) and suffer from the usual Moba community (Leavers and Ragers) but to a lesser extent than the other current Mobas. The matchmaking is also weirdly designed.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s just hope this game will not suffer from his popularity like it happened for LoL.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4167567">Expand</a></span>

You have your typical modes of Conquest (5v5, 3 lanes with jungle attacking opposing Titan), Assault (5v5, random god, single lane no jungle attacking opposing Titan), Arena (5v5, TDM set in a gladiator arena with jungle mobs on outskirts), MOTD (5v5, random game changes daily and will cover all modes including domination mode not available anywhere else. Examples - All the same god, Guy Gods vs Girl Gods, Norse gods vs Egyptian, etc.), Joust (3v3, single lane with jungle attacking opposing Titan), There is also private lobbies for groups of 5v5 to play in. They have practice, normal and league options for the different modes with the exception of the private lobby being only available under normal.
<br>
<br>The game is F2P but does have in game purchases yet none that make the game P2W. They offer you 5 starting gods and 5 random gods that rotate weekly so if you don&apos;t have the money you&apos;ll still get a chance to enjoy the variety of gods on offer, currently 51. Most things can be purchased with &quot;Favor&quot; which you earn through battle but some costumes and all the individual character voices are gems (cash) only. The best option they offer is a God Pack that gives you access to all current and future gods for a one time fee.
<br>
<br>Now for the final cut.. While the game is fun and I do play it almost daily it&apos;s not without it&apos;s glitches. For me personally this game was in beta for two years and to still be having problems I don&apos;t understand; which is why I scored it the way I did. Server pings are random. I can play a match at 70 and have another at 150+. Since release HiRez has fixed some issues with the ping where before I had matches that&apos;d start great then my ping would shoot up to 600 even 900. I also had matches where both teams could not play because you&apos;d be walking out your spawn area 5 times then suddenly pop halfway across the map yet we could chat just fine. Rare graphic glitches and abilities that on the rare occasion seemingly not do anything even though it executed properly from your POV. They offer a broken Twitch integrated client that would allow you to unlock a skin for one god but for a reason only known to the gods have not bothered to fix it so it&apos;s impossible to unlock the skin. Now even with these and other minor things the game is still fun. The community does have it&apos;s few elitist ass hats who whine about your build or not following meta but they do offer the option to mute, report and block players so if you happen upon them remember that and don&apos;t get caught up in their trolling ways mid game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4125754">Expand</a></span>

<br>Has great amount of gods to play and has better community than other moba games. The 3rd person makes you really feel alive when playing moba. The game modes are great too and you cant stop loving everything in this game. Had some server issues before release but seem to be fixed. Only problem is the kinda long patch times but the game is running faster than other games with high graphics. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4083560">Expand</a></span>

The third-person is such a huge difference and the &quot;even basic attacks are a skillshot&quot; thing makes combat so much more interesting to me. It&apos;s really fast-paced, the character selection is awesome, the community is fantastic, the developer takes a lot of feedback.. I&apos;m having a fantastic time.</span>

<br>
<br>This makes the game really skill based, and easy to pick up but hard to master. For me that made this game really addictive and fun. Besides that the game is pretty well balanced atm. There are a few gods who are a bit stronger than the other gods in the general opinion, but they are still far from unbeatable.
<br>
<br>Smite has a lot of gamemodes to offer. My personal favorite is the classic 3 lane + jungle mode conquest. But besides that there are plenty of other modes, like an arena mode and a one lane all random mode.
<br>
<br>One thing I also really like a lot, is their VGS system. This is basically a system that lets you communicate well with your team in a fast way. You press the V button in game and then you get to a menu with voice commands you can say. For example, gank middle lane is VG2. Or be careful is VCC. Communicating with your team becomes really easy thanks to this system.
<br>
<br>Besides that you have an item system like in every moba, it is pretty simple and since they recently revamped the recommended item system, you don&apos;t have to worry about learning that. There is still enough depth to counter build though, which makes items still important and it is fun when you get a feeling for them later on and start counter building.
<br>
<br>The only negative thing I have to say about smite now is that the leavers aren&apos;t punished that hard, so in my early levels there were plenty of leavers in the classic 3 lane mode. Luckily once you get to a higher level that gets a lot rarer.
<br>
<br>Smite also has a fair money system imo. If you decide not to spend any money on it, you won&apos;t be at a disadvantage. You will only have a smaller god pool to play from, as you will have to earn them with favor that you get after every match. You can spend money on cosmetic skins, voice packs for the VGS system, or more gods, and smite even has a deal where you get every god and every god added later in the game for 25 euro, so you can also buy that and see it as a full game purchase like I did.
<br>
<br>All in all, I give smite a 10 because it has entertained me for so long already (more than half a year) and I still enjoy playing a lot. I spend around 50 euros on it which is crazy, as this is the only free to play game I ever spent money on. (and that while I played some other f2p games for years) But I did that because the game is just so enjoyable, and Hirez supports it so well. They still do, so there is probably a lot more awesomeness to come. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4081559">Expand</a></span>

There is some balance issues i think still but nothing game breaking, basically ymir needs a nerf to damage or cc cause he has too much of both, and loki needs to have some form of counterplay added to his ult. beyond that so far all the gods feel equally powerful and balanced.
<br>
<br>I personally prefer Arena mode than Conquest but thats because i just love the big open fighting field it&apos;s alot easier to drop into and learn the gods than a conquest game that is a lot more .... organization requiring like lol/dota would be..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4083246">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>A year back, it looked to me like a Dota2 with a 3rd person gimmick, but now that I&apos;ve tried it, it&apos;s actually more than that. Smite does bring the same strategy, but it&apos;s easier for newcomers and it&apos;s more action packed. Game also features faster gameplay, interesting theme (Gods), more game modes, more maps, better graphics, surrender button... F2P model is also good. Overall, great game.</span>

                                        <span>SMITE is the most original MOBA ever. I know people would say &quot;LoL copy!!&quot; but they aren&apos;t. It&apos;s like saying LoL is a copy of DoTa, and no one cares about it. The gods that are released are from mythology, so its not a copy. Community is great, the game is really fun and u have to really use your skills to be good, not like other MOBAs that u just have to play.</span>

Just with friends to have a laugh and stuff. We stopped playing it in 2014 because we stopped finding much enjoyment in it, other than in-jokes we created. My friend (who also does reviews, his name is &apos;Memburg&apos;) was telling me about a game he recently started playing SMITE, I had seen a bit of SMITE on YouTube and I thought it looked okay, so I downloaded it and begun playing it with him. In my first game I got two kills, which is not much to most, but my MOBA background consists of one kill every match (that I stole), so to me it was a big deal. I began to love this game. I have no idea how long I have spent playing, but it would be nearing 100 hours by now. I started on Cupid when he was on the free God rotation, moved onto Tyr (who I no longer play), Mercury, Hun Batz, fell in love with Vulcan, and I&apos;m really enjoying Scylla right now.
<br>
<br>My long and ramble-y story basically comes down to this: If you are a fan of MOBAs, play it. If not, you very well may enjoy it, it&apos;s in a much nicer view so it&apos;s more welcoming to people new to the genre. The reason I gave it a 9 is because 1) MOBA communities are some really not nice people, so I play with friends (although you do meet some nice people now and then), and 2) every now and then, I get annoyed at features, but it&apos;s not a consistent problem; just sometimes annoys me in the middle of a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4394134">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Playing as a god is cool.
<br>Killing other gods is cool.
<br>Playing in 3rd person is cool.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been playing this game for 18 months in beta and still play it as much now as I did then. Awesome game.</span>

The 3D perspective is a nice change from the usual top-down MOBA. If you enjoy the moba scene, SMITE is a great game to try out!</span>

<br>
<br>Controls: Every ability and attack in Smite is an instrument to be played to the limits of its musician. Smite&apos;s control scheme is intuitive, consistent and fluid. Playing  games with similar controls will leave you with hunger pangs for the satisfying clicks and casts of Smite.
<br>
<br>Visuals: Hirez Studios has balanced fantasy and realism like the two edges of a finely-honed blade. Every god is visually distinct from another, and the animations carry a sense of weight that speaks to the competency of their artist. Watching a match from a few feet away is just plain eye-candy
<br>
<br>Sound: If you play for a week and don&apos;t find yourself repeating some of the taunts or catchphrases, you have my permission to write me an angry letter in all caps.
<br>
<br>Replay Value: Smite will leave you feeling satisfied, yet you&apos;ll always come back for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4082130">Expand</a></span>

<br>The crazy thing is, that the game still feels refreshing and exciting to me. And that&apos;s coming from a guy who has played it for almost 2 years now. I never thought I&apos;d get so hooked on a MOBA. But I did!
<br>Smite&apos;s gameplay is action-packed, engaging and most importantly just really fun. The art direction and theme on the game is also great - nothing beats playing gods and godesses of the ancient time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4082992">Expand</a></span>

The third-person behind view makes it much more familiar to those who play lots of shooters and action games, such as myself.  It&apos;s been awesome to watch the game itself grow in terms of available characters, visuals, and gameplay balance, but more importantly the player base has grown too.  The Smite community is one of the best I&apos;ve ever seen, and has kept me interested even after encounters with some nasty players.  In just about every way, this is a fantastic game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4080516">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The reason SMITE is the only MOBA which works for me is because of how unique it feels, 3rd person camera instead of top down (which I hate) that allows you to control your character more like an MMO instead of clicking everywhere (even though there is an option for it), this also gives you a more complete view of your battlefield and a need to watch your back.
<br>
<br>The Champions or Gods as they are called are just amazing, well designed with plenty of lore and unique looks and abilities. Some of my favorite ones are Cupid, Odin, Ares, Geb, Ullr, Ra, Neith and plenty more so finding some that fit you and your play-style for different roles should not be a problem.
<br>
<br>All in all, this is THE MOBA game to play, looks and plays amazing with plenty of variety and the ability to customize setups, as a newbie there are tools to help you out!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4086932">Expand</a></span>

<br>the game overall is great. There are only really 2 major drawbacks for me optimization, and servers (reasons posted below)
<br>
<br>Drawback one: is that the game isn&apos;t that well optimized, but they have been doing their best to optimize their lower end settings for lower end pc&apos;s, personally doesn&apos;t effect me, but then again no matter what I set my settings too I get the same frame rate.
<br>
<br>Drawback two:  is that the servers are kind of messy for the time being, the US servers are based out of Atlanta and I live on the west coast, they do have a few servers out here, but it is very rare to get them so ping can be a huge issue with the game, and even beyond this I have friends who live near Atlanta who still have some crazy lag and ping issues.
<br>
<br>overall I give it an 8/10 the game is great, so much that I have spent more money on this free to play than I have on any other Free to play or standard $60 game + whatever DLC it may have.

<br>Smite got more maps and game mods then the other MOBAs at that time and so u have a great variety to play.
<br>At the last point i want to say that the Smite community is so great. There are so few flamers, haters and leavers. Particularly in comparison with the other MOBAs at this time.

I am very excited for SMITE&apos;s future in the ever expanding MOBA Genre. The Mythology, lore, gameplay and artistic design of the game are definitely a few of its many strong points.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>-3D MOBA makes for an unique and innovative gameplay experience.
<br>-More than 50 playable gods to choose from at launch!
<br>-Great artistic design of characters and environment.
<br>-Mythology and lore of the different pantheons
<br>-Conquest game mode that should be familiar to MOBA players.
<br>-Hi-Rez Studios actively involved with the community via Twitch streaming, live Patch notes and weekend tournaments!
<br>-Newb friendly with plenty practicing options and tutorial videos.
<br>-uhmm oh yeah, IT&apos;S FREE TO PLAY.
<br>
<br>The not so good:
<br>-Balance issues with gods (Will probably be ironed out in the weeks to come)
<br>-Lots of games have either an AFK player or leaver, this is probably due to an ineffective reporting/ &quot;tribunal&quot; system.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: As an ex League of Legends and DOTA player, the idea of a 3D MOBA really hooked me. Playing any other MOBA after SMITE now feels really slow paced (and boring) to me in comparison. I would highly recommend this game to all my friend and anyone that enjoys competitive gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4080390">Expand</a></span>

Yes its kinda casual, and lots of pure fun modes, but the thing is how it plays! Its awesome! I highly recommend it to the people who love fast paced action. All the positive things can&apos;t be described in words. You need to feel it. The downside is that there are too much generic skills like hit all enemies in a line/cone/around you. But it compensated by insane non-standard skills and awesome ultimates. Like if you play Thanatos, god of death - your ultimate is flying up above the map (!) fly for 5 seconds and then drop down in a target location killing enemies below a certain amount of hp/stunning and damaging them. And there are many skills like this. Every hero is truly unique besides generic skills, mentioned above. Play it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4142802">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played all the MOBAs to date and I would say League Of Legends was the game I&apos;ve played the longest consistently.  I played SMITE during its Beta phase and I was not impressed.  While fun for a little while, it did not hold my attention.  Fast forward a year to release and it is a MUCH different game with many more Gods to choose from and game modes.  This game is a breath of fresh air.  I have been playing it now for about a month and love it.  Will that love last into 6,7,8+ months?  Time will tell, but right now it is a great game that has made me forget about League.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/smite/user-reviews?user_review_id=4213169">Expand</a></span>
