The gameplay seems a bit smoother, the art seems a bit more polished, and rocket launchers can actually do damage! That being said, there are a few things I would like to inform any potential buyers: 1. The loot system, while apparently expanded, seemed a tad bit limited. Oh sure, you find guns that have better stats and they might even have a new skin, but because all the gun manufacturers have their own &quot;quirks&quot; that apply to EVERY gun they make (i.e. all hyperion guns start out inaccurate but gain accuracy the longer you fire), all the guns seem rather similar. You no longer get the &quot;HX480&quot; prefix in your gun titles, which, while it might appeal to many gamers, also makes it harder to see if you have a gun made up of the perfect parts. Also, if you have been following the press releases about the game, the advertised &quot;thrown together&quot; aspects of Bandit guns are out. Originally there were supposed to be beer bottles in place of scopes and a screw that you look down when in ADS mode. It seems that now all bandit guns have is a &quot;dirty&quot; or graffiti&apos;d paint job.  2. The environments have definitely been expanded upon, with caverns and mines filled with acid to a modern city open for you to loot and shoot your way through. The problem that might turn off some gamers is that the devs added more obstacles for you to run past so that there is a greater sense of progression. This is, in my opinion, a double edged sword because this leads to a cluster of terrain that is almost impossible to navigate without using the map. 3. Badass points: You gain badass points whenever you do challenges like &quot;shoot x amount of enemies with sniper rifles&quot;. You can then spend these points on upping gun damage, reload speed, etc. This replaces the weapon proficiency system of BL1, so that some gamers wouldn&apos;t feel committed to using the type of gun they had used up to that point. On the other hand, you don&apos;t feel like you are improving with a certain weapon type, which cuts down on a bit of the RPG aspects IMO. 4. Gore: In order to release world-wide uncut, Gearbox disabled decapitations. In BL1, a headshot with a decent sniper rifle and *boom*. Head gone. In BL2, even though the blood from the headshot still spews out like in the prequel, the enemy models still retain their heads. This is a rather minor complaint, but judging from the Gearbox forums, there are a good number of people ticked off by this.
<br>
<br>All in all, I think that this is a pretty good game. The only setbacks I thought it had were conscious decisions made by Gearbox and, while I might not be the specific market they are trying to appeal to, there is still enough shoot and loot for me to enjoy BL2 immensely. I&apos;d also keep in mind that Gearbox was trying to release Aliens colonel marines and Duke Nukem Forever at the same time, which might explain the lack of innovation in terms of Bandit weapons. My hope is they balance the innovations (the manufacturer &quot;quirks&quot;) in BL3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2660818">Expand</a></span>

Works very well on PC and, voice acting helps drive the story forward. The decoration of the areas, for want of a better word, is lush and interesting. Character animation when shooting is fun and the ragdoll physics makes the world feel nice and alive.
<br>
<br>However I&apos;m 30 hours in and I can feel the repetitive gameplay become more evident as the novelty wears off. I didn&apos;t play Borderlands 1 and I can imagine if I had I&apos;d be quite bored.
<br>
<br>My main complaint is with the limited scale of the areas. The game world feels cramped, this is no Capital Wasteland. I make the comparison as the scale, complexity and exploration aspects of Fallout 3 is something that I started to crave. Especially as when completing an area, taking up to an hour to advance the story, the next side mission you take often has you going literally around in circles through the same area you&apos;ve just cleared, fighting instantly respawned enemies, and even respawned bosses. I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that running through the story missions and actively avoiding side missions is the only way I can keep interest in the game after the 25 hour mark.
<br>
<br>The bipedal enemies are fun in the most part, but the creature enemies I found annoying. They almost always run at you and swarm you, which is doubly annoying when they respawn behind you. And finally the big USP is the limitless amount of guns. This is slightly disingenuous as there are 4 gun classes underneath which all guns are roughly similar. They have randomised stats, and effects which once you&apos;ve seen them, aren&apos;t too interesting. The loot powers up with your level, so you&apos;ll never stumble across a great gun early on. Which also makes playing early side missions and going back to early areas after you&apos;ve levelled up pointless as all the loot is underpowered, and which is another tick against doing side missions.
<br>
<br>This game is pretty but shallow. Which is upsetting as I was hoping for something a bit more subversive, gritty, and epic in scale. If you can live with the repetitiveness and want to get lost in the art style I recommend it. For me I&apos;m counting the days until Firaxis release Xcom.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2660577">Expand</a></span>

Now I wanted to love Borderlands 2, I truly did, but something about the game was rubbing me the wrong way all the way through. After finishing the second playthrough and clocked over 100 hours, I can say this at least:
<br>
<br>A lot of people, hell almost everyone keeps claiming that Borderlands 2 is a big improvement upon the original and that everything is better then the first, truth is it really isnt true.
<br>
<br>Some of the most important aspects are done poorly, the guns is a big important part of the game and in the original it wasnt hard to find a gun you found to be perfect. a uber shotgun with high accuracy, 30 round drum, fast fire rate, fast reload speed, pretty much the perfect gun. Well let me stop you right here, you will never, EVER find such a gun in Borderlands 2. Every single gun in this game has something negative to it, in fact I&apos;d go as far as saying they only excel at one aspect at best. Either you have a big clip, or you do high damage, or you have high accuracy, but you&apos;ll never have them all. This annoyed me greatly. In 100+ hours I never found a good combat rifle, never found that shotgun that felt just right, etc
<br>
<br>Another thing that is done poorly, especially in a game like this that promotes Co-Op so badly, is weapon sharing, it is none existant. in the original game, each character was subtly suggested to use certain weapon types, and this is further encouraged by getting weapon levels after using a type of weapon for a while, which increased the parameters for that type of weapon, for example roland has talents for assault rifles and shotguns, and by using those weapons a lot you get experience in those weapons so you are less likely to pick up other types of weapons and stick with those you specilise in. In BL2 that system is thrown out of the window, everyone is good with all weapon types, which is good, but it also ment I spent 60% of the game with a sniper...as did all of the people I played with, and whenever a weapon chest was opened EVERYONE wanted EVERYTHING, you never heard &quot;hey there is a good smg for you here&quot; or &quot;you take that assault rifle, i speciilize in shotguns&quot; they didnt think that through.
<br>
<br>third, and this is just a opinion but I found the humor just not the same this time around, part of what made borderlands 1 so good was the writing. The random events that happend and the dialogue the NPCs said it just fit really well in the world of pandora, even little things like the vendor machine dialogue  this time around the NPCs, most of which are newly introduced characters just arent funny, the cutscenes feel forced, the jokes are pretty lame, I didnt chuckle once at these jokes.
<br>
<br>Honestly I feel they focused too much on the wrong things. I can honestly tell you, that the few things that were wrong with the original game are fixed in the sequel. The poorly intigrated multiplayer, the constant wasteland enviroment and the relatively easy difficulty of the original, and in that sense, yes they improved the game, but they also butchered the well executed aspects of the original.
<br>
<br>Long story short, they focused too much on the story, the enemy variety and uniquely looking enviroment,  and weapon looks, but the cost was too high, writing is bad in this game, guns never feel good, and because everyone uses the same guns, co-op is almost pointless since everyone wants to use the same guns, and its impossible to decide who gets what this time around.
<br>
<br>I played it for 100 hours so oblivously it wasnt a terrible game, but neither was it exciting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2672558">Expand</a></span>

The humor is dark, although the story is a little more serious this time around. About an hour in to the game you really want to kill Handsome Jack, and if you still think he is a cool dude by then you&apos;re pretty **** up. If you liked Borderlands you will find that this is a true sequel that lives up to the hype.
<br>
<br>They did a great job of melding the story of Borderlands with Borderlands 2. I know, I know they are sequels but GearBox didn&apos;t really set the first game up for having a sequel. I guess since the story in the original was kinda of lacking it makes sense that it was easy to mold the two together.
<br>
<br>Overall Borderlands 2 is a great improvement on the original connecting with friends is far easier now that Steam has been fully integrated, even though it is still a little buggy when connecting initially. Maybe the best improvement they have made is the size of the game. The world feels large and looks large, not the mention it is beautiful. I can run this game on almost the highest setting on my laptop. (Note: I do have a ASUS RoG laptop designed for games but it is kind of dated) If you have a computer that can handle CoD you will be fine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2625053">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The world also feels bigger, but filled with more characters, rather then just endless desert like the original.  While its no Skyrim in terms of world openness, it&apos;s at least headed in the right direction.
<br>
<br>One small disappointment is the check point system remains the same.  You have to find a check point in order to save your progress.  Check points are so 90&apos;s.  Adults have lives, and they don&apos;t always have 15 minutes to find the next pole.  In the scheme of things...it&apos;s a minor complaint.
<br>
<br>Bottom line - more baddies for you to shoot, blow-up and electrocute.  Better voice acting, more story, better story, and all the FPS action of the original - it&apos;s pretty much FPS of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2625022">Expand</a></span>

The first review is more critical of the game on principle, so I wanted to review it as a game with all the additional factors stripped away. I used actual facts from the PC version, like the cluttered inventory system, the lack of dedicated controls for features like designating weapons as trash/favorites, the existence of day 1 dlc like the monster arenas and the gearbox weapons and keys, the poor humor that relies on tasteless internet culture like arrow to the knee and other references, and the several small improvements to the game such as the addition of new shot and grenade types, the better graphics and color palette, and the minor pc additions in the settings. What do I get for being honest and factual? Review deleted.

About 10 hours in, the visuals are nicer, the combat is fun (same), and there seems to be more NPC talking. The killer for me was the decision to replace the Borderlands protagonists with... mutant-twin-copypasta, lame across the board versions of the Borderlands protagonists. It&apos;s my fault for not pre-ordering the game, but I&apos;m now facing the prospect of waiting until mid-October and shelling out another $10 to play as a character that doesn&apos;t seem to be eerily familiar (reasonable or not, I almost instantly feel hostile toward developers who do this). During the DLC of Borderlands I started to feel like I was getting tired of exploring Pandora, and though I was excited going in my enthusiasm for Borderlands 2 is quickly waning. Too much focus was put on trying to make the story &quot;better,&quot; and the game as a whole suffered. I played Borderlands when I wanted to mindlessly drive around, kill things, and collect guns. I would have honestly been happier with the same playable characters and new adventures.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2632817">Expand</a></span>

Playing over steam with friends is as easy as playing native steam games like Left 4 Dead 2 with friends.  The graphics look great, the game runs perfectly at max settings with high end hardware, and the gameplay is fun and more challenging than the original.  The only flaw I can really find in this game is that the menus are unnecessarily clunky.  Namely, the inability to use WASD to navigate menus (Skyrim, anyone?). But really, this is a wonderful game so far, and a much better piece of software than the terrible PC version of the first game was. :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2625133">Expand</a></span>

The humour has become more awkward rather than cynical as in the previous game. I didn&apos;t get the point of the character called Tiny Tina at all. &quot;Deadliest 13 year-old.&quot; Seriously Gearbox, did you completely sell-out to appeal to kids? The lowest form of humour in the game is pandering internet memes like &quot;got an arrow to the knee&quot;. That train has already departed, it&apos;s not funny any more if it ever was. I gave this game a 10 before finishing it, today I&apos;ve finished it and came back to adjust my rating to a rock solid 7 only to see my previous spoiler free and completely positive comment to be deleted. Way to deal with customers. I don&apos;t care if this was done on the action of 2K or Gearbox, I&apos;m done. If you enjoy item hoarding games with a mediocre coop go buy it. If you want a quality single-player rather get Fallout if you want multiplayer get Left 4 Dead 2. I don&apos;t care about random stats items anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2643150">Expand</a></span>

Originally I wasn&apos;t even going to buy the game but it was gifted to me by a friend. After playing for a couple of hours I gave him the money he spent back on my copy that way I didn&apos;t feel like I had to play this boring game anymore. That&apos;s right, I spent $60 to NOT play the game. Also, apparently there is day 1 DLC? I&apos;m very disappointed and was hoping from something new from gearbox on this release. Just a big disappointment. Their &quot;new&quot; menu/inventory system is a lot more annoying than the last as well. Looks nicer but I&apos;d much rather have the old one back. The game ran well, and the fact they added more options in this one that you had to tweak manually before via the config files (ie: FOV), was a nice change. The commentary from the NPC&apos;s/characters in this game however are definitely hilarious and made the boring gameplay a bit more enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2627193">Expand</a></span>

I was hoping they&apos;d at least make it optional to not have everything respawn behind your back (like, only respawn on new games) but no, the second installment is exactly the same in that regard. Maybe some people like this, I find it highly frustrating! The game is pretty but apart from a clearly upgraded Borderlands 1 in some ways, it&apos;s quite literally the same game and plays just like it. I give the game a 4 because it&apos;s a good game in many ways, but for me the constant enemy respawn is such a game breaking feature that I cannot get in to it.

Netplay is 10-fold better than the original game, no longer requiring 3rd party credentials!  Get it when it&apos;s on sale, steam does it several times a year.  I&apos;ve gotten close to 100 hours on my first playthrough, but I really enjoy doing all the DLC and stuff the first time around.</span>

Because of the crazy loot, many parts have real badasses to fight that are impossible to solo, but a piece of piss in a group. It was nearly fantastic, but then came over leveling, where you can get matched up with people 8+ lvls stronger than you, but you cant tell because lvls stop being numeric at 72.  I don;t see the point in wandering around a make believe world where your buddies make the enemy evaporate, while you collect stuff.

<br>This game improves the weaknesses of the first game and reinforces its strengths. Its graphics and physics are improved, but they still maintain the cartoon-y/ comic book-y style. There is a lot more variation in the amount of guns you can come across and a lot of interesting styles of guns. The story is more in depth,  although not amazing, but most people don&apos;t play Borderlands for the story, they play it for the amazingly addictive game play, which they improved even more. What I really like in Borderlands 2 is there is a bigger variety of characters you can play as, some who are slow paced ranges units, and then the faced paced, up close,  Have loads of fun while you get your ass kicked, but at the same time kick ass&quot; style characters.
<br>
<br>Overall: If you enjoy blind violence, astronomically huge environments, psychotic characters, and dark humor, this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3363331">Expand</a></span>

It keeps me quite entertained, and even though I sometimes want to throw my computer through a window when I die, I still keep playing. It&apos;s addictive with an interesting story, and killing stuff never seems to get old, at least for me.
<br>
<br>There are, however, a few major flaws that really make me scratch my head. First, clipping in this game needs some serious work. Whoever did QA on this, is a complete and utter moron. Sometimes you walk up to a big step, and the character walks right up it. Sometimes you walk up to a tiny little crack in the ground, and the character REFUSES to walk over it without a jump. Sometimes you walk up to a tiny little ledge and while pressing forward against it, you jump and the character hops a little bit as if he&apos;s just hit his head on the ceiling. Stop pressing forward and just jump, and the character jumps up as it should. It&apos;s clipping failure left and right in every map of this entire game. I can&apos;t count the number of times I died, just because of this severe flaw. When I contacted 2k about it, they pushed it to the back burner, then never responded to it.

<br>Second, the inventory in this game is so strange, it&apos;s annoying. 99% of the time, you look at a weapon that is nowhere near as good as the one you&apos;re holding. It&apos;s extremely rare to be able to find, or even purchase, a weapon that is really that much better than the one you already have. Even once you&apos;ve finished the game and are doing some of the near impossible missions, it still seems as if the &quot;loot&quot; is worthless. OK, not worthless, but you can surely take it to a machine and sell it for cash. This goes for weapons, grenades, character mods, shields, etc. The absolute plethora of guns gets unbelievably annoying after awhile.
<br>
<br>Third is the health system. It drives me CRAZY that you can&apos;t hold a replenisher for health, in your inventory. You can only pick up health if you happen to need it at that moment. Health is never there when you need it, and is always there when you don&apos;t. The timing is ridiculous. You either need to be prepared for your battle, or be prepared to die because of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3284991">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Borderlands 2 is an incredible, breathtaking game. The storyline is engaging and hilarious, and the game features some of the best voice acting i&apos;ve ever heard in a game. The combat is addictive, especially when you&apos;re playing co-op, and there is nothing more rewarding then defeating the baddies and going to retrieve your new gun. The best shoot and loot of all time.</span>

<br>Almost everything I loved about the original Borderlands is here in BL2. I say almost because the only thing that&#x2019;s missing is some of the charm and humour of the original.

<br>Almost everything I loved about the original Borderlands is here in BL2. I say almost because the only thing that&#x2019;s missing is some of the charm and humour of the original. But BL2 is still a great game, and it improves on the original in one area  the variety of enemies. Again the visuals and sound design are impressive. There are plenty of maps to explore as you complete the numerous missions. The combat is well-balanced and challenging without being frustrating. And there are, as advertised, &#x201C;bazillions&#x201D; of weapons (too many, in my opinion  it&#x2019;s gets a bit tedious deciding what to keep and what to sell or dump). And it&#x2019;s a great multiplayer game too, especially with friends. I guess it&#x2019;s hard to match what was an excellent game first time around, but Gearbox have just about managed it despite not being quite as memorable as the first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3526923">Expand</a></span>

The art of the game looks awesome and you have millions of weapons to choose from! Also a second and third playthrough in this game is still fun!! You definitely have to buy this game, its SUPER BADASS!!!</span>

It&apos;s a very good game when compared to the rest of the FPS junk out there. I&apos;ve finished the original Borderlands twice and this one not even once - both games have a substantially long long play time but the first one, even with the paper thin story was very captivating and had a nice feel of mystery to it. Most great things from the original game are here too, bigger and better. What&apos;s the problem then? Well, the few things that are NOT bigger and better, in fact they are abysmall. Humor is almost completely lost, main antagonist is seldom funny and he tries too damn hard, complete with real-life references aimed at mom&apos;s basement reddit dwelling teenagers - it definitely kills the mystery. Jokes feel like something that came out of **** constantly poking fun at its own bad writing. The only part of the game that was really immersive and a proper &quot;Borderlands feel&quot; to it was the Caustic Caverns and I think Borderlands fans will agree here, it is the hardest and most fantastic part of the game, it has stunning level design, spectacular monsters and captivating story behind it - the whole place was truly creepy complete with Borderlands&apos; trademark black humor. After that level though, everything else was &quot;meh&quot;. What made me quit the game though was the new item system where you get a purple (epic) gun with super short range but a super uber snipe scope - original Borderlands had its &quot;funny weapons&quot;, yes, but in amounts of good taste. In this one though, MOST of the stuff is randomly geneated junk and you have an OCEAN of purple/orange items to compare in hopes of finding an ideal gun - this becomes a tedious and boring task. In first BL, ANY orange gun was probably better than what you currently had, in this one though you will have plenty of orange/yellow guns that are completely useless. As you progress in the game this will happen more often. You will end up using a purple weapon 10 levels behind you because all you can find is total junk even aften killing a major boss 5 times. With the &quot;gun skill&quot; attribute removed I was happy thinking now I can use any gun but I just can&apos;t FIND any gun that&apos;s even remotely usable. With that said I rage quitted the game after I finally found an orange Vladoff minigun but it had some ridiculously extreme attributes that conflicted with each other e.g. over the top precision that you don&apos;t need in the first place and too high fire rate but as compensation for those &quot;awesome stats&quot; it had massive recoil effectively making it unusable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3991068">Expand</a></span>

Borderlands 2 has crushed its prequel with modified gameplay, gorgeous graphics, hectic music and an interesting story. While the sequel improved in every department, its story took me by surprise. The strong, unique, and diverse personalities you&#x2019;ll meet through the well-paced story improves the entire experience. Most importantly, this gives life and excitement to the planet of Pandora, which was just a boring hunk of rock in the original game. The &#x201C;Bazzilion&#x201D; guns that Gearbox claimed Borderlands 2 will have was no joke, and it&#x2019;s more than just a few minor tweaks in damage and accuracy. The guns will sometimes have a huge bayonet, a wacky reload animation, a crazy looking scope, and may not even have any recoil. When the critics can only complain about an imperfect user-interface, we can conclude that the gameplay is as addicting as we all hoped it would be. Its well-deserved popularity certainly earns a nomination for Game of the Year 2012. For fans of the original Borderlands, this is a no-brainer, but for those who are skeptical about the unique gaming experience that Borderlands 2 has to offer, it&#x2019;s time to come to your senses and get in on the fun that you&#x2019;ve been missing out on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3124896">Expand</a></span>

Figured I&apos;d be in for a lot of action and fun. Well... if killing the same random enemies on dumb fetch quests over and over, getting relatively worthless loot and thus hearing one joke per hour is your kind of fun, maybe this game is for you.
<br>The respawn mechanics are simply ridiculous. Enemies spawning during boss battles - alright. I&apos;m not a fan of it when it happens so much but still. But then having to fight ALL enemies yet again after finishing a boss and backtracking (because why put a fast travel point maybe after a boss battle when you can stretch the game out by having the player go through the same **** multiple times) is unacceptable.
<br>And the loot system reeks of Torchlight. Within just a couple of hours of playing, you&apos;ll probably simply stop picking up white gear because it&apos;s useless anyway. There is so much useless loot that it&apos;s more of a chore checking it out rather than being excited about what one might get.
<br>Also, the controls don&apos;t really feel all that great. And It seems to me that the cel-shaded graphics make it more difficult to aim when you aim down the sights.
<br>It feels like a bit like a bad combination of COD and Torchlight to me. I don&apos;t understand why on earth people enjoy it that much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4016963">Expand</a></span>

<br>The issue I had is that every fight is the same  or at least similar enough that I lost the urge to see what&apos;s over the next hill.  I&apos;m not exactly sure where it went wrong because on the surface it should be very similar to Fallout 3; and I&apos;ve probably spent more time in that wasteland than is healthy.
<br>
<br>The quests don&apos;t quite keep me entertained, exploring turns up obvious but samey stages, the enemies look different but fight very similarly.  They fall on the wrong side of the line between challenge though smart AI and challenge though soaking up bullets.
<br>
<br>Lastly the sound and music lacks impact.  Not a broken game by any means but not one I found entertaining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3165377">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Navigations &amp; mission systems are of the game STALKER&apos;s. Some part of this is like Serious Sam. And ... Deus Ex was a once high score game, could someone point to me which part of this game has resemblance to it? May be it&apos;s weapon systems that has a lot of selections?
<br>
<br>Look childish &amp; console based, that&apos;s how Halo sells so well. But mixing it with cruelty &amp; some little horror theme? Confusing!
<br>
<br>Takes a good mind to learn how to use the inventory system, swap guns. Finding waypoints that went way out of the mapped map view with no pointed arrow ... huh?! Went into a new region that player don&apos;t has enough XP points and Level to venture on, impossible to kill anything in the new region, but able to break mineral rocks to collect level 30 XP weapons that can be sold for over $1,000 while back in the &quot;normal&quot; region you only get to pick up $1 to $3 from cabinets?
<br>
<br>Too much works put into this one, end up with not such a big mess. Playable, but knew better why other game makers wont&apos; venture down this kind of path since it&apos;s not cost effective &amp; less in revenue return.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5646800">Expand</a></span>

Everything, from the enviroments, the gun variety, and the humor are really fantastic and I can&apos;t praise the developers more than I can already. Aside from a few minor complaints, there is nothing holding it back from a major award. The opening mission really pulled me in, as Claptrap&apos;s hilarious first dialouge sets up the start for the game. Claptrap&apos;s dialouge in it of itself is very hilarous and at times moves the plot forward. Seaking of plot, this is an area where Borderlands 2 excells. Handsome Jack is hands down one of the best villians I have ever faced. The returning cast of characters from the first game are all given something to do and a role to play. Moving on, the variety is insane, with more weapons than I can attempt to count, and the customization for your characters is equally as impressive. The side quests in this game are massive in number and you will never find yourself running low on them. And the side quests play a role too, because you cannot JUST DO THE MAIN QUESTS. That is highly inadvisable, as the teeming hordes of enemies that Handsome Jack throughs at you towards the end will show no mercy when they cut you down. The drop in, drop out co-op is very impressive, and in my opinion, the only way to play. My friend and I(HUGE thanks to him) played through the game together from level 1 up to our current level of 29 and we have only scratched the surface of the multitude of quests this game has to offer. My only complaints are that the npc&apos;s in Sanctuary and the other non-enemy controlled towns are very bland and seem to use the same character model. The memes in this game are everywhere to be found and NEVER go away. Memes only tell us that your too lazy to write an actual joke so you have to take someone else&apos;s content. But nonetheless, this game is amazing and I cannot wait for the upcoming DLC&apos;s this game has to offer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2963745">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Borderlands 2 is hours of fun. Some minor details have been improved from the first installment to make playing smoother and more enjoyable. I&apos;ve almost finished my second play through and enjoyed it equally both times. The story is entertaining and the side missions never fail to amuse me. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is into this style of games.</span>

<br>When I got it for free with GTX660 however, I decided to give it a try. Initially, it all felt ok. But then... Let&apos;s sum it up: repetitive fetch/kill quests, frequently respawning enemies (which considerably messes with completing secondary (and sometimes  even primary) quests), idiotic checkpoint placement, horrible map designs (in terms of ease of moving), a lot of content is put into overpriced DLC etc.
<br>
<br>On the upside, it has nice visual designs, variate loot. and big maps.
<br>

<br>The basic storyline is just taken from Borderlands (the first game) Where the characters are trying to get to the vault. The same thing happens in this game, except it is with different characters and some &apos;Different&apos; Objectives.
<br>The game tries to make you play with your friends. I have noticed (while playing by myself) that it becomes extremely hard to complete bosses on your own, but when you have a friend play with you, you can kill him first try  For example, Wilhelm (a boss) took me two days, or 20 tries, to beat by myself, but then with a friend, it is one try. When it says  has joined the struggle! The creatures of pandora strengthen!&apos; I think what it means is  has joined the (non) struggle! The creatures of pandora Weaken!&apos; I have yet to beat the game, but somehow this game makes me coming back for more. My friend is kind of obsessed with this game, he is really good at it aswell. We were playing it together one night, and we agreed that we would complete the game and do True vault hunter mode, and then I bought ultimate vault hunter mode for both of us. The thing is, you will get bored of the game sometimes, and leave it for a month or two, and then when you have nothing to do, you go to it and say &quot;Please forgive me, oh great Borderlands 2, I need your great therapy for my looting lust&quot;. In fact, I haven&apos;t been able to not play the game for at least a month, because the great multiplayer keeps bringing me back. The gameplay has no &apos;special&apos; features to it, but in it&apos;s core it is just an RPG/FPS/MMO game, where it&apos;s fun to mess around online. Overall, I would only buy this game if other people on your friends list have the game and actually want to play it with you. The repetitiveness is easily forgiven through the great feeling of killing a massive robot and getting your first legendary weapon from it. My rating of this game would be a 87%, in other words, it&apos;s a great game, for a great price. As long as you don&apos;t mind a little bit of repetitive missions and storyline, the developers took their time to render and program over 100,000+ guns, which you will enjoy. Buy it only if you want it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3335796">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s a shame. Because the look of the game was really interesting. I could only recommend this to people that play nothing but bland console games and don&apos;t know any better, or teenage kids who might find the subject matter amusing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4011134">Expand</a></span>

Playing the first Borderlands and being extremely let down by the storyline, I was really hesitant to pick up this and play it, but glad I did.
<br>
<br>I am very satisfied how the developers tried to keep some combat elements familiar to Borderlands 1, but expanded and improved on them as well. Some sequels (Mass Effect series comes to mind) are notorious for completely redoing the combat system and physically changing the feel of the game, but not so with BL2.
<br>
<br>The storyline was extremely satisfying and tied up many loose ends from the first game, and was somehow both dark and humorous at the same time. The side quests were not mindless milk runs, and I genuinely enjoyed completing them for the interaction with the NPC&apos;s in the game.
<br>
<br>The enemies gave enough variety and difficulty to keep combat interesting the entire game, and the add-on packs even more so.
<br>
<br>I think one of the best features is that this game is fun both as a single player campaign or as multiplayer. The dynamics are very different for both playstyles, but both are equally fun.
<br>
<br>One negative I will point out with this game is how the graphics engine is coded and all of the glitches and bugs it produces. Similar to Crysis, it does require significant horsepower to run, and it is not because the graphics are &quot;just so phenomenal&quot;. Its because the rendering software was not optimized properly. During some parts of the game, I found myself in the heat of combat only to receive the lag spike of death and losing all progress since my last save.
<br>
<br>Overall, extremely happy with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3425696">Expand</a></span>

The game is great, even for single-players, until the plot has ended, and the extras begin.  Then, the game becomes unplayable unless you join a multiplayer group, because the post-game enemies can&apos;t be defeated alone, and require group mates.  This means that many players will be left out in the cold, and the money they spent on all the DLC will be wasted.  An ok game, but should have been complete for both single and multi-players.  Otherwise, it should just advertise itself as multiplayer, and not try to fool single player gamers into buying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3503845">Expand</a></span>

Borderlands 2 vastly improves upon the first game by having a very immersive and well acted storyline that really brings the characters to life and immerses the players in the games world.

<br>Overall, this game is amazing. Probably the best game of its genre in years. They must have done something right, because I cant wait for new DLC to be release so I can play the game more. Bring on part 3!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3471481">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I consider that this game has a lot to offer. yes  some say it&apos;s the first borderlands ,version 2.0  but playing the 1st borderlands, i don&apos;t feel that way. it&apos;s hell of a lot fun even if you play alone, but in co-op everything gets better  the story gets much deeper and  it has more replay-ability value  consider adding this to your game collection </span>

<br>
<br>Great characters keep you entertained with one of the most important factors of the game  humour. Cheesy yet hilarious jokes and references will keep you grinning through the game. Despite this, the emotion is amazing, with heartbreaking losses and betrayal. Co-op is also an important factor, as completing missions with friends is always an entertaining experience. Replayability is near infinite with open world action and upgrades plus new game modes to challenge you.
<br>
<br>The map is big with some locations that would cause you to want to plunge into. DLC with upgrades, missions and maps will continue to keep you glued to the game. Achievements are plentiful to keep achievement hunters happy. Overall, this game is massive. With infinite replayability and hours of fun, and dubstep, Borderlands 2 is an experience you must jump into.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3678575">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you liked the original Borderlands now imagine playing that after 20 cans of redbull and realising your boss called you and yelled down the phone &quot;sweet skagg-entrails! Take the rest of the week off and pay the damn game!&quot;
<br>
<br>It&apos;s more fun with friends, so if you can get a &apos;stable&apos; group together this is sure to be the most fun you can have with your clothes on with those people.

The game it&apos;s self isn&apos;t for everyone since the game is based heavily on rng and that isn&apos;t a looting system that everyone enjoys as a grinding experience isn&apos;t for them.</span>

Even RPG&apos;s you basically kill stuff and level up. So don&apos;t see how that&apos;s even an issue. You have quests and shoot anything you want, plus level up. Awesome graphics, love the characters. Its crude humor. If you are stuck up then yea you will be offended by some of it. You got a crazy robot friend, and a AI helping you. Honestly the only complaint I have is there is no split screen. The PC gaming community deserves it. Also the backpack is awful small and the bank. So basically you cannot have more than 50 weapons. Which sucks from when I played borderlands 1 and modded it so I could hold 700 weapons. I am a hoarder on this game. Besides that how can you complain? You get so much bang for your buck. Lol still cannot believe people call any game repetitive when in reality every game you play you do the same things over and over. You cannot name one game that is not like that.  I dare you to name one that you don&apos;t do that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6900248">Expand</a></span>

The AI is also bad, the highest difficulty consists only of getting one-shotted and trying to get out of down state. Weapons are way too unprecise, it&apos;s obvious that the game was made for consoles. Why bother aiming for the head if the bullet spread makes you miss half the shots even at close range?</span>

<br>My opinion is that it&apos;s a good game, but it&apos;s not a masterpiece. Graphics are awesome and some missions are really well designed but the overall story is not that intriguing and the neverending blabbering by Clap Trap is annoying as hell.</span>

It has perfect mix of comedic and serious game-play. The weapon system is simple, which works out well since there are so many weapons that you can obtain. The only reason that i give this a 9, is that the game is less fun in single player than in multiplayer. My recommendation, call your friends, and get playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2653531">Expand</a></span>

Some of the characters are done excellently; Handsome Jack comes to mind. Second play through: Not so amazing. 7.5/10. Gets boring rather quickly... you know what&apos;s coming, there are no new skills as by that point you can re-spec to any skill you want. DLC, in order of how I would rate them... 1) Pirates 2) Torgue 3) Hammerlock. Pirates was fun, new enemies, new vehicle (and the best one in the game, I think) Torgue was hilarious, and Hammerlock? Hammerlock was crap. If you bought the seasons pass, sorry. You could have spent the same amount of cash on the other 3 (1 not released yet) and saved yourself some trouble. It wasn&apos;t a 3/10, but a solid 5.5. The game itself is great... For a while. After that it&apos;s grind-fest. Still, I find myself going to my Steam library and constantly playing it. Now that it&apos;s 50% off, get it while it lasts!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2941909">Expand</a></span>

Taking on a comedy theme has put color on the harsh world of pandora in a way that make it shine. Of all I can tell you the only thing i need to say is if you have friends to play with and you love co-op games I recommend this game to you.
<br>
<br>If you are still reading you&apos;re probably wondering why I gave this game a bad score. Well it is because I highly disagree with how Metacritic bases there reviews. Instead of taking the collective scoring of all their reviews, they take the reviews that were voted most helpful. For example: a game gets the reviews, one 1/10 and six 10/10. If the one 1/10 get lets say four positive votes and the six 10/10 get none, the end score will be 2/10 for the game. I do highly recommend this game I just hope people read before finding a review helpful.
<br>
<br>If you agree with me please up-vote this review, and may I wish you a wonderful day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3631374">Expand</a></span>

<br>First off,  guns on B2 look too cartoony as compared to B1. It&apos;s so bizarre in designs that you&apos;d think it&apos;s an alien gun, unlike in B1 where it&apos;s more or less recognizable and familiar.
<br>
<br>Claptrap and General Knoxx were funny in B1, now in B2 you get this really annoying bad guy named Jack that tells you tasteless jokes,. not funny but plain irritating. On top of that they added some things that I felt to be completely out of line, like the first recorder and it&apos;s story(google it). It just sets the tone for a really depressing game. I can only play through it once, as it is that depressing and tasteless. It seemed the sense of humor of the devs got sucked out by some aliens or something.
<br>
<br>Also one of my biggest gripes is the huge downgrade of backpack capacity. You can tell from the excuse that Gearbox posted that the writer was trying really hard to come up with a reasonable response to the small backpack. They really screwed the pooch there.
<br>
<br>They would have had more success and revenue if they followed the B1 formula or just release B1 DLCs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3740734">Expand</a></span>

<br>Finally, the game has a much more detailed and more interesting storyline than the first. Yes, there are some stupid 9gag level jokes, but they can be ignored. Other than these stupid references, the writing is relatively smart, and entertaining.
<br>And last but not least  there is the fantastic soundtrack, which is much less irritating than in the first game.

Borderlands 2 follows this formula but adds to it. The guns, skills, co-op, have all been improved. However, they added an actual story, improved the humor (making it similar to the General Knoxx&apos;s DLC), had more memorable character additions, improved performance, improved color palettes and schemes across the board, average map sizes are bigger, and added more character customization.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll still out level most of the optional quests though, you&apos;ll out level most of the rewards for them as well. And aside from the ability to choose to hand in some quests to one of multiple possible recipients for different rewards, or the ability to choose different rewards from the same quest giver the mission system hasn&apos;t been overhauled much.
<br>
<br>This game improves upon BL1 in almost every way. Don&apos;t get this if you didn&apos;t like BL1, don&apos;t get this if you think that doing some of the same stuff you did in BL1 with fancier weapons, skills and graphics will be boring for you. Otherwise it&apos;s a solid game whose flaws can easily be overlooked.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2641608">Expand</a></span>

<br>The characters are lovable and unique in personality (Zero&apos;s my favorite, I&apos;m sure most people would agree), and the statistics are easy to handle for most players. The story is a lot more serious, and I got a pretty good feeling a Borderlands 3 is gonna come up with an even more serious story. The weapons have more variety and each of the companies that make the weapons now have more noticeable differences, e.g. Bandit guns have names like &quot;pro shooty boom gnu&quot; and Tediore guns explode a lot (i can&apos;t remember if it was Tediore; I haven&apos;t played in a while). Which is quite funny. Overall, I think people could give this game a try, it fits well for just about any FPS/RPG player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2674798">Expand</a></span>

While the original Borderlands was nothing groundbreaking, it was greater than the sum of its parts; a cohesive, run-and-gun action RPG that pulled the quest for better loot out of high fantasy dungeons and into the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Borderlands 2 on the other hand feels like it was originally supposed to be a console MMO (that was then canned when Gearbox got the message that MMOs don&apos;t make money anymore) and instead repurposed it into whatever this mess is.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with the most glaring gameplay issue: weapon proficiencies have been removed, resulting in everyone being mediocre with every weapon type. Throughout my playthrough of the campaign, the majority of my weapons felt like they were spraying wildly; even rockets from launchers would come out at random angles, often missing a target ten feet away from me. Instead you get Badass points, a system designed to reward you with stat upgrades for doing arduous tasks such as breathing or shooting bad guys. Sure it might sound cool to have more options, but when you&apos;re made of paper and all your weapons spray like you&apos;re trying to shoot with a jackhammer it feels more like you are disabling handicaps instead of improving your character. The worst part is these stat increases have diminishing returns and you are forced to spread them; less chosen stat increases appear more often when you rank up, preventing you from rapidly increasing in any one stat. Your Badass rank is account-wide, meaning all characters will gain their buffs. If you&apos;re somehow addicted to this game, that&apos;s great for your alts, but I was obvious dead weight for my veteran allies online.
<br>
<br>Loot options feel much more constrained in BL2. Gearbox can brag about the millions of guns but when the only worthwhile weapons are at the top rarities, who cares about all the blues and greens? Weapon effectiveness seems to dropoff a lot faster in BL2 (probably because of no proficencies), with the only weapons worth using more than 5 levels being uniques and legendaries. Of course these weapons should be the best and last for a long time... but why should I be expected to pull serial codes from internet social media to get a guaranteed &quot;worthwhile&quot; weapon? I saw a single legendary weapon drop during the 25 or so hours I spent playing through the campaign and even that was a mediocre rifle that was unusable after a few hours. The majority of the game I was using quest rewards because they were the best weapons I could find. Again, who cares about the millions of guns when I&apos;m using generic handouts from NPCs anyway?
<br>
<br>Of course all of this is just the surface of the problems with this game. After years of patches there are still tons of bugs (mouse cursor doesn&apos;t appear with a controller plugged in, getting stuck in surfaces, mouse movement breaking, various broken textures), the writing is terrible with all the characters being turned into unlikeable jerks, the story is way too long and padded with checkpoints for fetch quests, map edges are poorly defined resulting in seemingly random death pits, character classes are blander, weaker, and more boring than the original... the list goes on. I honestly hated this game and I just wanted to finish it because my brothers did. I would not recommend this miserable experience to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5128605">Expand</a></span>

There is so much to do, So much loot to take and trade, bad ass enemies and more. The comedy is silly and refreshing and this game will keep you busy for hours and hours.</span>

With the almost never ending DLC that always add to the challenge to this game. With all games it has its bugs, but with updates they can be fixed. It just takes some time. I love playing this game with friends with finding all the humor, bugs, and Easter eggs. So i would love to rate this game a full 10/10!</span>
