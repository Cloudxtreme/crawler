<br>The changes here are immense. It&apos;s like being in a mish-mash of every science fiction movie out there, with lots of elements/ideas coming straight from the Matrix.

<br>Before you buy, check out some of the YouTube gameplay videos and make sure you&apos;re not going to hate it. If you go into this with the wrong expectations, you&apos;re going to be very disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3435136">Expand</a></span>

I find the storyline to be quite entertaining as well to go along with the sandbox gameplay in general.  I can see myself playing this game for hours on end even after completing the storyline and/or the 100% completion.  It was a good investment I made &amp; even bought the season pass already.  Take it from someone who has played Saints Row from the very beginning, you will not be disappointed if you get SR4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3437304">Expand</a></span>

<br>My impressions so far is that this is a game that is extremely exaggerated and so over the top that you can&apos;t help but have a good time.  It&apos;s adult humor, non-stop one liners, and extreme action makes for a really enjoyable experience. I&apos;ll have to play more to really give an in depth analysis.

The (fully customisable) protagonist of Saints Row IV is a former gang leader-turned-president of the United States. Aliens invade, trapping the people of earth in a matrix-esque simulated prison, leaving a superpowered commander-in-chief to save the world. The game&apos;s first mission involves a nuclear terrorist threat and the action actually escalates from there, eventually reaching dizzyingly surreal heights. In gameplay terms, the Saints Row series has never been revolutionary. It started life as a Grand Theft Auto clone, and that&apos;s still obvious here, though the superpowers are well-handled, fun and easy to use. The real strength is the writing, which is second to none. Saints Row IV is a brilliantly sharp cavalcade of pop-culture parody, showing a care for good dialogue and wit rarely seen in games. It may be immature, but that doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t clever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3435100">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story is actually good, the gameplay is a blast, and the it looks and sounds great. It&apos;s definitely a unique experience that&apos;s for sure, and one that I am enjoying a great deal. All the &quot;over the top&quot; action and Saints styling I have grown to love. With a huge helping of Sci-Fi, and love, and lust, and blowing crap up, and laying the smack down is full on superhero fashion.
<br>
<br>Like others suggest, check the game out before you buy if you&apos;re worried about not liking it. And for the love of Pete, don&apos;t take it so serious! Sit back and enjoy the ride!
<br>
<br>Money well spent in my humble opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3435230">Expand</a></span>

Like many other users, I found this game to be Saints Row: The Third Redux. It should have been a DLC, but Volition and Deep Silver wanted to be greedy and make users pay full price for a game with 10% new content, the only blatantly obvious difference between the two games is the main story line. I was incredibly excited for this game when I played a few minutes of it at E3, not being able to play enough to know how much like The Third it really was. This would be a great game to get if you didn&apos;t already play Saints Row: The Third, but if you have you are most likely disappointed with SRIV. It is quite buggy, driving into invisible walls in the middle of the street, characters not animating correctly, getting stuck in menus, and if you play co-op, both players will not be able to participate in the interactive cut scenes, the person hosting the game will be the one in control of the cut scenes. There are major clipping issues on the characters in terms of clothes and hair, but the Saints Row franchise seems to make that the norm. Using certain powers is wonky and not user friendly as you must double tap a key to enable them. In conclusion, I am pretty disappointed and feel incredibly stupid for buying into the hype and purchasing this game. I hope this review has been helpful to someone </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3445595">Expand</a></span>

The problem is that Saint&apos;s Row III had the perfect balance of over the top action and realism.
<br>
<br>The game was really fun at stages but also pretty boring for some parts.
<br>Sometimes I had the feeling they tried to turn it from an open world game to a 3D platformer, making you climb massive towers or hitting a target after a jump right in the middle.
<br>The super powers make driving around through the city in a car completely obsolete. I only entered a car  twice during the whole game (except for the missions where you have to drive a car) just to realize that it is much easier and faster to super sprint to my desired location.
<br>
<br>For the first hours into the game I was really tempted to just quit the game and not touch it again.
<br>The scripted missions are great and the humor is delivered on the point. But after the perfect tutorial level it lasts pretty long until the same feeling comes up again. The pace only picks up after about 4-6 hours into the game.
<br>
<br>The licensed music is good, especially when used as background music for the scripted missions it is used perfectly to underline the humor or tension. But as before, the music is not as well used as in Saint&apos;s Row III.
<br>
<br>All of the character background stories from Part 1 up to Part 4 are recapped in the different &quot;Sidekick Missions&quot; which is great for nostalgic reasons and for people  who haven&apos;t played the former titles.
<br>
<br>Overall Saint&apos;s Row IV feels like more of the same we already know from it&apos;s predecessors.
<br>Personally I think that the developers forced themselves too much to be just a bit more over the top and absurd than before and lost something on the way of doing so.
<br>
<br>Regarding the outcome of the story, I have absolutely no idea how a potential storyline for Saint&apos;s Row V could look like. This is why, although being a big fan of the SR franchise, I hope this was the last game in this series, for I fear it will only get worse from now on.
<br>
<br>Looking at it retrospectively, I liked the game pretty much, but at first I really had to convince myself to keep playing and give it a second chance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3592419">Expand</a></span>

The game is quite enjoyable, with the unique style of the saints row saga, and it&apos;s well done after all. YES, it&apos;s almost the same as SR 3 was. But unfortunately, the corporation that developed this incredible saga is, well, condemned.

<br>the game follows the idea of an expansion much more than a sequel in my opinion.  it uses the same playground but adds &quot;more&quot; of nearly everything. more customization, more casual stuff to do, more cars, more missions, buffed up graphics and soundtracks  or so i think), more more more.
<br>
<br>in my mind  i had to compare it to a very nice &quot;stuff pack&quot; for like the Sims.
<br>
<br>i had quite some fun playing so far  but noticed that i did not care very much for the storymissions  at all. the characters did not capture me as much as in prequels. the superhero mechanics are nice, but render some coregameplay obsolete (like cars) in some instances  which is a shame.
<br>
<br>all in all, you instantly feel familiar with the game if you have played SR3  maybe a bit too familiar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3518815">Expand</a></span>

<br>Fraud is not easy so far, waste more time to master, why it&apos;s easy in SR The Third and not in this one? Have I forgot how to?

<br>Upgraded weapon can&apos;t downgrade for free, can&apos;t downgrade any of them at all once you upgraded.
<br>Why would you do this? Where&apos;s all the sense of humor?! Why so serious?!!
<br>
<br>More confusing and need more brain powers to understand the new system, kids will hate it. But more console favoured for gamepad as difficulty has been lowered. Just hate those button mashing moments!
<br>
<br>Best of all you can kill all those cops (aliens) to rid all the wanted levels, since you&apos;re superhuman!

To be honest, if you remove aliens, it seems you have the old Saints 3 underneath.

<br>Not my type of game, but I am sure that Saints have their own fans who will enjoy it.

There is a good amount of fan service and allusions to the previous games.
<br>The gameplay itself is pretty solid. There are very few bugs despite the game being a physics sandbox with superpowers. The game does get a little too easy once you&apos;re sufficiently upgraded.
<br>The only downside is that, while developpers actually made an effort to make secondary objectives seem important and fun (finally), it has made the main quest suffer from it and has made it very short as a result.  I finished the game in 20 hours and did all the secondary objectives, I think it would take a little under 10 hours to finish the main quest, which is a bit short for this type of game.
<br>
<br>Good if you&apos;re a long time fan of the series and don&apos;t mind a very wacky atmosphere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=4874067">Expand</a></span>

I feel Volition really took that to heart unfortunately, and so what we have in Saints Row IV is all that insanity absolutely maxed out, with any story simply present to tie activities together.
<br>
<br>The result is something that certainly feels a lot like those wacky SR3 DLC storylines (not surprising really, as the development for SR4 started off as a SR3 DLC) and not like a true Saints Row game. I know SR3 was criticised for the same (unfairly, in my opinion) but really any notion that this game has anything to do with street gangs vying for supremacy has been firmly thrown out of the window. What we have here is a game that is partly a spoof of Saints Row, and partly a spoof of Mass Effect, but does neither of those particularly well.
<br>
<br>Where it does succeed is in the various activities (blazin&apos;, the various rift challenges, hotspots, fraud, etc.) which are either new or improved over their SR2/SR3 equivalents. A large proportion of the side quests in the game are just doing selected activities in groups; while understandable, this unfortunately means anyone who likes to explore activities in the open world is penalised in terms of story (such as it is) as these side quests skip the activities already completed.
<br>
<br>Saints Row IV has also arguably taken another step down in difficulty, just as Saints Row The Third did over its predecessor. In co-op mode, the game will offer very little challenge even on hardcore difficulty for most players.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s certainly not a bad game, in fact it&apos;s well worth the asking price, but in reality what you&apos;re getting here is a $60 piece of Saints Row The Third DLC, not something that truly continues the storyline and feel of the previous games. Anyone coming to SR4 without playing SR3 is missing out on a awful lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3611709">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Saints Row IV is not bad, instead it&apos;s just a disappointment. This game is almost like a texture pack or skin for saints row 3. The game is still in Steelport, not literally, virtually in Steelport. As is shown in the trailers, there are super powers in this game, they&apos;re kind of broken. You get super speed running an hour or so into the game, so from that point on there is basically no reason to have a car, and upgrades to running and jumping also make it so there&apos;s not really a benefit to have a plane or helicopter either.
<br>
<br>As far as their implementation in combat, they are ridiculous, like in the last game, you can do take downs (run at someone right click on PC), they are lethal on your run of the mill cops/gang members/zin. In this game, you run so fast that you can take out an entire group, 5+, that you can physically take down them all before they can really even take a shot at you. In 3, you were limited in take downs by your sprint meter, and until your respect level got really, really high up.In this you get unlimited sprint fairly early in.
<br>Instead of making them better or smarter fighters, instead they just spam them, literally opening portal. to bring in large groups of zin. This does make the combat harder (more like longer), but if you play on harder mode, it makes fighting with a gun basically useless, unless you want to take the time to take cover from the battalion of zin taking potshots at you, it&apos;s much faster to just use take downs.
<br>
<br>The story is okay, not anything spectacular though, I&apos;m avoiding spoilers so I can&apos;t really get into depth. While it&apos;s not bad, it certainly feels sequel-y (Although saints row 3 is a sequel also, it went in a completely different direction than 2 or 1 did.)
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve had one major glitch, to avoid spoilers I&apos;ll be vague. I had to get out a place with a door that was slowly closing, and the glitch meant that the doors closed to quickly. I did a quick search and found that the solution was changing the detail level, don&apos;t ask why but it worked. This occurred around a month after release.
<br>
<br>This game also has it so when you want to upgrade powers you collect &apos;glitches&apos;, there are literally over 1000 in the entire game, and searching for them isn&apos;t hard but it is very, very tedious.
<br>
<br>This is a mediocre game overall, but following saints row the third, it&apos;s just so disappointing. If you&apos;re a real fan of the series or just the third and are still interested, wait until it&apos;s on sale. I haven&apos;t yet finished the main storyline and I only play because I feel like I have to finish it, although I don&apos;t really want to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3651066">Expand</a></span>

<br>Saints Row IV however I could only tolerate for about five hours.
<br>
<br>Whereas the first two titles, and to a degree the third, focused on delivering a not so tongue-in-cheek humored-filled parody of the Grand Theft Auto series the fourth installment instead decides to concentrate on upping the ante set by Saints Row: The Third in regard to its more ham-fisted ridiculous aspects.
<br>
<br>The result? A game that appears to have been conceived by a group of drunk twenty-somethings with the mental maturity of thirteen year olds (who are also possibly drunk).
<br>
<br>The game opens with the protagonist being the President of the United States who then gets attacked and abducted by aliens and thrown into a Matrix-style program world of Steelport. In this fake world the player is then immediately given the ability to fly, jump fantastic heights, sprint at mach speeds, and use magical powers. Recall the premise of the first Saints Row and just let that explanation sink in...
<br>
<br>You&apos;re literally given &quot;God-mode&quot; from the outset  making things like driving and customizing vehicles, using weapons, and even giving a second thought to the experience/ability trees completely moot. Everything that basically made the Saints Row series, on a gameplay level, an actual interesting and engaging experience has been thrown out the window in favor of gimmicks and flash. The game isn&apos;t even all that funny either which, when you think about it, is kind of a main draw of the series.
<br>
<br>I will not be surprised AT ALL if Saints Row IV is the last game of the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3735036">Expand</a></span>

This was Enter The Dominatrix, this was originally going to be a DLC for SR3. You can research this, this is true. And you can easily see this. You want to know how? Just look at the map. Apart from a few added set pieces, and a pretty new sky box that doesn&apos;t change, it is essentially the same map.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s look at the graphics, the A.I., the super powers that&apos;s were already in SR3, this was a spread out DLC they managed to turn into a game. But that doesn&apos;t change the fact it is one of my favourite games, ever. For all it&apos;s flaws it will remains consistent, and is good at what it does. Which is mad mad mad mad mad. And frankly I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3714330">Expand</a></span>

I loved everything about the game and have spent countless hours playing it. All the missions are fun including the side ones along with the gun fighting, especially the part where you get to blow **** up which is really satisfying, trust me :). I don&apos;t know why people compare this to GTA 5 as it is an entirely different game all together, so no ratings should reflect upon this otherwise the rating is pointless. Grab this game and have a blast!

<br>So the game. Super powers abilities are very entertaining, story is embarrassing, music is golden, but after you finish story line and few side-quests, it get boring really quickly. Co-op might be a help, but don&apos;t bet on it.
<br>You have no more reason to use cars or any other vehicles, because of your superpowers, only 12-year old kids always use army helicopter and that flying-rocket kind of stuff, cause they scary to get down and do things hand to hand, you know what I&apos;m talking about. Even on hard difficulty is game very easy, so I don&apos;t understand those players with pants full of sh.t who play it on medium and are constantly dying.
<br>I can say, I enjoyed playing this, but for 50 euro it was not enough. Give the game better price, you&apos;re asking too much for it, really. Not a bad game, but even not so brilliant, just over average I think.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3485914">Expand</a></span>

Buy it. If you haven&apos;t played Saints Row, or if you slightly disliked the previous games, read on.
<br>
<br>I was first introduced to Saints Row in a sort of middle period after having finished GTA4 and waiting anxiously for GTA5 (which I am at the time of writing still doing, but not for long). It&apos;s pretty obvious from the get go what the purpose of Saints Row is; it&apos;s like GTA, only a lot more fart jokes, explosions, nudeness, unrealistic characters and so on. If playing a game that essentially feels like nothing but a developer sandbox for six hours because you love explosions, Saints Row is fine. It is entertaining in that way.
<br>
<br>The problem I have with Saints Row is that it has no compelling characters, and no compelling plot. I will say that I have no problem understanding why this is, the plotlines are by nature ridiculous and over-the-top, but for me personally I just can&apos;t become engaged in a game that literally does not have a story.
<br>
<br>For SR4, you might say it has a story. I would say the story is a thin film, present only out of necessity, to tie together the millions of popular culture references (do a barrel roll!) and &quot;crazy&quot; events throughout the game. It&apos;s obvious that the point here was to make a game that was as crazy as possible, and that&apos;s fine. It&apos;s true to its roots, because this is what Saints Row has always been about. However, the bottom line for me is that a game without a story is just as bad as a movie or a book without a story. I wouldn&apos;t want to watch a movie with 90 minutes of fart jokes and pop culture references either, where it feels like the plot was constructed on top of cramming all that stuff in to make it sort of fit.
<br>
<br>So, if you&apos;re like me and you need an engaging story and characters that have more complexity than a sack of potatoes to get you through a game, I think this game probably is not for you. This game is for the choir, those that already know and love the Saints Row series. It&apos;s not for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3451460">Expand</a></span>

I know many people say similar things but it&apos;s true.
<br>
<br>The super powers are really cool but they make many things unnecessary in the game (basically each vehicle). There are cars/helicopters in the game but you will never use them until you are being forced (by a mission). You better jump&amp;fly because the waypoints of each missions located on the opposite side of the map which is really annoying. (I think the travel takes the most of the time spent in the game.) Complete waste of time. A new map would save the situation but It&apos;s the same as it was in the previous release. That&apos;s why I have to mark the game as a refurbished SR3  there is nothing left to explore.
<br>
<br>They kept some old activities and renamed/reskinned them. Lazy bastards. The new rift activities are... mostly &quot;meh&quot; for me. That rushing activity wasn&apos;t that bad. Plus they removed the best activities related to Genki. Sad panda is sad.
<br>
<br>The enemies aren&apos;t serious threats but annoying ars*holes. I hate when they throwing fireballs (whatever) at me 10 times in a row and I can&apos;t do anything just watch how I burn. This is not hard but annoying which is not the same.
<br>
<br>The best thing about the game (in my opinion) is the reviewed game menu. I loved that. Well, the menu responsivity is far from acceptable but it looks nice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3451627">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Beyond this the powers feel OK they don&apos;t flow well in my opinion and the movement never feels very precise.  Graphics are fine nothing special. Sound is kinda meh, I think the radio stations are really which you can say just use your own music but when that is such a big crux to your game I think that should be mentioned.  Writing is honestly the only place where this game shines but I don&apos;t think its worth suffering through the very repetitive gameplay.  In addition to these major flaws there are a TON of minor flaws that are just irritating to deal with so be prepared. I&apos;d say avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3464729">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s not GTA 5 and not aspiring to be GTA 5, look at it as a new game entirely or you won&apos;t enjoy it.
<br>
<br>Saints Row 4 however feels just casual and easier than SR3.
<br>Also if you have a bad gaming rig this game is pretty heavy as far as FPS goes, I am not effected by this as i have a top banana machine and play this game on ULTRA.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>1. Looks great if you can play it on ULTRA
<br>2. Very funny, probably the funniest I&apos;ve played, you will laugh from start to end.
<br>3. Easy fun, the more they give you the easier it gets, hard is really not hard
<br>4. Storyline, you do find yourself getting sucked in especially if you have played the previous installments
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>1. Superpowers, wish they did not add these they are fun but take away EVERYTHING the game used to be
<br>2. Easy to put down, you don&apos;t feel you need to or want to play it, i found myself going and playing something else
<br>3. Repetitive, there is a lot of missions but nothing new.
<br>4. EXPENSIVE!!! and boy you feel like you have paid to much for this game wait for it to be cheaper
<br>5. 0 realism, it&apos;s just a mash up of silliness and being truly bonkers
<br>6. It does feel like a reskin, the city is the same the engine is definitely the same it just feels the same with stupid attached
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not the best game this year not even close, but it&apos;s a good laugh, very casual and if you&apos;re feeling down play this, it&apos;ll improve your mood. i like it, but i do not love it.
<br>
<br>Look at it as something new not a GTA 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3454919">Expand</a></span>

<br>What happens if you take:
<br>
<br>1 part super powers from Prototype, 1 part collection scheme from Crackdown/Infamous, 1 part crazy weapon collection from Ratchet &amp; Clank, 1 part irreverent M-rated humor, and 1 part gratuitous violence?
<br>
<br>You get Saints Row 4 and therein lies the problem. The game is, at best, schizophrenic in terms of what it aims to be. While it continues to be completely irreverent and crude, often making fun of pop culture and other games, it&apos;s lost a lot of what made Saints Row the &quot;anti-GTA&quot;. Now it wants to be a super hero game, a mini games collection, and Saints Row without really committing to any of the styles.
<br>
<br>Running around gathering clusters isn&apos;t nearly as enjoyable as orb gathering from Crackdown or shard gathering from inFamous, the free roaming city design is utterly destroyed by the ease of traversing the entire city using super jump and super speed, both of which can be maxxed out within only 2-3 hours of gameplay time.
<br>
<br>It bears repeating that this was originally designed as a large DLC for Saints Row: The Third but ended up becoming a full game in and of itself. This is evident in the fact that Steelport hasn&apos;t changed except to add the new alien structures. The location of most events are in the same places as SR3, the models are the exact same, and the core gameplay is shorter.
<br>
<br>How much shorter is this game compared to its predecessor? Well, when I completed the main story, I had finished all the activities, side quests, and targets and was sitting at 93% completion after only 14 and a half hours. I spent shy of an hour and a half finishing up gathering all the collectibles and doubling back to repeat two activities for gold medals and reached 100%. On hardcore, I had reached 100% completion in a third of the time spent on Saints Row The Third.
<br>
<br>&quot;Why is this game so short?&quot;, you may be asking. Well, frankly, they gutted a ton of activities that was in Saints Row The Third for this and streamlined the number of stores, as well. For example, the Saints Row standby missions of &quot;Snatch&quot;, &quot;Escort&quot;, and &quot;Trafficking&quot; missions are gone. The &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot; clothing store is gone, and many stores have had their location numbers extremely reduced. &quot;Genki Bowl&quot;, which had at least 7 different activities in Saints Row The Third, has been replaced with &quot;Genki&apos;s Mind over Murder&quot;, which only has three (and two cameos of Genki Bowl as side missions). &quot;Buying&quot; properties has been changed into a hacking minigame that is annoying and tedious, not difficult. As for the activities themselves, other than one or two, anyone can get gold on them on the first try rather easily. &quot;Insurance Fraud&quot; which was one of the more challenging activities in SR3, has become laughably easy thanks to super sprint and the ragdoll mechanic (at one point, I had over a $1M combo, higher than needed for the gold medal).
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, all the issues with the SR3 engine persist, and Deep Silver have even compounded some of the issues. The engine is even more poorly optimized than SR3 and slogs even on quality machines. The game is a buggy mess right now, with the initial release crashing and deleting game saves, and the patch &quot;fixing&quot; this issue causing even more problems such as the loss of weapons, cache, and vehicle/weapon upgrades.
<br>
<br>All in all this is a very hurried cash in that, despite the humor, isn&apos;t worth the $50 price tag. It truly is nothing more than a quick &apos;expansion&apos; of SR3 that is really only worth about $25. My sincere advice is to wait for a complete or GOTY version, then wait for THAT to go on Steam Sale before picking it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3461634">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s extremely over the top. If you are looking for a GTA type of game this is not it. They&apos;ve taken a hard right off the path into insanity. It&apos;s more of an evil super hero type of game. There is a lot of content in here and so much customization. Having these powers does make things like cars obsolete as I run around collecting all of these data pods but if you want to drive the cars can be pimped out. Some of it is cheeseball such as after mission screens where your character is doing really foolish moves and some missions are a lot easier than others. I&apos;ve been playing off and on for about a month with 25 hours into it and I&apos;m 25% complete. So unless you hit it really hard you won&apos;t sail through this game. There are tricks to doing that like loading an apache type helicopter for each mission. The aliens just get devestated. That&apos;s up to you though if you want to take a few shortcuts and complete it really fast. I don&apos;t know if there is much replay ability to it. I really enjoy this game but once it&apos;s complete I&apos;ll likely load SR3 back up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3503066">Expand</a></span>

<br>Even on hardcore mode it&apos;s not that difficult, that&apos;s pretty much the only glaring flaw with it. There&apos;s also a few glitches like getting stuck in walls if you&apos;re slammed into them with a telekinetic blast, or enemies getting stuck in them if you slam someone into them with a telekinetic blast.
<br>
<br>If the game was harder I&apos;d give it a solid 9/10, if it was harder and the glitches were polished out I&apos;d give it a 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3466642">Expand</a></span>

It is an amazing game, don&apos;t get me wrong. But if you are expecting Saints Row 2, you came to the wrong place. If you did not like Saints Row 3, don&apos;t worry, I thought that game was utter s*** as well. But this, this is... Dang.</span>

<br>
<br>Yes, this iteration of Saints Row doesn&apos;t really innovate quite as much as the others did, but you know, it&apos;s still ridiculously fun, especially for something that almost didn&apos;t get created in the first place.
<br>
<br>Yes, portions of this were originally slated to be DLC for SR3, but the released product goes beyond that.
<br>
<br>Yes, portions of the game get repetitive (namely the non-story related missions), but I found that true for SR3 and *gasp* SR2 (which seems to be the Holy Grail for several of the people making negative comments).
<br>
<br>The story itself is actually pretty enjoyable (if not flat out ridiculous), and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it.  That said, I *did* pre-order it and get it for around $40; I don&apos;t know that it&apos;s worth $50, and definitely not $60, but I&apos;ve yet to see it for over $50 on Steam.  I&apos;m also convinced that anyone giving this a 0 either a) didn&apos;t bother playing the game for more than 10 minutes before reviewing it or b) is blatant troll-baiting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3473066">Expand</a></span>

And it should cost around 10 euors, NOT 60! This is not a new game, is just an heavy modified version of  SRIII with aliens! Missions are boring, repetitive, the story is nice and the story missions are good, but i can&apos;t believe they sold this game as a new Saint&apos;s Row. Very disappointed.</span>

<br>Saints Row IV adds more than you think it does. The gameplay is Saints Row: The Third&apos;s but improved upon to include super powers.  The story is much more better than SR3 as it has a full on plot instead of just wacky funny stuff that adds up for a story. The story ties up many loose ends in the series, bringing back old characters like Tanya Winters, Veteran Child, Maero and Julius.  There are a lot of hilarious references and parodies that the writers created in this game, such as using a typical Call of Duty breach and clear on the first mission, and Metal Gear Solid&apos;s stealth gameplay during a rescue mission.
<br>
<br>The game is by far a blast to play even alone, doing missions, side quests, activities, and collecting all of the audio logs and clusters, you can just roam around the world for nearly hours.
<br>
<br>If you liked Saints Row: The Third, you will love Saints Row IV.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3448383">Expand</a></span>

I heard it was originally supposed to be DLC, and was not amused by the fact that this was built directly from Saints Row 3. I was also just as nervous to see how far they would push the ridiculous factor as anybody else returning to the series was.
<br>Despite all that, lets just get it out of the way: I had tons of fun playing the game.
<br>The Saints Row crew really know how to deliver their story and make things feel epic when they want to. The Matrix theme opened up a lot of opportunities to explore things I have never seen done with a game, and it all felt really good. Being as skeptical as I was coming in, it took me a few hours into the game to decide I was actually really having fun and then became genuinely immersed in the game. The oldschool game puns are hilarious.
<br>Now, the game did have a few flaws; Superpowers require practice and some upgrading before they feel fluid; Distractions and other optional tasks such as takeovers, Professor Genki missions, races, or other challenges are now connected with sidequests, meaning if you stop completing missions to do optional tasks in the world, you will get ahead of objectives and could miss out on some character and mission dialogue, if that is even important to you; But the biggest thing I could complain about is the amount of content for the price. I beat the game at 40 hours and am nearly at 100% completion. I bled the game dry. There is replay value here but if I could have squeezed 10 more hours out of gameplay, I would have been completely satisfied with the bang for my buck.
<br>However, as of right now, this game has itself set up for the greatest DLC content we may have ever seen. There are so many possibilities and directions the game could take with this new outrageous matrix simulation theme. I really, really hope that they take advantage of it and put out some amazing DLC.
<br>I heavily enjoyed this game and am looking forward to more. Removed a few points for the 50 dollar price tag vs. content. Since this game was built directly from the older game that I was able to put 80 hours into, there is unfortunately no excuse that they could not stuff in more content. Other than that, great experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3456935">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game for me was very disappointing, also to me at least I felt a bit lied to about the whole thing. Now before I begin I am going to point out this now...I will not be judging this game on the fact it was originally going to be DLC, even though I could and make the score lower, I feel that&apos;s kind of a low blow as just because it was going to be DLC doesn&apos;t mean it couldn&apos;t be a successful standalone game. I am judging this game from a story-line and gameplay standpoint.
<br>
<br>The gameplay in &apos;Saints Row IV&apos; is very enjoyable, it is fun to run around really fast and jump over buildings. It is really stimulating, I&apos;ll happily admit that it&#x2019;s like you&#x2019;re a god in a world of toy soldiers. But that is one of the game&#x2019;s biggest downfalls&apos;. The powers in the game make you too powerful, you are able to get around the map so quickly and easily it removes one of the core features in these city-sandbox games...CARS!!!! They in &apos;Saints Row IV&apos; now have no purpose or requirement, they were originally there to allow you a faster mode of transport around Steelport, but since now you can just jump over buildings, run across the road at super-sonic speeds and, cars go soaring away like a candy wrapper in an updraft when you run into them. Another thing these powers have done in this is made the game SOOOO EASY!!! Now what I mean is they give you all these super powers to use but then they couldn&apos;t think how to make the game still challenging so they made the challenge &apos;fake&apos;, what I mean is they make it so your health no longer regenerates, so you have to get health pickups from enemies which are in large numbers that aren&apos;t hard to kill because of your superpowers (also why in Saints Row II &amp; Saints Row the Third do you regenerate health when you&apos;re mortal but in this you&#x2019;re a superhero and you don&apos;t?...weird). And finally about the powers is one fact that most positive reviews leave out; the fact that these super powers in a virtual world, already existed in Saints Row the Third&apos;s DLC in the real world...and in Crackdown...and in Prototype it basically takes the original ideas of other games and puts them in this (including its own franchise!) even USGamer says and I quote &apos;While the game&apos;s roots as Saints Row: The Third DLC are still showing, Volition has put together an amazing game from a wide variety of sources.&apos; even though it&apos;s used in a positive context here the point still stands that the game is just parts of other games. So to summarize:
<br>Vehicles: Useless
<br>Enemies: Weak
<br>Difficulty: None or Easy
<br>Superpowers: Unoriginal-ception!!!
<br>Gameplay enjoyment: Fun
<br>
<br>Now the worst half, the story-line...to put it bluntly, BULL CRAP!!! That is all the story is in this. The thing that most people say about this game is, &apos;this isn&apos;t a game to take seriously it&apos;s meant to just be a game to kick back and enjoy yourself&apos;. In my eyes that is what free-roaming is for, your own amusement, not the story-line! I remember a trailer saying that this was going to be &apos;The Most Dramatic Saints Row Game ever!&apos; but that isn&apos;t true because for effective drama you need a threat, tension and, believable characters to pull it all off and make you intrigued, this game has none of those traits. The threat in this game isn&apos;t threatening. I was never for one second convinced that the aliens would enslave the human race entirely and rule the world at the end of the game, because it was one large invasion! Since there was a large scale threat there isn&apos;t any fear that they will win because you know that for this scenario the developers wouldn&apos;t do that, but if there was one alien in the game who was superior to you in any and every way and he had a new character prisoner, there would be a small threat that is effective because it creates genuine tension. If Zinyak came alone to earth and was able to stop you very easily and had captured Asha who was just introduced that creates great tension because you don&apos;t if in this game their main character or a built-up plot point just ready to die at his hands, and the fact it can go either way makes great tension. There you go, there&#x2019;s a way to improve Saints Row IV straight away! Also the characters are just gone in this game, they just aren&apos;t them selves. And that sucks because I like these characters but in this I don&apos;t. The comedy is all wrong as well as the charm of saints row 2 &amp; 3 was it was serious and funny but this is just funny that isn&apos;t really funny at all.
<br>
<br>So overall I&apos;d say don&apos;t waste your time, if you take the time to see the issues with this game, you&apos;ll start to notice obvious flaws. In my opinion: save yourself $40-$50 and buy something else; crackdown... or Prototype. Seriously it&apos;s the same game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3501934">Expand</a></span>

I regret not buying the physical CD so that I could at least get the satisfaction of hurling it across the street and watching it shatter on the sidewalk.
<br>
<br>As a disclaimer, I actually liked saints row the third, thought it was an enjoyable experience, and gave it a 7.5/10 or so. Saints row the IV, however, does absolutely  everything wrong and gets a 2/10. You see, GTA and prototype had a baby, drank moonshine and did PCP the entire pregnancy, then promptly aborted the baby at 8 months in order to give birth to this brilliant abomination.
<br>
<br>Where to start. The game throws out any sense of logic, immersion, fun, and challenge right away at the door and CONSTANTLY reminds you that it did so IN THE DIALOG throughout the game. Your first moments in the actual game put you right back in the exact city you played in the 3rd one with a few alien towers scattered about. Same cars, same insanely dressed cardboard pedestrians, same buildings, same boring grey sky, same side quests, same outdated graphics. You quickly realize you&apos;re playing just about the same exact game with this new super hero system bolted onto the side. You can run super fast and jump really high similar to prototype. In fact the movement system is identical to prototypes except... *drum roll* no parkour system whatsoever!!! Expect to get stuck on light posts, fences, random overhanging ledges, or anything that isn&apos;t flat. You&apos;re really overpowered even with the new pickup based health system (one of their only good ideas). You also quickly learn a fireball spell which literally clears the entire field of enemies with a single blast with a powerful CC and spreading DOT effect. There&apos;s really no fun in being immensely overpowered and pointlessly running between the ship and the simulation to complete the same boring ass side missions over and over. Some were fun like the on foot/motor cycle racing ones, but no one wants to play them 10 times. By the way, your main form of progression in the game comes form tediously collecting hundreds and hundreds of glowing &quot;code bits&quot; scattered around the world... have fun.
<br>
<br>Apart from the game being really easy and the new movement system being annoying and jarring to use (even from a prototype veteran parkour master sensi), its also really really buggy. You can ram a tank and send it FLYING into space without losing any speed but a car you bump into while running can hit a wall, bounce off it, and instantly ragdoll you on contact and it happens ALOT (this goes for any debris as well). Cars going 40mph across an intersection also can ragdoll you even though one of your punches will send it flying over a gas station. There are an assortment of glitches and bugs specific to each mission that either slow you down a lot or force you to restart the game and could have easily been fixed if any amount of beta testing took place.
<br>
<br>As for the story, its simply flat, boring, and stupid. The game is mostly about you and Kenzi talking back and forth which essentially boils down to &quot;Hey kenzie, what&apos;s the plan?&quot;, &quot;Go disrupt the signal relay so the simulation code overloads and we can siphon data from the internal storage module&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Go shoot the big glowy thing and kill aliens&quot; &quot;Oh, why didn&apos;t you say so&quot;. Huh huh huh, that gets pretty old after the 10th time. If you thought the opening missions were bad, wait until you rescue Johny Gatt. Your entire crew instantly starts sucking up to him like they&apos;ve all been childhood friends in the most corny, cliche, and forced fashion you could possibly imagine. You get the feeling that the characters are literally begging for your forgiveness on behalf of the developers for even having thought about killing Johny Gatt in the last Saints game. Before that, you had to rescue each saint from their own mental simulations which was a good idea, except it was really repetitive, easy, and unimaginative. My favorite was saving Big Ben which ironically was a simulation of a scene from the first saints game. At least you can go around and have sex with every crew member you rescue, so that&apos;s cool... and confusing.
<br>
<br>Anyways, I expected a lot more from this game than a steaming pile of garbage. This will probably be the last saints row game they make unless the apocalypse starts early or something.

With that being said, I wanted the series to go back to it&apos;s roots with the mix of the GTA style sandbox with a side of ridiculous stuff, what did we end up getting? Neither, SR 3 or SR2. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily and here&apos;s why. A game can be is ridiculous as it wants but all it needs especially for saints row is a good story. Yes a lot of things from SR3 and SR2 are recycled but that doesn&apos;t but if the gameplay is fun (which it is) and the story is good (which it is) then I&apos;m all for it. Saints Row the Third failed to find a balance between the ridiculous and seriousness that previous games in the series had. Saints Row IV on the other hand balanced those two things in a different way, by amplifying both. There are a lot of nostalgic moments from the previous games (which I loved). So overall I don&apos;t understand how people can thing Saints Row 3  is a great game while Saints Row IV essentially improves on everything SR3 did wrong. The biggest question though is if Saints Row IV is just glorified dlc. Like I mentioned, a lot of things are recycled but by no means did I ever feel like I was playing a rehashed game throughout by 11 hour run-through of the main story.  I am giving it a 9 out of 10 simply because of how close it came to reaching the great heights that Saints Row 2. I feel that this franchise has really found it&apos;s niche in the sandbox world even if the third game sucked (Saints Row 3  6/10). So,  I look forward to future adventures with the saints.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3439567">Expand</a></span>

With some really great guns and an open world to wreak havoc on, it&apos;s a huge disaster sandbox. Yes it&apos;s got more nonsensical but it&apos;s not trying to win you over with a coherent storyline, it&apos;s trying to be fun and in your face. I like it.</span>

I was thinking in a 7 score but I have mixed feelings, more turning to bad, and for the yellow bar a 6 would be more fitting. Jeez I think I would stop believing in videogame sites reviews, they simply are more benevolent in some games just because the name lately than usual. Further more, very good games are underrated, buy I would prefer not to mention names. I&apos;m disappointed with this one. I have to mention that I haven&apos;t played the first ones, only the third and I liked it, very. I have heard that the third was a mimic from the others. I cant tell haven&apos;t checked that just yet, but I will base my review on the Third. This game is actually the Third but mutated as mentioned before. And is not the classic GTA style, just morphed into a Prototype so I&apos;ve heard maybe a Infamous one, a little bit. The city is actually the same, all is actually the same with very little modifications to worst. it&apos;s like imagine an ad from the third now imagine the ad with an ugly face. Bad. I don&apos;t know if this going to change further ahead in the game but the result is the same. Your character is more like a superhero that a successful gang leader or so. So like a superhero, you don&apos;t need more the use of a car and so on. This is not like isn&apos;t fun but; for the ones who liked the first releases, this is a complete letdown. In fact this 4th installment was released soo early. In fact feels more like an ad-on, that a new release. Maybe that was the first goal, and Volition just change of company or I heard so, that the result is bad. Well to be sincere, is not like is a bad game but neither a good one, just an average, what is lame for a successful franchise(or, it was?) This reminds me that there&apos;s a phrase to mention for the hyperactive people who always want to improve what doesn&apos;t need to be improved: If isn&apos;t broken, Don&apos;t fix it!
<br>But what is broken? Saints Row just need better graphics, a little more of everything like a working subway  a completely new big and different city, even the most simple solution like, only just imaging(is not like I have seen this before...)  if they like variety why don&apos;t they just release a new Saint Row with a 50-60s atmosphere? All that with the crazy humor and everything so peculiar of the Saints. I would certainly cheer and like that, meanwhile look like the Saints are  on the road to hell like Tomb Raider, Hitman ,Resident Evil and the list goes on ,I hope that Volition reconsider it for them and or us for he next gen of videogames PS4,Xbox One, PC and retake the path, and don&apos;t see another weird mutation next time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3491167">Expand</a></span>

I have found the experience to be undeniably fun, although short lived and cheap. On normal difficulty I had 100% completion in about 20 hours, which in my opinion is not worth the fifty dollar price.
<br>The strongest, or most interesting, mechanic in this game is probably the addition of superpowers in a sandbox-type environment, which leads to a lot of goofing around. Navigating the city by running around faster than cars and jumping over buildings was still as enjoyable at the twentieth hour of gameplay as it was during the first. However, the implementation of superpowers feels only skin deep and points a big spotlight on the lack of work put in by the developers. Now, most likely this wasn&apos;t entirely the developers&apos; fault, but rather a decision made by the publisher to upgrade from an expansion pack/DLC (that this game was originally meant to be) to a full game.
<br>Why is the implementation of superpowers so shallow? For one, the starting offensive superpower, the freeze blast, is the one that you will probably use 95% of the time in combat. Bad guys appear. You freeze them, which makes most enemies one hit kills, stops them from dealing damage to you, and breaks any special attacks that tougher enemies might be planning to unleash on you. Occasionally, the game will force you to change powers for some specific task, like a special game mode/activity, but there is no fluidity to using different powers in combat. What I would expect from a game with so many superpowers and ways to customize them is some sort of &quot;rock-paper-scissor&quot; mechanic or a chain/combo mechanic where you &quot;start off with one of these, then give &apos;em one of these, and give &apos;em two of those for good measure&quot;  all while peppering them with small arms fire. Instead, you drop in on your enemies unannounced, push the &quot;I win&quot; button(Q by default), shoot the survivors, and you&apos;re off on your next adventure. Nothing but a quick disposable thrill, just tie it and throw it in the trash.
<br>Now this game isn&apos;t serious, nor did I expect it to be (it is Saints Row after all), but you quickly run out of ways to goof around. There is only so many unique things that you can do. And I&apos;m not talking about &quot;activities&quot; or the mini-games, which you&apos;ll just breeze through anyway (and enjoyably, at least for me), but I&apos;ve found the sandbox experience rather limited. Your gang is essentially useless, since you&apos;re a one man army. The game sticks you into a sandbox, but all the sand is dry and your tools are useless; so the only thing that you can really build is a big dune.
<br>Despite everything I&apos;ve said, Saints Row IV is not a bad game. You will probably enjoy playing it, but don&apos;t expect the feeling of a full game. For a 20 hour long experience, the material presents itself ok, throws a few decent punch lines your way, metaphorically speaking, and leaves before it overstays its welcome. It&apos;s just not worth the ticket price. Just a publisher looking to cash in on some recently bought intellectual property.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3446464">Expand</a></span>

<br>You have some people who just want to repeat the same old tedious nonsense over and over. They&apos;ll sit down and do the same thing day in, day out. They don&apos;t get bored, they have no sense of quality, and that&apos;s why franchises continue to sell so well despite never changing their formula.
<br>
<br>So, what&apos;s the biggest complaint in the negative reviews of Saints Row IV? It&apos;s different. It&apos;s entirely out of left field, and that&apos;s fun. Not everyone wants fun, most people want to retread the same ground, and they hate anything new and original. They&apos;re not interested in Saints Row IV because it isn&apos;t exactly the same as Saints Row II, and they&apos;ll come up with any lacklustre excuse to hide this.
<br>
<br>Some people aren&apos;t meant to be awesome.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m awesome, personally. And I&apos;m having a fantastic time with this game, since it&apos;s something novel and a bit different. And it has that elusive quality which many games lack. What quality, you ask? What is this elusive, strange quality which games have been so bereft of, lately?
<br>
<br>Fun.
<br>
<br>Saints Row IV is awesome. It&apos;s fun.
<br>
<br>Not everyone can be fun, and not everyone knows how to appreciate fun. Some people will spend their afternoons grinding away in Call of Duty, and to those poor souls, that&apos;ll be &quot;fun,&quot; because they have very distorted view of fun. To me, sitting on your arse, grinding through bland, boring levels, finding places to lie down with your sniper rifle to take potshots? That&apos;s about as fun as filling out a form, or doing taxes.
<br>
<br>Fun is exhilarating, fun is thrilling, fun has you sitting on the edge of your seat. Fun is awesome.
<br>
<br>So, if you value fun? If you&apos;re awesome? Saints Row IV is for you. Simple as that. Ignore the boring twerps who simply can&apos;t handle it, and do try not to become one of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3448130">Expand</a></span>

So if u are looking for a fun game with no sense of logic and just want to f*ck things up, go for it.

<br>
<br>In my eyes, it&apos;s just an Expension Pack, priced as a whole new game. It&apos;s definitely not a new game. If you liked SR III like I did, you&apos;ll like it but since it&apos;s a new game you won&apos;t be too impressed by it.
<br>If you hated SR III, you&apos;ll hate this game too. Because it&apos;s the same game.

This is a game with many references to the popular movies and games (Terminator, MGS, Robocop, Space Invaders, Mass Effact series...). Has a better story than SR3. Technical issues are here too. My final verdict is nine.</span>
