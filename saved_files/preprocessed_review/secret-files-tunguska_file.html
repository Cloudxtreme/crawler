Some of the dialogues made me wonder if the developers even looked / listened to it themselves. Worst part about the game must be some of the puzzles, where there&apos;s absolutely no hint, just trial and error and the solution is something rather over-the-top. At some point you even have to go back to the very beginning to pick something up that has never been there before. The ending is a bit &quot;meh&quot; as if they ran out of ideas. Another thing that had me groan a few times is the walking speed which cannot be adjusted. The graphics look pretty decent for its time and there&apos;s plenty of original stuff in there as well. All in all, it&apos;s a very decent point and click game which has the continue-to-play value, but mostly a 1-time-experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/secret-files-tunguska/user-reviews?user_review_id=741963">Expand</a></span>

(2) The dialog was....not good. Sometimes embarassing. And (3) the puzzles were the &apos;combine some items&apos; type, which are a good adventure game staple....but there were about as contrived as &apos;puzzles&apos; of this type get. Before long, I was sick to death of guessing what inane &apos;improptu tool&apos; I was supposed to make with the things in my inventory. And the voice acting was, all to often, bordering on abysmal. (To be fair, a few of the actors do a good job...and I feel like those were the same voices that seemed familiar from anime dubs.) But between the weird &apos;never use contractions&apos; thing, the odd phrasing and word choice (that I imagine stems from the US version of the game being translated from a non-English language original), the fourth-wall stuff (&quot;I managed to open the door! Don&apos;t you love playing adventure games where the main character addresses the audience?&quot;) and the main character&apos;s voice acting being all over the place in terms of quality, I was having a hard time bringing myself to slog through this game. So...I looked up a walkthrough. I don&apos;t like wasting money by buying a game then just plowing through it, but this game wasn&apos;t giving me a reason to play it. So by the time I finished the game, I&apos;d seen the extent of its dull, inane, meandering story; I&apos;d heard plenty more bad voice acting; I&apos;d enjoyed plenty of robotic animation; I&apos;d had to play &apos;hunt for the pixels that I can click on to find an item that the walkthrough tells me is there&apos; more times than I&apos;d liked; and I&apos;d gone through puzzles that, had I played the game organically, probably would have meant resorting to systematically trying to combine everything in my inventory until I stumbled across the right pairing. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game to anyone unless they&apos;d run out of other adventure games to play and needed one that would probably taken them a long time to get through. Upside: the game runs without crashing. That&apos;s worth a 2, I suppose.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/secret-files-tunguska/user-reviews?user_review_id=2086600">Expand</a></span>

This is an incredibly fun point and click game. It is very addictive and probably the best point and click i have ever played. I feel sorry for the critics as i doubt they got through it without a walkthrough, if the even got through it.</span>

<br>- Gormless inventory combinations. And since at times your character tells you that she won&apos;t do something until she has a good reason, it&apos;s particularly baffling: you&apos;ll endure throngs of actions that make no sense to you, the player.
<br>- Abysmal voice acting with intonations all other the place and ridiculous accents that make even a non English native speaker cringe.
<br>- Dialogues ranging from asinine to infantile.
<br>- Pixel hunting, despite the existence of a hot spots key.
<br>- Responses to a small set of possible actions only.
<br>- A terribly annoying main character, moreover afflicted with nasal logorrhea.
<br>- No humour. Or more likely failed humour.
<br>- Dull scenery. For a couple of nice landscapes, you&apos;ll spend most of your time in bland rooms, not to forget a truly disgusting toilet scene.
<br>- Generic plot, complete with conspiracy, nonsensical motivations, unrealistic science, plot-holic events, all good for a parodic game but rather distracting here.
<br>- All puzzles so easy that they are completed in 10 seconds tops with minimal thinking.
<br>- And much, much more !
<br>
<br>The visuals are fine. The atmospheric background sound is often quite good, although not fully translated (like the German voices heard through walls in a Cuban asylum.) The interface is average. All in all, there are worse games out there, on a technical standpoint, but this one is definitely not pleasant to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/secret-files-tunguska/user-reviews?user_review_id=6084308">Expand</a></span>
