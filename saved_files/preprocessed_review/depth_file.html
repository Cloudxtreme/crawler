This makes for a extremely terrifying experience at times or extremely fun depending how you look at it. Playing as a Diver you are able to choose from pistols,rifles and harpoons to use once you can afford them. Learning all the weapons and finding what works best for you and on what level is necessary but very enjoyable. You can also buy temporary items like motion sensors,mines,Health etc. Sharks also have many different ways to spend there points as they level up and depending on what type of shark they are some abilities may be more essential then others. The game is fairly balanced if the teams are working together and the map is forgiving at times, Some rounds may feel bit one sided for the sharks if your team isn&apos;t cooperating.
<br>Depth is a great Multiplayer Shooter for anyone looking for something slightly out of the normal for the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/depth/user-reviews?user_review_id=5570353">Expand</a></span>

If you take a really bad game like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare you see there is a huge difference how users rated the game and critics. Im not sure how it works? Do they really get paid or is it advertisement which they wont get if the review is bad?</span>

I absolutely love it too! I think it could become one of the biggest indie hits of the year.
<br>Depth is in essence an asymmetrical multiplayer-only game about treasure hunting divers and sharks trying to kill them. It&apos;s polished for indie, and very well balanced. Playing the shark is absolute blast, but playing a diver is fun too, scary kind of fun.
<br>There are two Great White sharks (played from 3rd person) pitted against four human divers (1st person). Sharks have superior speed, vision and strength and razor sharp teeth, but divers have waterproof guns and other gadgets. The game takes place 100% underwater, in 5 different maps (free DLC maps coming later). Divers are trying to escort a safe-cracking ROV robot through waypoints, collect treasure, sticking together and trying to fight back sharks lurking in the darkness. A heartbeat sound indicates how close a shark is, but not it&apos;s direction, which creates paranoia and fear in diver players. Sharks can destroy some roofs and walls, to create new attack routes. Divers are slower than sharks, but have  assault rifles, pistols, nets, harpoon, mines, flares and such. Even a small vessels, which can be used to drive around. Sharks have &quot;Evolutions&quot;, which mean unlocking faster speed, better vision etc, but both sides start every round with nothing (Counter-Strike style) and must earn their unlocks. Divers use treasure they collected from safes (+ some extra laying around), sharks get an Evolution Point for each kill. Humans need to stick together, and getting separated from group usually means that you&apos;re going to be shark food, especially against competent shark players. Sharks work together too, for example other one creating distraction by thrashing a wall to draw attention.
<br>
<br>All  of the maps are mostly very dark since it&apos;s deep sea, and flashlight + flares light the way. The game is very polished in both visual and gameplay sense, only thing I could nitpick about is the system to join and search for games. It has had occasional joining problems at launch, I&apos;m sure they will fix that ASAP.
<br>I highly recommend this title. It has fairly unique idea, visceral and tense action, scary atmosphere (for diver team) and lot of teamwork...  kind of Left 4 Dead vibes here, but different. High polish, good balance and it seems to have strong community and support from devs. Ready up your wetsuit and jump in!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/depth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4656631">Expand</a></span>

I have wanted it for quite a while, I love the PvP concept with different species.  I was blown away with how good it is.  My time with it has been very well spent.  This game is INTENSE!  This is what I wanted from Evolve, which was disappointing.  Does Depth still have some rough edges? Yes.  Does it matter when you&apos;re playing? NOT ONE BIT!  :D
<br>
<br>Playing as a diver is stressful, in a good way.  They&apos;ve done a great job on the atmosphere and feeling of it.  Hearing your heartbeat speed up is a great indicator of the increased danger, I love it.  It&apos;s never a completely one-sided battle, sharks are fast, divers have tech.  Currently no difference in the divers that I can see, it&apos;s all about your load-out.
<br>
<br>The sharks all have different strength and weaknesses.  Playing as a shark is fantastic, really gives you that &quot;hunting&quot; feel.  Find a shark you&apos;re good at and stick with it, there are a lot of differences.  I go Great White, my friend I played with goes Tiger Shark.
<br>
<br>I honestly enjoy both modes equally, they give such different experiences, it&apos;s almost hard to believe it&apos;s the same game.
<br>
<br>Developers seem to be putting good work into the game, updates are well-stocked with features and fixes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/depth/user-reviews?user_review_id=5323430">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Me and my buddies, after watching a couple of YouTube videos, decided to all chip in and buy the 4 pack. We pretty much went crazy from there, and we practically played this game every time we met up after class. We laughed, we cried, we conquered. Even now, we&apos;re still playing!
<br>Even if you don&apos;t have friends to play with, the community has tons of people (or at least in my experience), so finding someone to play with shouldn&apos;t be a problem.
<br>
<br>For $25, I think this game is worth it. If you&apos;re THAT cheap, just wait for the Christmas sale in a few weeks.
<br>
<br>Hopefully, they&apos;ll add more content like extra sharks, gear, and player models, but still, I had a blast, and I highly recommend this game to anyone and their mothers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/depth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4812487">Expand</a></span>

The original game was also very fun, starting with a lot of items and 5 new maps, and they continue to add more things. I recommend this PC game highly. The only fault is that there are not many game modes. and even if they were starting out with only one and will continue to add more, i think that they should have added more to the original game. Still, I highly recommend this game and this should be added to more people&apos;s steam libraries.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/depth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4934667">Expand</a></span>

Playing as a diver is all about sticking together with your team and trying to collect treasure as quick as possible so you can upgrade to better weapons/gear. Shark gameplay is more stealth, sneaking up, attacking quick and getting the heck out of there before the rest of the divers see you. All in all, definitely worth the $15 price I paid for it on Steam! Developers seem to be continuously adding more stuff such as Megalodon mode too which  is awesome considering it&apos;s a free update for anyone who already owns the game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/depth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4892858">Expand</a></span>

<br>t&apos;s very good that the shark is not alone and btw a very cool character to play, and i hope they improve the game up to more sharks / divers per scenario.
<br>One of the major weaknesses in the similar game evolve which i only played an alpha, is the fact that every mod is the same 1vs4 and this got me bored very quick.
<br>So i hope the ame will improve further because the setting is really interesting.

See it as a assymetric multiplayer horror game with fast paced gameplay. Some say it is better than Evolve and I can`t really disagree. As of now you can buy this game because the player numbers are substantial for good mp experience. You don`t need elite players to enjoy this game. Anyone can pick it up, play with people who they don`t know and still have a great time. It is very hard to break the experience because most of the people are focused on having fun toghether. I did not encounter any cheaters or exploiters.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY
<br>Gameplay quality surpasses most other games in my opinion. Digital Confectioners made it a bulletpoint for a good reason. A mouse with two buttons and few keyboard keys is all that is needed. Everything is smooth and fast. Controls of both sides : sharks and divers are simple and work very well, povs are good. Everything is easy and intuitive. Anyone can play this game with success.
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS
<br>A bit dated. Textures are very low quality here and there but that concerns mainly the maps. This is visible particulary in shipwrecks and on ground (sand) textures. Other than that the player models are well made, have some nice details and move exactly like they should. Divers swim like humans do, sharks wiggle like they really do. It really feels like swimming under water, All the colors are there. As a diver you WILL get scared and as a shark you feel like a perfect killing machine. The higher you go, the more sunlight there is. Personally I`d add a bit more turbidity and take away some light. Overall graphics do not limit the experience, the game is scalabe and works well even on weak PCs.
<br>
<br>MAPS
<br>10 maps so far. Makes for good entertainment but the devs need to add some more otherwise it can become boring a bit. In multiplayer the maps are randomised so typically 3-4 make for most matches.
<br>The environment is ok, the sharks can crack some walls to make new ways for themselves. There are few routes to get into the same location. One of the maps (a flooded mine) is a labirynth. There needs to be some more variety or mp numbers will shrink quickly.
<br>
<br>MUSIC/FX
<br>A little weak. Should be better. I do like the interface sounds though the player sounds, the water effects, the gun effects need some work. For me it is of low quality like listening to a bad recording. A shame because if the sounds were as good as the graphics, the horror of fighting sharks would be simply breathtaking, maybe even unbearable. As of now you know you are playing a game and you get used to it.
<br>
<br>MULTIPLAYER
<br>So this is only multiplayer game.
<br>Very cool idea wrapped in a game that everyone will understand and be able to have fun with. Main type of match is 4 divers, 2 sharks and 30 tickets for either teams. Two other modes are not so good and are usable only when you want to take a break from the usual stuff. So the main match mode is very addicting. You do some treasure hunting, you do some shark hunting, you do some fighting for your life, you do some diver hunting. Interesting stuff. 50 hours of multiplayer is easy to break in this game.
<br>Many people online daily so far. Time between matches is about 5 minutes. Easy to find fluid, lagfree games. The casual nature of the game however results in lack of coordination in most matches. Most of the things is improvised although the game is so simple that everyone gets the point and knows what to do and how. Newbies are apparent but don`t get to ruin matches too often. I also spotted some balancing issues which should be resolved. Some skills imo are just fillers whereas many many cool ideas simply didn`t get implemented.
<br>
<br>Devs still support the game. Some new mode has been added few days ago. Bugs, as few as they are, are being worked on. I hope this game will still grow. A one of a kind multiplayer experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/depth/user-reviews?user_review_id=5377463">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I like this game, it features an unusual underwater feature which enables 3d movement ( swim up / down ) . This adds a bit more depth to the game (sorry). It is surprisingly well balanced for such an unusual deathmatch model. You could check the amount of players on steamcharts.</span>

<br>But there is a big setback for some people in this game,
<br>It suffers from a lack of content in this current state.
<br>But the developers Digital Confectioners have promised to keep adding content to the game.
<br>So overall I enjoyed it a lot but the lack of content within Depth must be fixed to give the game a longer lifetime.</span>

-5 shark species with unique active abilities and passive stats

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-5 shark species with unique active abilities and passive stats
<br>-cool counter-strike like weapons and perk system
<br>-spooky atmosphere, great visuals, is OPTIMIZED (something which is rare in PC gaming nowadays, oh how the mighty have fallen)
<br>-FUN AS **** people saying it lacks variety? you could say the same thing about every modern game but it&apos;s never a point that&apos;s brought up on other game reviews, just goes to show that game journo&apos;s are payed out
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-no singleplayer campaign (well the game is $20, I&apos;d gladly pay for some campaign like DLC)
<br>
<br>Buy this now if you love sharks and shooters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/depth/user-reviews?user_review_id=5315346">Expand</a></span>
