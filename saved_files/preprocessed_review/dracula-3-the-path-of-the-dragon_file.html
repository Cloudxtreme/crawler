<br>
<br>That said, &quot;Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon&quot; is one of the best adventure/puzzle games of the past five or six years.
<br>
<br>Simply, the combination of plot, setting and characters is spectacular.
<br>
<br>The attention to detail is of first quality, the climax of well structured, the tension perfectly developed.
<br>
<br>A truly, enjoyable, horror/gothic adventure and some characters are to remember (except Dracula... that appear strangely out of context...).
<br>
<br>Personally, I find it really a great product, and, among other things, accessible, to date, at very low cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dracula-3-the-path-of-the-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3722112">Expand</a></span>
