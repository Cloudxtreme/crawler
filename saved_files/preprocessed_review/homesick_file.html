Maybe because it would shorten this short game even more? No, that is not the right way. Five points for some nice ideas and the really good graphics. But not more, because to slow and the story ... at the end ... not really mind-blowing.</span>

<br>I should make clear that the players willingness and ability to actually immerse her/himself into the game is crucial in order to enjoy it. This is a very tranquil - very slow game - right on the edge of a walking simulator.
<br>
<br>When in the right mood for such a game - it is an easy 8/10 ... when not in a kind of melancholy mood - it may be a 2/10 for being quite boring. But i d rate it an 8 - because i would assume that people buying that game know what it is about - and know how to enjoy such a game. (which is people that enjoy games like Esther or Gone Home)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homesick/user-reviews?user_review_id=5291027">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The walking in this game is dreadfully slow, and you have no way to sprint or alter the walking speed in any way. This is a big flaw, as it makes moving around awfully tedious. I mean, I appreciate that you want us to take it slow and all, but if I&apos;ve forgotten something in a room 100 metres away, it should not take me thirty seconds to get there! Why couldn&apos;t you just add a sprint button? It would make the game much less tedious.
<br>
<br>This game lacks areas. For an exploration game, this game has shockingly few areas to explore. They are bloody gorgeous, though.
<br>
<br>There was at least one puzzle I genuinely liked, the others were a bit &quot;meh&quot;. Most of them have to be figured out without any instructions, which makes some of them rewarding, but most of them were just... obtuse.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t really speak for the story, as I didn&apos;t really feel the need to read all of the notes and books scattered around the place. The awfully slow walking speed I mentioned before is to blame.
<br>
<br>All in all, this game was a disappointment. The visuals are gorgeous, but the dreadfully slow walking speed made it hard for me to enjoy the game as a whole.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homesick/user-reviews?user_review_id=5483110">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Ok, so this is an adventure, I don&apos;t need to explain what that is, right? Let&apos;s get to the chase. I rated it a 4, meaning it needs an additional two notches before I could recommend it. The big beef with this game I have is that by the time  you have the ability to understand the details of the main story, you&apos;re done with the game.
<br>
<br>Let me explain. At the beginning of the game you can&apos;t read. the books and notes you read do not make sense. However, when you have solved all puzzles, you can read again because you have re-learned reading again. To know the full story, you need to backtrack and read the books and notes you have encountered throughout the game. But by that time, I wasn&apos;t interested anymore! You see, I solved what needs to be solved, and at the end you have a fairly good notion of what has happened.
<br>
<br>So you can&apos;t read and you move from puzzle to puzzle. You move very slow. You can&apos;t sprint or run. You walk. It goes agonizingly slow. I thought it was to set the tone for what&apos;s coming next, but nothing noteworthy arrived. You just crawl from puzzle to puzzle. And that didn&apos;t make sense at all. Exactly this is my second major beef with this game. I didn&apos;t mind the slow pace, but I do mind when you&apos;re not allowed to join the context of it, which turns out to be a sad story.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere was nice and it was clear that something sad and horrific had transpired. So the mood was visualized nicely: a limited amount of colors were used with a somewhat bland color scheme. It worked perfectly. But again, too bad I wasn&apos;t allowed to know the reason for this melancholic setting until the end of the game. I waited and waited, accepting the agonizing slow pace and when I arrived I didn&apos;t care anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homesick/user-reviews?user_review_id=5884131">Expand</a></span>
