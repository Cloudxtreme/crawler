<br>- Super fun to have so much choice in this game. Different dialogues appear for different choices you make throughout the entire game, not just one section.
<br>- Overall, a highly enjoyable experience that makes me want to get all the achievements, which to me is the sign of a fantastic game. Would definitely recommend if you are into horror/thriller stories in general!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tokyo-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=7500023">Expand</a></span>
