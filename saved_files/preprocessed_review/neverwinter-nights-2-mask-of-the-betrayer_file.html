If you loved Planescape: Torment, chances are you will love this. If you thought Planescape: Torment was too wordy and needed more combat, chances are you will love this. If you don&apos;t know what Planescape: Torment is, find a copy of that when you go buy this. Mask of the Betrayer is much more polished than the original Neverwinter Nights 2, and includes an entirely new musical score, which is amazing, vastly improved voice acting, and a story good enough for me to say its one of the best RPG stories of all time. The engine has been optimized leading to much less lag, faster load times, and faster save times. The autosave has also been set to be more frequent, saving almost every time you enter or exit an area, but the superfast save speed means you aren&apos;t waiting for more than 1-2 seconds for the autosave to finish. I highly recommend this to anyone who loved the original Neverwinter Nights 2, and even some who didn&apos;t. If you couldn&apos;t handle the unoptimized engine, or long load times in the original, both are fixed. This is one game where the developers listened to feedback and fixed nearly every complaint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2-mask-of-the-betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=403063">Expand</a></span>

The extremely upgraded influence system is fantastic, it actually gives you stat and feat bonuses from your companions, It also has a huge influence on the game as well. The only thing I wish they would have gotten better is the camera, it&apos;s still clunky and broken, not as bad as when the first game came out but it&apos;s still pretty aweful. But if you can get past that there is a wonderful game here. It turely does feel epic. When you consider lvl 20 in d&amp;d is nearly god -like then you can see how powerful these 20-30 levels are, but trust me, the game is challenging and you&apos;ll need the extra power, every battle is a hail of magic and steel it&apos;s almost surreal the amount of power your characters release, and the new graphics engine was specifically designed to improve the look and effects of magic spells. The story is fabulous as well. I recommend this to d&amp;d fans or anyone who just loves RG&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2-mask-of-the-betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=403996">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately it didn&#x2019;t fix the camera issues and some of the performance issues, but oh well, at least, this time, the game is playable from start to finish without any significant problem.
<br>But as always Obsidian had to fu** things up again by adding a new mechanic in act II know as: The spirit bar.
<br>Without spoiling, the spirit bar decreases as time progresses, if it reaches a certain thresholds your character will suffer stat penalties, and if it reaches zero, you&#x2019;re character will die. You can delay these effects by feeding on spirits, suppressing or sacrificing XP points.
<br>Basically, the spirit bar works like a timer and If you don&#x2019;t work your way through the story fast enough, you&#x2019;re character will end up severely gimped.
<br>Fortunately there is an easy exploit for this. The solution can be found here: http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/939027-neverwinter-nights-2-mask-of-the-betrayer/40775737
<br>
<br>The difficulty as also been tweaked, so if you have an unbalanced character from the Nw2 OC, prepare to die&#x2026;.allot.
<br>
<br>But what about the story?
<br>Motb has arguably one of the best stories in any Obsidian game I played to date, and is probably one of the best stories in the D&amp;D universe.
<br>To sum it up it&#x2019;s a bit like a Greek Tragedy meets NW2 OC.
<br>Although, motb was a refreshing change of pace from what we seen before, I still have a few gripes with its story, especially the cop out/ fu** you type ending they gave, that kind of reminded me of the infamous Mass Effect 3 ending. But at least the motb ending made some sense, something that ME 3 ending did not.
<br>
<br>In conclusion: Nw2 Motb is a must play for all D&amp;D fans out there, but its still flawed like its predecessor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2-mask-of-the-betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4366110">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>-D&amp;D 3.5 character creation/play
<br>-the story
<br>-the turmoil/tension
<br>-companions
<br>-epic levels for an already well-worn character (or try something new, your choice)
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>-figuring out how to manipulate the potentially lethal problem you wake up with can be a challenge
<br>-listening to the hag in the maze on repeat (you&apos;ll understand when you get there)
<br>-companions from the first game are gone, no they cannot join your party again
<br>-finding a rogue is difficult unless you are one
<br>-it ends here, the other game releases under the NWN2 title are crap, especially SoZ</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2-mask-of-the-betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618592">Expand</a></span>

The fact that it has a lower critic score than the travesty that is Dragon Age 2 is an insult to the obviously passionate people who developed this game.

Dialogue is clever and unique to each creature you encounter.  The NPCs have unique, interesting, and strong personalities without being rude and abrasive (what&apos;s the deal with rude in-party NPCs that insult you constantly in a lot of modern RPGs?  It&apos;s just dull.  Why would you hang out with these people, much less trust them with your life?).  Attention to detail abounds in this game.  Great attention to detail abounds, such as load-screen text specific to the area you&apos;re entering and off-hand situational comments from your party during exploration.  Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2-mask-of-the-betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=1718796">Expand</a></span>

I cannot agree with what othes have said concerning the performance issues which plagued NWN2. (Or the polish, but I&apos;ll talk about that later.) Truth be told, there hasn&apos;t been much of a performance upgrade from when it was first released. The engine is still god-awful. 8800GTX and Core2 @ 3.2 and 4 gigs of RAM, with all shadows disabled and 2x aa 8 af, the game clearly dips into the 20fps range at times when outdoors. And the outdoor areas in MOTB are smaller and less populated with stuff than they were in NWN2, so much so that the game feels like a beta or a user-made mod. Still, the game still simply doesn&apos;t look good enough to warrant the resources it seems to demand. However, Bioware wisely decided to start MOTB in an indoor area, which is much easier on the hardware than the large, highly populated town that the PC found herself in in the first game. NPC AI is horrible. Your companions bug out on one another when running behing you, cast ridiculous spells during combat, etc. My party NPCs have continued to fight each other to the death after winning a battle, more than a few times. Others have mentioned how difficult the game is, compared to the original. And it is. If you start fresh with the mediocre items the game provides you with and, most importantly, you choose not to micromanage companion NPC attack behavior, you will be dying a lot. I played through the first chapter as a paladin, and it was such a struggle that I had to roll a pure fighter, just to make sure I had the mojo to get through the scripted fight sequences. The story (so far) is typical NWN-- lots of mysterious warring factions with motives opaque, each led by a boss who is in thrall to another boss who is in thrall to another. As usual, it&apos;s easy to lose track of who&apos;s who. But however it pans out, one or more of them is responsible for removing the silver shard from your chest and/or cursing you with the &apos;Spirit Hunger&apos; mechanic new to MOTB. (A nuisance mechanic more irritating because I can&apos;t spend forever re-arranging my inventory like I used to. Sitting in town and setting up your gear and swapping junk between party members just might get you killed, in the long run.) Instead of typical fantasy-world RPG companions, it seems as if Bioware wanted to do some really weird stuff this time around; Half-Celestials with antlers, A Narcissistic Sex-Starved Half-Witch-Goth-Boy, a undead-unliving curly-plumed Bear God who&apos;s colored like a Rocket Pop-- and others--will fill your party. Your home base at the beginning of the game is a theatre called The Veil. The Veil&apos;s nemesis is The Sloop. There&apos;s some dialog about how the Sloop puts on light fare to appeal to the masses, while the Veil&apos;s productions are deeper and more meaningful. It is clearly the game commenting on itself. Whether or not MOTB is deeper or more meaningful is debatable, but the notion that it&apos;s presumed complexity is the the cause for the Veil&apos;s financial struggles, as well as the notion that their plays are simply too much caviar for the general is probably correct. Here&apos;s the short version: It&apos;s not as good as NWN, the expansions, and NW2. It still performs horribly. It is darker. It feels much more narrow and slapdash than NWN2, which for all its problems had a wide vision and clean, professional layout. The only thing keeping me playing it is my interest in what happened to me and my companions from the first game, and the irritating level of diffuculty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2-mask-of-the-betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=404988">Expand</a></span>

There are only 5 companions to be found in the entire expansion, and while they are well written you are shoehorned into either having no companions or choosing from one of only a few for a good portion of the game.
<br>
<br>In addition the items you come across in the game are ridiculous. Its literally at the point where you are finding +3 swords in barrels. There is a reason why higher level campaigns in D&amp;D don&apos;t always work well and this game exactly shows why. Throwing such powerful items at players, even in situations where you are are just walking around regular old Thay, is totally uncalled for.
<br>
<br>The spirit eater meter is just uncalled for. The whole concept was frankly pretty weak from the get go.
<br>
<br>Its certainly better than the main NWN2 story but it still has too many flaws to get above an 8 for me.

The character design and inventory are amazing and endless fun to explore. All of the design fundamentals are here. The game&apos;s main weakness is in the visual quality of the cut scenes, which are dreadful and tend to break immersion. This game shows just how much recent AAA titles have cut out of the gaming experience for the sake of finding a broader audience. This game shows the many things Bioware should remember and restore if they want to save their Dragon Age franchise. This game shows Project Red in Poland the kind of scale and scope and epicness that a game needs to be truly enthralling. No doubt about it. This is the model from which ambitious RPG projects need to work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2-mask-of-the-betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=2750550">Expand</a></span>

Second the D&amp;D system is much too big in my view: too many decisions, overloaded with talents, skills, and so on. Dont forget you start with lvl 18...Your start will be even more difficult, because there is no introduction: I discovered a little summary about what happened before in the journal window. So in the beginning you really dont know what is going on and who you are. Somehow I didnt want to play more, it didnt let me immerse in the world. It is like the developper forgot to implement some elements to enjoy the game. Another bad point is the controlling and interface: very circumstantial, the camera is really annoying. But the interface is beautiful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2-mask-of-the-betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6319705">Expand</a></span>
