To my dismay, they decided to make it a completely different game. Now it&apos;s linear, with way too much quest text and way too rigid scenarios. I stopped playing after a few scenarios and gave up on it, it&apos;s just not nearly as fun as the original game.

<br>If only they&apos;d make an expansion that plays like the original game, just a continuation of it rather than making something completely different.

Before you can start any battle, you have to dig thru an endless sequence of branching dialogs which tell you the story (since I am not a keen reader I attempted to just skip all that rubbish to finally see the battles, but got stuck in looping branches  meaning, you do have to read them which is pretty frustrating). Ok, then I tried two missions, one for the archer hero and one for the warrior one. The archer&apos;s first mission is ridiculous: every time an enemy partol sees you they run away and alert the whole map, bringing so many enemies to you that you can&apos;t win. Even if you leave the spot where the patrol saw you, the enemies will still find you anywhere. I gave up on this after 2 tries. The mission for the warrior puts you on the edge of the map, and the whole map seems to be surrounded by high mountains with no hope to get inside. The camera is locked to the units, you just can&apos;t view the field freely to see where you have to go. So, I gave up on that one, too. Frankly, I&apos;d give this game a 0 since I couldn&apos;t play it. I did see the interesting abilities though (which i couldn&apos;t really test in battle). The 2D GUI of the game looks very dated though the models of soldiers in the units are insanely detailed. A very strange game with lots of wasted development effort, and definitely an unplayable one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/king-arthur-fallen-champions/user-reviews?user_review_id=3373399">Expand</a></span>
