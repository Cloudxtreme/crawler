Im not gonna lie here, my initial expectations were low, I expected a slow pace modern wannabe shooter consistent with the quality of games ID put up recently. I was blown away,  I am a massive fan of the series and saw that this doom was everything I wanted. It is fast-paced, gore filled fun that only doom can deliver. My original guess was that it was going to pander to console players  by making it slower ( I thought this after I saw the scroll wheel that slowed down game play.) It has been a long while since I have seen a shooter with intelligent map design, design which rewards players for playing the game at a faster pace, in fact I rarely found myself stopping in between combat, if at all. There is secrets galore in this game to. Not only that but the game itself is absolutely beautiful. From the large bosses to the small imps for pistol fodder every part of the game does not lack in design, This game reinvigorated my faith in ID. The online has obviously improved since the beta (Its great, i didn&apos;t get the chance to play the beta but I heard complaints) With a larger selections of weapons. In fact I see so many modding possibilities for the multiplayer on PC. After playing leagues and leagues of modern shooters this is the most refreshing multiplayer I have played in a while and will suck in hours and hours of my time I haven&apos;t really played around with snap map yet, but Ill be looking forward to it!. Anyway this reinvigorated the franchise and will forever be known as a classic, Amazing job id, i look forward for more</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6388728">Expand</a></span>

<br>I played the original Doom when it came out.  I&apos;m in technology and I&apos;m a developer. The creativity and finesse this game was developed with are staggering.  I don&apos;t really typically like FPSes or games like this.  I&apos;ve evolved to simulations and serious games.  I have to say though.. this game is JUST FUN!  Some aspects (like finding all the hidden areas) are seriously challenging.  The notes about certain technologies and weapons are very creative.  The levels are not ment to hand anything to anyone.. just like the original Doom.  I am in no way disappointed with my purchase.  I plan to go through the campaign again in the hardest setting..  God help me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6392048">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First, let&apos;s cut the crap. This game is not a 9 or 10, nor is it a 1 or 2. I&apos;m giving it a 7 for the reasons listed below.
<br>
<br>This is a reboot of the original DooM, nothing more and nothing less. If you were expecting something that plays like DooM 3, please adjust your expectations. This game is fast paced, the enemies are numerous, and you must sustain yourself by picking up the ammo and life items the enemies drop when you kill them. Again, just like the original DooM of yore. You also pick up key cards and look for hidden caches. Nothing new here for veterans of DooM.
<br>
<br>If I were to compare this to other games, it is a mix of original DooM, DooM 3 (in the graphics, atmosphere, and sound department) and Space Marine. The combat gives you plenty of choices, but the funnest option is to set up your &quot;Glory kills&quot; with your guns. That is, you stun the enemy with a gun shot, then finish them with your R3 button at closer range. Combat is fluid and it works, in my opinion.
<br>
<br>Here is what the game does not have:
<br>Aiming down the sights
<br>Cut scenes
<br>Very much dialogue
<br>
<br>All of which is a plus for me, not a minus. If you like &quot;cinematic&quot; games like The Last of Us, this game is probably not for you. If you like games like DooM 1 and 2, Half Life, and Metroid, this game is probably for you. I&apos;ve always considered long dialogues and cut scenes in video games to be a waste of my time. I like the story to be told by exploring the game world and playing the game.
<br>
<br>Whether or not you want to wait for a price drop (or skip this altogether) depends on how much you loved (or did not love) the run and gun style of older shooters.
<br>
<br>Again, I have not dipped my toed into multi player yet. That could alter my review and if it does I&apos;ll update this review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6391123">Expand</a></span>

<br>The secrets are neat, like original doom secrets. The multiplayer is expansive, and snapmap is one of the best level editors for console.

<br>The game is damn fun.  And immersive. Doom (2016) makes doom 3 look really quite poor.</span>

Wait for a price drop or a sale before buying it in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6389987">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I can&apos;t help but compare it to Wolfenstein: New Order. People, Doom 2016 HAS NOTHING over W:NO. The latter is simply a masterpiece with tons of cut scenes, tons of story, tons of dialogues and npc interactions. Doom is about shooting monsters through narrow corridors, that&apos;s it. Doom 2016 is not even scary like Doom 3. Doom 2016 is just an average run of the mill shooter that could have been made just as well by Nobody Studios and not ID.
<br>
<br>Also it&apos;s very short, about 10 hours.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer? Oh god, it&apos;s Quake. If you like to play such a basic and simple shooter like Quake in the year 2016 when we have CoD, Counterstrike and Overwatch, by all means, do play it, but the majority of players will just see it the same as they see the singleplayer: dull and unimpressive.
<br>
<br>Save your money. This game is not worth it. I have no idea what did they do with the budget, this game feels like it was made with a really small budget for an AAA game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6389680">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>2.plot - As you would expect, the story is there just as an excuse for the game to have some story. nothing really interesting about the plot.
<br>
<br>3.artstyle - the artstyle is almost great and fits to doom&apos;s hellish theme, although when you kill demons they drop candy crush items which bugged me
<br>
<br>4.cashgrab - as soon as you click on the multiplayer mod you&apos;d get an ad on the menu to buy more stuff for you experience.
<br>
<br>5.graphics - overall nice looking game with everything on ultra but even then you&apos;d notice low res textures.
<br>
<br>6.sound - almost good but not quite there in my personal opinion.
<br>
<br>overall its a decent game but wasn&apos;t my cup of tea. I sent a refund request.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6388779">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is not Doom, that&apos;s to start things out. You start the game and it&apos;s all about linear maps with extreme amount of handholding. You get a scripted scene for every little thing in this game. Pickup a new weapon and the game showcases you the gun for like 5 seconds until you can move again, you open a door and you watch a scripted animation of the player opening the door and ofc while this all is happening, you can&apos;t do anything :/
<br>There are perks too, yes guys you get perks which give you ability to know where all secrets are etc and most of the pickups come only through glorykilling and thus game forces you to glorykill. Forexample
<br>ammo is ridiciolously low (20 max for shotgun) and this forces the player to use glorykill system to get more ammo. You can&apos;t fail in this game since the AI enemies are dead stupid and just stand still when you shoot them. You have a locked door in your face and the keycard is &quot;hidden&quot; right 100 meters next to it in a oneway cave. Seriously?
<br>
<br>Yes, it&apos;s a console game through and thoroughly. So I can&apos;t recommend this under any circumstances since it&apos;s not a Doom game and most definitely not a PC game either. 0/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6394270">Expand</a></span>

The enemy count is also very small at any given time. Keep in mind that the enemies don&apos;t appear all at once, but TELEPORT in after you&apos;ve killed some of them. It ruins the tempo and strategizing and was done to keep consoles running smoothly.
<br>
<br>After finishing an arena, the game is slowed down with tedious exploring, bad story telling, scripted cut scenes and jumping to platforms before reaching another small group of enemies in the next arena. This constant starting and stopping of action takes you out of the game. Add to this an extremely low ammo count and the action becomes a dance where you must watch for Glory Kills and Chainsaw kills to get needed supplies every few seconds. Basically, the game gets in the way of itself at every turn.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6900551">Expand</a></span>

<br>The original Doom was not about achievements or DLCs, the game play enough was what made it fun.  It was also mostly a closed kind of tunnel&apos;ish game where you didn&apos;t know what was going to be around the next corner.  This version is more about large often outdoors areas.
<br>
<br>Then there is the multi-player.  That is if you can find someone else to play with.  Here about a year later from release and the the server(s) are pretty much dead.
<br>Also in the original Doom there was no concept of level.  Here you are everyone&apos;s **** until you play up in levels because the level 50 people will stomp you.  In the original you could just jump right in on an equal footing and it was your skill that made the difference.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s too bad John Ramero and John Carmack have long since left Id where they could have made a proper remake..

The original DOOM blew people away with its pseudo-3D graphics and gameplay. The 2016 DOOM is hoping to blow audiences away with a game with amazing graphics and gameplay which harkens back to the 1990s.
<br>
<br>It succeeds, albeit incompletely &#x2013; as while the game is quite good at times, it also reminds us all of exactly why things changed, and it isn&#x2019;t nearly as memorable as I would have expected.
<br>
<br>DOOM has a very old school aesthetic in some ways. Gone is reloading &#x2013; you can fire all of your weapons until you are out of ammunition. Gone is a limitation on weapons carried &#x2013; you eventually tote around ten primary weapons, most of which have two weapon attachments which change their alternative fire, as well as three equipment items, two of which are grenades and one of which is a hologram used to draw enemy fire. There is no regenerating health &#x2013; instead, ammunition is lying around the levels in boxes lying on the ground, there are health packs and armor packs lying around, and in a few areas there are temporary power-ups such as quad damage, invincibility, haste, and similar things which make you that much more powerful for a short period of time.
<br>
<br>Coupled to this is always running around the level by default, the ability to pull yourself up to platforms, the ability to double jump (eventually), and a general run-and-gun style of gameplay as the demons try to close in from all angles due to the design of various areas, forcing you to keep moving if you don&#x2019;t want an enemy to attack you from behind. Some of the later enemies have pretty high health as well, further encouraging you to run around as if you stay in place, they will get to you before you kill them.
<br>
<br>The enemies in the game have okay if not amazing variety &#x2013; there&#x2019;s over a dozen kinds of enemies, from agile imps which throw ranged attacks at you and attack you sometimes, to enemies with shields, to a couple varieties of flying enemies (one a suicidal kamikaze, one a ranged attacker), a few big ground melee demons, a couple big ranged demons, and some big mixed-ranged demons. While these are okay in terms of variety, it isn&#x2019;t great, and the game stops introducing new demons about halfway through. This is unfortunate, as beyond that point, the only &#x201C;new demons&#x201D; are a couple of remixes of older ones (which aren&#x2019;t that new feeling), as well as three bosses which, while okay, are not exactly amazing.
<br>
<br>Sadly, this leads the game to feel a bit stale after a while &#x2013; once you&#x2019;ve unlocked all the weapons and fought all the enemy types, there&#x2019;s about half a dozen levels left in the game for you to fight through. Worse, the game gets quite a bit easier at that point, both because there&#x2019;s nothing new to throw at you, as well as because you just continually get more and more overpowered as you unlock more powers for your weapon secondary fires and various static bonuses continue to accrue in the forms of adjustable powers from unlockable runes which you acquire in various levels, as well as the upgrades to your armor abilities and base health and armor. The BFG is almost comically overpowered, and the chainsaw, while limited in ammunition, ensures that you never run out of ammo of anything important. Indeed, in some of the later portions of the game you can unlock rune combinations which effectively give you infinite ammo and make it very easy to maintain tons of health and armor, making the game almost trivial in some places, while the BFG can be used to bail you out of any seriously difficult situation &#x2013; including the bosses.
<br>
<br>Additionally, running around and picking up ammo and health and armor, while it feels novel at first, is actually kind of tedious. Worse, it actually highlights one of the problems of many modern games with collectables &#x2013; secrets seem like this really cool thing, but in practice they end up slowing down gameplay as you wander around hunting for them. This results in the game&#x2019;s pacing, which is pretty solid if you just play through, being interrupted at times by wandering around looking for resources and secrets.
<br>
<br>This really just kind of highlights why some of the old DOOM things aren&#x2019;t done anymore &#x2013; hunting down ammo, armor, and health packs just isn&#x2019;t that fun, and secret hunting can interrupt the flow of the game&#x2019;s otherwise pretty intense gameplay.
<br>
<br>That being said, this game is pretty fun for a good chunk of its run. The story, while nothing special, works pretty well, the DOOM Marine&#x2019;s attitude towards mission control is kind of amusing as he starts off by smashing a few screens which try to deliver exposition at the player, there are only a limited number of cutscenes to interrupt the flow of the game, and the actual run-around-and-shoot-demons-that-are-spawning-constantly gameplay works pretty well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=7306111">Expand</a></span>

So the game is straight-forward: you kill stuff and then go to hell and kill some more. There isn&apos;t much in terms of plot but this is Doom. There&apos;s a storyline but it&apos;s thin, but that&apos;s OK. Here&apos;s the meat of the burger: gameplay. Crazy, loony and berserk madness. These demons are NOT dumb. Well sometimes they are but for the most part they won&apos;t stand there and get killed. They&apos;re quick, resourceful and armed to the fangs. They&apos;re ugly and mean and merciless. The level designs are clever and vast. The navigation and maps are simple and effective so you never get lost or confused. The arsenal is nuts. So many weapons. Where does he put them all?! I did have an issue with the customization as it was TOO elaborate at times. You get two types of grenades which is fine but I could&apos;ve used a third since I never found out what the Argent grenade did exactly. I rarely used the hologram but it was a nice addition to the equipment stack. Lots of final upgrades require challenges and those are pretty hard. Plenty of hidden stuff (look for grates and floor/ceiling panels BTW) hidden everywhere that can be found on the maps. As for the aesthetics: just astonishing. The environments are detailed and rendered perfectly. The lighting is awesome looking. The sound effects are crisp and varied. The voice over work is very good and well written. There&apos;s not much of it but it works when its there. There are little to no faults here. It&apos;s just that amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6927776">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As with classic Doom, health, armor and ammo are pick-up based (no regeneration), there are only 10 weapons which are unlocked throughout the game (via exploration), there is no reloading, there are very few cutscenes and it&apos;s just fast-paced demon-slaying action all the way. Although on the surface it sounds like it&apos;s extremely repetitive, there are some excellent additions to keep the experience more entertaining. Firstly, as with all good classic shooters, there is a clear emphasis on exploration. You are rewarded for exploring the game&apos;s vast levels not just with meaningless collectibles and background reading, but with useful resources that will help you develop your demon-slaying capabilities. For example, each weapon can be customised with two weapon mods found from Field Drones, and each attachment can be upgraded using upgrade points, and even then there is a challenge for each mod to further enhance its capabilities. You can also upgrade the Doom Marine&apos;s suit and capabilities - again, this is almost exclusively from exploration. There are also Runes - mini challenges with a given set of conditions in an arena which, if completed, unlocks a &quot;perk&quot; (you can have three equipped at once) which can then be further enhanced by completing the challenges. Each level also has its own three challenges to complete. There are even sections of classic Doom maps to be found in each level! So to get the point across: there are some light RPG elements which are non-disruptive but also stay true to the spirit of the original. Furthermore, dying does not reset progress towards challenges, so it doesn&apos;t feel like a grind.
<br>
<br>The campaign is a fair length - especially if, like me, you try to explore every last nook and cranny of the levels. With an exploration-intensive playstyle, expect to spend around an hour minimum per level and there are 13 levels. It is best played on Ultra-Violence (the hardest starting difficulty available) since it feels challenging and intense as it should but becomes easier when you&apos;ve got loads of upgrades later on in the game.
<br>
<br>In terms of performance, DOOM is extremely well-optimized on both Vulkan and OpenGL 4.5 graphics APIs. Even on a modest gaming rig (GTX 1060 6GB, i5-3470, 12GB RAM) the holy grail of 4K Ultra 60 FPS is achievable (though admittedly with around 75% resolution scaling) on OpenGL, and around 130 FPS at 1080p Nightmare settings.
<br>
<br>In terms of additional content, DOOM has a multiplayer component which is, as expected, an arena shooter with the usual game modes and extremely light customisation. Whilst this sounds great, it isn&apos;t especially balanced because of some consumable &quot;perks&quot; which put higher-level players at an advantage. The gameplay is also not satisfying in my opinion, and it just feels like a mess. I&apos;m usually a fan of &quot;tacked-on&quot; multiplayers due to their simplicity, but Doom&apos;s doesn&apos;t do it for me; though perhaps more skilled players who enjoy games like Quake and Unreal Tournament might enjoy it.
<br>
<br>Perhaps the most novel feature of DOOM is SnapMaps; allowing you to create your own levels complete with their own objectives, enemeies, AI behaviour, pickups etc. The interface and tutorials for doing these are fairly good, but as with all &quot;game creators&quot;, it is extremely time-consuming to do something simple. Still, it&apos;s a nice addition, though I haven&apos;t seen anything particularly stand out made by the community.
<br>
<br>Overall, DOOM 2016 is exactly the kind of game I hoped it would be. Everything from the weapons, gameplay, enemies, levels and even the option to have that classic centred weapon pose (as opposed to the ubiquitous right-handed pose of modern shooters) are reminiscent of the classic Doom games, and I&apos;m pleased to say that Doom&apos;s spirit has aged beautifully. This is a shining example of how to modernise a classic game series without losing its essence.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=7396810">Expand</a></span>

<br>I was expecting a mediocre game, and I was wrong. While I don&apos;t see it like a *real* DooM (doesn&apos;t feel like a DooM game, sorry), it&apos;s a really excellent game overall. It&apos;s fast, it&apos;s fun and it&apos;s really well designed. Graphically is excellent. The musics are fantastic and really spot on. Combat is fun, the weapons are great, the enemies are all well designed and fun to battle.
<br>Now, it does have some downsides.
<br>- Maps enviroment are a bit confusing, sometimes it&apos;s hard to disitnguish which room are you on.
<br>- Glory kills are fun to see the first time, they they only get annoying and take away from the combat itself.
<br>- Checkpoint saving is a TERRIBLE idea and an horrible trend. We should be able to save whenever we want to.
<br>- The map is kinda confused, and, worst of all it resets every time you close it, forcing you to zoom and reposition it as you need.
<br>- denuvo is horrible.
<br>- It&apos;s only on steam.
<br>
<br>EDIT: since my save file have been corrupted while I was almost at the end, and since it is A WELL KNOWN BUG, I decided to remove 3 points from my verdict.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6703910">Expand</a></span>

ID claims they went back to the Doom roots.  Bah!  I played the original Doom 23 years ago and replayed it years later.  Lousy graphics but a great game, for a mindless shooter.  Way back I thought Serious Sam was mindless fun.  But 23 years later I grew up.  This game is a pile of dreck, a waste of time and money.  Al you do is run and gun, with a lot of tedious annoying jumping unto and off of platforms.
<br>
<br>The save system absolutely sucks with checkpoints instead of quick saves and reloads and hard saves,  This can be very exasperating when you are engaged in a difficult  part requiring perfect jumps and numerous enemies  with distant checkpoints forcing you waaaay back to the previous checkpoint and starting all over.  That was the final straw that caused me to joyfully dump this turkey into the trash can.
<br>
<br>I loved Doom 3, Resurrection of Evil and Doom BFG.  Very nice combinations of horror and FPS.  ID should have stuck to that and improved on it  but no, they came up with this borefest.  Along with that stupid game, Rage,  Doom 2016 will be another game I will never bother to play again.  At least I finished Rage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6831291">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>What this game make perfect is that, I never thought that killing evil creatures could by that much fun. Great fps, one among the best. Kinda feel like a Wolfenstein The New Order but instead of nazzis you have hell. Variety of weapons is pretty, game is well balanced. Map design is also very good. Minus one point for repetitive feel in the end.</span>

<br>DOOM is about putting the headphones on and cranking the volume up and pushing the big red button in the middle of the room that unleashes the 1000mph psychotic demon onslaught and smashes your face in. You move. You dodge. You aim. You shoot. You do not think. You do not stop. You just kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. And then the room falls silent, and you snap out of it clutching a chainsaw and covered in blood. Doom is about flipping the table on the most terrifying lucid savage nightmare conceivable with shotguns and adrenaline.

In that the levels are in sections with many gimmicks like closing a portal, fight a wave of demons, rinse and repeat. Find a key, open door etc. Go through airlocks again and again. Got very tiresome after a while. Controls are a bit off. They feel very fluid but a little floaty with no sprint button. Can you believe that? It&apos;s tough to navigate around some of the faster moving demons and the stupid small sections they throw you in to fight them. They should have added sprint and some open area levels to make full use of the weapons because most enemies just rush you all the time.
<br>
<br>Visually it&apos;s superb like some of the UAC facility levels, weapons, few enemy designs (revenant, the undead and cacodemon being the only ones that stood out), and slick menu presentation. Loading times are ridiculous. Audio is hit and miss. Sound effects are good but some of the gun sounds and explosions are weak. Had to crank my volume a little bit. They nailed the music which is constantly there sometimes subtlety or full force.
<br>
<br>A sequel or DLC needs to add more variety (Phobos and Deimos?) because it was overall missing something I can&apos;t quite put my finger on? It badly needed something fresh because it all felt too mundane. It needs a story that isn&apos;t a rehash. It basically is a remake of Doom 3. That&apos;s not to say it sucks. It was a blast to play but too arcade-ish and similar for me. Worth a rental or pick it up when it drops to $20.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6398995">Expand</a></span>

<br>DOOM is good game if you enjoy great gameplay and shooting monsters almost all the time, but don&apos;t expect to get any kind of story.</span>

Sadly it appears Bethesda chose to focus much of their effort on the multiplayer aspect so the single player campaign is quite a short venture.   Clocking in at around 10 hours you can blast through the game and get most (if not all) of the upgrades in a single play-through.   All in all it is a good game but not near as good as their recent update of Wolfenstein.
<br>Great visuals, well built and a solid shooter if only it had another 10 hours of single player action...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6396094">Expand</a></span>

It sets aside sniping, cover, and all the other FPS conventions of the last decade, and brings back the hardcore DOOM experience at an astonishing level of polish.  The single-player campaign is the most fun I&apos;ve had playing a game in years.  I can&apos;t recommend the single-player campaign highly enough.</span>

<br>For the record, I got into gaming in the 70&#x2019;s when Pong was out. I actually had and still have my old pong machine. I&#x2019;ve had every machine under the sun since, from the woodchip Atari &amp; Intellivision through ZX80/81, Speccy, C64, ST, Amiga and all the consoles all the way to now.
<br>
<br>I was in my mid 20&#x2019;s when Shareware Doom released and it was a revelation and was the reason for me buying my first gaming PC (386 or 486) for &#xA3;1500! Doom was a landmark title for many reasons and along with the release of the PS1, is perhaps the only other gaming release which stands apart as a revolution in gaming.
<br>
<br>Yes, Wolfenstein came first but, that title was pretty much overlooked due to the fact PC Gaming back then wasn&#x2019;t hugely popular and tbh, it wasn&#x2019;t that great either. Doom in one fell swoop changed all that with its stellar innovation because 25 years ago, nothing like it had ever been seen before. It beared no resemblance to its older brother Wolfenstein, which was the bedrock for Doom. Gone were the blue walls and Nazi&#x2019;s and in their place was Hell. The sounds, the graphics and blindingly fast game play were simply stunning not only to play but also to watch. That Shareware title (and the fact it was SW demonstrated that ID weren&#x2019;t confident of its success) would define the entire FPS genre. Quite simply, it was a revolution.
<br>
<br>Fast forward to now. Do I still want to play Doom? No I don&#x2019;t. Why? Because in plain and simple terms, the mechanics of Doom are literally last century and it&#x2019;s glaring limitations are cruelly exposed when stood against titles that have since improved vastly upon it. It&#x2019;s like asking would I prefer to play Outrun ahead of Dirt Rally (no I wouldn&#x2019;t).
<br>
<br>Against my better judgement and mainly because of the glowing feedback on here, Steam and elsewhere, I downloaded it. I honestly wish I hadn&#x2019;t because some things are best left in the past. I wanted it to succeed (which I suppose it has tbh). I wanted it to be great. I wanted ID to transport me back to those halcyon days of running round shooting endless Imps and Cacodemons. It doesn&#x2019;t do that though. It certainly tries and whilst the game play somewhat resembles Doom of old, it&#x2019;s not what I want anymore. After a not inconsequential 10 hours of playing (well over halfway), I&#x2019;ve had enough of it and getting to that 10 hour mark has been a slog.
<br>
<br>Do you know when I know a game isn&#x2019;t holding my interest? I get fidgety, my mind starts wandering to other things and my legs start bouncing on my feet under the desk. This usually happens when I have to read a text book or perform some mundane task in preparation for something I have to learn. That is what I&#x2019;m experiencing with Doom! I&#x2019;m struggling to enjoy it in any meaningful way and I suspect that is because I&#x2019;ve been here before, a long time ago. For want of a better description &#x2013; it&#x2019;s generic and dare I say it, quite boring.
<br>
<br>Maybe it&#x2019;s my age or maybe my gaming tastes have changed but, the lack of intelligence this game requires is almost insulting. From the get go, you run a few corridors and shoot some spawning enemies, then you enter an arena and keep shooting until you&#x2019;ve defeated X amount of mobs. You then repeat the process of a few more corridors and another arena to defeat another X amount of mobs&#x2026; rinse and repeat. This mechanic was great twenty odd years ago because it was ground breaking. It&#x2019;s not great now and in fact, it&#x2019;s downright decrepit and it shows. Gaming, and FPS gaming in particular has changed far beyond what Doom started all those years ago.
<br>
<br>Whilst I&#x2019;m happy that many are enjoying it and appear pleased that it&#x2019;s exactly what they wanted, I&#x2019;d seriously have to question this because I&apos;m finding it mind numbing. As said, I&#x2019;m 10 hours in and I can&#x2019;t last more than 30-40 minutes before my legs start bouncing and the need to load up Dark Souls 3, TR or Uncharted 4 takes over.
<br>
<br>At best it is a very mediocre FPS built on what is a relic of a game play model and I suspect that had this been another game made by any other company, public opinion would not have been so gushing towards it. The fact it is &#x2018;Doom&#x2019; by &#x2018;ID&#x2019; means the rose tinted fanboy brigade will just about accept anything and proclaim it as the best thing since sliced bread even when it isn&#x2019;t.
<br>
<br>In 6 months&#x2019; time, I think people will look back on Doom and probably admit that it was a very average, generic and dare I say it, boring shooter with zero depth and which required zero intelligence.
<br>
<br>A shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6403592">Expand</a></span>

I love all the little touches to this game, that there&apos;s still keycards and colored skulls to unlock various doors. Well, I&apos;m going to go back to playing folks. If you&apos;re on the fence, get it. Especially if you&apos;re an old Doom1/2 fan like me, heck even 3.
<br>
<br>Note: I played some multiplayer. Here&apos;s my thought on that... If you EVER plan on playing the singleplayer, do yourself a favor and play through it BEFORE doing MP. Experience the game, weapons, and levels at the pace the developers intended. It is much more rewarding and fun. MP spoils that a bit by showing you all the areas and guns right away. That being said MP does bring back some classic &quot;Quake Arena&quot; styled mayhem and I do enjoy it. Snapmap creations are coming in, and are pretty cool! We&apos;ll just have to deal with flashy pink armor and hearts on it -_-</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6404488">Expand</a></span>

<br>Amazing graphics, you can even give the game a gritty film grain that takes you into a sort of grindhouse satan/hell exploitation kind of atmosphere. Music is phenomenal, good sound overall, with plenty of texture and makes killing enemies really satisfying.
<br>
<br>Campaign is a blast and the full package. Multiplayer is also quite a bit of fun to play, the loadouts are not my favorite setup, but they make sense - and take a lot of the weapon spawn camping aspect out of the game (which is rampant in other frag fest games like this one.)
<br>
<br>Honestly I was in shock at how thoroughly polished this game felt. Negative reviews on here seem really silly, to the point I feel the negative ratings are there strictly to bring the score down or troll - you cannot loose with this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6392047">Expand</a></span>

It was kind of the thing to do with shooters at the time. The action is fast, the story sparse, just how it should be. There are secrets, just like in the original, and I never thought I would enjoy collecting such stupid little figures before. There are little doom dolls, kind of like Funko POPs on each level, and when you find it, a little clip of the old dooms music plays. Puts a smile on my face everytime.
<br>
<br>There are also hidden parts of the original levels of doom in each level. You have to find a hidden lever, switch it and a wall or unique looking door will open. Its really is well thought out. they seem to progress down the original lvls as you progress down the levels in this doom.
<br>
<br>Im not positive, but I believe this is how you unlock the old doom levels. I had the option to play the hanger level after I found one. Was quiet a bit of fun. remembering old secrets and completing it.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve only played about 3 hours of the 13 hour campaign but it has been very entertaining. One big grip I have is there seems to be no way to fast switch between weapons on the same key. for example the pistol and chainsaw are both set to the 1 key. You hit it once, and you get the pistol, hit it again and you get the chainsaw. I thought you could maybe just double tap the key to get the second weapon, but you have to hit one, wait for it to cycle to the pistol then hit one again to cycle to the chainsaw, for a fast paced shoot em up this seems wrong. Maybe I am just missing a quick key. the plasma rifle and the chaingun are also both on the 4 key.
<br>
<br>I have yet to try the multiplayer, but its probably not going to be my thing. I really just wanted the nostalgia of a good doom. The multiplayer looks to be more like Quake Arena.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6393564">Expand</a></span>

<br>My biggest problems are that multiplayer feels slightly laggy even with perfect internet connection while campaign feels perfect. The graphics are alright but beware that if you are not running high end hardware you will have to turn them down to the point where they look like a 10 year old game and is still jittery which is quite disappointing. Seems very badly optimized but could be Nvidia drivers.
<br>
<br>So to recap, the game is fun and feels like a true doom (unlike doom 3) and is worth around &#x20AC;30, but I would not advise paying more than &#x20AC;40 for this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6399369">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Con&apos;s
<br>- U dont buy a FPS game for 10 h long story mode with 0 choices and replayability (Well, if You like secret hunt/archiev&apos;s/higher difficulty etc U might add +10h to totall time played).
<br>
<br>- FPS games usually shine in Multiplayer (and thats why everyone i know buy&apos;s fps games in the first place) And Dooms multiplayer is, simply put, BAD. Ive played DOOM NDA alpha, then closed beta, then open beta and i must say one thing - Its not &quot;fun&quot; to pwn other players in demon form or using gauss/bfg but You are forced to use those to win. Its not rewarding or challenging. U dont win by outskilling opponent, (with pro gunplay, dedly accuracy + tactic). You win games by controlling demon rune/power weapon spawns. There are way more problems with multiplayer (announcer/loadouts/hack modules/only 9 small maps/ no deadicated servers etc.)
<br>
<br>- Snapmap tool -&gt; Its cool for about 20 min, but then U start to notice it&apos;s limitation&apos;s (4 player only/12 monsters spawn max/ 1 environment/ U build from premade piece&apos;s).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6403943">Expand</a></span>

This game has always been about mindless killing. What little story there is, is not bad. This game is fast paced run and gun DO NOT sit still. This isn&apos;t Call of Duty, Battlefield, Destiny etc. This is a run-n-gun or die trying game.
<br>
<br>Doom 1 &amp; 2 games were pretty straight forward. Walk into a room full of Hell and kill it all. There were some puzzle aspects to it.
<br>Doom 32x was basically the same
<br>Doom 64 took that same approach and tried to add a linear story to it.
<br>Doom 3 turned to a darker story with a linear story which most were not a fan of but i thoroughly enjoyed.
<br>Doom 2016 is a basically a buffet of all of those things. There is the linear story and you will walk into an area where all hell breaks loose and you must survive to move on to the next area.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a gorgeous fast-paced shooter that doesn&apos;t require thought process to comprehend whats going on but want a challenge staying alive this game is for you. Its a nice change of pace from &quot;camping&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6403321">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s a good game for a 1h play, not more that that.</span>

<br>This game has nothing to do with doom, it looks like a hyperventilated and bad designed levels Game.
<br>What is that about the locked doors and need to survive each time until everything is dead than opens up... That&apos;s not what doom 1, 2 was about. Then those melee fights to get life... pffff I don&apos;t get it. Weapons feel flat no reloads because yeah you know it&apos;s a button to much for the kids let&apos;s just auto reload when walking over ammo... just take the shotgun it is so far of the feeling it has from doom 1,2, duke nukem or even Serious Sam.
<br>
<br>Seems like those who love the game that so much actually are not from the older times where we played 100&apos;s of hours playing doom and especially doom 2. How many times I had a jump inside those was incredible as it was never expected... here you know it&apos;s gone be full until everything is erased and move on...so boring.
<br>
<br>Even Doom 3 feels better than this OVERRATED crap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6893053">Expand</a></span>

<br>Congratulations DOOM team because you guys elevated my expectations with this game. Hope that we can have a sequel on this. I&apos;ve always a DOOM fan since with DOOM 1 and 2 wich at was really scary and exciting at that time. Love the new interpretation and history too. It is a game made with so much effort and dedication. Love the graphics and the soundtrack too.</span>

<br>
<br>The single player campaign is a borefest. You just follow the corridor, shoot generic enemies, and press F to finish them and get health and ammo. Repeat until the end. No story, minimal cutscenes, braindead enemy AI, and no freedom of exploration besides some &quot;secret areas&quot; for more ammo hp and armor. You will be bored very early in the game, unless Doom is your first FPS game ever.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is nothing special, and will be forgotten soon.
<br>
<br>Overall, not worth it at full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6695266">Expand</a></span>

Not only did this game exceed my expectations, but it also went the extra mile to make this as true to the origional as possible. They have every single enemy from Doom1 and 2. Even ones they lead you to belive are not in the game. If you love any Doom there is no way you wont like this. The finishers, chainsaw, vaulting and double jump ad all new dimensions to the already supreme formula. The additions are often useful and don&apos;t feel tact on at all. The guns are pretty brutal on their own, but their is so many ways you can make them more powerful. Just like in New Order, you can complete challeges to unlock  special abilities. You can find secrets to enchance the suit, and you can play trial modes that teach you hidden tricks ontop of unlocking yet a another new set of abilities. There is one secret at the end that I figured out by playing the last level of Doom 2. Won&apos;t say much but John Romero will be happy. I hope to see more Doom games like this come out soon. I have a feeling Quake is the direct sequel  that will tine into this. Call it a hunch. Bet it will be just as fathful to the origional with castles and space weapons.
<br>
<br>I gave this a point off because it isn&apos;t the most perfect looking game. There is no campaign co-op, just co-op in snap map. The story isn&apos;t too exciting and it slows down the action at brief times, soundtrack can get too repetitive and is nothing special. At least the origional tune made it in. There is one bug in the close the well mission. I killed the last enemy with beserk mode active and I was locked in the room with no escape. I thought I was lost for an hr, and it made me restart the last check point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6392092">Expand</a></span>

That is what you&apos;re getting with Doom 2016, for good and for ill.  I personally found the game very enjoyable, but it should be added that I was really wanting a fast-paced shooter that was single player and the newest game I had that was scratching that itch was Serious Sam (preceded by Painkiller).  I sat down with this game and asked it to keep my pulse up and send me on a gory, exhilarating ride as I mowed down the legions of Hell.  And it delivered exactly what I asked of it.
<br>
<br>This game is a very literal translation of the earliest shooters, your Doom&apos;s, your Wolfenstein&apos;s, your Duke Nukem&apos;s.  On the good side, you have the fast-paced, frantic gameplay that the old ones had, and it came up with a few ways to keep the flow going as much as possible.  The weapons are viscerally fun as ever and, aside from the starting pistol, none of them are ever really useless.  There is a surprisingly elaborate upgrade system added that (amongst other things) helps keep earlier weapons competitive with their late-game cousins and you&apos;re free to settle into a gameplay style that suits you.  The enemies are varied (though the majority of them are familiar to those who have played any Doom games) and the game moves at a decent difficulty curve.  Now, on the bad side, I can say that some weapons wind up being a little vestigial depending on your play style; the double-barrel shotgun in particular was almost unused during my playthrough.  Additionally, the map design is... well it&apos;s not *bad* and you can tell where you&apos;re going, but it carries that maze-like quality that the old 2.5D shooters had, so if you don&apos;t like that you won&apos;t care much for that.  Though there&apos;s a very nice degree of verticality to it.  As for the gore... well it&apos;s what you&apos;d expect--simple gratuitous violence that makes your inner thirteen year old giddy if you&apos;re into that sort of thing.  Again, if you don&apos;t like gore, then don&apos;t buy this game.
<br>
<br>Now, you may have noticed that I didn&apos;t mention the story.  Well... here&apos;s the thing.  For the game you have, the story is exactly what it needs to be.  Set-up: you wake up chained to a sarcophagus in the midst of an invasion of Hell on Mars inside a UAC facility and it&apos;s up to you to do the cleanup job.  Obviously there&apos;s a bit more to it, but it&apos;s not exactly an operatic plot... but it does what it needs to do.  The thing I do like is that the few characters there are have a neat amount of characterization, there&apos;s a lot of background storytelling (particularly involving the sort of place the facility you&apos;re in and what it was like prior to getting invaded), and the Doom Marine himself has a bit of characterization.  Now, when I say that, he&apos;s still a silent protagonist, but you can read a bit into his actions, little things like the way he hesitates at certain points in the plot, the sheer brutality he shows towards the demons, and the way he interacts with certain objects.  The story is shallow, but it&apos;s as deep as it needs to be.  It keeps the story afloat and it&apos;s enough to make you comfortable in the game world, and it succeeds at what it sets out to do.
<br>
<br>Basically, if you want a successor to the old Doom games, you have it.  If that is what you wanted, then consider this a MASSIVE recommendation, 10/10, gold star, A+.  It was what I wanted, and while I&apos;m normally an RPG guy, I still found this a fun escape from all of that.  Alternatively, if you are uncertain on whether you&apos;re interested in this kind of game, I&apos;d recommend trying Painkiller or Serious Sam 3 first to do an interest check (and potentially save money).  This is a game that knows what it wants to be and hits that point with full marks.  It is a game that I know not everyone would care for, but I personally loved it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6392975">Expand</a></span>

I originally pre-ordered this after I enjoyed the multiplayer, just expecting it to be a fun shooter like COD of Battlefield. Nothing exceptional, but a cool theme and exciting game play. Now that it is released, I was pleasantly surprised. The multiplayer is high action and intense, and it really rewards understanding all of the games mechanics. The variety of game modes also keep the game from getting stale. The campaign is also great. The story is there if you want it, but it is pushed off to the side. While this is a negative for some, it really puts the focus on the game play, which is great. Each new area is inspired and all of the weapons have their own unique purpose. I never found myself sticking to one the whole time. The reason I am not giving this game a perfect 10 is that I had some problems running it at first. I don&apos;t know if it was my drivers, which I reverted from the newest version in an attempt to fix it, or if it was just a day 1 issue, but the game crashed quite often while I was playing it, especially during the campaign, although that issue seems to be resolved now. Another strange thing is that to switch between multiplayer, campaign, and snapmap, you have to restart the entire game, as if it is actually 3 separate games. Other than that slight annoyance, I really have no problem with this game. If you are looking for a high action, intense FPS, Doom is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6391481">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Doom is essentially a reboot of the legendary first game, and while fans of the original will be disappointed by changes to the health system, the pacing is very good, retaining the &quot;move on to the next group of demons&quot; dynamic. There&apos;s an overfocus on melee which, while satisfyingly brutal, does become old after a while, but it still comes across as fresh just because of the abundance of drab military shooters in the market it competes with.
<br>
<br>Surprisingly, the campaign is the best part of the game for me. Yes, a decent campaign mode in an FPS for the first time in what feels like forever! It&apos;s nothing revolutionary, and this isn&apos;t a top drawer narrative RPG experience or anything like it, but it is competent and feels like a focus has been placed on it.
<br>
<br>Much was made about the overuse of browns and greys in the colour scheme before release, but I can confirm that the art style is good. Not great, but good. Personally, as an old Doom player, I would have appreciated a lot more colour variation and imagination, but I can understand that the era we live in doesn&apos;t make that &quot;cool&quot;, so the art direction is what it is - nothing special, but passable, despite some low quality textures in certain areas.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a surprisingly decent game. Is it worth full price? If you&apos;re a big FPS fan, then probably - it&apos;s going to be worth it to you more than whatever the latest shovel of CoD crap is anyway. It would have been easy for Bethesda to take the Doom licence and make a quick cash grab; they haven&apos;t done that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6392883">Expand</a></span>

Now, first thing&apos;s first, I&apos;m gonna address the neighsayers. Go ahead and read the *currently* 85 negative reviews. Ok, since you&apos;ve read them, tell me what they have in common. Obviously, the mass majority of them are either people who have never played the original Doom games, and know nothing of what the original is about, and the other half are the purists, who say the game is too slow and that it&apos;s not a carbon copy of the original, so it sucks. Because innovation is bad, right? Now, there is also a small crowd who haven&apos;t played the first 2 games, but have played Doom 3, which was totally a deviation from the originals, and was poorly received on a whole.  This is also a crowd that has never watched the e3 demo, or any of the videos released prior to launch, they were just like &quot;oh hey I remember that game it was really scary.&quot; and was shocked when they found out &quot;hey this isn&apos;t scary, 0/10.&quot; Another common complaint is that the game is repetitive, which is complete bs. This game has a massive load of replay value, due to the 5 difficulty levels and the numerous upgrades and weapon mods available. I completed my first playthrough on ultra-violence (hard), and my second playthrough on nightmare (very hard), and I&apos;m currently attempting ultra-nightmare (1 death and it&apos;s game over.) And this game is STILL extremely fun. I don&apos;t get how anybody could not have fun with this amazing piece of artwork. Now, another thing I commonly see (mainly on steam reviews, but on here as well,) are people who have played 10-30 minutes of the game, and then leave a 0/10 score and refund the game. To which I have to say, did you really even play the game? You can&apos;t even complete the first mission in 30 minutes, much less actually try the multiplayer, or snapmap. These are people who just want to hate on the game because they think it&apos;s cool to do so. Not actual Doom fans, just casuals. Second, this game is MADE for PC. There are so many graphics settings, and the game is so well optimized that I can run it on my laptop, which has a GTX 960m in it, which is a horrible horrible low grade chip, in 720p 60fps. On my main rig I play 1440p, 120 fps. Yeah, it&apos;s really, really well optimized, which is amazing considering how AWESOME this game&apos;s graphics are. So please, ignore the hate reviews and just try the game for yourself. If you&apos;re a fan of the originals, you&apos;ll have a blast!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6400774">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Doom is a very fine shooter. It&apos;s game-play is in some places a hark to the past, but freshened up. There is no cover mechanics and no reload. It&apos;s twitch, select weapon move, shoot and select finishers (to keep up health and ammo). The whole things is lazed with not-so-subtle aggression and stomping pissed of music, so you end up as a furious one-man demon genocide. There&apos;s a story, but you can show it the middle-finger if you want.
<br>
<br>I suspect for Doom-fans this game is near perfect, and for me it is certainly an excellent leap away from silly cover-based action and the slowness of the typical modern shooter.
<br>
<br>You also get fairly big maps and key cards. Yep, this is no corridor shooter like the (otherwise) excellent Shadow Warrior remake. This is big hurrah to the old days, when you had to do a little thinking between the bouts.
<br>
<br>A very nice game indeed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6393665">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As with all negative reviews I&apos;m sure this one will be quickly voted down by the paid tro##s that lurk here.  I purposely misspelled that word to avoid getting reported for abuse as my last review that stated similar was reported for using the word weir#o.  Seriously Metacritic how do you not know this?
<br>
<br>Doom isn&apos;t a terrible game, it&apos;s just a boring FPS with nothing revolutionary or even interesting.  I&apos;m actually so unimpressed I don&apos;t even want to write a review.  I just want to complain about Bethesda paying people to tro## Metacritic and giving this game a 10 out of 10.
<br>
<br>Although this game is a bit different as it seems even the paid reviewers don&#x2019;t want to rate this game at release.  Bethesda is quickly using up its creditably capital.  Fallout 4 was probably their last great cash grab.  The next Elder Scrolls better knock the socks off the world because you won&#x2019;t get away with this garbage a third time.  Funny how the mighty gets greedy and destroys the heart and soul of what made them great, talent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6397213">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>MP mode is fun and again kept to its roots old school PC players would know and love. Freeze Tag being a completely new type of FPS game mode I&apos;ve seen on console and so much fun! although a want for more maps in the base pack would of been nice. DLC inbound.
<br>
<br>SnapMap: Is whats going to keep the game alive between content map creation allows community to create and upload fast and easily some great things already there, remakes of the classic game, a horde style mode for 4 players.
<br>
<br>all in all DOOM is the FPS that can do it all and does what it always has done to a great level. much like the reboot of Wolfenstien you can see they have put there heart into creating this game not just garbled out a classic franchise for monetary value

If you are on the fence about buying it, or don&apos;t like FPS-es that much, maybe wait a few months for the game price to go down / go on sale.</span>

<br>
<br>While I can&apos;t comment on the multiplayer aspect, I&apos;m having a blast with the single player campaign. It&apos;s exactly the kind of old school shooter I was hoping for.

<br>The negatives:
<br>* The story line is next to non existent so far. It might as well say &quot;fight your way to here&quot;. &quot;now fight your way to here&quot;. &quot;now...&quot;.
<br>* I am appalled by the lack of cut-scenes to pull me in to any attempt at a story.
<br>* The graphics are Good, but not epic. Even on Ultra (SLi 980 GTX) although the game plays VERY smoothly.
<br>* The enemy attacks (AI) are more than a little dumb so far. You can easily get them to follow you and just pummel them while running backwards.
<br>* It feels a bit like a COD version of Doom.
<br>* I swear I saw some typos in the text placeholders.
<br>* If I used the gamma slider in the way the game tells me to, I would be able to see basically nothing of note - so Ignore that, IMHO.
<br>* Weapons fire isn&apos;t amazingly accurate... it almost feels like it was made to be slightly forgiving if you were to play in using a gamepad. Not that I am.
<br>* I have already got trapped in a couple of locations (foundry, in between a couple of metal bars, to mention one) and had to restart.
<br>* It definitely is mindless and requires very little thought. Just follow the lights and you will advance in your game.
<br>* Health popping out of beings you kill by hand... what is that all about?!?!?!
<br>* Personally, I cant stand chosen level ups and skill customisation.
<br>* Some of the &quot;sparks&quot; look like flying pixels and nothing more.
<br>
<br>The things I like:
<br>* The game is a smooth as silk and has no frame judder or other textural oddities.
<br>* The level design isn&apos;t that bad. It is just a shame that it is so linear.
<br>* The ability to climb a little is nice - although goes against physics a lot of the time.
<br>* Still a better love story that Twilight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6400303">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Doom (2016) is the successor to the good ol&apos; Doom of 1993 - if you&apos;re after the &apos;survival horror&apos; of Doom 3, this ain&apos;t it - that was never the point of the series. If you&apos;re going to hold the game to the standard of a sequel that shared nothing with it&apos;s predecessors, of course you&apos;re going to be annoyed. You&apos;re also going to be wrong. [...strange how they re-titled from Doom 4.]
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s the long and short of it;
<br>
<br>- The single player campaign is a solid 12 hours on a reasonable difficulty and without going out of your way to find all the secrets or collectables. That says nothing about completing it on higher difficulties, or with permadeath enabled (so tack on another 12+ hours).
<br>
<br>- The gameplay is fast as anything, it rewards you for keeping up momentum and has so many small mechanics that help ensure you&apos;re constantly on the go. The chainsaw&apos;s been given an overhaul to make it into a limited use weapon that replenishes your ammunition, and the finishing &apos;Glory Kills&apos; give you back health, it just works.
<br>
<br>- The progression/customisation is pretty engaging without being an obstruction to shooting things. Almost every weapon has two modifications, each modification has three additional upgrades, and once you&apos;ve unlocked all the upgrades - you&apos;re given a 4th &apos;Mastery&apos; upgrade that rewards you for getting neat kills (double-kills with single shots, locking on to targets who can teleport...)
<br>
<br>- You&apos;ve got an awesome array of Collectables, Secrets, and Codex entries that give you an insight into the storyline, without having it rammed down your throat through cutscenes or hindering the player. They&apos;ve hidden a level of the original Doom in each of the 2016 levels, grab &apos;em all and you&apos;ve got yourself a free game. Winner.
<br>
<br>- Multiplayer&apos;s fine. It&apos;s tacked on, and it&apos;s nothing special - but as an added bonus for an awesome single player experience, why bother complaining? Don&apos;t like it, go play one of the million other multiplayer FPS titles you&apos;ve got at your disposal. It too has a boatload of customisation and challenges, so we can add a couple more hours onto our running total.
<br>
<br>- The exposition of the story is flawless. Doomguy rightly remains mute across the game, but you&apos;re given such a deadpan comical insight into his mindset. The game throws you into combat within the first 30 seconds and it genuinely doesn&apos;t let up bar a couple of (one-sided) conversations. It all flows from one scene to the next, it makes perfect sense, and you really get a feel for the overarching narrative - without any of it being made painfully explicit
<br>
<br>- If storyline isn&apos;t your thing, there&apos;s a whole challenge system based around collecting Runes and earning Combat Rating. Runes offer you gameplay related bonuses - extra ammo drops, wider pick-up radius, while the Combat Rating gives you weapon upgrades if you&apos;re able to achieve specific criteria (Finishing a Baron of Hell with an aerial attack, for example)
<br>
<br>Basically, and as always on this website, I&apos;ve got no idea why people are rating it so low. One guy&apos;s saying this game would be better if it retailed for $10/&#xA3;6...
<br>
<br>I see his point, it would be nice (for us, probably less so for id/Bethesda), but it&apos;s a ludicrous request. If a cinema trip&apos;s gonna set you back &#xA3;15 for some food and two hours of visuals - you can cough up &#xA3;30 for 20 times that content.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s fine. It&apos;s a 9-10 if you&apos;ve got nostalgia for early FPS titles, it&apos;s a 7 if you don&apos;t care for it that much, but by no means is it below a 5.
<br>
<br>This website is living proof of why the hoi polloi can&apos;t be trusted with a mouthpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6393142">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s similar to Serious Sam 3 in a lot of ways, including the melee system and how alt fire works on the weapons. Gameplay follows Sam&apos;s formula, walk into an area and trigger the monsters, there are usually a few already there, but more teleport into the fight in waves as you fight. Once an area is cleared, you stock up on health and ammo and move on to the next.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not quite the same, melee is the primary means of healing as it results in health drops. You do need to shoot most enemies to weaken them before you can do this. Traversal is also a bigger element here than it is in Sam.
<br>
<br>It also takes elements of Brutal Doom and mixes them into the formula. It&apos;s quite gory and the kills are quite a spectacle.
<br>
<br>The result is a fast and fun old school style shooter with Doom 3 style visuals that are newer and shinier. Single player alone is well worth the price of admission.
<br>
<br>Plus there&apos;s a Little Big Planet style map editor system called Snap Map that will give plenty of replay once you tire of the campaign. Users can create both single and multiplayer maps, so regardless of your preference you&apos;ll have tons to do after you&apos;ve escaped Hell in the campaign.
<br>
<br>Haven&apos;t messed with the MP, but I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s similar to Quake and UT. I&apos;m not a MP guy and don&apos;t care much, the rest of the game is more than enough to satisfy me.
<br>
<br>Doom is grand and doesn&apos;t try to reinvent the wheel. After Doom 3 fans asked for a throwback to classic FPS gameplay, and ID delivered exactly that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6392722">Expand</a></span>

I had recently been replaying Doom 3 and you wouldn&apos;t believe what a refreshing game THIS doom is compared to the previous entry in the series.  Combat has a very good flow to it, with melee finishers, gunplay and various mixtures of enemies all coming together to create quite a rewarding experience.  Its very frantic on the higher difficulties and its where the game seems to feel the most satisfying.  The music, aside from the absolutely terrible opening Doom themesong remix, is fine and is certainly a welcome addition to the ambient droning background noise that embodied Doom 3&apos;s soundtrack.  These are techno pumping tunes that almost made me feel like I had just put the original Quake II cd into my cd-rom drive.  Perhaps not quite that level of quality, but once again, its a nice change of pace.  Pace is a keyword here, I&apos;ve been playing for around an hour and have not felt too bored by any particular sequence, the elimination &quot;rooms&quot; as I refer to them are loads of fun and I wouldn&apos;t necessarily call them repetitive.  If you want to call them repetitive, than I suppose Turok 2&apos;s enemy filled portal rooms were repetitive too, however I think in this case its a respectful nod to the Turok series, whether the developers realized it or not.  The visuals are fine and are definitely add a more refined look to the classic enemies from the older games, though I am a little upset that some of the enemy designs from Doom 3 didn&apos;t (or have yet to) show up to the rehearsal.  I would advise everyone with two eyes and a brain to turn off some of the visual features that add nothing to the experience, i.e. depth of field, motion blur, chromatic aberration,.. these are all useless features and don&apos;t particularly enhance the game stylistically speaking.  The campaigns story is a bit derivative, since thus far its been a (mostly) retread of the Doom 3&apos;s plot, which is not so much disappointing as it is, well, &quot;troubling.&quot;  I&apos;m annoyed that they couldn&apos;t be bothered to be a little more original with a franchise that has literally not even bothered to have much of a plot since the third game tried its hand at creating one.  All this aside, Doom 4 is an action game, it allows for a lot more mobility than any of the previous games, isn&apos;t concerned about making itself spooky, and doesn&apos;t have monster closets and those are all positives for me.  Sure the level design and environments are more open, but you have to remember that the reasons they designed the original Doom games the way they did is because it was not feasible to even have the kind of open environments and level design you see in 2016&apos;s iteration.  I&apos;m not intimidated by a first person shooter moving away from cramped corridors and feeling more like Quake 3 and neither should you.  Besides, in my opinion the third Doom game was only as claustrophobic as it was for mainly one reason, they didn&apos;t know what else to do with the level design.  So they played it safe.  This game is far better than RAGE and at least three or four (maybe even five) times better than the third Doom game, but is it better than the originals?  My answer will always be no, because of the amount of respect I have for the original games and the changes they brought to videogames (historically speaking of course).  However, I cannot say or will not say that Doom 4 misses the point of the originals or is anything near average, its most assuredly above average.  So if you were one of the ones that played the multiplayer BETA and were not entertained by it, check out the game at least for the single player, it will hopefully change your perspective on the whole game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6392045">Expand</a></span>

And the exploration, oh my, I love the exploration! I&apos;ve spend so much time just roaming around trying to discover every secret there is.
<br>
<br>The game is fast in bursts of demons. Then it slows down and let&apos;s you discover the map until you run into another demon nest. And every battle is unique with traversal of the environment in all dimensions. Enemies are really well designed. Each one has a different optimal approach for extermination. In each battle you find yourself constantly laying out tactics for which demons to hunt down first. And it happens so fast that you can&apos;t help but get a kick out of it! It&apos;s glorious!
<br>
<br>Outdoor environments, indoor environments. Stunning vistas of the martian horizon. And even with so much going on on-screen, I haven&apos;t once dropped below 100 fps on ultra with my GF970. So well optimized.
<br>
<br>This is all I wanted it to be and more. And oh my god, the chainsaw! Love that it&apos;s not just another weapong but actually has a tactical point. The game design impresses the **** out of me. Finally a game that is A GAME! You know, not just an on-rails interactive cut-scene. There&apos;s NONE of that. This is how you make a computer game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6390330">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also the class system is just stupid, this game shouldn&apos;t have classes. The weapons, power ups and everything else should be picked up. There should also be a server browser. 90% of the time I cannot find a game, I&apos;ll be searching continually until I give up from waiting to find players. Also I noticed theres a season pass for $60 WTF.
<br>Love the game but hate it as it has almost no end game considering multiplayer is awful.

Has a fantastic throwback feel to gameplay with hordes of demons coming at you instead of the jump scare horror style of Doom 3. It&apos;s hectic, brutal, and very satisfying. Visuals are outstanding, sound is on point, and performance on my system is very good. I&apos;ve even been enjoying the multiplayer quite a bit which was the biggest surprise for me. It has been polished quite a bit since beta and has a great arena-style feel to it with modern mechanics thrown in as well. There will of course be the die hard arena shooter fans that don&apos;t enjoy it because it&apos;s not as fast as they might have expected and the loadout system instead of strictly pickup weapon gameplay, but I think it works pretty well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6400580">Expand</a></span>

This is easily the best shooter to come out in a good long while. The game plays flawlessly and is extremely well optimized for PC. The story isn&apos;t a blockbuster, but Doom has never been primarily about the story. Doom begins to shine when you get to the parts of gratuitous violence; chainsaw hacking, shotgun blasting, rocket launcher exploding, tusk ripping and throat slitting, Leg snatching, arm slapping, and BFG wielding fun. The Horde mode mentality coupled with the intense atmospheric music never ceases to inspire a feeling of panic intense combat. Small to large-scale variety of enemies forces you to think tactically about the weaknesses of those enemies and makes you adjust with less than a second&apos;s notice about the next maneuver you should execute. The protagonist himself is portrayed as an over-the-top badass, who is dead-set on chaos. Weapon variety is huge and Bethesda pulled no punches when it came to additional features such as weapon and suit customization. Now comes the question should you buy it? Well if you&apos;re a big fan of gratuitous violence first person shooters and in-your-face action Doom is a must-have!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6389745">Expand</a></span>

The action is more fast paced and the levels are more Doom-like.  Is it worth $60?  Ehhh.  I think it&apos;s too simple to be charged $60 for.  I&apos;d wait for a sale or buy Rage instead if you&apos;ve never played that.</span>
