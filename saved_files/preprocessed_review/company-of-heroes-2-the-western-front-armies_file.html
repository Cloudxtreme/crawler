<br>I would score it higher but it shares the issues of the base games such as selling units/abilities as DLCs, having too few maps in ranked automatch and lack of balance.

Actually it&apos;s pretty funny that Relic think we prefer the western armies more than the east. The first time that they annouced this package I though they completely look over the real problem with coh2 (money grabbing dlc, sluggish unit animations, lack of contents, bad unit quotes, weak sound effects and basically everything with the game atmoshere).
<br>
<br>But this time Relic have made helluva comeback. By given us **** of contents and units to play. I&apos;m very excited when I first see the details and informations of it. And it&apos;s the same excitement feeling when I  see coh1 for the first time. sturmpioneer alone might even have more ability slot than every soviet infantry units put together. The animation is a lot smoother. You can see that they have varieties and attention to details (they will act like they use bandage while healing. may seems little but I like it!). The dying quote is back now. Apparently you cannot use these as your of argue anymore.
<br>
<br>It still require a lot of specs to run compare to the graphic quality it provided. But since I bought coh2 It never crashed. And in terms of gameplay it never failed to give me. At this point I think it safe for me to say that Company of heroes 2 has changed. And it changed in the better way. Whatever they did in this expansion is what they should do back then when coh2 was released. And I happy to know that Relic is the kind of developer that learn from their mistake. The only issue that left is the previous two factions. I think we&apos;re just gonna forget about them &apos;cause they have much much less stuff than this one do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-western-front-armies/user-reviews?user_review_id=4294988">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Another welcome addition is the new lobby system that now allows for users to make their own custom matches without all the hassle of only being able to invite friends via steam.
<br>
<br>On top of the lobby system, is now the new &quot;spoils of war&quot; loot system, that will randomly drop you a &quot;supply crate&quot; after a game has ended, rewarding you with a random new upgrade weather its a new commander, skin or bulletin of various &quot;rareness&quot;. A brilliant little feature. All in all, if you liked the original Company of heroes or the sequal, the Western Front Armies is nothing short of a must buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-western-front-armies/user-reviews?user_review_id=4296075">Expand</a></span>

Started with AoE.) I&apos;ve loved and played CoH for hundreds of hours.
<br>I definitely do understand the frustration from a lot of thew reviewers about how unbalanced and buggy the expansion is, but you guys have to keep in mind that the expansion just recently came out.
<br>
<br>I knew that there would be several patches for the expansion, but the frequency of these patches has been far beyond my expectation. For those who don&apos;t like how the armies are right now, I&apos;d just suggest playing the Soviets or the Wehrmacht while the guys over at Sega/Relic continue to smoothen things out.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t speak for all of you guys, but I&apos;m fairly sure that the ones who are more frustrated with the expansion are the ones that play the game more competitively, as opposed to people like me who find the change refreshing.
<br>
<br>Giving it a 9 because the only part that bothers me right now is the difficulty of unlocking new commanders. But this is as of now, as I know that there will eventually be more commanders available...
<br>Unfortunately they&apos;ll be DLC.
<br>
<br>Anyway, if you guys don&apos;t like the expansion, all I have to say is to just try and wait things out until it&apos;s more &apos;playable&apos;. Until then, just keep playing Soviets/Wehrmacht, or the legendary  CoH 1. ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-western-front-armies/user-reviews?user_review_id=4331208">Expand</a></span>

The expansion game is multiplayer oriented and is now a lot more dynamic offering many new strategies and units to use. The pace feels steady and is no longer hampered by long range tanks that would stall games. This expansion puts a much needed breathe of fresh life into the existing game.  The new armies for both sides do a good job complimenting the preexisting Soviet and German armies. The balance does have some issues, and is sure to be tinkered with by the Relic developers. What is obvious in the characteristics of the new armies, is that you can see a path in which Relic could add an additional expansion bringing back famed armies from it&apos;s previous series, the Brits and Panzer Elite.
<br>
<br>On whole, the game is worth the $20. It&apos;s still top in the top class for strategy games but still remains in the shadows of Blizzard&apos;s Starcraft II for strategy game dominance. With this expansion and the further development that is looking to come, Company of Heroes is looking like it might regain it&apos;s reins as a high standing competitive strategy game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-western-front-armies/user-reviews?user_review_id=4310733">Expand</a></span>

Both factions do not build bases the oberkommandos are much like the british in coh 1 while the american forces have a prebuilt base that requires higher echelon troops to unlock buildings which gives an entirely different feel to the game. From what i&apos;ve seen on the oberkommando side they have good troop variety and can even use one of their main base trucks as a powerful flak cannon. The americans on the other hand which I have played frequently is a bit flawed. For one the american riflemen will be the backbone of your army literally since they are the only combat infantry available short of using a commander summon. There are no rangers or even mortars. On top of that the higher echelon troops usually cost a lot of fuel 75-90 and by then the germans would have armored cars rolling in. Another problem is that U.S. forces although their base has gun racks that give instant weapon upgrades it doesn&apos;t exactly help because when your men are out in the field you have to retreat them to give them a bazooka/browning and depending on the size of the map it actually takes longer to upgrade weapons while also putting your territory at risk. It would be great if they had some type of truck that can pass out weapons but until then americans will be steam rolled by germans if there are no russians on their team.
<br>
<br>The spoils of war system is a bit in the &quot;baby&quot; phase meaning I never really got any but what I have received is useless compared to germans that receive 10% bonus exp on infantry so it varies from faction to faction.
<br>
<br>The game itself did receive some love since my framerate no longer lags since I have an average computer.
<br>
<br>All in all if you liked the first company of heroes this would probably be a must buy since they go back to their roots a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-western-front-armies/user-reviews?user_review_id=4387040">Expand</a></span>

Incredibly frustrating seeing so much cheese and imbalance after being so long out. The game runs like a pig as well. The ratio of people q&apos;ing for the game is 90% vs 10% due to severe imbalance. Plus you have to Pay to win to get the commanders needed to beat the cheese call in units.</span>

<br>Western front added two new armies, to the game and removed the dlc commanders, its not longer pay to win. Two downsides, though. First, they did a launch day dlc thing, making mission packs where you have to pay extra, to unlock them, despite them already being in the game, itself. Second, it has terrible net code.
<br>
<br>Another game that is similar, but has less dlc related issues, would be the original dawn of war 2 and dawn of war 2 chaos rising. If wwii is not your cup of tea, try the 40k universe, version. Both play very similarly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-western-front-armies/user-reviews?user_review_id=4450672">Expand</a></span>
