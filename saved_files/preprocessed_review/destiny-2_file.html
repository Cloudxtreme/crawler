<br>Pro - Great Graphics and Excellent Optimization out of the gate.
<br>
<br>Con - Gameplay: Mindless, repetitive shooting against AI that acts solely as a bullet sponge.  The campaign is so poorly written but tries to maintain the appearance of an epic story that after the first couple of hours you are just trying to get through it as fast as you can. Compared to games released in 2017, it is shallow and unrewarding.
<br>
<br>Your hope when playing is that once you hit lvl 20 (a meaningless number) you can finally start the &quot;end game&quot; which is to become more powerful to prepare you for the harder activities like nightfall and the raid. Shortly after reaching 20 the true disappointment sets in - your only options are to run the same handful of public events over and over again to get tokens (which feel so tedious and unrewarding) to get the same reskinned weapons with higher stats until you hit 265 powerlevel. This can take you a few hours to achieve post 20.
<br>
<br>After that the little incentive to play plummets. Your options are to make another character and repeat the same unrewarding, braindead story and just do a few weekly milestones on each character. Or grind the same things pre-265 over and over hoping for an exotic drop. Its a tiny bit of content used over and over again without any feeling of progression or reward.
<br>
<br>Lastly the &quot;customization&quot; present in this game is laughable. Two skill trees that have no options and forces you to use every point in the tree remove all options. Weapon customization is non-existant, you are using the same reskinned guns that you receive all through the early game. The cosmetic items are primary locked behind in-game purchases and are one time use. They ONLY change a color...
<br>
<br>To call this a mmo is an insult to an already dying genre. To call this a shooter is an insult to the few great games that have been released. To call this an RPG is an insult to games like Divinity 2 that have been released this year.
<br>
<br>The game doesnt know what it wants to be, it has the most shallow elements of each genre and the result is a highly polished, good looking game that has no depth or value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7638296">Expand</a></span>

<br>Compared to D1: no new enemies, no new subclasses, less content, no pvp choice.
<br>&quot;Please give us more money so we could return what you had in D1&quot;.
<br>Thanks, no.

<br>People are running around 2 shotting others with hand cannons because of aim assist, people are running around CHEATING with XIM4 and abusing your stupid aim assist on PC.
<br>
<br>You screwed up, getting a refund immediately, your pc PvP community will die stupidly fast because of this.

<br>Take notes from Overwatch and why they removed aim assist during beta.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7638002">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1.) The gameplay is repetitive, but varied enough to enjoy many times over and through many different activities.
<br>2.) The gaming environments are beautiful and encourage exploration through the finding of region chests and Lost Sectors.
<br>3.) The NPCs are actually intelligent, causing many encounters to be fun and challenging.
<br>4.) Character models and gear are sleek and cool to look at and change at a rapid rate, keeping your character looking awesome in a multitude of ways, all the time.
<br>5.) It is recommended you play this game with your friends. Work together to complete challenges, raids, and crucible matches. It&apos;s great!
<br>
<br>1 point off for lack of social features. It is interesting they chose to default microphone on when the majority of players are too insecure to speak with strangers using their real voice. Perhaps Destiny 2 will urge people to break out of their shells?

<br>
<br>CONS :
<br>
<br>- Extremely poor campaign/story.
<br>
<br>- Short campaign/story.
<br>
<br>- Weapon and armor customisation is limited - you can only make slight adjustments.
<br>
<br>- Content is full of padding and rehashed/reworded quests.
<br>
<br>- Content is repetitive, and similar to stuff found in budget F2P games.
<br>
<br>- Most of the game is empty space, empty corridors and empty buildings, connected by &apos;rooms&apos; or &apos;courtyards&apos; of enemies. Again, similar to budget games.
<br>
<br>- It feels like the game has been built as a DLC platform. First DLC being released a couple of months after the main game.
<br>
<br>- The endgame is relatively stale and empty, as other (non professional) reviewers have said. What content has been offered is unrewarding; The stuff that is rewarding is limited to weekly-reset quests.
<br>
<br>Score : a solid 4/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7676655">Expand</a></span>

They rehashed the same armor pieces/guns with different colors as &quot;new content&quot; and called it a day. They put ZERO effort into designing interesting new mechanics/loot/gameplay elements/maps.
<br>
<br>This game is pretty on the outside(for marketing it&apos;s perfect) and disgusting on the inside(once you actually play, it&apos;s obviously just a cash grab). The art is beautiful, but why wouldn&apos;t it be? That&apos;s all you need to sell a game nowadays to people, pretty graphics and good music.
<br>
<br>Obviously if the base game was good, why would anyone buy DLC (thinks bungievision).
<br>
<br>This game could&apos;ve been great, but money. They decided to re-release Destiny and remove everything good about it. It seems that Bungie looked at how The Sims can release a new game with zero features so that they can sell them later as expansions.
<br>
<br>However Bungie seems to have forgotten that they are not selling their game to teenage girls. They dumbed down every system, they made all the loot the same, they made it so the &quot;casuals&quot; aren&apos;t overwhelmed, but are casuals really as stupid as Bungie thinks? I think they aren&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Just because your testers are middle-aged men who never played a game in their life, doesn&apos;t mean that an average gamer wouldn&apos;t be able to figure out how your game works. Even casuals aren&apos;t as stupid as this game thinks they are.
<br>
<br>I wish any of this meant anything, but in the end, they made their moneys and they will continue their **** business practices until they run out of people who buy their games/micro-transactions.
<br>
<br>I am never going to buy anything that has the label Bungie/Activision EVER again. Fool me once... I can do without playing your generic ****.
<br>
<br>If the first game was on released today on PC, not a single person would be playing Destiny 2 after finishing the story. That&apos;s how empty this game is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7692038">Expand</a></span>

<br>The PvP is even worse than the one in dishonored. P2P, Broken Matchmaking and you can&apos;t f***ing reconnect if you game kicks you out for no reason.
<br>The PvE content is pretty boring once you finished the raid and the story.</span>

<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>- The gameplay is exactly the same as the first game.
<br>- The classes are the same (except the subclass is the starting class)
<br>- The gear, like most FPS Action RPGs, is trivial at best
<br>- If you even want to consider Competetive PvP you&apos;ll be grinding
<br>- BULLET SPONGES - Enemies are just that. They are not smart. They are not crafty or complex.
<br>- You do NOT EVER need to use your abilities to succeed in this game. They are afterthoughts.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not a terrible game, but it is terribly boring. If multiplayer can somehow change that, that may be it&apos;s only saving grace.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7666070">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I am going to give you an example. After the story was done, i had hit lvl 20, and gear level 265, i was hungry for more content, so i went and did EVERY SINGLE adventure in destiny 2, i spent about 6 hours on it, thinking, i am going to get the sickest reward for all this work. What did i get, not a f*cking thing.
<br>
<br>This is destiny 2 in a nutshell. The story is OK at best, short, predictable, lazy, after the story, the game i basically over. Even the grind to aquire better  gear level is so boring i actually logged out of the game and went downstairs and asked my girlfriend how her day was, she looked at me and asked me if i was feeling well. No, i wasnt feeling well, i felt **** sad.
<br>
<br>This game has so much potential, how about one huge open world, with stories, events, quests for legendary gear, pvp, treasure hunting, constant progression, perks, so many different weapons you could have a loadout not everyone playing the same class as you had. a game that rewards exploring, crafting combining recources with shaders and mods to get armour pieces that were utterly unique, That would be amazing!
<br>
<br>instead i am left with an impression of being scammed, this game promised so much, had so much potential, the game looks gorgeous. Just imagine, if one of the zombies working at bungie had said; guys, lets make this game the mother**** best game open world rpg shooter the world has ever **** seen. Lets make the god damn World of Warcraft of shooters. No, instead they make a theme-park piece of crap that looks golden but has less content then my Instagram DM`s.
<br>
<br>Dont buy this game, its a cheap moneygrab and feels like a gold plated potato. i give this game a 2/10 because it looks nice.

After you spend ~15 hours in the game you are done with the campaign at which point you are exposed to the outrageously lacking end-game content. This game also requires knowledge of the first game; if you don&apos;t know what happened in Destiny 1 you will have no idea what is going on. Not only is there almost no end-game content, but Bungie is also posed to launch a DLC that users have to pay for in December. Besides a few obvious differences like how they jump, the classes are extremely similar and only differentiate in a few ways. The talent trees for each class are extraordinarily dull and don&apos;t really change the way you play the game. People have said that this is a MMO-type FPS, but don&apos;t be fooled. This is not a MMO nor is it anywhere near one.
<br>
<br>The good parts of this game are the combat systems and the looks of the game. It really is one of the prettiest games I&apos;ve ever seen and the combination of multiple weapon choices and weapon mechanics make combat exciting. There&apos;s also no difficulty settings so you can&apos;t ramp up the overly-easy standard difficulty or turn off the hilarious auto-aim setting.
<br>
<br>This game is no where near worth the price that so many paid. Such a disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7699381">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My biggest problem with Destiny 2 is CONTENT.
<br>I&apos;ve reached what is in essence, the endgame for Destiny 2. It&apos;s only been less than 5 days, and I consider myself a casual gamer. For 60 bucks, you earn yourself a remake of Halo, where instead of fighting Elites, grunts, or brutes, you fight robots (sums up a majority of the antagonists) and mutated naked mole rats for 5 days. That alone should flare a red flag that this lack of content is unacceptable by any company. It feels like a half finished game, where the developers hastily threw in elimination side quests on steroids and called it content. The story itself lasts roughly 6 hours or less depending if you skip through all the action packed cut scenes. Once you run through a few &quot;Public Events&quot;, you&apos;ll see they all follow the same pattern. Protect this. Move over there. Kill this.
<br>The class and subclass system are over hyped. They are all nearly identical, with differentiating factors being grenades and small stats. The only saving grace for this game is the game play. Again, it essentially feels like a remake of Halo with different lore. Not convinced? Look up Destiny 2 reviews on Youtube by original dedicated Destiny players, and you&apos;ll see the same response.
<br>Lets stop companies from pushing out half ass products.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7648855">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have run into some game-crashing, but in the 20+ hours I have put into it, it&apos;s happened maybe 5 times, and usually happens after alt-tabbing out of the fullscreen.  It&apos;s a minor annoyance for an otherwise outstanding experience.  The game is running brilliantly with my i7 4790K and GTX 960 SC, constantly staying at 60 FPS aside from the occasional dip to around 55 FPS.
<br>
<br>The endgame is a little lackluster at the moment, but seems promising.  My biggest complaint at this point (besides the intermittent game crash that happens) is the lack of a &quot;Local&quot; chat.  It&apos;s way too hard to interact with other players that aren&apos;t already friends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7659818">Expand</a></span>

The story is absolute trash, but with a group of friends, the gameplay is a lot of fun.  The pvp seems to have been tweeked since beta and the time to kill feels much better.  Over all, the movement is a bit slow for my tastes, but it feels fairly well polished and I&apos;m looking forward to seeing what the future holds for this game.
<br>
<br>I just really hope the developers do right by their community and flesh the game out with at least a few free content patches.  Right now a lot of people seem to be comparing this to Warframe, which can be played and enjoyed without spending a dime on it, not to mention it contains some of the best bits of story I&apos;ve ever seen in a game.  Bungie has listened to a lot of what people said about Destiny 1, taking a lot of steps in the right direction, but has also made some mistakes.  Here&apos;s to hoping they correct their mistakes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7638468">Expand</a></span>

Now the bad:  Literally everything else.  The plot is shallow, filled with characters that are generic, lifeless, and utterly devoid of any reason as to why you might care about them.  The main baddy, Gaul, has no motivation for anything he does other than &quot;he&apos;s a bad guy&quot;, no backstory, and no reason for doing anything he does.  He spends the entire game telling everyone who&apos;s around during his cutscenes about how he wants to be &quot;chosen&quot; by the Traveller to receive the light, and then at the end of the game, decides **** it, Ima take the light like everyone&apos;s been telling me to the entire game&quot; with absolutely no acknowledgement about this sudden and drastic change of heart nor any justification.  The NPC protagonists are lifeless, flat, 2-dimensional objects who serve no purpose except as narrative devices to further what can only generously be called a plot.  The voice acting is awful, with the exception of Nathan Fillion, and even he is forced to work with bad, non-sensical writing (robots don&apos;t eat, so why a joke about shooting the big baddy in the head and then eating a sandwich?).  The strikes are boring and linear.  Run here, kill some of them, get to the end, kill a boss that is just a scaled up version of one of the thousands of baddies you&apos;ve killed up to that point.  Rinse, repeat.  The gameplay consists of just putting as many bullets downrange as possible while occasionally meleeing when things get too close.  There is never any sense of tension or risk in this game, because you can either respawn immediately after you die thanks to having &quot;The Light&quot;, or respawn 10 feet further back because the game implemented a checkpoint system for areas where &quot;respawning is limited.&quot;  Your choice in character class does not matter, as it won&apos;t have any impact on how you play the game.  Your weapon choice has virtually no impact on the tactics you must employ (as the only viable tactic is &quot;shoot lots of bullets into boring enemies and melee if they&apos;re close enough&quot;), and nor does your skill choice, as the skills are on such a long cooldown that they don&apos;t impact the gameplay either.
<br>
<br>PVP is just terrible, missing basic features like an in-game scoreboard, the ability to choose what type of PvP contest you engage in,  the matchmaking has no regard for power level or skill, and power weapons/power abilities are so unbalanced as to simply be &quot;I win fights for 10 seconds&quot; buttons.  This results in a PvP where games are almost always decidedly one-sided.  The game doesn&apos;t even do basic things as punish people who choose to leave PvP in the middle of a match.
<br>
<br>I could go on and on, but the bottom line is that this game feels like it was made by a committee of people who don&apos;t really like video games, and instead of opting for challenge or to take any risks, just mashed together a bunch of elements that &quot;video games are supposed to have&quot;.  The result is an undirected mess with neither heart, soul, or anything interesting to say.  But it is very pretty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7661268">Expand</a></span>

<br>Stupid ideas like oh lets make different looking ghosts you can get. Great, too bad you never see other people&apos;s ghost cause they are not out all the time AND they are tiny specs once out.

<br>Issues:
<br>Can&apos;t see clan members...   Really?
<br>Only 3 people can be in a strike or do anything in the public together?  - Is this an MMO or what?
<br>Can&apos;t see members of your group on the map.  -Really?
<br>Small game world, each planet is tiny.
<br>Short campaign with not enough endgame content.  -2 Days to finish campaign then stuck grinding the same crap over and over.
<br>One RAID after 2 months being out on consoles and PC.
<br>Three &quot;strikes&quot; after 2 months being out.
<br>No gear variety, everyone looks the same and gets the same small pool of legendary and exotic gear. Legendary and Exotic gear are not really legendary or exotic because everyone get them same gear...
<br>Me and my friends are bored already and it&apos;s only been 2 weeks.
<br>
<br>Expansion after 2 months that you have to pay $20 for. NO content in expansion.

<br>
<br>Masquerades as an MMO but falls dreadfully short. Emulates some of the worst aspects of latter-day World of Warcraft such as world quests, randomized gear, being constantly showered with irrelevant loot, a &quot;leveling&quot; experience so brief as to be meaningless, a fear of making in-game currency valuable, and an unhealthy obsession with item level undermined by a fear of making item level relevant to gameplay. The result is a game focused on gear which has an uncertain relationship to actual gameplay and sometimes none at all.
<br>
<br>The world is small, load times are intrusive, interactions with other players are minimal, and the menus are unnecessarily unwieldy.
<br>
<br>On the plus side, many of the guns are well-designed and satisfying to use. Item stats can be customized with a remarkable degree of depth that stands prominently in contrast to the rest of the game&apos;s absence of subtlety.
<br>
<br>The PvP maps are fairly well designed. You won&apos;t find yourself being shot in the back or unable to find cover very often, particularly just as you spawn. The absence of large battles is sorely noted, however.
<br>
<br>The game is plagued by &quot;ultimates,&quot; following the model of Overwatch/League of Legends/DotA. Periodically players receive an unreasonable increase to their power, which is supposed to be &quot;fun&quot; and to mix up the gameplay. Thankfully, the ultimates in this game are not quite as frequent nor as powerful as the ones found in Overwatch. Whereas in Overwatch you may find that an unpleasantly large proportion of your deaths are caused by someone&apos;s ultimate, and that you are generally powerless against someone using their ultimate, in Destiny 2 you will feel that you still have a fighting chance against most ultimates and consequently they will not amount to a majority of your deaths.
<br>
<br>As for the the game&apos;s story, it is an unmitigated disaster. The writing is inexcusable and frankly embarrassing. The villain is not in the least bit compelling, commanding absolutely no respect whatsoever. An attempt was made to make up for what he lacked in character with sheer bulk, with the end result being a sort of fat, alien Bane recycling lazy dialogue about how he is the bad guy.
<br>
<br>The protagonists suffer from a similar flatness of character. Their names are not memorable over the course of the entire campaign, even the &quot;funny robot&quot; who is meant to be the one guy you actually remember.  The proliferation of &quot;token minorities&quot; among the cast stands as testament to their absence of value as narrative vehicles.
<br>
<br>The abundance of cutscenes during the campaign is painful, particularly when considering their high-budget nature and their simultaneous complete lack of meaningful narrative. If the campaign had had a handful of lazily-crafted cutscenes to go along with their lazy story it would have been easier to forgive the campaign as merely an unwelcome tutorial, but the barrage of high-budget cutscenes instead leaves one with an impression of the vast waste of resources that went into this uninspired portion of the game. Perhaps the game could have been $10-$20 cheaper if only this embarrassment of a campaign had not left the drawing board.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7672764">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>-You don&apos;t get a sparrow until level 20(Max level) (This is a problem because exploring Destiny&apos;s planets are extremely boring when walking and spending four hours to do just one mission).
<br>
<br>-You are given huge areas to explore, but they are often extremely empty only offering enemies, small collectables, and one time only side quests. The only planet that seems to be shaped out in my opinion is Nessus
<br>
<br>-You must battle Brain dead AI that poses as much of a threat as an apple covered in razor blades. The only time they&apos;ll actually be threatening is if they are in their taken forms, and are in large groups.
<br>
<br>-A shallow story where the only interesting characters are Cayde-6 and....that&apos;s about it. From a new player&apos;s perspective and anyone elses you have no legitimate reason to care about any of these characters, we don&apos;t know their history, or if they were just like us once. They just come off as generic leaders.
<br>
<br>-Aside from the grenade launchers submachine guns, and the three new subclasses, there&apos;s nothing really actually NEW added to the game. Why not add a whole new class in general? Or at least make limited time events like Sparrow Racing(As an example) permanent.
<br>
<br>-Character Customization is EXACTLY the same from Destiny 1. They didn&apos;t even try to change it! Why should I trust Bungie if they&apos;re too lazy to even change something people hated?
<br>
<br>-Cutscenes that you will most likely skip, because the game gives you no actual reason to get invested into the story or this villain....speaking of the devil....
<br>
<br>-Ghaul is one of the worst main villains in gaming history. He&apos;s not even well designed! He just looks like some fat pale dude, who is trying way too hard to look like bane from Batman.
<br>
<br>Destiny 2 is definitely one of the worst games i&apos;ve played this year. It didn&apos;t fix jack **** from Destiny 1, and even made some things WORSE like Sparrows, Cooldowns, and the idea of the Exotic items being rare. Add microtransactions for shaders, A uninteresting story, forgettable missions, to top it all off, and you get one big clunky mess that should never have existed.
<br>
<br>Buy something actually worth your time, instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7648082">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>-the game is very well optimized, i can easily run it in 4k with a single 1080ti above 80 fps and on top of that it looks very incredible
<br>-the soundtrack is very beautiful, id say one of the best soundtracks i&apos;ve ever heard in video games
<br>-mobile application allows you to track your character progression and even manage your equipment. it also helps with the social aspect.
<br>
<br>now well go to the negative points
<br>
<br>-1 month after release they are going to release a DLC. such a thing should be illegal and is plain cash grab nothing more. Couldn&apos;t they wait 1 month with the release and add more content to the game?
<br>
<br>-the content of which we speak, where is it? there is very little to do in destiny 2. After youve beaten the campagin you can level up your lightlevel, but wheres the point in that? You don&apos;t get stronger by doing that. in fact you even get weaker. I felt much stronger at lightlevel 200 than on lightlevel 300.
<br>in the first 5 days ive leveld 3 characters to max level and reached lightlevel 300 with them. Thats 1 week of content. there&apos;s nothing more to do for me except wait for bungie to add paid DLC into the game
<br>
<br>-PvP theres 2 modes in Destiny 2. Its 4vs4 or 4vs4. Thats right its 2 modes where you play the same thing. Hey maybe the DLC will ad a 4vs4 mode, i think thats missing. Wheres the deathmatch? wheres the big battles with vehicles from destiny 1? it is the most boring pvp game i&apos;ve ever played
<br>
<br>-Story. If you&apos;re into a story that a 12 year old wrote than this game is for you, timetraveling robots, darkness, good vs evil everythings there
<br>
<br>theres alot of small things that make this game unbelievably bad, i wont even list them all but things that show laziness and money grabing
<br>-aim assist perks on weapons when theres no aim assist
<br>-exotic gear that does nothing like the darci sniper and lucky pants
<br>-no world chat, no chat at all. you cant talk in this online game to strangers. only to people you&apos;re in group with
<br>-there are chests in the game scattered around the world but if you loot them to fast then they&apos;ll stop giving you loot.
<br>-shaders arent reusable
<br>
<br>overall i cant recommend this game in this state nor the state after they release dlcs worth 200$
<br>stay away from activision and bungie</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7673995">Expand</a></span>

<br>I am a sucker, a game junkie, but boy Destiny 2 became boring so fast. It doesn&apos;t make me want to OCD grind, maybe I should thank them for that.
<br>
<br>Oh well.
<br>
<br>Maybe the later content will make it better but as it stands at the moment, it is not worth the price at all.</span>

<br>The gameplay is a boring grind with no challenge and has nothing new to offer, the story is full of holes and simply garbage, the characters have no character and are forgettable, the multiplayer aspect is simply not there and half of the game is locked behind a paywall.
<br>Destiny 2? No, its simply destiny 1.5. This whole series is a lie.</span>

<br>
<br>Storytelling-wise: It&apos;s bad. It&apos;s basically Angry Birds. And nothing wrong with that, but whereas Angry Birds leaves out no open questions, Destiny 2 leaves a lot. You would assume Destiny leaves the plot to be uncovered as you progress in the game, but no. Instead, it just more bad layers to it.
<br>
<br>I have not played the first Destiny, but as this is the first time the title appears on PC, I would have expected an introduction into the series. I think it&apos;s safe to assume many others would be in the same boat with me. But instead, the game does not provide anything to make out the story from the first establishment.
<br>
<br>So as far as I know, I am some sort of Jedi, but my powers are drained in the starting cutscene. I am not told what we Jedis do with this power, except kill people. Also, the bad guy has a hostage, but I don&apos;t know who the hostage is. As far as I know, he is just another Jedi, but I am not told why I should care.
<br>
<br>Because of the narrow and one-sided introduction to my Jedi powers, I can&apos;t even tell why I should hate the bad guy. Even if they destroy stars, I am only given one side of the story here. How do I know I, the protagonist, aren&apos;t actually the bad guy here? My Jedi powers are only for killing, after all.
<br>
<br>Throughout the campaign, I am introduced new characters. It&apos;s assumed I already know them. That would be fine, but instead like in Witcher 3, I have absolutely no way to read their backstory.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-wise: PvE: You don&apos;t benefit from open-world if it&apos;s dead. I have yet to find a hidden chest. When it comes to difficulty, as long as you walk, you cant die. You can clear out enemies from a safe distance. The game even incentives you for it, because it&apos;s quite efficient. I tried seeing if there&apos;s any reason I should rush, such as to skip waves of enemies, but there was not. Progressing in the everlasting tunnels requires you to kill the enemies within.
<br>
<br>PvP: I could not fathom how people are so quick to pick up game mechanics. I got my ass handed to me with the hard to aim, but rewarding, handguns on the first day. The last time I mastered anything like that in a video-game took me months of practice. Then I recalled the game has an aim-assistant, which I had disabled.
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>The game is well ported into PC. The game looks great, and I did not assume it to run as smoothly.
<br>
<br>But that does not save the game. **** baked in butter is still ****.
<br>
<br>That being said, I assume there is more to come into this half-baked game in forms of DLC&apos;s. But unless the DLC&apos;s are outsourced, I would not wait for them. There are many ways to spend your time and money, but unfortunately, Destiny does not offer much for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7646179">Expand</a></span>

Memory leak which degrades performance. The worst story in any game I&apos;ve ever played. Hit boxes are busted and it&apos;s more difficult to NOT head shot things. Guns have almost no recoil. The endgame is to grind your light level which doesn&apos;t actually do anything because everything scales to you anyways, you never really change in power level. The talent system is incredibly underwhelming and offers no real choice or customization. There is no chat, at all, including for clans. There is no point to explore at all. Chests are on a timer where you won&apos;t receive loot after you open the first one. The stats, like the talents, are entirely underwhelming. You literally just find the same pieces of boring armor over and over again. I thought this might be redeemed by being able to eventually use exotics - nope, you can only equip one exotic armor and one exotic weapon, non exotic armor does literally nothing. The in-game fps counter is a lie, mine will continuously say 90+ yet feel like 10.
<br>
<br>Any points that I could have awarded this game for anything would be more than negated by the season pass/loot box combo. It&apos;s an empty shell to attempt to get more money out of you when they &quot;fix&quot; it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7648530">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s good it got released but none of the critic reviews mention how alien it is at it&apos;s core.
<br>
<br>The graphics are good, the music is awesome... The rest is kind of meh.
<br>
<br>First big problem with the game is that the social part is almost absent. There are two hubs where people can hang out but there&apos;s no global chat or local chat on the planets (something you could use to tell new people how to make an encounter heroic, for example). No group finding interface at all (although not too much content is available at release and there is no reason to choose a particular strike because they all give rewards from the same pool). The developers seem to be of a &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter what you&apos;re farming, if you&apos;re farming&quot; mindset.
<br>
<br>And the second problem is that the game offers nothing in terms of gameplay that has not been done better before it. Borderlands did the RPG/FPS part much better with more unique skill trees, a better variety of weapons and enjoyable platforming. Any MMORPG did the mass multiplayer better. Lots of games did story better.
<br>
<br>So the only thing that remains is a multiplayer RPG/FPS. And to be good at that Destiny just needs to be much more multiplayer-friendly. Assuming you&apos;re doing campaign/all the good exotic quests and have no friends who also bought the game, you&apos;ll spend about two thirds of your time alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7660464">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>&quot;Competitive pvp&quot; has no ranking system so I don&apos;t see how it could be competitive for anyone. PvP maps are completely exploitable as soon as you figure out how to invalidate spawns to split the other team. Some of the PvP map design is very poor.
<br>
<br>The guild system remained broken on release for far too long so broken it was crashing or lagging out just about everyone on the pc. Not an acceptable thing to allow to go on for so long, let alone get released.
<br>
<br>Again, the core gameplay is great but literally everything else is lacking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7680351">Expand</a></span>

You could tell the game was a mish mash of problems due to a troubled studio with employment problems and trashing of storylines and such.  Bungie is not the greatest place to work for, I would imagine.   It took them years to get to where Destiny 1, Year 3 was and even then, it wasn&apos;t the best it could be.   This game has been half-assed from the beginning but still our friends managed to drudge online for a raid or to play the SIVA event after maxing out our characters.
<br>
<br>Destiny 2 had a great, short-lived story with cinematics and all that...then it was over.   You moved to multiplayer events and it was the same or worse and became a drudge faster than Destiny 1.   I can&apos;t even imagine where to begin with the PC version other than it&apos;s a platform full of aimbot hacks you can purchase and other cheats.   That&apos;s just the cherry on the cake of another Bungie game that was rushed or half-assed just to comply with a 3 game contract.  The employees are liars and Deej is the biggest one.   I think we need a raid to kick Deej&apos;s ass for making this game sound more than it actually is.
<br>
<br>This game is in a a 5 alarm 911 state and I predict the PC version will die faster than the console version...and it will die with inept Bungie employees sitting around a table scratching their asses wondering if this is a game they would actually be excited to play themselves.   I don&apos;t really think so.    Fix it or get out of the software business.   You make great guns but that&apos;s about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7646985">Expand</a></span>

Nightfall Strikes require a group of 6 with no way to find groups in game, so you are screwed unless you have five friends to play with. PvP is extremely imbalanced with no matchmaking.

<br>However, be very careful for playing this game as I got banned for latency issues with no way to appeal.

<br>So, if you want to play with someone, you cannot find him IN THE GAME!!! You need to go to the internet (with your online browser) to Bungie site to create account and there you can COMMUNICATE and CREATE FIRETEAMS....
<br>Ah yes...you cannot communicate in the game  with others, even if they are standing right next to you because there is no GLOBAL CHAT!!!!!

<br>Probably they will add &quot;INVITE A FRIEND IN YOUR FIRETEAM IN-GAME&quot; as a DLC in some future update....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7682292">Expand</a></span>

It offers nothing worth remembering. Its story is basic. Its abilities are dull. Its worlds, while gorgeous, are tiny and feel dead, though not intentionally. It is a pastime at best, and a punishment at worst. Destiny 2&apos;s idea of challenge is taking a note from the Division, and simply putting more numbers in their healthbar, and nothing else. And that is beside its microtransaction and season pass nonsense that has become a staple. I am glad I got this for free, or I would have been incredibly embarrassed to know that I had spent money on this.
<br>
<br>If you can have fun with this, good for you. I&apos;m glad. I wish I still had your optimism, but Destiny 2 to me is an excercise in how much you can get away with providing the bare minimum, in order to maximize profits. But in a world where the Star Wars: Battlefront revival sold 12 million copies, I suppose I should get very familiar with this sort of idiocy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7646556">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pool your money with friends to buy a copy, play the 6-10 hour campaign then delete your character so your buddy can play if you must but it&apos;s worthless as a long term time sink.

<br>Wonderful PC port however, no bugs, wonderful visuals, and great performance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7666259">Expand</a></span>

<br>So you know, this is not an MMO, as while in one non-combat area lets you see 30-40 people in the map, and in the field the best i&apos;ve seen is 4 people.  Except in multiplayer, I have never seen a message, or heard someone talk, at all.  Oh, and theres no public chat, or clan chat, or way to talk to anyone.
<br>
<br>Its also not a complete game.  If feels like there are dozens of places the narrative just stops, and apparently 60 days after the PC launch, they are already launching an expansion pack,
<br>In end game, theres only 1 raid, and 10-20 hours of grinding to see it.
<br>
<br>There are 3 classes that are the same
<br>Your main character is a mute manikin--never speaks, never smiles, face made of stone.
<br>
<br>The story is off kilter
<br>There&apos;s little to no reason to be on half the planets-why are we invading aliens while defending our home from annihilation?
<br>
<br>Its feels profit focused.
<br>The best way to describe this game is it is a high budget free to play game, that also costs $60 dollars to play and the extra content is $35, not $5.  The mechanics feel similarly grindy, and with the same satisfaction.  It feels like its got tons of potential, and is fun for a few hours before you realize, nonononono I don&apos;t want this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7680062">Expand</a></span>

<br>Feels incredibly tedious so far.
<br>
<br>No option to lower music volume, just mute or unmute. Lovely as the music is it&apos;s intrusive beyond belief in most early sections and feels like it trying to tell me how i&apos;m feeling when i&apos;m actually feeling &quot;this feels wrong&quot;
<br>
<br>Might try a different class but the prospect of reliving the early UTTERLY tedious levels seems offputting to put it mildly.
<br>
<br>Additional: I would also like to point out the on rails early section and the &quot;invisible walls&quot; and &quot;out of bounds&quot; areas. Too many times to list here just in the prologue i found clearly open doors and corridors that had invisible immersion breaking walls but there is no consistency. Several times i wandered around to see if this was really all there was, rather than hitting a false wall or a barrier i was given 4 seconds to &quot;return&quot; otherwise i died...that&apos;s right, not spawned back to the nearest viable  part, KILLED.... even in the &quot;last City&quot; area it took me all of 5 seconds to find a part that killed me for being out of bounds. Lazy level design plain and simple.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7639549">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Pvp is nothing special. Seen it 100 times before.
<br>-This is the one that really just DROPS IT. For most stuff I unfortunately discovered you can only have 3 person groups! Why is it not 4 or 6, or 12, or 30!
<br>This is a TEAM GAME. It can obviously handle it as I see 20-30 people doing public events with NO ISSUE. Why would you limit something for NO REASON.
<br>
<br>-The game runs great. It looks great. No issues installing! That&apos;s about ALL I can say as far as the positives go!
<br>
<br>I got this to play for a month or so before Battlefront 2 came out and I wish it was out sooner!
<br>
<br>5.5/10. Solid standard loot based first person shooter....BUT unless you&apos;ve played it for 3,000 hours already...I&apos;d say you&apos;re probably better off going to steam and getting Borderlands 2 for 20 bucks!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7648075">Expand</a></span>

Neither of the games introduce the characters shown in the advertisements for the first Destiny game, and I&apos;m pretty sure they it so they can work on their loot crate gambling system, of which they finally introduced in Destiny 2 (they probably want credit for not introducing the gambling mechanics as a paid for DLC). The gambling extends beyond loot crate slot-machine-esque &apos;gameplay&apos; in the PC version however, as a number of players have been getting instantly banned for opening up the game with discord or other overlays (such a recording software) open (and the plebs say discord is better than skype, psh).

With that said, those are the only two facets of Destiny 2 that deserve praise, and the reason this game gets any points at all. How can a game get so many things wrong is beyond me. Destiny 2 feels more like a public joke than a real game. The pacing is off, the story is unmemorable, there&apos;s a feeling of loneliness throughout the entire game created by Bungie&apos;s lack of desire for any social interaction, no matchmaking, no ranked multiplayer (multiplayer is lacking in so many features it feels more like a demo than an actual release), game-ruining bugs like inability to change key bindings. The list honestly goes on. Seeing game review businesses give this game positive scores is honestly sickening. Bungie used to release pure quality. This is not the same development studio, that&apos;s for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7640423">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ll start by saying this might be the best PC PORT from console I&apos;ve ever played. Day 1 launch is perfectly smooth, and no hints of bugs. The presentation here seems Blizzard influenced, which is to say the presentation of this product is flawless. No small feat in today&apos;s market! The engine looks amazing and delivers high FPS with no loss in frames on my 1070gtx at 1440p.
<br>
<br>And now for why this game is mediocre. First off the game basically plays itself. It is the most entry level shooter I could imagine a modern release being. It plays at about the Doom 2 level of difficulty. Kill things fast dodge left and right, use your abilities. Far too many of the enemies are mindless Zombies who are often un-cleverly spawned into the world, essentially right in front of you with a teleporter beam.
<br>The second problem is the loot and level systems. These are very simplistic, and the numbers make extremely minute differences on gameplay (Youtube these issues if you disagree). The 1-20 leveling system should have just been removed entirely. It serves as a 20 level skill stagger tutorial system that gets disposed of in 10 or so hours of game play never to have any use ever again unless you start a new character. As far as loot goes, there is just nothing to grind for as everything has been balanced so heavily you won&apos;t be getting any advantage over other players through item drops. It&apos;s hard to get excited about a vanilla loot system. I understand that an intricate loot system creates unbalance, but again where is the fun in everyone having access to all the same stuff?
<br>
<br>Lastly despite all the hullabaloo about the countless hours of story in Destiny 2, IT ISN&apos;T COMPELLING! It is all cinematic to the 10th degree, told so that anyone including those with the most extreme attention deficits can follow along. The dialog is so cringe worthy you will have to confront yourself with why you aren&apos;t doing something productive.
<br>I&apos;ve said this in other reviews, but these crazy over the top cinematics the AAA developers keep putting in their games aren&apos;t necessary. If you have an incredibly clever well-written story to tell at 100 decibels, by all means use it. But if you are including it just to check boxes it will look sloppy no matter how artistically you glide and swivel the camera around the terrible terrible lines and overused movie memes.
<br>
<br>In brief summary, you might enjoy this game if you want a great looking super casual shooter with RPG-ish elements and a 100 decibel 1000 milligram energy drink slammed story that will melt your face off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7637642">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game was unplayable for me, I had memory leaks and had to restart game every 15 minutes.
<br>And of course game isn&apos;t good by itself, It&apos;s like you play some mediocre shooter from 2003.</span>

Textures are nothing special, some environmental models are good,  but everything else is disappointing. Antialiasing is bad (outdated tech), and world feels sterile. Like there are no particles in the air or somesuch. There are just two scenes in the game that made me feel wow - the upclose sun and Pyramidion strike (inside).
<br>
<br>Audio - weak. Gunshots are bleak and uninteresting. Enemy sounds, environmental - nothing to write home about.
<br>
<br>Class mechanics - played only 1 of 3 classes, but tried all 3 subclasses. They&apos;re practically indistinguishable. There are only 2 abilities - grenade and ult. And that&apos;s for all classes and subclasses. Warframe has dozens of &quot;classes&quot;, each having a passive and 4 distinct abilities, along with Operator abilities and passives.
<br>
<br>Mobility - compared to Warframe - very weak. No special hits on slide, no diving on enemies, no rolling on the ground.
<br>
<br>Weapons - weak. Extremely limited variance. Very limited tactical modding like choosing a scope, etc. Mostly ugly weapon models. There are some good ones for Exotic quality though.
<br>
<br>Story - weak. 5 year olds might get excited, though. Zavala is voiced by the FBI chief from Fringe, and I love that man&apos;s voice but it&apos;s mismatched for Zavala. Every time Zavala speaks I cringe and notice how that voice is a bad fit for him.
<br>
<br>Social part - VERY BAD. No talking to other players, no matchmaking for nightfall strikes, raids.
<br>
<br>Music - doesn&apos;t get on my nerves and I&apos;m very picky, and sometimes (on Nessus) it&apos;s really good.
<br>
<br>The only good thing I can mention is, despite all that, it&apos;s kinda fun to do brainless shooting of hordes of enemies on some missions.
<br>
<br>Also cannot purchase the game as a gift to someone, Blizzard shop tells me it&apos;s not allowed for my currency. Well done, guys. Billion dollar companies and all that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7640065">Expand</a></span>

<br>Never played destiny 1. Excited for this game. Played game, wtf is this lol? It&apos;s not open-world its all small and instanced. Grouping with other people is downright painful, why not just make a matchmaking option for missions like wtf is this 2009? Thought this was supposed to be a MMO FPS/RPG but what the hell is this? This should be free 2 play at BEST. just UGH.</span>

Here are all the things you should be aware of before purchasing:
<br>
<br>- Campaign is very short, very linear. From the very beginning you know that you have to kill a token &quot;bad guy&quot; named Gary and once you do that - that&apos;s it. All you have left with is s-l-o-w-l-y grind your &quot;power level&quot; using repeatable &quot;Adventures&quot;/patrols/strikes/Public Events, ALL of which happen in same exact tiny areas you&apos;ve visited throughout campaign where you do same exact thing, over and over and over. Oh, and yea, there&apos;s also a single &quot;raid&quot;.
<br>- The &quot;raid&quot; thing: there&apos;s only one so far and it&apos;s easily exploitable for now, with several ways to significantly &quot;shorten&quot; it.
<br>- The PvP system: just a bad joke with only 4v4 mode.
<br>- Social features: another bad joke. No good text chat system (especially for things like guild/group), no good voice system (not even proximity voice chat), most of the communications with other players are done through very few available emotes (unless you&apos;ll somehow coax other person into installing a Discord or other third-party chat/VoIP client). The whole &quot;clan&quot; system is another joke - it barely works now, causing people performance issues (just by joining clan) or issues with not displaying any clan members in clan list. Oh, and fun fact: you can&apos;t see your clan members in any in-game location unless you actively group with them (because the in-game world is EXTREMELY instanced). And even the grouping system is a joke because it only allows 3 or 4 people per group (depending on the activity).
<br>- Game world feels &quot;empty&quot; most of the time - occasionally you might see someone joining in the Public Event... Or you might be stuck doing it all by yourself, with only a couple of other random people just doing their own thing on the same &quot;planet&quot; area. This is due to very anti-social and highly instanced &quot;hybrid&quot; client-server/p2p system Bungie is using even on PC platform.
<br>
<br>The only &quot;positive&quot; thing you might notice is that the game engine performs very well even on low-powered PC. But that&apos;s kind of expected considering that you won&apos;t see many players in any area anyway (especially for PvP mode). All in all, no way in hell it is worth its current retail price (unless you&apos;ll get your &quot;review copy&quot; for free so you can write a mandatory &quot;10/10&quot; review), and if you still want to try it out - wait for it to go on sale for $10-15 sometime next year then buy it, your in-game experience won&apos;t be different but at least you&apos;ll save a significant amount of money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7660608">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay is very arcadey and involves fighting off hordes on a regular basis. There&apos;s a number of various baddies, but the gameplay is incredibly easy throughout the game. You could pretty much watch a youtube video of gameplay to find out whether or not you&apos;d like the game, because if the gameplay doesn&apos;t look fun to you, then you won&apos;t like it. For me though, it&apos;s because of the constant hordes of enemies that I&apos;m able to enjoy it, because it keeps me engaged. But it certainly won&apos;t be everyone&apos;s fancy.
<br>
<br>The baddies have weak points, (mostly headshots), to give you the extra gratification of landing your shots. And when they die they tend to explode in a manner that&apos;s similar to the grunt birthday headshots. There are some bullet sponge bosses, which I generally find boring to fight, so I tend to avoid them when I can since they&apos;re mostly tied in to public events you can do simply to level up and get loot.
<br>
<br>The graphics are for the most part, pretty damn good. They&apos;re certainly not hyper realistic by any stretch, but they&apos;re generally gorgeous to look at. On a 1070, I&apos;m able to play the game at max settings at 1080p with over 100 FPS on a mere I7 2700. So I consider the game extremely well optimized. I rarely ever encounter significant frame drops.
<br>
<br>As far as weapons go, there are a ton of them. And I&apos;ve really been loving that. It keeps the game interesting by having different means to eliminate your creeps. I find they all look pretty cool and most of them sound pretty satisfying. Balance seems to be all over the place though and can be tough to gauge in the campaign since you can get drops that yield some pretty significant differences in DPS values. The higher level weapons can also have special perks which sometimes provide significant bonuses to a weapon. You can also collect and wield special weapons like rocket/grenade launchers, sniper rifles, swords and shotguns, though you need special ammo to use them that only drops on occasion.
<br>
<br>The main campaign and story is the main source of disappointment for me. The story, in my opinion, is just really, really lame. You play as a guardian who due to space magic known as &apos;The Light&apos;, is capable of coming back to life after every death. This is a major frustration for me, because it cheapens the plot and dialogue. Whenever people start talking about any sort of risk or uncertainty all I can think is, &quot;I&apos;m **** immortal. It doesn&apos;t matter. The job&apos;s gonna get done one way or another.&quot; It&apos;s basically having 24/7 god mode. I don&apos;t have any issue with it as a gameplay element, it&apos;s just that as a plot device it completely nullifies any sense of vulnerability or danger. And naturally there&apos;s a villain who&apos;s trying to capture the light for himself so he can be an unstoppable, immortal tyrant over the galaxy. Cuzz, duh. That&apos;s what cookie cutter bad guys do.
<br>
<br>As far as the levels and actual missions go, it&apos;s a format somewhat similar to mass effect in that you can go to different worlds, (there&apos;s only 5), that you can travel around freely in, which are filled with various adventures and a campaign mission on each of them. The world&apos;s certainly aren&apos;t massive, but they&apos;re a decent size. They&apos;re designed in a way that makes the combat mostly close to mid range.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a small number of players you&apos;ll find in a level that you can interact with. They&apos;re locked out of you campaign missions, (unless you join one another&apos;s fire team), but the adventures, which are essentially side quests, are open to anyone on the map. So you can randomly help out other players and they can randomly help out you. I certainly enjoy this feature, but it doesn&apos;t feel MMO at all. You&apos;re lucky to bump into even a few players at a time. So it feels more like a gimmick than a fundamental feature. Unfortunately, the game&apos;s total content is lacking. You can complete everything well within a week, which is disappointing for an MMORPG.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is where the real replayability is at. It&apos;s essentially Halo PC with a bunch of extra features. You can bring guns you&apos;ve collected from the campaign into multiplayer with you, but they don&apos;t come with the DPS stats, so everyone&apos;s weapon is the same in that regard. However, you do get to take advantage of whatever special perks you weapon has. This bothers me, because it&apos;s an unfair advantage, but it essentially just reinforces the benefit of completing the game before getting into multiplayer.
<br>
<br>You can also use you special weapons, but you require special ammo that spawns at opposite ends of the map with a timer. There&apos;s various abilities like sticky grenades, explosive throwing knives and shields. And then there&apos;s ultimates you unlock after getting enough kills and assists. They&apos;re not as strong as the one&apos;s in overwatch, but they can still be frustrating when the enemy team is stomping and spamming them all game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7669624">Expand</a></span>

First off, this game is a technical masterpiece. It looks stunning on pc, runs amazing on both of my rigs and gives me a lot more variety than Overwatch. Destiny 2 is my first attempt at the series... I avoided it because of the reviews last game, but I played the beta for 2 and I&apos;ve been hooked ever since. Anyone that rates this game lower than a 6 probably doesn&apos;t know what they are talking about.

So much potential to talk about something with meaning like what life was like, what it is we&apos;re fighting, or really anything of substance, but instead we get cheap quips, flat humor, or exposition about how this guy is situationally worse than the guy before him for doing the things and needs to be shot while pacing in a clearing or threatening an abandoned structure.  The beginning was phenomenal because they gave us glimpses into life outside the city, beautiful panoramics, and serious challenges to overcome.  Then it turns into everyone loves me power fantasy throw fireballs at the bad guy and never fail again.
<br>
<br>As far as gameplay goes, it is bare bones minimum.  There are three player classes which have three subclasses each with 4-5 five abilities.  These abilities have such long cooldowns that it really doesn&apos;t set the classes apart most of the time.  The gunplay is satisfying, but one quickly discovers most guns perform worse than the few good stat combination ones.
<br>
<br>The level quality is inconsistent.  Earth and titan look amazing while io and nessus are boring balls of dirt with bits of metal poking out every once in a while.  With only a small handful of dailies, strikes (co-op dungeon runs for 1-3 people), and pvp modes/arenas, there is little content to keep people going towards the end goal of a 305 average gear score once the story and side quests are done.
<br>
<br>I give this a 5/10.  It&apos;s decent, but it is not $60 decent.  It has so much potential it&apos;s painful, but has difficulty living up to the hype.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7666975">Expand</a></span>

<br>The major downfall of this game from my experience on console would have to be the endgame. While I&apos;m perfectly fine with bungie taking things such as random weapon rolls out of the game, they really need to add more, meaningful endgame activities. However, props to the pc version for making crucible a much more enjoyable experience than console.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7641685">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is basically a large extension of Destiny and it brings the game to a new port, which for me was huge as a PC player. I will subdivide some genres to make clear the strong and weak points of this game.
<br>
<br>-Story-
<br>The story of Destiny 2 is a very simple one. Basically, after defeating some of the darkness in the first Instalment, some new threat had to be implemented to become a large enough deal to work a story around. However, it felt rather spontaneous and not very persistent. For example; your special powers as a guardian are being taken away in the first mission, only to regain it within the next hour of gameplay, this makes it feel as though the game&apos;s story is dismissible at first. The story implemented in Destiny 2 feels as though it was meant to introduce you to the new world of play so that you can better start off at your maximum level with slight area knowledge. The story is not the selling point of this game, therefore I&apos;d like to stress that this is in fact not that big of a deal to anyone who bought Destiny 2 for the right reasons. Overall the story felt serious enough to do, yet dismissible enough not to properly remember.
<br>
<br>-Gameplay and Classes-
<br>Once again they use the same classes as the first instalment, Warlock, Titan and Hunter. Each is specialised in their own traits (as the classes imply) and feel very unique. I have to give a straight A for this class system. The classes give a strong sense of uniqueness and are powerful in each of their subclasses when used correctly. For example, a Warlock can become a Stormcaller, Voidwalker or Sunblade. Subsequently, these classes are good at Mob management, Boss nuking, and PvP combat.
<br>This makes neither of all the subclasses ever feel unnecessary or useless.
<br>
<br>How the gameplay feels is very much based on how well you know your class. Someone who is great at playing Destiny 2 will find the Gameplay extremely smooth and satisfying and someone who is not will likely find it very difficult or rough. Though this does decrease the accessibility to crowds that are not about serious gaming. Overall the Gameplay feels rather smooth.
<br>
<br>-Loot and Rewards-
<br>There are several rewards that you can earn in Destiny 2 for doing several things. The most common reward at max level is engrams. Engrams are random items of a certain rarity that you have to go and &apos;open&apos; at a vendor. You can earn these rewards by completing set challenges, milestones, or obtain them at random by doing anything in the world. Overall I like the looting system as it feels very rewarding to those farming it and playing the game actively. The exotics feel a little less exciting than they used to, however, they are on a different power scaling than they used to be, allowing for more versatility in gear sets, as you can only equip one exotic of each type (armour and weapons).
<br>
<br>-Performance and visuals-
<br>Now here&apos;s the tricky bit
<br>Destiny 2 looks amazing and has great graphics all-around, however, there are a few issues.
<br>One of these is a very serious one that I&apos;d like to stress; namely, the memory leak issue when (which is always) the game fails to load the Clan roster. It will keep reloading this action into your memory until it is virtually full and you have to restart the game. Also, there seems to be a screen tearing issue when going above 60 fps in this game. However, the game is very well optimized for PC and gets great performance and FPS overall even on higher settings.
<br>
<br>-Community-
<br>The community of an MMORPG Action game is - as any real RPG player knows - almost the most key part of such a game. Destiny 2 consists in my experience out of extremely helpful people and people who are willing to spend the time to make an effort towards a conjoined goal. I have rarely seen such a laid-back, yet serious gaming community. I must say the game&apos;s overall community seems to be a nice bunch to be around. Lots of dancing, but also lots of monster slaying!
<br>
<br>-Post Scriptum-
<br>I see a lot of negative reviews here and I looked deeply into a few of them, it seems they all have not played more than 1-5 hours. I urge you to not attach too much trust into these reviews as they are likely biased and incorrectly researched.
<br>
<br>Thank you for reading if you got this far and I hope to see you on the Leviathan soon.

But it sure is a fun game, after the campaign... it&apos;s &quot;story rich&quot; Campaign leaves a lot to be desired, with it being only about 10 hours long, if that. The villain is actually rather bland, they could have done more with his inner conflict but chose to leave that out of the game? I don&apos;t know why, on the surface he is a conflicted villain who wants to obtain the light the &quot;right way&quot; but then chose to do it by force... huh? He wanted to go against his teacher&apos;s teaching and then decides to just say screw it I&apos;ll do it the wrong way, very confusing. Also I think the only character I actually cared about in the campaign was the Cade and his trusty sidekick Colonel Chicken. I think the only game that I&apos;ve beaten the story mode faster in was mortal kombat X (In one sitting) Destiny only took me two sittings. Campaign was quite lackluster.
<br>
<br>Alright now we are getting to the juicy goodness of Destiny 2. If you have a friend that plays PC, you better tell him/her to get this game right now, it is the best CO-op experience on the market with the PvE format, nothing comes even close to what Destiny 2 can do. The strike missions are the icing on the cake and the goal of all Destiny players to complete, the prestige mode is also a welcome challenge to the game that I hope to get to come day... Which leads me to my next topic... The grind... is very real, it might be the reason why the campaign was so short (maybe it was like a tutorial for the real game actually...). If you don&apos;t like grinding, just get out now, there is no game for you here. Those that do however, you are going to get such a rush when you get the one armor piece that you&apos;ve been grinding for hours to find and when you get it, the feeling is like magic, for real, you feel like you&apos;re on cloud nine, there&apos;s nothing else like it in any other FPS.
<br>
<br>Okay, now time for the dumpster fire that is PvP, seriously, what were they thinking? Is the matchmaking run by baboons? How come In PUBG I can match up with nearly 100 players instantly, when in Destiny 2 it not only takes 2 minutes, but I get matched with three randoms vs a group of four in a clan... seriously? How is this even possible? And don&apos;t even get me started on the Aim Assist problem, come on really? If you need a controller to play a FPS on PC than why did you buy the game on PC in the first place!?!?!?
<br>
<br>*sigh* Okay, the rant is over. I have to give credit where credit is due to the developers of this game... Vicarious Visions, these guys deserve an award for bringing a game that was meant to be played with a mouse and keyboard to the PC, these guys have done a phenomenal job for making the PC version of this game beautiful, and I don&apos;t get enough credit for this achievement in video gaming history. From a technical standpoint, this is how a good game on consoles can be infinitely better on PC, thank you Vicarious Visions, for setting an example for the game development community.
<br>
<br>You may be pondering on the score of 7/10, and I was thinking about it myself... doesn&apos;t just mean that the game is average? Barely passing? It means both of those things, but it also means that there is room for improvement as well. Destiny 2 in it&apos;s current state is an average game but with incredible potential, so many things are locked behind closed profit doors. Will I probably open those profit doors? Yes, yes I will. Battlefront 2 is making steps in the right direction saying that ALL DLC will be free. I hope Bungie&apos;s dip in profits from the last Destiny show them that most of the gaming community will not stand for this kind of pay more to play more scheme, it worked with EA, why not Bungie? Come on guys, you are so close, just make the DLC free and everyone will play your game till the end of time. Just make the DLC free and this score will instantly go up 2 points.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/destiny-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7647105">Expand</a></span>
