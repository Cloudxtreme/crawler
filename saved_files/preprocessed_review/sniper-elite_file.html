The one that you shake your fist and yell &quot;YES!&quot; the secont you know you made it. The one that you know your friends cant make. The only reason this is not a 10 is because some things could have had more time spent on them. A little more ragdall, not to much, but just enough to make you chuckle when you pick that guy off at 250 yards at a dead sprint, and you watch as his body slams into the earth with all his momentum and weight behind him. Some more sniping locations would be nice, and the lines in the crosshairs of the snipers are helpfull...but they are too helpfull. Every shot should be a challeng. Either you can make the shot of you cant, you dont get two guesses at different notches, you have one shot, and where you place it is depends of your instinct. Cant wait for #2, its going to be breathtaking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite/user-reviews?user_review_id=389605">Expand</a></span>

I can honestly say I never found it boring - the gameplay is far too tough for that. I played this game a year ago, got thru the campaign a couple of times and then eventually uninstalled it to make way for other offerings. Recently I bought Call of Duty 2 in the expectation that it would be great. I have played about 3 levels but think I will take it back to the store. Its a typical corridor shooter that involves moving down one path with little or no discretion and killing the ever lasting hordes of enemy popping up before your eyes. After a couple of hours of gameplay I am bored in a way that sniper eleite never bored me in its entire campaign. Hope that a later version is turned out - there will always be niche markets for this kind of game. The only game I haev found close for tension is Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter another game that allows you wide discretion in how to approach an objective.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite/user-reviews?user_review_id=396278">Expand</a></span>

Enemies are smart not just blank targets (single player).Play seems like what a real sniper during WWII would do. I need at least two hours a day of Sniper Elite for my gaming fix.</span>

But all in all, a sniper fan WOULD hav the patience to wait and snipe, so other quick-paced gamers may not like it that much, but if one needs the close sniping experienc, this is it..as far as i know..as yet.

You are dropped off in the middle of a city, you find your way to the top floor of a building, look through your scope and start picking off enemies at 100m away. The physics in the game is done well, you gotta aim above the head to account for the gravity. But as you play, you start noticing its shortcomings. Enemies from far away have unrealistic aim with their machine guns. You cant control vehicles. I know its a sniper game, but when you see 2 russians come out of a tank and you take them out, you should at least get to use their tank. The biggest shortcoming is the map layout. You CANNOT enter buildings! A game that relies heavily on you finding a good sniping spot, doesnt even let you do that! There is a few half-destroyed buildings that allow you to enter, but they dont provide much of a spot. I would like to kick open a door of any building, walk to the 3rd floor, go to a room, open a window, and start sniping. The way it is in the game, you are pretty much out in the streets. This game had so much potential, hence the low score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite/user-reviews?user_review_id=383385">Expand</a></span>

This is a first class shooter and probably the most realistic one ever. Tired of walking godlike through though other games with all your armor/shields/suits providing you with all but immunity while your single shots take out legions of super cool but super weak opponents? Well in Sniper Elite a bullet will kill you and opponents won&apos;t just stand there waiting to be fragged. In this game you better keep your head down, move carefully, and make sure that your shots are carefully aimed, or you&apos;re toast and quickly so. Most of the bad reviews here are from kids who are used to blasting there way through hordes of 100 foot aliens without getting scratched. For them it is very frustrating when an enemy who you can see perfectly can also see you and who can fire their weapon just as accurately as you. And yes, if you fire a rifle, it can actually be heard from a mile away. And yes, you will be hunted down and killed if they can find you. The idea that a single soldier should easily be able to wade through a few dozen enemy soldiers every time is just a joke. Snipers in war have some of the highest casualty rates and so will you when you play this game, which I think is a good thing. The situation with some of the complainers here reminds me of paintball, where all the kiddies come out thinking they will be Rambo and then get pissy when they get taken out quickly over and over again. Anyway, this is a great game, I rank it right up there with Crysis as one of the best FPS sniper games ever. Highly recommended for those willing to face the realistically bad odds of a war zone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite/user-reviews?user_review_id=746979">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll spare you the rant and give you some highlights. The bullet drop is hilariously bad. I&apos;ve fired BB guns with better accuracy. The game focuses on stealth, and yet only the pistol is silenced, and the gunshot from your rifle can be heard from the entire country of Germany. Enemies clairvoyantly know where you are and will run directly to your position, even if you&apos;re moving silently, and even if they&apos;ve never seen you. Soldiers can usually take a bullet to the chest and keep moving. They are precision-accurate with wartime machine guns (remember, guns that were built to be cheap and fire bullets, but not for much else.) Most enemies are quicker draws than the Sundance Kid and more accurate than John McClain. At one point, I got frustrated and simply rushed through a mission with a machine gun, sniping nobody. I completed all objectives easily, and spent much less time doing it. Terrible game. Avoid this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite/user-reviews?user_review_id=744019">Expand</a></span>

This is mainly due to clunky controls that have you looking down at your keyboard more than the screen, and some of the gameplay ruining what would otherwise be great fun. The computer AI leaves a lot to be desired, with enemies just running straight to where you&apos;ve been hiding silently for 5 minutes. But the most annoying aspect is that if you make any noise that isn&apos;t covered by some shelling (and only your pistol is silenced) then every enemy for the rest of that level (however far away) will be spooked. This leads to constant re-loading just to have some proper sniping fun.
<br>
<br>The sniping is by far the best thing, you just never get bored of the bullet camera showing you the enemy getting it right in the head in slow motion, and it&apos;s good that you have to adjust for bullet drop and wind. But this doesn&apos;t make up for the fact that everything in between running from sniping spot to sniping spot is annoying and hard work.
<br>
<br>This is a brave and innovative game that just falls short in the way it is executed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544072">Expand</a></span>

<br>I like to be able to save when you want, although it is limited before it affects your score (Which I do not care about). I heard on the harder levels it may only let you 7 saves or something. I believe there are 4 levels of difficulty and I started with easiest to learn the controls and moved up one level. I assume it can get pretty darn hard as even on the 2nd level, you have to manage your ammo and bad guys sometimes do not appear until you have been shot. They will sneak around behind you and nail you or pop up on building roofs you already walked by. Some good sound effects of people screaming etc. All versions of this game need to have a scarier feel. I have seen some big rats and birds, etc. These games need civilians, injured and wanting of help. Would be good side mission stuff. I do get killed a fair amount, I need to learn to play slower. You do not just gain health in 3 secs like V2, you have a gauge that you can fill back up using med kits (which I like). Tanks are there with there caps (some of them). It still is sometimes confusing on exactly what it is the game wants you to do. I found the pistal not very usable at a distance I did find usable in V2. Sniping is still very fun, and has the slow mo bullet and pretty good reactions of baddie being hit. Over all, I would think if you liked V2, you would like this one. It is fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3400040">Expand</a></span>

The ballistic modeling is terrible...I have been a long range target shooter for many years and was extremely disappointed with this aspect of the game. The idea of having to aim high on a target 100 meters away is ludicrous. Generally speaking a rifle is sighted in at a minimum of 100 yards, and the ballistics of most rifle cartridges is such that gravity has very little effect at the ranges presented in most of the game. It appears in the game that the rifle is zeroed at the muzzle and any target beyond that range requires ridiculous elevation compensation. The other huge mistake made in regards to bullet performance is the damage inflicted. So far I have only been able to get a kill with a single bullet if a head shot was made. Rifles of the caliber used for this kind of shooting very reliably produce kills with a single shot to center mass of the chest cavity, and it is uncommon for someone to sustain a chest hit and remain on their feet, let alone, still shooting back while limping towards cover. The information is readily available to easily correct these shortcomings with a modest amount of research...COME ON GUYS!!! My other major complaint with the game is the inability to enter buildings and structures. This is supposed to be a somewhat realistic game, yet you would never see a sniper out in the open the way this game requires of you. The advantage of a sniper is in use of cover and concealment to hide his position while employing the ballistic advantage of his weapon to engage enemies with little risk of detection. It seems that all they have done here is dump the sniper into the role of a common foot soldier. Even with these flaws, I found the game challenging and enjoyable, but have to give it a low rating due to the unrealistic mapping and mission requirements of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite/user-reviews?user_review_id=396365">Expand</a></span>

I played it a bit single player (which, by the way, I felt was a fairly high challenge), then I played some of the co-op (which is a bit easier). The games bullet physics work very well, as you have to calculate the gravity, wind, and heart rate into consideration. The levels have good variation, whether it is mainly indoors, in the city, or around large buildings, you will feel like you are usually in different areas. The stealth on here works pretty well, with a moment occasionally that makes you feel that you got spotted for no reason. Usually, however, you will find there is someone who could have spotted you, which makes these alerts seem valid. The stealth bar is not perfect, but that is because it has 25% intervals. The sounds of the game are okay. The objectives of the game are of good variety, whether it is something like escort, assassinate, etc. The one major downside I have found was that the enemies feel a bit too accurate. They can hit you with their PPSH from about 200 yards, which is a bit crazy. All in all, this is a very fun game that should not be overlooked. (Note: PC version has no co-op features. This would drop my rating to an 8.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite/user-reviews?user_review_id=3629852">Expand</a></span>
