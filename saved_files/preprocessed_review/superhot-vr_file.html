Alot of games I&apos;ve played once or twice, or fire up to show friends and family what VR is like. But Superhot was the first game that made me really believe VR could be the future. There are flaws of course; it&apos;s much too short for the current price tag of $30 (only a few hours long), limited range of movement, not being available to Vive owners, and the occasional &quot;why are my hands not doing them what I want them to&quot; moment. But this is the kind of game that is important to the future of VR -- it&apos;s incredibly fun, it&apos;s fast paced and frenetic, it immerses you, and you don&apos;t want to stop playing it till you&apos;ve gotten all the way through. If you own the Touch then I can&apos;t recommend this game enough, in fact of all the motion controlled games I&apos;ve played this is the only one I would say is a &quot;must own&quot;. Especially if you were a fan of the original game, you will not be disappointed. It&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s about as good a VR gaming experience as is currently available.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superhot-vr/user-reviews?user_review_id=6906393">Expand</a></span>

It is a completely new game built for VR, which sounds great! Though one major change I was disappointed in was the lack of free movement; sure you can move around your roomscale environment, but you are auto transported to new spots which I found really hurt the experience. Given you move in slow motion, I figured thumbstick/free-locomotion would actually work pretty well in this game. Unfortunately, we don&apos;t get to find out.
<br>
<br>Stand in one spot, pull off a handful of moves, then get whisked away to the next scenario. Normally you play a block of about 5 scenarios before you &quot;checkpoint&quot;. Fail on the 5th, start back on the 1st. It can get repetitive. And if you miss a ranged enemy and have no bullets/items nearby, you have to move your hands or make strange, extraneous movements to speed time along until he gets into melee range. And miss you can, as thrown objects don&apos;t seem to follow any sort of repeatable trajectories. Take your time on your aim and throw lightly to help improve your chances of repeatable throws. In what feels like a patchwork solution to the &quot;distant-enemies-but-no-ammo&quot; problem, a bit later on in the game you get some glitch-force ability which can explode enemies every 3 in-game seconds which, in execution, ends up feeling less like skill &amp; more like a cheat.
<br>
<br>If all goes right, you can feel kinda cool like in the original. Though unlike the original, it is easier to miss and a bit harder to gracefully recover when you do. And since you can&apos;t move outside your Guardian-bubble, once the flow breaks, the feeling of &quot;cool&quot; breaks along with it. In the end, it feels like a fairly disjointed experience and a bit meh overall. I don&apos;t find it worth the price-tag and it ultimately feels like an average VR experience to me. But I am quite clearly in the minority, just wanted people to take a minute to look into it a bit harder and see if it is truly for them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superhot-vr/user-reviews?user_review_id=7423257">Expand</a></span>
