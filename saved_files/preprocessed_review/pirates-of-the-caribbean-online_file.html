To sum it up in three words: tedious, buggy, and problematic. A great possibility for a fun MMO is entirely wasted on this game. Truly subpar graphics, poorly written dialogue, confusing controls, bland quests, and the big brother that is Disney watching over you. The only saving grace is the mediocre ship combat ripped almost entirely from Sid Meier&apos;s Pirates! The bugs in this game are truly fun killers, including everything from server crashes, graphics clipping, freezing/stuttering, NPC warping, and my personal favorite &quot;ship not available&quot; when trying to board my own vessels. There are far better MMO&apos;s out there, even free ones. I do hope to see a truly great MMO based in the Age of Sails someday, but this is not that game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pirates-of-the-caribbean-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=417142">Expand</a></span>

The missions are cool and a bit of a variety but some are not great and many are &quot;kill x number of *insert monster here*&quot; Doesn&apos;t take long to load things. The ground fighting is fun and there are a variety of weapons and ammo.  The controls aren&apos;t complicated and are easy to learn. The game has fun features like pvp and pvp ship battles. It has improved over the years as they have added more weapons, ships, and also more things that free players can do, which is always good. there are a few bugs tho, a lot of times npc&apos;s disappear and reappear, and they also warp around from time to time. Good overall. 8 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pirates-of-the-caribbean-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2363699">Expand</a></span>

The movies themselves are excellent, but the game...not so much.  After playing the game for about three days, all quests and skills are locked up until you buy the subscription.  Until you hand over your money Disney only let&apos;s you engage in basic ship battles.  When that&apos;s all an entire MMO is reduced to, it&apos;s time to find a new game.  Not to mention that it is extremely buggy and not well thought out.  Most quests follow the same format of kill a bunch of certain types of enemies then return to the person who gave you the quest.  This game either needs more dedication from the makers or shouldn&apos;t be a game at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pirates-of-the-caribbean-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2384641">Expand</a></span>

The only part I wish to talk about is what relevance this will have to do with the movie at all. Disney could have made a pirate game nice, but to include a movie in which has nothing to do with the rest of the world? Fine fine, there are pirates and treasure. But how can there be an MMO with just an ocean? And how can there be an MMO with Johnny Depp running around being better than anybody! As awesome as the idea grasps into my head, I just don&apos;t see it becoming a successful MMO at this point. More coverage from Disney would be greatly appriciated and, even, wanted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pirates-of-the-caribbean-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=58597">Expand</a></span>
