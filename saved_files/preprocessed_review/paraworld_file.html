Although it has some nice cut-scenes it is still nothing special. I was hoping for it to be a fresh look at the RTS genre but it just adds some uninspiring features to the everyday RTS framework. The unit levelling is poorly thought out with there being little benefit to improving your basic troops (as there is a such a small unit limit that you will be forfeiting more advanced troops). The plot of the single player mode is really not worth mentioning as the missions are far from involved and you end up just playing many levels as if they were skirmishes. I&apos;m am sorry to say that I do not have many good comments to make about this games as it has been so disappointing. The graphics are nice but are dwarfed by the graphics and unit animation displayed in Company of Heroes (an RTS released around the same time).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/paraworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=392395">Expand</a></span>

<br>You are thrown into a world where dinosaurs roam the land and different tribes wage war on each other for the control of resources (wood, rock and food). Each of the three tribes have distinctly units and buildings  and their own tamed dinosaurs. Mounted rhinos, war-mammoths, prehistoric...steam-warships, guarding water-snakes  the list of original ideas is endless !
<br>
<br>Finally, an excellent RTS  Ubisoft should do a Paraworld 2.. without spoiling the good ideas, wich remains very good today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/paraworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=3238525">Expand</a></span>

Amid all the headlines, based on World War II, futuristic military clashes and of course undying enmity between orcs,
<br>humans, elves and dwarves, The game features more than 50 prehistoric animals, especially dinosaurs and Pleistocene mammals.
<br>
<br>Paraworld is nothing but a breath of fresh air. Finally, it was time to tame one brontosaurus and jump into the primitive, savage battles conducted daily distant parallel, prehistoric world The story, set in paraworld.
<br>
<br>Hardly worthy of a literary prize, but computer game is more than decent. The actions developed in the XIX century, when a group of ambitious scientists led by a brilliant mathematician named Jarvis Babbitt, formed a secret society to learn the secrets of parallel worlds. After decades of experimentation and study of the matter in question, Babbitt finally managed to find the secret portals between dimensions. This scientific success serving the secret society opportunities hitherto unknown to mankind. All this would be great, but three young scientists encountering evidence that may make public kept a strict secret discovery. Frightened by actions inspired researchers Babbitt throws them in prehistoric parallel world. Ebullient Anthony Cole, strongly tied to nature biologist Stina Holmland,strange introvert - a genius in physics  Bela Andreass Benedek.
<br>
<br>Find themselves all alone in a distant and unfamiliar world. Their sole purpose is to find a way to return home, relying on wore a little weapon - the power of their intellectual capabilities. Whether young scientists will be able to survive in the abundance of prehistoric creatures and savage tribes? Only time will tell...
<br>
<br>Characters caught up in a completely unfamiliar world, quickly realize that they can survive and cope all alone with the challenges faced by them. On the thorny way home they will have to unite with various local factions. The first race that you will encounter in single player campaign Paraworld.
<br>
<br>A tribe of northerners. Each faction has its own specific characteristics. Northerners like the Vikings hold their power, wear similar clothes and beards, and are really good warriors. Their tribe relies primarily on strong physical combat units. After several missions successfully played on the side of northerners will side with the other tribe, called Desert people. In the company of this faction will have to radically change their style of play. Crabs do not rely on massive buildings, and these can in no time be dismantled and moved elsewhere. They are like nomads result of my movement back and forth in search of more favourablee
<br>living conditions.
<br>
<br>Their mobility is combined with their ability to tame dinosaurs. Fighting their units are not particularly strong, but combined correctly, become really powerful military machine. The third race, which will have the opportunity to play in single and multiplayer.
<br>
<br>Game mode is called Dragon clan. This fraction very strongly reminiscent of Japanese culture. Its buildings are constructed entirely in the Asian style, from combat units meet ninjas and other typical Japanese warriors. The most characteristic feature of this tribe, however, is the ability to create mechanized combat units. Such as powerful scorpion, armed with a rotating cutting wheel and other simple but deadly gizmos.
<br>
<br>Each race can increase your starting population limit to the number 52. The interesting thing is that from now on it is distributed in different eras of development. Ages five and separation of the units is as follows: first period - 25 second - 15 third - eighth, fourth - and fifth 3 - 1 (the number signifies the number of simultaneously existing Unity of an era). This whim ensure exciting course of hostilities. Developed to the same level opponents will have approximately the same power units - this means that in the battles of significance is mostly skill of the player to manage its prehistoric warriors. Another feature of the gameplay.
<br>
<br>Is the presence of characters, which is not something new in the genre, and it is hardly necessary to explain a long and wide. In a nutshell - the characters are nine and each has different characteristics. Accumulating experience allows a unit of a,lower class to climb into the upper field population. Engine, power Paraworld
<br>allows recreating a great environment posed a unique feeling in play.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere is very powerful, and the ability to play in five different climate zones: Northern, Jungle, Savannah, ice and ashen wasteland valley contributes to greater diversity. The powerful graphics platform enables the creation of large units bright contrast against the background of ordinary warriors.
<br>
<br>Having more than fifty different animal species (of which forty detail recreated dinosaurs) is another guarantee for the impact experiences in the company of Paraworld Is a real-time strategy, which is a kind of synthesis between the most important game play elements of leading titles in the genre.
<br>
<br>In the new game Developer SEK there is a model for crossing the ages of Age of Empires, strong cash RPG elements - the presence of heroes - intercept of WarSraft III, mystical vision characteristic of Age of Mythology, and &quot;Age of Empires&quot;. If you look closely, you&apos;ll see that the game is almost nothing new (except whim good separation of the population limit), but this seems different because manufacturers apparently have found the formula for combining the leading trends in the genre.
<br>
<br>Enjoy the game on all RTS maniacs.
