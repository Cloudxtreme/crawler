<br>
<br>Now on to the game itself. Well the game is fun if you loved The New Order then you will love this one too. Good action and nice graphics with beautiful music.
<br>
<br>I hate all propaganda they put in games and moves and bunch of pure politician Bullsh*t and incorrect historical information and events. But this is the world we&apos;re living in today its based on a Lies. Either you play the game and ignore these stuff just like me or you skip the game. This game mostly base on shooting stuff and not a story driven game. If you are looking for story then there are better game choices out there.
<br>
<br>Be aware of all the critic reviewers today. They all have been payed on every big game made by a big company like Bethesda, EA, Ubisoft and so on. And most of the Critics gives the same reviews to PC as Consoles when they only played it on Console. Most of them have NO IDEA how the game run on PC. This is getting out of hand and there is absolutely no reliable source no more. To hell with this evil world... Do not trust the critics wait and see for yourself how the game is and runs by watching videos on release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7651202">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Despite that i got a few hours out of it without crashing today and only minor issues with audio and video.  The real issue was how bad the game is.  If you ignore the cutscenes and setting, with the worst characters i have ever seen in a video game, you can get a few decent hours of fun out of the shooting, the problem is that you can&apos;t separate the plot, story and characters from the game.
<br>
<br>It beats you over the head with some of the dumbest commentary i have ever listened to.  It&apos;s so bad it&apos;s like a caricature of a caricature.  when you go that far it just becomes silly and tiresome.  Idk what Bethesda was thinking giving this game to anyone in Sweden.  but they&apos;ve managed to pull a Mass Effect Andromeda in the worst possible way.
<br>
<br>The only people who will enjoy this are people who can ignore everything but the few hours of gunplay it gives you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7651480">Expand</a></span>

<br>Sadly, there are a lot more problems than just the politics. The characters themselves, the character models, dialog, and story are terrible. My favorite person in the game was Sigrun Engel. What does that say about the other characters in the game, including BJ?
<br>
<br>The actual game play is good, but it&apos;s almost impossible to enjoy the game considering all of the other flaws. It&apos;s hard to believe this game was made by the same developer that made the last game. I really liked that game. Now it seems like even that game is tarnished. It makes me wonder if some of the programmers from Mass Effect Andromeda got hired by Machine Games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7658145">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game has MASSIVE problems and I can&apos;t recommend it. &quot;Come again after a few patches&quot; (c)
<br>Best advice - just download the pirated version (Its already out there) and see if It works well for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7647792">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Just stop using OpenGL/Vulkan id in your engines please add DX11 support soon. In the mean time I ain&apos;t neva buying id tech games again or id software ones.
<br>
<br>At least DX11 works better on Win 7-Win10. So please release a DX11 patch soon so I can finally play this game at a stable fps and have better and cleaner looking graphics like I do with witcher 3/new prey/elex/all other single-player games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7650934">Expand</a></span>

<br>Despite the fact that I knew this game was going to be catering to the current political scene, I wanted to believe that it was just  a marketing decision and would have no impact on the game.
<br>I was wrong.
<br>
<br>The whole central point of wolfenstein was killing nazis. This game instead tries to make it as if you are what the far left believes is the antithesis of nazis: Communist revolutionaries. This game isn&apos;t fun, it&apos;s politics with some gameplay.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is extremely bland. They wanted to make this a story game but the plot is awful. The level design is worse.
<br>
<br>The game itself is extremely unstable and crashes frequently. The only people that would defend this game are partisan to the politics endorsed by it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7659417">Expand</a></span>

<br>The writing is atrocious, and actually may make ME: Andromeda look good. Its absurd, politically heavy handed to a degree I&apos;ve never seen before, and detracts greatly from the already dodgy gameplay (good luck using stealth).

<br>took me an hour just to get the damn thing to work on pc, i feel many would just give up. tons of ugly screen tearing. in game vsync is broke. had to disable in game and enable in nvidia control panel. But had to do so in some unknown order combination with rebooting and turning off and on in game since i couldnt repeat the solution. basically its working good enough but still some tearing. also had to disable the dpi resolution option in the executable properties to get 4k to work..oh i also had to install a latest hotfix from nvidia even though the fix said it was for kepler cards i have win 10 and 1080ti fully updated. i guess bethesda doesnt test their pc game on win 10 or nvidias latest cards.

<br>Gameplay - 5/10, gunplay doesn&apos;t feel powerful, levels are extreme corridor-minded. AI, super agressive - cool BUT you are can die from 3-5 good landed bullets even on easiest difficulty. You&apos;ll be dying a lot and you&apos;ll rage because epic moments gonna be ruined by insta-death from nowhere.
<br>Story - 6/10 - US under nazi setting is old and doesn&apos;t really work. Character&apos;s actions are not very natural.
<br>
<br>I start a game, excited and so on, it is Wolfenstein II let&apos;s kill some nazies.. oh.. what I&apos;m looking at? Some unneeded drama from main hero&apos;s childhood. For some reason main hero is super attached to  a character who was just a cardboard background in 1st game? O_o... Ooookay. Further cutscenes are trying to show me why Nazi&apos;s are a bad thing - I get it... but where is cheesy killing mfking nazies action I loved 1st game for? Nope.. still don&apos;t see it.
<br>
<br>Next 2-3 hours into the game, I&apos;m raging because of super sensitive main hero&apos;s health bar.. it drops from 1 bullet to 10%... I lower difficulty level, nope, still same **** - AI is shooting with 100% precision. Oh! Epic moment, huge experimental soldier-robot appears in the middle of corridor, and...... shoots me dead with 1 bullet,replay from checkpoint&gt;replay from checkpoint&gt;replay from checkpoint&gt;replay from checkpoint.... &quot;i&apos;d better stop playing for today.. may be tomorrow&quot;.
<br>
<br>So.. you get the idea. BUT I&apos;d say it is very classic FPS from 2000-2005 times. Sadly gameplay is absolutely NOT like DOOM, which was fun, adictive, balanced.
<br>
<br>overall score: 6... sadly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7644335">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I thought the crazy bits were genuniely creative and well done, but the &quot;serious&quot; bits were very superficial, boring and drawn out. The characters, although plentiful, were one-dimensional and I didn&apos;t really care about any of them.
<br>
<br>The game itself is a lot of fun. Visually it looks great and runs very well, the controls feel good and the shooting is satisfying. Given the crazy unrealistic setting the enemies could have been a bit more diverse, particularly in terms of strategy, but they&apos;re still quite fun. The stealth mechanic is very questionable but luckily not forced.
<br>
<br>7/10 for the story (5/10 for the &quot;serious&quot; parts and 9/10 for the crazy parts)

<br>
<br>Very little doubt the story is going to not fit with everyone but there are two things you need to realize when playing:
<br>- It&apos;s an alternate reality
<br>- It&apos;s a friekin&apos; game, enjoy it for what it is and if the cut-scenes and story upset you then good news: most of them can be skipped!
<br>
<br>So don&apos;t get your panties in a bunch like a lot of others appear to have you&apos;ll get:
<br>- A wonderful game that ran smooth as silk for me. A lot of reviews seem to suggest otherwise so I might just have been lucky (hell I never even bothered updating my graphics drivers lol).
<br>- Excellent gun-play
<br>- Weapon customisation and a perk system that rewards your particular play style
<br>- Some really gorgeous looking levels
<br>- Decent challenging FPS experience that forces you to react quickly making it an adrenaline fueled delight to work your way through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7686390">Expand</a></span>

You can clearly find it in this game, and firefights are the best part of it. Shooting feels great and rewarding- its awesome. At its best this is 9/10 game material.
<br>However, and its big however, this game is crippled by many flaws.
<br>The biggest one is nonsensical plot, with crazy characters (not in a good way), which is showed to player by many, too many and too long, cutscenes and filler missions (like these one in submarine-hub, or at the farm). At these points there is no action, occasionally you need to press a button (QTE) but thats it. The flow of game is completely destroyed by these annoying, long cutscenes, and as i said, there arent even interesting to begin with. Plot is totally lame and predictable- kill some nazis, destroy some bases and start a revolution, with some nonsensical ideas like head transplant or bases on Venus. Id rather play just bunch of connected levels like in first Wolf 3D without plot whatsoever, than this nonsence.
<br>Map design also isnt that good, at many points after killing enemies i just couldnt figure out where to go next, because marker didnt show up, or it showed place behind a wall, and i just had to find a tiny vent somewhere in level. This is just annoying af and kills action momentum instantly.
<br>Add to that bunch of SJW/BLM crap and terrible anti-white racist policy (only black people are good and fight nazis, white people just surrendered and became KKK) and we have a game that should (and could) be brilliant, if only devs focused on what matters most- the gameplay, and not on politicizing their game. Also whats funny, word Germans is never used in game- only nazis. Nazis this, nazis that. Thats how history is being misrepresented and distorted.
<br>I wanted to love this game, as i really like previous Wolf games, and i really enjoyed some moments of it (intense firefights). But this awesome core is buried under the layers of boring cutscenes and trash of political correctness, and because of that i cannot rate it more than 5.
<br>I rated it 6 before, but because you deleted my legit review (damage control i guess), which 39/40 people agreed with, i repost it now and rate it 5. Censorship at its worst, you delete honest opinions of customers who bought the product, and let troll reviews &quot;10/10 best game ever&quot; to stay.

L&apos;aventure d&#xE9;marre dans un fauteuil roulant pour Blazco. Apr&#xE8;s avoir explos&#xE9; le Boucher &#x2013; et lui avec -, il doit d&#xE9;sormais se d&#xE9;placer en fauteuil roulant pour commencer, puis dans l&#x2019;armure de sa comp&#xE8;re Caroline. Frau Engel pourchasse notre homme et a bien l&#x2019;intention de lui faire mordre la poussi&#xE8;re. Pour les r&#xE9;sistants, une seule voie possible : lib&#xE9;rer l&#x2019;Am&#xE9;rique de l&#x2019;oppression nazie. On d&#xE9;marre sur les chapeaux de roue : n&#x2019;allez pas croire que le fait de se d&#xE9;placer en fauteuil roulant va emp&#xEA;cher le h&#xE9;ros d&#x2019;&#xE9;clater tout ce qui porte une croix gamm&#xE9;e sur son passage. Parlons aussi des personnages, tous tr&#xE8;s bien &#xE9;crits et avec des personnalit&#xE9;s bien marqu&#xE9;es. L&#x2019;homme que l&#x2019;on rencontre &#xE0; notre arriv&#xE9;e en Am&#xE9;rique est par exemple totalement dans son d&#xE9;lire d&#x2019;invasion extraterrestre&#x2026; alors quand on sait en plus qu&#x2019;il vit &#xE0; Roswell&#x2026; Tout le titre vous offre une pl&#xE9;thore de d&#xE9;monstrations comiques &#x2013; qui m&#x2019;ont pour le coup vraiment bien fait rire de nombreuses fois &#x2013; durant votre aventure et cela participe pleinement &#xE0; cr&#xE9;er l&#x2019;identit&#xE9; du jeu ainsi que son atmosph&#xE8;re, d&#x2019;autant que l&#x2019;univers est compl&#xE8;tement barr&#xE9;, vous aurez l&#x2019;occasion de le constater par vous-m&#xEA;me. L&#x2019;histoire en elle-m&#xEA;me est plut&#xF4;t sympathique mais c&#x2019;est surtout la narration et la d&#xE9;couverte du pass&#xE9; de Blazcowicz qui font se d&#xE9;marquer Wolfenstein 2. Il faut bien le dire, ce suppl&#xE9;ment apport&#xE9; au sc&#xE9;nario entame le rythme du jeu car vous aurez de longs passages narratifs, mais il s&#x2019;agit d&#x2019;une bonne chose car les missions en elles-m&#xEA;mes sont toujours autant survitamin&#xE9;es et les s&#xE9;quences film&#xE9;es le sont &#xE0; la mani&#xE8;re d&#x2019;un film de cin&#xE9;ma, pour un r&#xE9;sultat tr&#xE8;s prenant et &#xE0; contrepied de l&#x2019;aspect purement bourrin coutumier des Fps. Le jeu des acteurs est de plus tr&#xE8;s bon et participe ainsi &#xE0; vous immerger dans cette uchronie plus cr&#xE9;dible que jamais. Ajoutons &#xE0; cela les diff&#xE9;rentes documents que vous pouvez trouver un peu partout, dont certains ont des r&#xE9;sonances dans notre monde bien r&#xE9;el. Venons-en au c&#x153;ur du titre : le gameplay. En gros, Wolfenstein 2, c&#x2019;est Wolfenstein premier du nom en mieux. Beaucoup mieux. J&#x2019;ai beau avoir aim&#xE9; le pr&#xE9;c&#xE9;dent opus, celui-ci fait tout mieux que son grand fr&#xE8;re. En sus de la narration, mentionnons les gunfights, absolument jouissifs. Les armes offrent un superbe design et on se retrouve enfin avec un jeu qui g&#xE8;re &#xE0; merveille les effusions de sang. Tr&#xE8;s r&#xE9;alistes ici, elles sont habituellement n&#xE9;glig&#xE9;es. Cela participe &#xE0; un rendu visuel coh&#xE9;rent et, mis &#xE0; l&#x2019;&#xE9;chelle d&#x2019;un affrontement contre de gros escadrons de nazis, &#xE7;a envoie sec. Les combats s&#x2019;encha&#xEE;nent, nerveux, avec des ennemis qui, malheureusement et une fois encore, ont souffert d&#x2019;une ablation du cerveau &#x2013; on le savait parce qu&#x2019;ils sont nazis, mais c&#x2019;est aussi parce que l&#x2019;IA est &#xE0; revoir. S&#x2019;ils ont le r&#xE9;flexe de se cacher, les nuisibles ont tout de m&#xEA;me tendance &#xE0; rester largement &#xE0; d&#xE9;couvert et &#xE0; venir se faire d&#xE9;fourailler &#xE0; la cha&#xEE;ne. Ce Wolfenstein 2 d&#xE9;boule sous les meilleurs auspices. Une action relev&#xE9;e et tr&#xE8;s dynamique, des graphismes l&#xE9;ch&#xE9;s et bien plus en phase avec leur temps (ceux du premier Wolfenstein &#xE9;taient un brin d&#xE9;lav&#xE9;s pour l&#x2019;&#xE9;poque) et des effusions de sang enfin dignes de ce nom, sur fond de bande originale compos&#xE9;e avec talent. Que demande le peuple ? &#xC0; part la lib&#xE9;ration des &#xC9;tats-Unis, bien s&#xFB;r ! MachineGames a d&#xE9;cid&#xE9; pour l&#x2019;occasion d&#x2019;offrir une vraie narration au jeu et on d&#xE9;couvre avec plaisir le pass&#xE9; de Blazkowicz ainsi que sa personnalit&#xE9; et ses &#xE9;tats d&#x2019;&#xE2;me suite &#xE0; l&#x2019;&#xE9;v&#xE9;nement dramatique qui donne le d&#xE9;part de cette nouvelle aventure. Un des meilleurs jeux de 2017. #hexen #warlegend</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7687644">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s obvious that this is barely a mediocre gaming experience, and yet everyone praises it. Why?! It&apos;s the same game as the first Wolfenstein except worse from every technical aspect. Just a generic, nazi shooting game and it&apos;s poorly done. How does that happen in 2017. They&apos;ve cut corners everywhere. Graphics are exactly the same as before only now the game chokes on shaders, LODs and other inane, unnecessary crap that in turn, amps up the system requirements for NO GOOD REASON. Also, crashes, freezes, lags. Seriously? What a load. To hell with its &quot;messages&quot;, characters and whatever else you find to praise undeservedly. If it were a movie, this would make SOME sense. This is a game, and it&apos;s barely playable, so who cares about the characters, and political statements? Managed to bore me to tears in three levels. Utter nonsense.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7668784">Expand</a></span>

<br>I also love the heavy metal / rock music that plays throughout the game. The credits are great, I know it&apos;s weird I&apos;m praising credits but the music mix is great at the end.
<br>Also I had zero performance issues or sound issues as everyone mentions.

It seems the negative attention it&apos;s receiving is from

B) (and this one is even more absurd) terribly optimised.

To address both, no it is not a SJW</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I just felt I HAD to give this game a review here to offset ever so slightly all the morons.

<br>
<br>To address both, no it is not a SJW peice, it is rather condemning of a Nazi ideology though so if that makes you uncomfortable maybe have a conversation with yourself.
<br>
<br>And secondly, the game is about as well optimised and polished a release on PC this year, hell even the last few years. Both this and Destiny 2 are fantastic examples of how to leverage the power of PC and deliver a visually stunning experience, with performance that scales very well across various configurations.
<br>
<br>The gunplay is fantastic, story is engaging, visual and aural presentation is phenomenal...honestly a standout title of the year. The current 5.6 user rating it has on metacritic is sadly a reflection of the community of gamers and not at all representative of the quality of this title</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7662147">Expand</a></span>

I spent 2 hours, looking how to fix that, and all I had to do was, I just had to turn off motion blur.
<br>Game itself is meh. Stealth got ruined, if your shot is not well placed and an enemy spots you, that&apos;s it, the alarm will go up. Enemies can easily spot you and instantly alarm goes on, stealth mechanics in TNO were way better. You will not be able to complete a level 100% stealth. New guns feel weak, they sound like guns from CoD. Storytelling is kinda ok, but they push leftist agenda over proper storytelling.
<br>
<br>The leader of Kreisau circle dies, her place is taken by most unlikable character ever. Grace. MachineGames probably tried to make her look cool and badass, but I hated her, she tries to be a leader, she swears a lot, tells everyone what to do, and it made me cringe so hard. Creators of the game pushed most of that agenda through her (how America is weak and submitted to Nazi&apos;s, white people are racist, it&apos;s men&apos;s fault that Manhattan got nuked, &quot;balls of steel&quot; is a term, that Grace thinks should be more feminine and doesn&apos;t like that and the only ones that put up a fight against Nazis are mostly black people, so on and so on). From a zero-f*ck giving Nazi killing machine, Blazkowicz got turned into a little-b*tch, that constantly whines about everything. Internet is full of political correctness and such, I expected to play a game where I can brutally murder Nazi&apos;s but instead I got a game, where political correctness, anti-white propaganda is showed down your throat. Soundtracks aren&apos;t heavy metal anymore, which pumped me up in TNO, instead it&apos;s some loud music, even doing stealth plays. When you f*ck up during stealth in TNO, heavy metal starts playing. But here, the same type of music is playing throughout the level. Heavy enemies, for example supersoldaten are less threatening, and its enough to shoot half a clip of submachine gun into his head to kill him.
<br>
<br>During the section where you find out who is sending signals, Supersoldaten that are in Section F are the new type of Supersoldaten, not the old ones. Same goes for the new type of cyber-dogs, that you kill in a sealed off section of the U-Boat, when you try to close a gas leak. You can see how low of an effort was put in.
<br>
<br>During the most dangerous missions (for example the New Orleans one), Anya tags along with Fergus (or Wyatt) to help him. Now, what the actual f*ck. The U-boat is FULL OF REBELS, but instead they send Anya, who is pregnant WITH TWINS to fight the war! What about Bombate or many other &quot;fighters&quot;?
<br>
<br>Overall, the game is a flop. Storywise it&apos;s a huge flop, because it has many plotholes in it, gameplay wise it&apos;s a flop too, because the stealth is ruined, guns are weak, enemies are not threatening. MachineGames f*cked up for good, and this shows, that you shouldn&apos;t get hyped up for a game. I got stuck at levels, because I didn&apos;t know where to go, because there were no proper objective markers. And the most annoying were U-boat intersections, because U-boat is a labyrinth, and you have to navigate your way through it, doing side quests and whatnot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7670459">Expand</a></span>

<br>But all of this, unfortunately,  ruin by:

<br>For me big problem in some characters.
<br>I don&apos;t know how people can love characters in this game. Look at this.
<br>-pregnant woman who can killed trained nazis. Yes she can shoot, run, jump and drunk with her big stomach. And nazis who spent much time in war and seized all World can&apos;t kill her.
<br>-womanizer black guy who use women like comfort object.Yes for him women are only body nothing else.
<br>-fat girl who don&apos;t afraid die by Diabetes Mellitus, and she mad pervert. (au&#x107;)
<br>-crazy man who afraid aliens and ready to shoot in his allies.
<br>-junkie or man who can be kill by his crazy prosthesis hand. Yes they are good fighters too. 9000 killed nazis  by facepalm confirm it.
<br>- and my &quot;favorite character&quot; communist &quot;yea&quot;. I was stupid that i thought that communists as nazis.  Thousands of killed Poles, Hungarians, Russians, Americans  and another nations who &quot;weren&apos;t killed&quot; by communists confirm it. Creators in MachineGames says to us &quot;communists are good guys never mind&quot;.
<br>In conclusion i want to say it&apos;s very bad that creators use us like stupid sheep who can eat everything. And looks so terrible when people who protect this game, instead of arguments call opponents nazis because they don&apos;t like this garbage.
<br>If you want to play in good Wolfenstain games try to play in Return to Castle Wolfenstein, or Wolfenstein: The New Order. About this game, avoid this thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7695094">Expand</a></span>

This game has great graphics, funny characters and dynamic gameplay, but if you have a **** pc then you&apos;ll be frustrated like all these haters.</span>

<br>As for the game itself, well obviously everyone sees in it what they want. I really don&apos;t see any threat to white people, or the western civilization or negative/positive discrimination for that matter. There are 2 (two) main characters which are black and 7 (seven) or more main characters which are white. So like wtf people? It goes very well in the settings of occupied U.S. of A. as, surprise surprise, there were (and are) a lot of black people in the country. Deal with it you racist pricks.
<br>Story is not too complicated but well executed. The cruelty of Frau Engel and her band of morons gave me shiver up my spine. The readable documents nicely contributed to the complexity of the world and pictured the nazi hate to untermenschen and their total lack of care for the lives of non-nazis, which were treated as livestock.
<br>Gameplay is nicely fast paced and fluent as in the previous games.
<br>I would give it a 10, but it seems that they focused primarily on the story and forgot to implement boss battles or any remarkable enemies.
<br>All in all a very good game which could be better if there were bosses or any other notable (and killable) enemy characters other than Frau Engel which you also see like 3 times total.
<br>
<br>Also Hitler gave it a zero. That means it cannot be bad ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7689222">Expand</a></span>

<br>Even with the nVidia 388.13 driver and having recommended specs, the game has been able to bsod my pc twice during first half of my playthrough and I couldn&apos;t even play the rest of the game. After some point all my save files were corrupted and caused bsod on start. Only game able to bsod my 4 year old pc and it has done it about 6 times. Weird texture bugs, some clipping problems are icing on the cake.
<br>While story and the characters being arguably good and voice acting perfect; in the first half of the game there is a cutscene or level transition for every 10 nazis you kill and it gets very annoying getting murderblocked like that. After every mission you go to hub and get some exposition, which promotes storytelling but diminishes gameplay. If you are expecting constant nazi killing and action, too bad. The storytelling parts are trying to give too many political messages, you&apos;d think the game is made as progressive leftist propoganda material. It would be good if it had diversity and anti racism undertones but in here they tried to fit every issue ever brought up by leftists to this day. The mild wackiness of the previous titles has gone up to eleven and prevents you to take this game a bit more seriously. Hovewer intentionally or not, some moments are going to make you laugh out loud. There are no boss fights, the only thing closest to a boss is the big mechs similar to the previous titles. The ending makes the game feel like it&apos;s cut short, like MGSV.
<br>Gameplay is very similar to the previous titles with some new types of enemies like combat robots. For some reason footsoldiers have more health but armored enemies are weaker. You can upgrade your weapons and later in the game you can get some interesting character upgrades. Gameplay is bloody and fluid, enemies play agressively and will give you a fight but it doesn&apos;t mean they are smart.
<br>Game looks good and yields high performance even on older rigs. The only issue I had with graphics aside from bugs is the contrast, everything is either too bright or too dark. Good for setting a style, but hurts the gameplay.
<br>Overall, it can be bought a year or two later with DLCs as an actually finished and playable game, I recommend you to avoid it like plague in its current state and price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7676225">Expand</a></span>

<br>The id tech engine is fantastic though it using Vulkan is a kick-in-the-face to us PC gamers Machine Games should of used Directx11 I have no problems reaching stable 60fps and none of the black screen and graphical bugs I experience with Vulkan I am also using Nvidias latest 388.13
<br>
<br>I never buying games on id tech or using OGL/Vulkan ever again I have had these problems with other games using OGL
<br>
<br>Sorry Bethesda, either get id n&apos; Machine Games to add Dx11 for their games from now on or I never buy Dx11 gives me much, much better performance and no graphic bugs.
<br>
<br>Serious hope for Dx11 patch in few months.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7666817">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s not to say there aren&apos;t some great levels here, but not as many as the original. Also the story as crazy as it has always been is absurd in places. To the point where it becomes laughable. I enjoyed my time here but it could have been better. You should play this game but not at full price
<br>
<br>Overall Wolfenstein 2 is an oK game, but it falls short of the original greatness of the New Order. There are however some great moments of fun to be had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7678877">Expand</a></span>

This game, however, just isn&apos;t on par with those titles.
<br>
<br>Perhaps then, that&apos;s this game&apos;s purpose. Where the first reboot was very much right place, right time to remind us what made story driven linear FPS&apos;s great and why they dominated the gaming scene for so long, then Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus exists to remind us why they fell out of favor so dramatically.  Save your money, this one isn&apos;t worth the time.
<br>
<br>Note: I have no problems with the political controversy surrounding this game. Shooting Nazis is fun and if you find yourself upset with the idea of a brutal Fascist regime being taken apart brick by brick, it says more about you than the media. I will say, however, I believe the developer embraced the controversy as a way to hype a game they knew was deeply mediocre. This game earned it&apos;s rating on a wonky story, crummy gunplay, and it&apos;s penchant to spawn enemies behind you and in blind spots.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7671474">Expand</a></span>

<br>Bethesda and their quality control and letting whoever is incharge of id&apos;s engines to have opengl/vulkan should be fired.
<br>
<br>Only a few pros I can say about Wolfenstein TNC:
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>
<br>- No micro-transactions
<br>- No multi-player
<br>-All single-player

I was screaming at my monitor by the end of the game, how dare they put those moments in grainy, 30FPS, 720p cutscenes. even a quick time event would have been preferable.
<br>The gameplay is a little rough. They took TNO&apos;s gameplay, and applied sandpaper. Stealth is pointless now, you aren&apos;t going to be able to successfully stealth it, yet the game features so heavily on commanders and stealth kills.
<br>The story is OK. not quite as grasping as the previous games, and quite wishy washy and muddied.
<br>Back to cutscenes. so many cutscenes. anything important that happens is in a cutscene, and this is a shame. there are many beautiful interactive moments back at the home base, and it is a shame this wasn&apos;t expanded to the rest of the game. Of course certain scenes have to be cutscenes, but there were far to many.
<br>Lets also not forget the &quot;it as only a dream&quot; level. And how there are many obvious open ended plot points (and a few plotholes that only a second playhtouigh may clear up)
<br>As for the bugs, the game ran very smooth for me on a mid-high PC, but a few issues with mouse pointer popping up, broken level waypoints and the odd texture / mesh glitch. two hard crashes (during cutscenes, now you see why i&apos;m not keen on them!)
<br>Either way, 15 hours of entertainment, may consider trying to 100% it, don&apos;t feel empty, but don&apos;t feel full (and i&apos;m someone who very much focuses on 100% games)
<br>Its not the bombastic power fest that TNO was, but a steadier gentler trudge through the Wolfenstein world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7659189">Expand</a></span>

Sure, you can usually spot health bonuses and ammo, but when the sh*t hits the fan, good luck spotting this easy-to-miss items. So in firefights, you&apos;re just running around hitting E all the time.
<br>
<br>Sometimes you get stuck on the edges of obstacles that look like you should be able to get around, there&apos;s the stupid &quot;hold a button to pick up an item&quot; trope that makes you die when you&apos;re trying to unmount a heavy weapon. The controls and gameplay feel slow and sluggish, a horrible fit for this kind of game. There&apos;s terrible input latency, which would be fine for a JRPG, but for Wolfenstein or any really fast-paced shooter, this really hurts the quality of the gameplay severely.
<br>
<br>The graphics are just okay. They&apos;re not bad, but in 2017 in a major-budget action game, I expect a lot  more. There&apos;s barely even any dynamic lighting. With games like Quantum Break showcasing passable global illumination a couple years ago, there&apos;s no excuse why Wolfenstein II shouldn&apos;t also be using some sort of GI technique, except that they went with the ID Tech 6 engine when better choices exist. While the graphics in this game won&apos;t make your eyeballs bleed, don&apos;t expect to have your socks knocked off.
<br>
<br>The often slow-paced and frankly boring-as-hell cutscenes really break up the gameplay momentum. Fortunately, you can skip these, and you might as well, since the story is unoriginal, uncreative, and just plain boring. At least the voice acting is good, but with such a boring story, it all goes to waste.
<br>
<br>This game is yet another overhyped pile of crap. If this is what people think is a good game, then I fear for the future of the video game industry in general. I hope you like free-to-play Android games, because if Wolfenstein II is any indication of what&apos;s considered cutting-edge triple-A material, then it won&apos;t be long until people get sick of AAA titles, stop buying them, and nobody makes them anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7695420">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But the real reason what I give it only 3 out of 10 is SJW propaganda. I mean if I&apos;m paying for the game leave the propaganda out of it. It&apos;s sad and insulting to expect for people to pay for it.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s an action game not a propaganda campaign.
<br>The selection of guns is limited.

I had very little info about the sequel to 2014 reboot of Wolfenstein franchise.  I played the original and enjoyed it for what it was, a single-player story driven FPS, but it did not leave any lasting impressions.
<br>The New Colossus did not start well, error message right at the start left me with no choice other than to search internet for solution--and I was found relatively quickly, I had to instal latest Nvidia drivers.
<br>
<br>Once I installed latest drivers from Nvidia, the game started and played flawlessly on high settings in 1080p on my i7-4790k with GTX1070--rock solid 60fps, no noticeable slowdowns, no broken geometry or texture popping. Only other problem I have encountered from start to finish of the game were 2 game freezes during loading. I have not fiddled with video settings at all, the game run smoothly and looked amazing at default high settings.
<br>
<br>The game offers continuation of alternative history of WW2. The story was decent with several great characters that were flashed out as much as possible in a FPS game. The story absolutely parodies current political situation and does not shy away from controversial topics such as racism, sexism and spreading of neo-nazi propaganda. It is all in good fun and cartooney approach but there are some graphical moments not for feint of heart.
<br>
<br>I liked the gameplay because it is simplistic in its focus--provide well crafted experience focused on killing enemies, pure and unadulterated mayhem, with optional stealth that worked good enough. Weapon selection is limited to standard set of armaments including pistol, sub-machine gun, assault rifle, electricity-based gun and grenade/rocket launcher. There is also few heavy weapons that can be picked up from static gun posts or from fallen enemies. They have limited ammunition and must be carried in both hands slowing you down and forcing you to drop them on the ground if you want to use some of your standard guns. Gunplay is fine, each weapon feels differently.
<br>
<br>Length of the game is decent, I have finished the story at around 25 hours on Do or Die difficulty setting. Some parts of the game were rather difficult but nothing impossible. Enemy AI is very mobile and once alerted to your presence they can often surprise you  by flanking you or coming from behind you. I always found it better to soften enemy forces by applying stealth early in the game levels--this is certainly recommended approach on higher difficulty settings when captains are present on the battlefield.
<br>I still have several ubercommanders to kill via helm navigation map, which is some kind of meta game on top of story missions. These kill missions are happening in locales you visit during story missions with slight modifications to what enemies are present, their placement and new collectibles.
<br>
<br>Character perk and weapon upgrade systems are good and fit the tune of the game. Character perks are gained naturally by performing specific actions, e.g. killing enemies while dual-wielding or performing stealth takedowns. These perks improve certain aspects of your character--mostly quality of life improvements but some of these perks are very powerful.
<br>Weapon upgrade system is simple enough but efficient. Upgrades provide improvements to a gun or even add new functionality to it. Upgrades can be toggled on and off so you do not have to worry whether you will like it or not. Weapon upgrade kits are relatively rare but you get enough of them to upgrade your favourite weapon or two. Side mission provide access to additional weapon upgrade kits.
<br>
<br>All in all, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus was very positive surprise for me. High quality production value with slightly funky story that does not take itself too seriously. Once I overcome initial problem with incompatible GPU drivers, the game run smoothly without any major issues. Visuals and sound are great, music fits the theme and some tunes were outstanding. Gameplay is fast-pace with clear focus on combat with light elements of stealth that never felt cumbersome. Enemy AI is serviceable but it will not amaze you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7667101">Expand</a></span>

<br>Killing Nazis is even more fun when the story provides context through character growth, conflict and excellent voice acting.
<br>
<br>There are some corny bits and the story does go in some controversial directions just by virtue of it&apos;s subject matter combined with the current social/political atmosphere.  Which is an alarming situation that has nothing to do with this game but a sad sign of the times :(   Where were all these snowflakes when Mafia 3 came out?
<br>
<br>The graphics don&apos;t seem to match the toll they take on performance but I really dig the style which serves the setting very well and creates a nearly perfect realization of location, tone and feel.  Nothing feels out of place except the resistance, Perfect!
<br>
<br>It took about 20 minutes to disable the Vulcan bits that don&apos;t jive well on NVIDIA cards.  Finding the fix was only one search and 2 clicks away.
<br>
<br>Much like Doom and The New Order, the devs don&apos;t overthink the gameplay.  Kill bad guys, move the story, rinse repeat.  While every other AAA game today lives or dies by it&apos;s open world combined with coop MP and pointless loot boxes containing fashionable armor designed to shoehorn an RPG in to pad gameplay, Wolfenstein 2 keeps it simple while achieving mechanical mediocrity on a grand scale and I love it!
<br>
<br>I give it a solid 8:
<br>+ Gameplay is exciting
<br>+ The setting is perfectly realized and eerily topical (weird times we live in, not games fault)
<br>+ The story keeps the action honest throughout.  The stakes always feel high.
<br>- Performance.  There are easy fixes for NVIDIA users.  I hate to subtract for this.  PC gaming can be complicated but great power requires great responsibility, which equals amazing results. But I wish it had an NVIDIA button that disables the Vulcan bits that don&apos;t jive well on Maxwell/Pascal.  I&apos;m sure this will be patched but this is the current state.

Right amount of weapons and gameplay that gives a rush of adrenaline and a sense of acheivement. Story is very good, i seldom play fps for story but this game made me really care and some moments really kept me on my toes. I love this game and whole heartedly recommend it.</span>

<br>Wide range of characters.
<br>
<br>Cons (Why I did not give it a 10)
<br>Technical issues.
<br>I haven&apos;t had any crashing, however I have had a lot of artifact issues and just general graphics hooey. Windowed mode has **** for resolution choices and editing the config file for a custom one screws up the text. Just play in Fullscreen and that&apos;s mostly fixed for me.
<br>
<br>Other people are having more serious issues and I cannot blame someone for rating the game low if they can&apos;t play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7671119">Expand</a></span>

I finished the game in 8-9 hrs which is a little bit short for me and nothing really new compared to the previous installments. but that&apos;s okay because it is still a Wolfenstein game and it should be.
<br>Good job Bethesda, maybe make the next game at least 10-12 hrs long.</span>

I am far from finished but even at this stage I can say without doubt that for me personally this may be the best PC video game I have ever played, at least so far. This was unexpected. &apos;Wolfenstein&apos; is an old franchise. One with a wonderful pedigree for sure but by now I thought that perhaps I had tired of shooting nazis and storming wildly imaginative military industrial complexes. I was wrong.
<br>
<br>The first thing that surprised me is both the depth of the story line and the emotional nuance of the characters. Our hero B.J. Blazkowicz is introduced us through a series of memories from a childhood that is unpleasant to put it mildly. I really like the back story and how we learn it as a frame to his current attitude. But the story line from there only gets deeper and more involved. I haven&apos;t cared this much about a character or story line since Vampire Masquerade all the way back in 2004.
<br>
<br>This serves to makes some of the plot changes and &apos;Game of Thrones&apos; like deaths that much of a shock when they occur. For shocks there are. Be prepared for decapitations and violence on an epic scale. But these are built into the story and game play brilliantly. For this is a thoroughly enjoyable game to play as well as experience. The stealth/melee attacks as as good or better for example as those in &apos;Far Cry&apos; whilst upgrade able weapons and ranged attacks offer variable options in how to progress levels.
<br>
<br>I also really like the way that sometimes when it seems impossible to make progress, for example after many failed attempts to jump to a rescue, I had to finally realize that I really wasn&apos;t meant to escape that way. Pausing, rethinking years of standard game play, I found alternatives ways to move forward. This is refreshing and Machine Games deserve kudos for taking a fresh approach.
<br>
<br>There is also much humour in the game. I laughed out loud to find one nazi officer in his room with a VR headset on oblivious to the carnage going on around him. Another time you get to over hear an enemy celebrate finding a working toilet. These lighter moments are terrific and add enormously to the games enjoyment. I would not describe the scene with Hitler the same way but it was still amazing. This was the first FPS game where I had to grab a pen and paper to write down and memorize an actors lines. That too made me smile.
<br>
<br>If I could ask for more it would have been for more outside, open levels. At one point we come across a parade of nazi soldiers. It would have been enormous fun to wreck havoc with that. All in all this is a wonderful game and for those like myself that may feel the best days of the FPS are over I am pleased to say that this is not so. This game is really terrific.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7691195">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To those giving a ZERO because they can&apos;t run the game: that&apos;s like saying you don&apos;t like a restaurant that you&apos;ve never eaten at. Come on. I mean, I get it; it&apos;s annoying that it clearly needs a patch for some users, but don&apos;t rate the game a ZERO and pretend like you&apos;ve played it. Don&apos;t give it a rating until you&apos;ve actually played it. Wait for a patch, then write a bad review if you don&apos;t like it.
<br>
<br>If you like FPS games, you HAVE to pick this one up. It&apos;s the most fun I&apos;ve had with a shooter since....well.....

<br>- Great Story - there are few instances when you&apos;ll feel like that the game is about to be completed, and then Boom!!, it sill be something out of the unexpected. The plot is great and they have improved a lot.
<br>
<br>- Great Graphics - the new engine is great
<br>
<br>- Amazing Gameplay - Also, similar to Doom, there are sort of Glory kills, which works great. In fact, they have improvised it, when you opt for Glory Kill from front, the NPCs will try to attack you automatically, for instance when you click glory kill, the NPCs will try to kick you and you&apos;ll grab his leg and will chop it off, and so on...
<br>
<br>- Even the cutscenes are great.
<br>
<br>- Great acting and dialogues - for instance main villain, supported NPCs (check-out the strawberry milkshake scene), BJ Blazkowitch monologues, and so on...
<br>
<br>- Good music
<br>
<br>- Enough of aww moment, such as riding the dog, beheading, some great fight sequence, etc.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>- there are a few fps dips
<br>- game freezes a few times
<br>- only single player, yet this is what this game was meant to be.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve almost completed the game, so far it is all great. Didn&apos;t regret playing any of it.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, what i found here that AC Origins got a lot of 10/10 user ratings, this let me doubt that whether AC Origins is paying people / bots to rate their product better and Wolfenstein with the low grade. For instance, most user review for Wolf.. they criticize about the storyline / politics and stuff. On the other hand for AC origins, the reviews that i&apos;ve read such as the game works great on FX 8350 with GTX 1050ti on auto detect graphics settings, buying it from uplay instead of steam, makes the game run more smoother, uplay offers rewards so no need to pay for perks, and so on...
<br>
<br>I would strongly recommend people to go for this game, don&apos;t go with the user ratings that you see here, play for yourself and judge. I would give it 9 coz of a few graphical issues that i&apos;ve faced.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7662713">Expand</a></span>

<br>Amazing level of detail and atmosphere, graphic engine is wicked good and fast, only thing letting it down would be texture quality with crysis from 2007 having better looking textures. Performance is amazing 60 fps on 980TI aslong as i dont touch the image streaming to uber cause dont have enough vram rest is maxed out. Guns are great once upgraded, playing it on do or die and i do die but it&apos;s easy enough that i dont get stuck for long in any parts more then 5 min while i figure out best course of actions to dispatch some **** nazis back to germany. The cutscenes and characters are amazing and i **** love it. Story is great if you played the original reboot of wolfestein so you feel attached to the character and what he is going trough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7650520">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have a few issues, especially when comparing to WF 1.
<br>
<br>1.  First of all, too many damn cutscenes! I swear the game is 50% nazi killing and 50% cutscene watching. I normally love cutscenes in games but WF2 really went overboard with them.
<br>2. The maps are small, too small. Nothing compared with the huge maps of WF1. When you finish a level you will go &quot;Wait, that was it?&quot;.
<br>3. No epic fights by now. Nothing like the London Monitor from WF 1.
<br>4. Story has a couple of cringy moments, and I&apos;m not talking about the free use of gore during cutscenes, I&apos;m talking about moments where you would go &quot;no way that could happen!&quot;. Not gonna spoil anything. Or &quot;Come on, white ass nazis&quot; said by an actual white guy, go figure.
<br>5. Lip syncing...non existing. Not only the characters barely move their lips during dialogues (and are certainly not in sync) but I was in this town and a woman was talking to a nazi officer and their lips didn&apos;t move at all despite the obvious voice acted dialogue.
<br>6. Obvious plot holes here and there.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sorry to say this but this game is clearly a step backwards from WF 1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7648934">Expand</a></span>

<br>I normally wouldn&apos;t bother writing a review but I&apos;m writing one for this game to counter what I feel is undue praise heaped on a sub-mediocre game.  There is absolutely nothing remarkable about this game, well at least nothing remarkably good(plenty of remarkably bad elements)  First the minor but numerous problems: the graphics are sub-mediocre(would have been nice 8 years ago I suppose), the gun design is uninspired, the character design is generic, and the story is just sloppy.  Taken together these minor flaws are enough to ruin any otherwise potentially good game however they are not the main problem with this FPS.  The main problem I have with this game is that  the controls are terrible. Swimming is ridiculously stupid, you feel like you&apos;re swimming through some extremely odd viscous fluid and you can only hold your breath for about 20s before you start taking damage.  Beyond that traversing the world is made artificially difficult.  You will often find yourself in position where any normal human being would jump a half a foot up, grab a railing and climb over it.  In this game however such feats of common dexterity are made impossible resulting in janky puzzles you have to solve when you really just want to vault the f&apos;ing railing. I find this type of gameplay/level design inexcusably amateur.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7700019">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m kind of in awe that some people are giving this game 0/10 or 1/10 for reasons like too short or no multiplayer, Well first of all for a single player game the story is damn long and has plenty of replay value, with exceptional game play, voice acting and narrative that keeps the story engaging, it&apos;s just the same as watching a well made film that gives you enjoyment multiple times over you have a game gives you that exact same feeling although you have many more hours and get to be a part of the action. Now to people that say no multiplayer......... just **** off.......yep simply put **** off, you knew this game was not going to have multiplayer so using that as a detractor is like buying a car knowing it&apos;s a three door and then complaining to the manufacturer that it doesn&apos;t have five,which quite simply makes you sounds a remtard short of trying to bite your own ear off while trying to use your fingers to touch your wrists.
<br>
<br>My hat goes off to the developers who have poured time, effort and love in to this game and have created something that hasn&apos;t been seen in modern gaming for the last 20 years,and with the recent craze of loot boxes, DLC and season passes suffocating games in a cloud of greed it&apos;s a welcome change for a developer to show how things should be done, so please support games like these and hopefully EA, Ubisoft and other &quot;AAA&quot; developers will take note and stop producing games for the sole purpose of testing how tight they can squeeze their consumers ****
<br>
<br>10/10 guys, great job and can&apos;t recommend this game enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7651627">Expand</a></span>

<br>Disturbingly Good
<br>The New Colossus is the direct sequel to the new order&#x2026; Spoilers for the first game you don&#x2019;t die at the end&#x2026; once again you play as William Blazkowicz, and while you don&#x2019;t die in the first game... you are left wheelchair bound&#x2026; which makes for a really unique opening to game...
<br>and one of the most brutal openings to a video game I&#x2019;ve ever experienced..
<br>You don&#x2019;t stay this way forever thanks to a body suit you&#x2019;re able to walk again&#x2026;
<br>This time the game takes place in America...
<br>Once again in an alternate history where the Nazis won the war&#x2026;
<br>seeing how this win affected America is thought provoking, and full of emotion&#x2026;
<br>Easily one of the most impactful campaigns I&#x2019;ve ever played through in a shooter&#x2026;
<br>Here you&#x2019;re starting to spark a revolution and take back America, killing some Nazi scum&#x2026;
<br>Wolfenstein 2 is a much more compact game compared to the original, this time only taking around 6 and a half hours to complete&#x2026;
<br>But it&#x2019;s an enjoyable 6 and a half hours...
<br>much more linear as well with the same concepts of taking out scouts so they don&#x2019;t trigger alarms, and stealthing through areas or going in guns blazing&#x2026;
<br>The weapon variety isn&#x2019;t as vast, but you have your typical base weapons you&#x2019;d expect in most shooters... but to bring some variety in, your guns are all upgradable, allowing you to add a perk to give them an entirely different feel&#x2026;.
<br>The level design isn&#x2019;t that great this time around&#x2026;
<br>it feels pretty dull and generic&#x2026;
<br>The greatness comes in the setting and the story telling&#x2026;
<br>when the game puts you into perspective of the world around you..
<br>Without the great story pieces, this is still a good shooter&#x2026; but just good...
<br>There are no epic fights or showdowns&#x2026;
<br>Just a bunch of running from point a to b and shooting everything in your way&#x2026;
<br>it plays and feels how you&#x2019;d expect, but no moments outside of cut scenes blew me away
<br>I love how the story was delivered though, in ways you wouldn&#x2019;t expect and are surprising each time&#x2026;
<br>This game will break your heart, it will give you hope, it will take it away&#x2026;
<br>for those reasons alone, you owe it to yourself to play through this first person shooter&#x2026;
<br>I give Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus
<br>an 8.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7665092">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is fun, storyline is good, very good optimization as well, I don&apos;t have a beast pc and I could play this game in 1080 on medium with 60+ fps, no fps drops, no freezes. People who voted negative are honestly retarded, talking about racism and **** guys its a **** game stop getting offended.</span>

I was so hyped for this game, and it really delivered. The ratings, honestly should be way higher than Assassins Creed Origins, because I can tell Bethesda worked very hard on this, especially the story telling of the game and flashbacks were very good but also very sad. This game had me crying and heartbroken on some parts but having lots of fun on others and laughing a lot because of the jokes and cutscenes. They really did well with the mix of funny and serious. Honestly Bethesda seems to never let me down, bugs usually come with all games so I&apos;m just used to it, so I don&apos;t count it as a way to lower my review, but I would definitely give this a 10. It&apos;s such a good game, and I really enjoyed it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7655554">Expand</a></span>

<br>As for the political stuff--I enjoy killing Nazis, with a group of white, black, Jewish, etc. freedom fighters. From my point of view, there&apos;s no moral ambiguity--Nazis are bad, go kill them. Seriously, for the people who hate this game because they think it&apos;s SJW, or marxist...if Nazis invaded the US in real life, are you seriously saying you&apos;d join them???

Wolfenstein II is not bad because it has a &quot;far left message&quot; (anything but, the communists ingame have a historical basis in the radical American labour movement and Black Panther Party, the latter which peaked in the sixties and seventies and was highly armed and militant, the portrayal of them has a clear basis in caricatures of real figures of the movements. I doubt one has much historical knowledge if they believe that portrayal counts as leftist propaganda), it is bad due to its awful, awful performance. Lip syncing constantly breaks even on the lowest settings, textures randomly seem to pop in and out of existence, and you get lag pouring out of all orifices. I think you get the picture.
<br>
<br>Beyond that, the story suffers massive tonal whiplash. Whereas the prior games had humourous moments mixed in with serious ones, the two were largely separated and made sense in the context of the game and world. The humour did not feel as though it was in there for the sake of being funny, but rather as part of an organic and realistic situation. Here, the opposite is true. There are two examples which immediately stick into my mind. Anya and BJ discuss the future of their child and their life under the world as it is, and suddenly a man walks into the scene boasting about a great dump he took. Additionally, there is a scene with a certain drug-addicted Nazi high commander which could be used to show the degradation of his mind and already existent paranoia through his drug use, and seems to be going down that path for the first few minutes, but then, nope. He starts urinating and vomiting everywhere because &quot;haha funny&quot;. The constant switch between humour and the darker tones of the story make it hard to keep up with or enjoy. That being said, there are still some genuinely funny and well written parts of the game, they are just few and far between.
<br>
<br>Beyond that, the game suffers heavily from the worst aspects of modern first person shooters. The action is constantly interrupted by cutscenes and moments where control is taken from you so you can be railroaded into story elements. This could be acceptable, though annoying, if they were on average just a little bit shorter, but every time this happens, it seems to take up between ten to fifteen minutes. I&apos;d argue that the game has a 40/60 ratio of gameplay to cutscenes.
<br>
<br>The gameplay aspects are quite good. The shooting is satisfying, but the weapons and their sounds feel mildly anemic. Some points of the game have very bad enemy placement, where hitscanning enemies spawn in behind you and you have no chance to defend yourself. This problem is particularly pronounced in a certain level. I won&apos;t say which, as it contains heavy spoilers, but you&apos;ll know when you see it. If you are playing on a hard difficulty, it is quite possible to be one shot killed within the first second of the level, without a chance to defend yourself or react to your surroundings until the shots miss from luck and you can dive for cover.
<br>
<br>Overall, if this game had only combat, it would be a solid 8. If the story was more in the vein of the prior two, maybe a nine. However, considering this is what we got, I can only really see fit to give it a six. It&apos;s not bad, but it&apos;s not great. It has many aspects which are unnacceptable for a AAA game and should have been ironed out with the multi million dollar testing budget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7672867">Expand</a></span>

It is just ordinary linear shooter. Yes the shooter old school and to shoot in it it gives pleasure. Yes interesting alternative story (but only the concept). But all spoil typical stereotypes about people and the biggest that I hate - tolerance. If you white - you are a Nazi (Russians and Poles will precisely estimate) if black - you battle for independence of the USA. I also didn&apos;t hear bigger nonsense. And why the black aunt fills with everything? Who is she in general such? The ending in general crosses out everything as it is possible to make the plot culmination murder of some cranky Nazi, it is simpler only in games of the Assassin&apos;s Creed series.
<br>PS. To kick the lying Hitler it is invaluable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7688945">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>but the biggest problem is cut-scenes. way too many that can&apos;t be skipped through.

<br>another problem is politics. the inclusion of bj&apos;s father. the stereotypical boogie man of the click bait press: straight white male, wife beater, anti-semite, racist anti black, complaining about the plight of the straight white male.
<br>
<br>and last 2 of the most bizarre scenes i&apos;ve ever seen in a game. 1st is the pissing/vomiting hitler. 2nd is anya pregnant and topless in the trenches with bj near the finale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7741298">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m so disappointed by this game. Instead of fast paced shooter that we like they gave us cinematic cut scenes galore with shooting elements. So cut scenes are few minutes long and you can not skip it. You can not do it in Wolfenstein ! Also story feels reused, guns are almost the same like in New Order and The Old Blood (both brilliant, brilliant games), story campaign is short (8-10 hours) compared to 16-20 hours in NO and TOB, there are some technical issues with resolution and frame rate drops. Also graphics are just OK. game looks like from 2012. Just compare it to DOOM or even GTA5 and you will see its ugliness. Graphics aren&apos;t everything in video games but why then we invest dollars and dollars into new hardware ? We do this so games can look and run better. Its not bad but also not very good console port -

The only thing that really bugs me, is the platinum trophy, which is simply impossible. Why? You have to finish the game in one attempt on (8-12 hours) &quot;Mein Leben&quot;, which means the difficulty is extremely hard, no checkpoints, savepoints but permadeath. A bit exaggerated and a turn-off for trophy hunters.</span>
