This was still pretty fun though, it&apos;s just a shame that the characters didn&apos;t do what they were supposed to. Some of the pathfinding was dreadful, one character in particular spent ages turning around in circles instead of heading to the room they kept saying they were off to. There&apos;s also an encounter later on which is very buggy - your attacks pass straight through your enemies, they get stuck, teleport to right behind you and instantly end the game, you get stuck on furniture, sometimes everyone gets stuck and you have to quit and restart. This encounter is a lot easier when the game switches to first person view, unfortunately this seems to be a bug as there&apos;s no option for it anywhere and it happens sporadically at best. And maybe I&apos;m being picky, but if I&apos;m an evil kid I want to at least be able to hit someone when they&apos;re down...
<br>Also the spelling is pretty poor in places.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lucius/user-reviews?user_review_id=2716726">Expand</a></span>

Game is also nice, although it has several technical challenges, but definitely passable. but without a quicksave is really ridiculous.

There &apos;Omen&apos; atmosphere is created perfectly, but there is very little choice (none, to be precise) making this game linear and just an interactive movie. There game is divided by chapters - in each chapter you kill somebody. You have super powers like telekinesis or mind control which will be upgraded (it&apos;s done automatically and I don&apos;t see much point in doing that to be honest). Thankfully you can skip cutscenes as you WILL fail a few times, at least once.
<br>The mansion is huge and beautiful and you can open, pick up all sorts of objects but again, there is no point in doing it. The game provides very little or too much guidance. Sometimes you just don&apos;t know what to do next, another time you feel like playing through FC3 Blood Dragon&apos;s tutorial.
<br>All in all, it is a decent game that could&apos;ve been a hit. If only there was more than one way to kill people and if there was real stealth (yes, unfortunately hiding from your mum in the darkest corner in a huge room, behind a sofa, with lights off, at night, doesn&apos;t protect you from being spotted... this is btw the moment when you WILL fail at least once, you&apos;ll know when it comes).
<br>Hugely disappointing game that somewhat redeems itself after a completed playthrough (it&apos;s a nice story and beautifully looking game).
<br>Voice acting and animations are terrible too. But the game still manages to make up for it in a strange manner. You even have a little tricycle, just like in The Shining. Well done.
<br>It is a game for adults - gore, violence, sex and nudity (and I mean it).
<br>Lucius&apos;s potential has not been used. It&apos;s just another title you will forget after a while. Play time - 5 hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lucius/user-reviews?user_review_id=4192269">Expand</a></span>

You play as Lucius a child who discovers he&apos;s the son of the devil on his 6th birthday. From this point on you just wreak havoc on your household until there&apos;s nothing left. No seriously, whomever you think you might want to kill around you... you probably will.
<br>
<br>Graphically it&apos;s fine but I&apos;m not someone who needs HD to feel happy with a game. If they get the ambiance and feeling of the game right, I&apos;m good. I feel like Lucius did a good job there. It was easy to play and I also appreciated that when I had things like a toy or a bike in a room where I committed a murder, it was also in the cutscene. I appreciated the continuity. There were some unexpected twists I enjoyed but I do feel the end was a bit rushed and it left me feeling like there was supposed to be more but it got scrapped to meet a deadline.  I also took off points because of the abrupt ending that left me feeling dissatisfied with 100 questions. (what happens to Lucius? Where is the devil in all this? What the hell was the point of murdering all these people? Do I go on to do more devilish things? Can I take over the world? I&apos;m only 6, will I go on to ruin another family?)
<br>
<br>Bottom line, I had fun! The price was a little steep but if you can get a little discount on a Steam Deal it&apos;s worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lucius/user-reviews?user_review_id=2730529">Expand</a></span>

Not really any tactical approach like hitman though and not much to take from it.

This effort merits a higher score, therefore, it&apos;s a B-Movie with a grade of B-. It&apos;s has the whole creepy evil kid thing down very well. The graphics and video shorts I think are well done, the sounds adequate and the house has a creepy vibe to it. Although the lip sync issue is pretty bad in the English version. It reminds me of an interactive movie, the puzzles aren&apos;t too terribly difficult to figure out and its fun poking around the house and collecting items, but extremely linear -- its not like Lucius is going to do something that is not in the script or get into much trouble running around wielding a wrench in his hands without question by the adults. For that matter, the chores are pretty much more of a &apos;quest&apos; than actual consequences if you continue to ignore the adults around you. It would be nice if some dark humor was intermixed with the items you can interact with, to make it more like a Monkey Island type of experience. The house members and staff are pretty much a three line conversation deal. What carries you along is the plot of what Lucius might end up doing next and how he is going to take out the next person in game. I will say the Steam achievements seem to be the only thing to pop-up unexpected. Reminds me alot of the Call of Cthulu: Dark Corners of the Earth -- if you are a fan of Lovecraft, it works well enough. With that said, if you like the old Omen movies or B movie horror films, you will enjoy Lucius more than most and is worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lucius/user-reviews?user_review_id=2713990">Expand</a></span>

The game itself if generally enjoyable, especially if you are a fan of horror games. It&apos;s like a cross between Hitman and your standard point and click mystery . The graphics are very good for an indie title and the atmosphere is very detailed, offering a huge mansion in which the game takes place. Lucius, the main character, goes about trying to murder all of the inhabitants through the mansion as a sacrifice to his father Lucifer. The murder tactics are pretty clever and seem like what you would expect for a boy who&apos;s been possessed and given powers. The game itself took me roughly 9 hours to complete, with moderate exploration and a few side quests to earn special prizes to help solve some of the mysteries in the game (which come in handy numerous times). The game has a couple flaws however. The game is very linear in your ways to murder people, unlike the Hitman franchise, however, the murders themselves are executed quite well. Some of the games puzzles are harder than what you might expect, I cruised through the first 4 chapters, but by the 5th or 6th I needed to use a guide after wandering around for 15 minutes wondering what to do next. But all and all, I do recommend Lucius as it&apos;s a great game to kill some time, and it really immerses you into it&apos;s world. I hope Shiver Games continues to make games such as this, while gradually preventing mistakes in gameplay.

<br>Don&apos;t get me started on the animations and graphics. Not that it&apos;s like a bad port, but they just did a terrible job modeling the people; mouths and voices are also not in sync.

Quirky game play and skills but ultimately somewhat dry and hard to chew as the game progresses.

Some chunky animations

You try and guess what the hints are trying to tell you, you wander around until you find the object they want you to find, then you use the object in the way they tell you to.  Not worth spending money on since most of the gameplay is just you walking around until you find something to interact with.</span>

Both the visuals and voice acting are surprisingly good for this kind of game. The story and characters are alright and it is beyond charming riding around a tricycle in your fathers mansion plotting a sinister murder. The execution isn&apos;t perfect though. The point and click adventure style part of the game works for the most time alright however there are some far fetched puzzles and some annoying item searching in there. There are also some stealth missions in the game which would work surprisingly fine if the game didnt restart the entire map every time you got caught. This dumb save-system drags down every single part of the game but it is especially noticeable in the stealth missions. There are also some action-based missions in the game which are quite awful. I would still recommend the game to anyone interested  despite its flaws simply because its concept is so unique and entertaining. So if you find this game available for a cheap price, go for it! It will be an interesting experience no matter what.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lucius/user-reviews?user_review_id=2944953">Expand</a></span>

Some quests make no sense at all, and even supposed &quot;helper&quot; at Lucius&apos; desk doesn&apos;t do much good either. Not to mention technical glitches and broken lighting on AMD graphics
<br>
<br>Final fight is atrocious to say the least.

You do not get to figure out how to do anything, it is just a very bland specific and boring series of linear short puzzles that have a gore shot at the end. I cannot believe how well it is doing with the reviews, it is not even close to good enough to get a 3, let alone a 6.2.
<br>
<br>Add this this horrible gameplay really strange graphics. Half the game was extremal dark. Middle of the game, 8 windows and a series of light. You cannot see 3 feet in fount of you, everything is black and shadowy. I looked it up, apparently this is how it is supposed to be. Then, about halfway through, it changed for me. Everything was washed-out and very bright, like they just took the blackened graphics and lightened them. At least you could see the doors and other objects then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lucius/user-reviews?user_review_id=2783857">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s not a chocker considering i like to blow up thing in a similar fashion to a terrorist but alass, let&apos;s get this game pinned down to what it actually is: A satanic game.
<br>
<br>Whoopty-frickin&apos;-doo.
<br>I mean, it&apos;s never easy to talk about a game in which you collect souls from innocent beings (well, mostly) and lend them right over to the devil in exchange for more power and abilities.
<br>Gee, i wonder why so few games are made in the spirit of straight-up satanic murder. Hurr durr.
<br>
<br>Anyways; in this game you do.... what i just said, really.
<br>You toy around with your surroundings, destroying machinery, rig special environments to work in your favor, etc. The game relies on puzzles which i don&apos;t really like. Cuz&apos; i suck at dem puzzles u no wat am sayan&apos;?
<br>
<br>That&apos;s basically it! i mean, i could go into detail about the puzzles and so on, and i&apos;m gonna&apos; do it to brighten up your mind. You have abilites such as mind control, telekinesis, and visa versa. You use mind control on weak-minded people.
<br>
<br>An example would be the one case right right here: *spoilers. You trick a woman into thinking that her love interest loves someone else... the hardcore way of course. After that she goes to the balcony weeping and her mind has weakened from this... &quot;occation&quot;, which makes it easier to mind-control her. And then you know;
<br>
<br>Balcony + mind-control = Swan dive
<br>
<br>However, puzzles tend to be very hard and not giving any direction as of what you&apos;re supposed to do.
<br>I.... f*cking.... hate..... PUZZLES!!1!!!
<br>
<br>*sigh.
<br>
<br>Alright, alright. Let&apos;s round this up.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>1) The game manages to be a rather calming experience, which is nice.
<br>2) The soundtrack doesen&apos;t loop, instead it switches to another tune once the previous one has ended. It&apos;s also very nice.
<br>3) Mechanics and physics are a nice touch.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>1) Graphics are laughable.
<br>2) Puzzles are very hard and not very &quot;rewarding&quot;
<br>3) The game is very repetetive and boring sometimes.
<br>4) Jacksh*t sequel (this doesen&apos;t really matter)
<br>
<br>Please don&apos;t beat me to death.
<br>This game gets the score: &quot;It was only ok, dude&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lucius/user-reviews?user_review_id=5065228">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is linear, a poorly made Hitman clone without any freedom to choose your way to kill people. However the killing part is exactly what bothers me in this game, no clues on how to progress your objective, sometimes way of killing your family members can be ridiculous. Either it gets very hard or it&apos;s easy as pie.
