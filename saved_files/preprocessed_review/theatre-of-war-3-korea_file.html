Plus they have an intrusive DRM scheme as well to activate your games and they charge you for patches now at $5 a pop for CMBB and CMAK. Buy it if you must but at least wait for the bargain bin $5 which will surely come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/theatre-of-war-3-korea/user-reviews?user_review_id=1737901">Expand</a></span>

First it crashes a bit, second the AI could use a tune up but the game in general is decent. The campaign is enjoyable with a number of new craft and units. All in all I&apos;m happy</span>

Sometimes the units would curl up against each other in a corner when you tell them to move, and you have to figure out how to get them moving again by trial and error, while other times the path finding works exactly like it should. Why the wonkiness? I can understand if you guys can&apos;t be bothered to make TOW2 better, but how did you manage to make it worse?
<br>The lack of documentation has been a problem in the series, but this is a new low. What in hell is &quot;Historical units set&quot;? What are the numbers on the top left hand side corner of the campaign screen?
<br>
<br>Oh, another thing: now when you click a solder, you automatically select the whole squad, and you have to double click the solder to select him only. This little change makes infantry movement so much harder. I could name other annoying little changes from TOW2 that make no sense, but I&apos;d rather not.
<br>
<br>And mortars.  Player controlled mortars are wildly inaccurate. It&apos;s not uncommon for a mortar to empty all 84 rounds without killing anything. Enemy mortars, however, can wipe out entire platoons with a few rounds. This makes infantry squads useless whenever the enemy has a mortar position. Either make enemy mortars as inaccurate as player controlled ones, or get rid of these pieces of junk altogether.
<br>
<br>Infantry behaviour is exactly the same as in TOW2. They still throw grenades at friendly units, take minutes to figure out how to shoot an enemy 5 metres away. Good thing enemy soldiers can now surrender, making trench warfare slightly less frustrating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/theatre-of-war-3-korea/user-reviews?user_review_id=3818209">Expand</a></span>
