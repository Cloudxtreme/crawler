<br>I will not review SPG2 here because there are many reviews of the game. I will just say that it&apos;s not X, Eve, Elite or Star citizen. And that&apos;s a good thing.</span>

<br>I don&apos;t normally do early access games but after reading reviews by players and watch some lets play videos  I found i was unable to wait to buy the game and try it for myself.
<br>
<br>I bought it back in April and found that as a space combat sim it ticket a lot of the boxes other games in recent times were missing. The full 3D flight and streaming of the entire Gemini system are pretty nice and I spent hundreds of hours playing in the beta in free roam mode doing side missions or pirating.
<br>
<br>The Dev team at LGM is second to none there have been so many updates/ fixes and content releases since April they listen to the fan base and have included a lot of fan suggestions to the release game. They are very active on forums and very friendly always willing to listen to new ideas and willing to make changes to the game for the better.
<br>
<br>The game may be released now but that doesn&apos;t mean LGM are done developing the title they are now working on post release updates and content and at least one expansion(free of charge) is in the works that I know about. The games story line and free roam are now enabled but I would expect a lot more to come from LGM in the coming months.
<br>
<br>The game has been one of the best buys I&apos;ve found in terms of space sim it has both the feel of some classic games and the visuals of a modern space sim.
<br>
<br>Game play is both easy to learn but brutal at times you can do many of the things you would find in other space sims, like trading and mining to capturing ships and selling them.
<br>
<br>On the whole the game offers a lot of content and many ways to play, it lets the player choose how they want to play without holding them back from progressing or holding their hand.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4544337">Expand</a></span>

I have to agree with him to some extent, but this game can also make the adrenaline rush to your head. It&apos;s fast paced, if you want it to be. It&apos;s intense, if you want it to be. It&apos;s relaxing, if you want it to be.

<br>
<br>True sandbox, open world, choose-your-own-fate gameplay. I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s taken this long for a game of this type to come along, and it&apos;s really high caliber. So much fun that I had to find somewhere to give a favorable review, and I am rarely impressed enough to do so by a game.
<br>
<br>Highly recommended.</span>

<br>
<br>You can hire mercenaries to fight alongside you and even buy little fighter jets that deploy from within your hangar to help you (think: drones from Eve Online).
<br>
<br>There are nearly a hundred ships to aquire by either buying them or boarding an enemy ship, killing the crew, grappling the ship and towing it back to a nearby station to either sell ( for a very high price ;] ) or place in your garage for use, and they are all customisable. You can equip them with a variety of different weapons like railguns, plasma cannons, beam weapons and heavy weapons. You can enhance your systems by purchasing upgrades for things like your propulsion engines or shield generators. You can even give them a new paint job and add decals.
<br>
<br>It plays like an open world RPG. You pick from three different classes and go around doing freelance missions, mining, fighting or exploring, and it all gives you XP (and sometimes money) to level up your character. Levelling gives you the ability to spend points on improving your class skills, which can be used in battle, and attaining perks, which provide buffs to a number of things like increasing troop strength for boarding ships or improving trade prices.
<br>
<br>There is a recently added Campaign mode, which is basically a story mode. The story isn&apos;t great, and it&apos;s a little buggy, but you can still freely explore and do whatever you want while doing it. I found that despite the weak story, the missions were okay and gave you something else to do. If you&apos;re feeling aimless and not sure what to do next, the campaign missions can be a good way to provide yourself with a sort of goal or objective. If you really dislike it, then you can just ignore it all together and stick with freelance missions or hunting down relics deep within enemy territory or whatever else your heart desires. There&apos;s always plenty to do.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a fantastic game with a lot of content. The developers are also very active and involved with the community, and they update regularly. I expect the game will get even better from here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4546255">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is a must buy for space-nerds. It&apos;s fun, there&apos;s loads to do. And with the workshop, there is potential for user added content. The dev&apos;s are great and plan to add so much more for free.

I was probably more than 20 hours into my early access when I realized just how much I missed it.
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s no game breaker but having played Freelancer for well over 1500hrs and EVE online for much more you quickly realize just how much it holds the game back from being so much better. I&#x2019;ve put some 140 hrs into the game (including beta) and I&#x2019;m far from finished with it.
<br>
<br>The good news is that some serious HUD tweaks are coming as the DEV&#x2019;s work tirelessly to address a few bugs that appeared at launch and they&#x2019;ve been responding to some imbalance issues relating to leveling, the game having only been released a few weeks now is already feeling much better.
<br>
<br>Visually the game scores 9/10    Just beautiful!
<br>
<br>Soundtrack 9/10    Really great soundtrack.
<br>
<br>Storyline 6/10    Story was OK, I just didn&#x2019;t get into it. Just dialogue, no character cut scenes at all.
<br>
<br>Voice acting 6/10  Some were hilarious they were so bad.
<br>
<br>Gameplay 9/10  Some solid gameplay mechanics, easy to get into but hard to master.
<br>
<br>Replay ability 9/10  I got my money&#x2019;s worth just playing the Beta early access!
<br>
<br>General Content 9/10  Some real quality ships, gear, missions, bounties, capture ship gameplay etc&#x2026;
<br>
<br>LGM Dev&#x2019;s 10/10 Never come across such a great team working so hard with so little.
<br>
<br>I just finished the story mode&#x2026; overall I enjoyed it, I&#x2019;ve still got a few high bounties to go after and I haven&#x2019;t explored all of the map. The game as far as the DEV&#x2019;s are concerned isn&#x2019;t finished they have a big wish list of features they still hope to implement and honestly I can&#x2019;t wait.
<br>
<br>Starpoint Gemini 2 easily makes it into my top 10 space sim games and if you&#x2019;e looking for something to fill the void while we wait for Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous etc Just get it already.
<br>
<br>SPG2 will keep on getting better as they go and I&#x2019;m looking forward to it and new content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4575204">Expand</a></span>

<br>The development team is second to none. They are very responsive to problems that arise and work hand and hand with players to give you an optimal experience.
<br>I highly recommend this game to any spacer. It allows you a lot of choices for personal customization of not only the ships, but the type of game you want to play. Choose your story line or go rogue; &quot;be good, bad, or you&quot;; and anything in between.

With mods like Rogue Shadow which gave me the option to fly Star Destroyer in the game, devs brought this game to another level. Amazing details and graphic and Star Wars look and feel!!!

<br>
<br>In its current state it is worth the $35 price tag but as an added bonus the devs are fully supporting this game with freeLC and DLC in the works.  One thing that was mentioned was that its eventually going to be like mount and blade in space where you control armies of ships!  Can&apos;t wait for that but for now the game is still well worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4893250">Expand</a></span>

<br>Even in alpha state this game is well worth the price and in better shape than most release quality games!. You start the game in a predefined ship that you can sell to get a different ship(be it a bigger one)there is a garage that you can park all the ships you have this is a great feature. There is plenty to do, such as mining which is done via blowing the asteroids apart and getting the ore that drops. This feature is still being worked on and will get even better.
<br>
<br>Trading is also good, with all the many stations and planets you can spend many hours in search of a better price for goods. There is also freelance missions, currently there is passenger, trade, assassination, patrol and rescue they are quite good but this is a feature that is still being tweaked so expect them to get even better:)
<br>
<br>The graphics are really well done and run good on most systems. Gemini is a huge place with lots of areas that you will want to visit and explore, in a way it reminds me of freelancer in regards to exploring and how trading works.
<br>
<br>The sound is also quite nice that draws you into that mood of open space. The voice overs and the crew sounds are excellent and they are still adding more in. The sound effects such as explosions and weapons fit in just right.
<br>
<br>The game runs good with very little CTD&apos;s and that is damn good for a game that is still in alpha state!
<br>All in all I give this game an A+ so if you are on the fence about buying it, stop and get it now. By doing so you are doing a great deed in helping fund a really great game that I think will have its name in the &quot;Space Game Hall of Fame&quot;... Also be sure to check out the community forums http://steamcommunity.com/app/236150/discussions/ And the main website http://www.starpointgemini.com/
<br>Best of luck to all the pilots and god speed.
<br>**UPDATE**
<br>The newest patch has introduced allot of new content and fixes... The performance has been greatly
<br>improved also so if you not got this legendary space game yet... Well, what are you waiting for ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4513776">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Gemini system is alive with ships going about their business, traders and patrol ships cruising around, pirates taking chances on unsuspecting victims and you are all part of this big picture.
<br>
<br>The game is beautiful. Many times I find myself just floating above a planet and watching the scene, listening to the game&apos;s music and just generally relaxing watching the stars or the satellites rising and going by then descending behind the horizon as they follow their orbit.
<br>Then I fire up my overdrive and race towards the twin suns, flying under and through the arcing sun flares...
<br>
<br>There is the combat then. Like many other players, I had my fair share of playing other space sims, but this game caught me by surprise: here you are the captain of a multi-thousand ton space faring war vessel, and you need to take a different approach to combat - instead of dog fighting you need to steer the ship as well as aiming and firing often in totally opposite directions. You have tactical elements, like 4 tier shields, limited firing arcs and battery reserve: you are advised to rotate your ship around according to your shield-tier damage, battery reserve and weapon firing arc. If your left side shield is low, you rotate to present undamaged side to fire and let the damaged one to recover. If your bow turrets are empty, you offer your devastating broadside salvo to the enemy while your bow batteries recharge. This mechanic take a bit of time to muster, but as soon as you are familiar with it, it becomes second nature and immensely good fun.
<br>
<br>There are 75 (!) ships in the game, ranging from gunships to carriers and dreadnoughs, freighters and freightliners. All of them are possible to captain, purchase or steal. They are beautiful designs, you soon pick up favorites, each of them have their own characteristics, strength and weaknesses in amazing detail.
<br>
<br>Over 300 stations and planets to visit, explore and dock, land on, every one of them are different artwork. Should I say more?
<br>
<br>It was worth my money alone to have conversations with the exceptionally professional and customer oriented developer team, taking part in constructive debates along a great community, and seeing the game evolve. This game and the developer team behind it have great future, I recommend it to every space fan (and not to just gamers - I have recently took some unbelievably beautiful starscape as a screen background, the game is an HD movie experience)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4512737">Expand</a></span>

<br>I myself have been playing since Alpha (September 2013 release) and I have seen SPG2 come along in strides. Below is a basic list of what is ingame and can be done whilst playing. SPG2 brings back many memories of quite a few spaces games I have played since the mid 80&apos;s onwards.
<br>
<br>EDIT: V0.8000 - Most systems in place (being polished to perfection as LGM does!).
<br>
<br>Star Point Gemini 2 - So much to do ingame already, as of latest patch V0.8005 Beta:
<br>
<br>Collision system now in place with damage (No more flying through stations, asteroids etc or you will pay the price hehe)
<br>
<br>Fighter wings for ships with hanger bays are a blast to play with.
<br>
<br>70 ships to buy/capture/destroy
<br>
<br>Equipment/Weapons that can be modified with enhancements
<br>
<br>Customizable ship - Can re-color certain parts of your ship, add decals etc.
<br>
<br>Consumables - Shield boosters, damage boosters, repair nanobots, etc
<br>
<br>Power ups - Boost your Railgun damage, or Beam weapons etc for a few seconds to turn the tide in battle (Use them wisely though as they have a cool down for re-use)
<br>
<br>Ship cloaking (Ships that have cloak devices) - A lot of fun with this one :)
<br>
<br>Hero Characters to hunt down and kill for excellent credit reward. (You can kill a few of us Forum members now as Hero Characters! - Thanks to LGM&apos;s competition)
<br>
<br>Global events - More fun things to do outside of freelance missions etc.
<br>
<br>Junk yards - Cruise the junk yard like a junk yard dog looking for some possible cargo and or poor unsuspecting ships that might contain some nice cargo to liberate from them.
<br>
<br>Trade your wares in stations and planets that you either bought elsewhere or collected from combat or mining. (Price balancing to still be finalized)
<br>
<br>Board and capture ships - Hire troopers and grapple a ship, send in the troops and take over that ship for some extra credits or to take as your own new ship.
<br>
<br>Worm Holes appear around the galaxy and can whip you to somewhere else in no time (Be warned you might turn up somewhere &quot;You dont want to be&quot;)
<br>
<br>AI Security forces scan you ship for contraband and give you an option to dump it or duke it out (Pirates life for me, damn the pollice hehe)
<br>
<br>T-drives work as personal T-Gates to quickly jump to other areas very quickly (Same as using T-Gate, but on the spot usage, instead of finding a T-Gate)
<br>
<br>Ability to hanger (Personal hanger accessed via stations and planets) upto 5 ships, which you can swap out when needed. Have a freighter parked in your hanger when you want to do those big commodity runs for the big bucks, or some large scale asteroid mining. Drag out your carrier to go out and take on fleets of enemies with your weapons and your fighter wings.
<br>
<br>Travel the Galaxy map by normal engine power (I have done this and it takes quite some time - grab a coffee and some food), Power to engines (faster travel speed) or by Fast travel ways (Real fast movement across the galaxy)
<br>
<br>Freelance missions, Combat, repair, scan, VIP Courier, Cargo courier the list goes on.
<br>
<br>Steam Workshop - Mods are coming along and many more to come as modders get busy!
<br>
<br>Did I mention how bloody good the galaxy looks, Nebula&apos;s are amazing, Asteroid fields are real special (I like to play a pirate, so I like to hide in the dust clouds of some asteroid fields and wait for passing freighters/mining ships for some easy kills and loots. Junk yards look great, and just a reminder again don&apos;t run into them they not hurt hehe :)
<br>
<br>Oh and Mod Tools,
Want to add a new ship into game, can do!!
Want to add new sectors into game, Can do!!
Want to add anything virtually into game, can do!!!

Probably the best thing of all about SPG2 is the Dev Team, These people are one of the best I have had the pleasure of enjoying an alpha/beta release with. They are always responding to members posts, questions, technical help, and ideas.

The Dev Team have even taken ideas from members and have put into game those ideas, what more can you ask for in a Dev Team who cares just as much for the player base as their game, that is simply priceless and a quality lacking in many AAA title Dev Teams.

All I can say is, &quot;If you enjoy space gaming, Buy SPG2 today. You wont be disappointed&quot;

And drop by the official forums and say hello as well :)

And I&apos;m writing this about a week before full release so I didn&apos;t even play main story yet. Pure perfection.
<br>
<br>And what is more important, this game gave people faith in Early Access games. The process of involvement in the game development for players and the invaluable input developers are getting from the community is something spectacular. And that&apos;s what we have here. A true gem in the space genre, that is already compared to much bigger productions like X: Rebirth, Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen.
<br>Not to mention that many people said Starpoint Gemini 2 is first true spiritual successor of Freelancer which is a bold statement, but in fact, true.
<br>
<br>If you haven&apos;t bought this game already, that either means you don&apos;t like space games, or that the game didn&apos;t had visibility it deserved. So buy it, try it and join our big community on official forums.
<br>
<br>Buckle up and enjoy the ride, captain.
<br>
<br>P.S. And for the guy who gave it 0 because it doesn&apos;t work on Win XP - It was not intended to work on Win XP. System requirements part say minimum is Microsoft Windows 7, 8 and they even managed to get it working on Vista. Please read once before buying and think twice before trashing, because that review looks funny and forgettable now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4511527">Expand</a></span>

You can feel all of the energy and enthusiasm that the devs have placed in this game. A huge living universe with a tons of possibilites and as many radnom mission, that will take a big toll on your gaming time. Sleep depravation is a big issue for this game, because when u start flying your ship through all of those eye candy asteroids and gas clouds, its up to you to try and stop ;)
<br>
<br>Big thumps up for all of those many ships designs and sizes, and even for the light RPG effect of classes you can choose.
<br>
<br>A great game, made with a lot of heart.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4541452">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ll make two examples: tiny sattelites are orbiting planets and they have no other purpose than to look cool and add that small touch to the sensation.
<br>The other is the name and description of tradeable items - you smuggle &quot;adult magazines&quot;, &quot;tarkleaves pot&quot; and &quot;hogwash whiskey&quot;, or take a taxi mission to take &quot;super important person&quot; to a different location.
<br>Game simply has a lot of spirit and doesn&apos;t feels generic.
<br>If the storyline soon to be added keeps this direction, it will be one awesome game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4511521">Expand</a></span>

Want to know a dirty little secret?  I love and crave 3rd person space games.  En route to searching for something to fill this desire, I came across this game.  &quot;A Steam sale?&quot;  I asked.  &quot;Twenty-four bucks?&quot;  I blinked.  &quot;I spend that on 2-3 drinks at a restaurant with the wife...&quot;  So, I plucked this one out of the Steam shelf, downloaded and started playing.  Eight hours later I looked up and saw it was 4am.  &quot;Woah...&quot;  The next (read: later that) day I dove into the Starpoint Gemini 2 Community and learned I was late to a really cool party.
<br>
<br>Did you love Freelancer? Are you craving a 3rd person Space game?  What are you waiting for...?  Pick this gem up ASAP.  There are few games that are so worth your money that you&apos;ll want to encourage others to purchase, but this is certainly one for me.  In a day when space sims are seeing a great resurgence, it&apos;s refreshing to see a game that&apos;s not afraid to be 3rd person and give the player a bit of a relaxed take on space.
<br>
<br>I feel like a Malcom Reynolds, flying around in my ship, always with my eye on a new shiny, but lovingly holding onto, in my case, &quot;Big Red,&quot; until the time is truly right.  There&apos;s dangers around every planet, but I&apos;ve got a crew, a purpose, seemingly endless space to explore (certainly more than my limited time allows), and a ship.  There&apos;s even a fun plot-line to follow along as you make your way in the galaxy--or don&apos;t; whatever--it&apos;s all up to you.
<br>
<br>I can assure you that if you want a rewarding, relaxing, and immersive (but not taking itself too seriously) space game, this is it.  I give it a 9 (I&apos;d have done 9.5 if it let me) because of the somewhat outdated UI, and the graphics are not the most polished.  That said, the graphics do not detract from the game too much and again, it&apos;s sort of a breath of fresh air of late with the Elite: Dangerous&apos;s and Star Citizen&apos;s of the world.
<br>
<br>The development team has their ear to the forums and though I am new to the scene, they appear to be largely shaping the game around their community.  It&apos;s mod friendly, and seemingly more so as time goes on, and there&apos;s already some great mods out there.  It&apos;s much of anything you want in a fun game.
<br>
<br>Cheers.

If you enjoyed games like Freelancer or the X series, you will enjoy this without a doubt. It looks amazing, plays smoothly, has a big universe to explore and conquer, has staggering ship customization and upgrades, great trading, easy interface and decent tutorial so you feel comfortable playing it within 10 minutes. It&apos;s also surprisingly bug free, for a game that&apos;s still in beta, it doesn&apos;t crash, nothing. It misses a campaign (I think it will be added in a couple of weeks just in time for release), but even just the free roam mode is great fun. I also loved the idea of having different classes that you can choose with different abilities, some make your ship stronger while others buff your (future) fleet, along with a ton of perks that you can customize as you level up. Gives it a lot of replayability as you try different styles and approaches. Even the music&apos;s great. I honestly can&apos;t find anything to complain about, and that&apos;s pretty rare for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4502009">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Out of pure luck, one day i decided to take it on a Daily deal on Steam, and that was like hitting a winning lottery ticket. The feel of a massive universe where u can be what u want, from a economy based mega mogul Trader, to a ransacking Pirate in a search for a better loot. Starpoint Gemini 2 gives u the real feel of space adventure that was last seen in old classic games like Freespace.
<br>
<br>Buy your ship, upgrade its capabilities, choose from a variety of sizes: from small and fast gunner for fast kill, big slow freightleiner for hauling your precious cargo to a nearby station, or just maneuver a mega military carrier in a massive battles. Its up to you, to take your pick from more then 70 of ships that will blow your mind and make u wanna play more to get &quot;that one there&quot; you have seen in on of your many random generated missions.
<br>
<br>Open space universe is a delight to see and feel. No loading screens, big transport network hub ranging from ships T-Drive capabilities to riftways and wormholes, a cluster of asteroid fields and and beautiful crafted nebulas. It all gives you a immersiveness of a real breathing galaxy, in which your adventures will make a big impact on a world.
<br>
<br>All i can say its a great game, especially when i know its made by a really small dev team of real enthusiasts and space game fans.
<br>
<br>Enjoy it, because: The outcome of the universe is in your hands...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4541370">Expand</a></span>

The original Starpoint Gemini was a clunky, unevenly paced slog that often left you wondering what you were supposed to be doing or whether the game was even working properly.
<br>
<br>Starpoint Gemini 2 is a professionally polished and engaging game.  It falls somewhere between Freelancer and Starfleet Command in its execution.  Its open world is a varied and interesting place.  Missions (both story and random) are at least entertaining and usually take about 5-10 minutes to complete.  The controls and camera actually work with you this time, offering the player a variety of on-the-fly customization.  Combat difficulty can go from pushover to suddenly impossible, so knowing when it&apos;s time to bug out is important -- which adds a huge dose of tension to encounters!  It also means there is a nice sense of increasing power as you level up your captain and acquire better ships and systems.
<br>
<br>There are only 2 real negatives.  First, the story line.  You won&apos;t become attached to any of the characters, and the plot is a yawn-inducing tromp across very tired sci-fi themes.  No biggie, however, as the main plot is really nothing more than an excuse to reveal the game&apos;s factions and explore the map.  It is NOT the meat-and-potatoes of the game.  You can even opt to play without it!  Secondly, there is a bit of a learning curve.  Ships move and maneuver in such a way that seems awkward at first: either too fast or too slow.   The controls work well, but take a bit of getting used to, and learning which camera works best in certain situations can be a bit annoying.  Once you&apos;ve moved past it, it no longer interferes in the least.
<br>
<br>What the core gameplay does revolve around is a huge universe to explore, lots of nifty things to discover, a trading system that rewards exploration, and some very cool travel mechanics.  (Like riftways.  Riftways are confirmed coolness.)  And there&apos;s a lot of depth here that might not be immediately apparent.  It&apos;s a nice balance between hardcore space sims and arcade-like space shooters.
<br>
<br>Recommended without hesitation!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5086985">Expand</a></span>

For the price - around $17 US - it provides hours of fun exploring a huge universe, considering and accepting contracts to perform various missions, engaging in battles that can become nail-biters, gradually enhancing your ship and personal capabilities, getting a sense of satisfaction when your new fusion missile blasts a higher rated ship into space debris, and always wanting to take on just one more mission before going to bed.  So far, I&apos;ve only played freelance and am enjoying it immensely.  There&apos;s also a story line option that I&apos;ll try later.  My only ding is that the manual is inadequate causing some minor frustration.  This is offset by ample online help in the forums.  The developers are highly responsive to forum topics and continue to improve on the game.  I view it as a solid long-term investment in fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5086243">Expand</a></span>

It is so chock full of great features that it should be on the radar of every fan of space combat games.

DLC will probably cost something, but I want them to take my money. The game is awesome.</span>

I see a lot of potential in this game but right now it feels more like a framework for something better. The entire game revolves around completing repetitive quests or very mundane trading between stations and planets. There are a lot of issues.
<br>
<br>1st, combat is a bit straight forward and boring. There is really not much strategy to it aside form shifting power usage between full engines to get around and shields/weapons when in combat... not exactly hard to figure out. Almost all encounters are easy mode. Just head in, fire long range salvos against hard enemies and whittle them down once in range. I found it easier to simply grapple everything once in range and just fight them face to face. This works with 100% success rate as long as you got the 1st hit earlier and are in a similar or better class ship. This is boring. No strategy. I like that you can target certain things on the enemy ship to disable them and I like being able to board and take over ships but its also much too easy... just click, transfer troops and watch. All you need is a few boarding perks, a toggle-able skill, or more troops than the enemy and you will win. Replenishing troops is trivial and cheap as is repairing your ship and restocking heavy ammo... again, its boring how easy everything is in the game.
<br>
<br>Trading in this game is silly. You check the high and low price indicators in your map and simply run between  stations who sell and buy the items you want to trade. Stations always restock when you leave and come back and its an endless boring loop of profit. There is no such thing as production in this game nor price controls. There is also no automation so you have to run the trade routes manually.
<br>
<br>Thats it... there are a few more features like being able to repair stations through a context menu and a few more things but none are fleshed out much. I stopped playing at about level 30 after the endless monotony of recycles missions. It needs more work. At this time, it feels like a consolized/dumbed down X3 lite. It needs more ships, more things to do, more strategic combat (not that x3 is brilliant in this area), more strategic trade/economy, or something... it feels incomplete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5302177">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Eve Offline with less depth but more FUN.
<br>
<br>Graphics: Some awesome ship designs, each area has a distinct feel and graphical style (there are no loading screens, it&apos;s all seamless transitions), some of the fog shaders are a little overdone (they can look &quot;blurry&quot;) but it&apos;s nothing that will put you off the game. Overall graphics are acceptable/good and actually are very impressive for such a small dev team.
<br>
<br>Sound: The sound design is OK, it&apos;s nothing to write home about but it does keep you immersed. I find the music sometimes cuts out leaving the soundscape a bit empty but it&apos;s not a game killer for me.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: The campaign is lack lustre and not really worth your time in it&apos;s current iteration: I would advise new players to just play in &quot;free&quot; mode. The game can become repetitive and it would be nice to see the ability to take over sectors and build your own stations (like the X series) however having said this the game is still very fun as it does feel like you are in a dynamic universe. This dynamic feel could be improved by having random galaxy wide events (such as alien invasions) or  by providing more end game content as it can get a bit stale.
<br>
<br>Flight mechanics: Somewhere between Eve online and X3:TC, you do have direct control over your ship but it doesn&apos;t feel like you are controlling a space ship - it feels more like you are controlling the camera and the ship just rotates in front of the camera. I think they could do a lot of work on improving the physics engine as collisions feel very &quot;bouncy&quot; and unrealistic. It&apos;s not terrible but it&apos;s not great either.
<br>
<br>Economy: If you like trading the system in this game will keep you happy for a while although there is no way to see market data and because the player cannot build their own stations it can feel a bit like you&apos;re not having any affect.
<br>
<br>UI: The UI is acceptable and some parts are actually really well done, I like the context sensitive radial menu and power distribution UI; it&apos;s elegant and gets the job done fast.
<br>
<br>Size: The game world is huge so you can definitely get immersed in the world, it&apos;s just a shame it all feels a bit generic (from a gameplay perspective) different regions don&apos;t offer different styles of gameplay or missions.
<br>
<br>Re playability: Your mileage will vary depending how much you like space games. For me I think I could get a good 100+ hours out of the game and feel like I definitely got my moneys worth.
<br>
<br>Difficulty: Put it on extreme or you will find it far too easy.
<br>
<br>Overall: 7/10 - with expansions that allow for station building, sector takeovers and larger fleets, wars and rando galaxy events this could easily be 9/10

<br>
<br>The focus here is on large ship battles - and with many ships, rather than smaller dogfigthing. Your starting ship is fairly large ( gunship), and some of the stuff I have seen to buy looks cool. You can climb the ranks and get battleships, dreadnoughts and the like, and command officers and mercs to help you out in battle, either on your own ship or as a wingman. You can even board enemy ships and take control of them, or tractor ships back to stations to sell them.
<br>
<br>It looks lovely and has a massive open map to explore, complete with anomalies, slipstreams, wormholes, gates, planets, stations asteroid fields, nebula etc. - all you would come to expect from such a game and more.
<br>
<br>The campaign is basic, but enjoyable. The voice-acting is absolutely atrocious though - the accents are all over the place and it is detrimental in an necessary way. You also have the option to free-roam, doing missions as they come along, trading or becoming a pirate. It has a complete reputation and trading system, allowing you to become anything you want.
<br>
<br>A lack of multiplayer hits hard, since this game would be infinitely better with it and a real shame it is not included. It also seems to have a fairly repetitive and grindy feel to it - hence the mark of 6/10. If it had multiplayer I think my score would jump to 8/10 instantly though.

The story is interesting, there is a huge universe to explore and you have, like in Freelancer, a good choice of career. It&apos;s overall a good game but it&apos;s unequal game-play will soon wear your patience thin.
<br>
<br>The Good: Choice of career, customisable ship and vast universe to explore. Interesting quest story but you can also choose not to follow it and do your thing: Trade, fight or smuggle. Unfamiliar but easy to get used to interface.
<br>
<br>The Bad: Bugs. Expect crashes. This is complicated by the fact that you can only save at stations forcing you to quit whatever you are doing and dock at a station rather than racking up side missions after side missions. Game-play is totally unequal and mostly unfair. You can manage to kill four enemies on your own to complete a mission just to be blown up by a single shot of suddenly appearing &quot;impossible to kill&quot; enemies. Missions are supposed to be evaluated by level but you can&apos;t trust it. Progression through rank is painfully slow limiting your ability to get better ships.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: Get it when it&apos;s at a discount. Lower your expectations. Play it once in a while, a few missions at a time and you&apos;ll get to enjoy the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5440521">Expand</a></span>

<br>I will never play the previous game, cause it is not needed. You can literally play this game and see 100% the full story. Voiceactive being it;s weakest point is NOT what I care from my games. I go for the gameplay. What it does, it does well! You will have fun with this game for a handful of hours, as long as this is your kind of game. This game is still developed so it means it has a lot of future potential! The love given on metactitic really made me smile :D
<br>
<br>First of all let me make this clear. I give this a 10 not because it is a perfect game. I give this a 10 because it is  a game that does not give up. I was happy to see all the 10s here about this game and this is one of the games of the new age that deserves it. It comes from a small and quite successful development group and a really new and quite nice Publishing group.
<br>
<br>I have never played it&apos;s predecessor, which seems that has gotten a less warm acceptance than this one and I definitely never will play it. This game right now costs as little as 8 euro on a sale, full content and all current DLC and that means that if someone is patient, he can get this game for little money and enjoy a game that deserves even the full price.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for a perfect game with graphics that make your PC (or your pocket) cry for help, this is not what you need. The graphics are quite enjoyable an simple and honestly, I do not care to see more shiny ones or ones that when you zoom in to the point the ship is up your face you can see every single detail and scratch. X Rebirth, one of my most anticipated titles did this and currently I do not even care to check what is new about it. I will remain with X3 and forget that high graphics beautiful part of it, called X Rebirth.
<br>
<br>BUT, back to Starpoint Gemini 2. First of all I will talk of the voice acting. It ranges from bad, to good or cheesy and silly. This is NOT a bad thing for me. I do not consider Hollywood and people that talk with perfect voices and tones or pitches or that always talk right, normal. In real life people can talk weird, can act weird and can feel like they are from another planet. That does not make me excuse the bad voice actors, but makes me not care enough to either get disengaged from the story or dislike the game. If you want good voice actors then watch a high budget movie.
<br>
<br>With the voice acting out of the way, I really have to say the game is A W E S O M E. As I mentioned before, I will NEVER play the previous one, because when you get this game for free you the the Origins DLC, which is the story of the first game, that does not seem to be as good as the second, all with the new engine and graphics! I do not care what people say, but that is not something companies do usually. They try to see older products by packing them along with the newer ones that get a better rate and and make extra $$$. Little Green Men were like &quot;Nope! Forget the old one! If you want to know what happened in the previous game.. here you can see it with the new game too!&quot;. AND IT IS AWESOME!
<br>
<br>The gameplay is quite &gt;boring&lt; , like most gameplays can be. A lot of games are evolved around; Go there do that, go there fetch that. Yeap, there is no puzzle solving or first person shooter moments. There is also no cooking recipes, racing or even farming in space. What the hell I am talking about? I do not know. I am trying to imagine what people expect the game to offer when they say &quot;It is a boring game of you going to places and pressing a button to scan or shooting enemies and killing them. &gt;
<br>
<br>There are still a lot things they could fix, like the casual crashes or giving the ability to skip dialogue sequences, since they can be long winded and the game crashing or you getting shot to pieces, means you have to go through the whole thing all over again. I would say some tweaking of stats between ships or economy is needed too, but I said it feels it is still being expanded and evolved, so I will wait to see what they fix. After all, large games that are loved, like X3 or Skyrim, have mods that people fine tune the game to make it work better and  do what you normally can&apos;t. The creators seem to support Modding so I am happy, even if there is not much of it right now.
<br>
<br>All in all,I say just go watch a let&apos;s play and if you like it buy it. I am glad i did and feel lucky! :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starpoint-gemini-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5837310">Expand</a></span>
