In BF2 you get a game that is far more feature-SHALLOW than the orginal.  Fewer features, much poorer play-balancing, and virtually no challenge (unless you are a diehard conqeust-only player).  I purchased the original BF2 and had to deal with EA&apos;s virtually non-existent tech support while trying to get the game to run on my computer.  Once it was installed and actaully working (poorly) I spent the next two weeks constantly enduring helecopters gunning me down while they were taking *multiple* tank gun hits - that&apos;s balanced?  The expansion has done nothing to address this, or the multitude of other problems that make this game more aggrivating than enjoyable to play.  This &apos;expansion&apos; essentially amounts to a map pack that costs you $30 - meanwhile the original game has been released for five months and virtually none of the bugs that were in the game since day one have been address by any of the three &apos;patches&apos; EA has released.  This is corporate greed at it&apos;s worst.  My suggestion to you is try and play this on some poor slob&apos;s computer who has already been fleeced for the $30 cost of the expansion and see for yourself before you buy.  After an hour or two of dealing with all of the above irritations you&apos;ll be throwing -his- copy of the game in the trash - and I think you&apos;ll agree that you&apos;re better off saving your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-2-special-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=57182">Expand</a></span>

BOOM! So easy for the expert difficulty mode, I really wished there&apos;s an option to assign more enemy bot numbers to the opposition army. The medic guy could drive me up the walls sometimes, the priority for the medic guy to rescue the down and injured first, regardless of how close the enemy is (like just few metres away), so in the end both the medic guy and the just saved player (after one resurrected by the medic guy) was gunned down altogether right after the medic guy saved a bot/player, should have made the medic guy more wiser and shoot the enemy if there&apos;s one nearby, or make some hot-keys (when down and injured, press either the keyboard key 1 to 3) so the downed player could order the medic guy to save/rescue the player or to shoot the enemy first. The mouse sensitivity couldn&apos;t be set higher for flying the choppers and jets, there are all sort of mice made all around the world, the sensitivity of my mouse are normal, but this game&apos;s flight-mouse sensitivity is not normal, I need to flung the wireless mouse off my desk to turn the F-15 Eagle jet around. It&apos;s hard to fly the F-15 at the pretty-above-and-near-take-off speed, as the mid-low flying speed could get the jet lost control and crash easily, there&apos;s no constant/fixed thrust rate for the afterburners by pressing the 1 to 9 keys on the keyboard, one needed to press and hold down the &quot;W&quot; key to make the jet accelerate and fly, you take a glimpse at the flying speed to the mid-left of the screen, the next thing you know was that you almost flew out of the small fly zone or missed the bombing target! Yes, flying the chopper needed a joystick, or else you could barely aim at a target or fly low enough to dodge some rockets.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-2-special-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=1443541">Expand</a></span>

The price is set too high for this expansion, although its a great expansion to add. i would say to those who complain about it off center fireing, is that all weapons dont exactly shoot Dead Center. If you want real physics, dont complain. I&apos;m looking forward to other additions.</span>

But the wait did seem to be worth it: not so much for the new forces, which are fun to be sure, but the great new maps, with much more of an emphasis on fighting on foot through dark corridors, village streets. I spent way too long last night fighting over a submarine pen, which was very well thought out. Vehicles are still an important feature, for sure, if nothing else for getting to places, and the attack helicopter pilots always seem to win the most kills, but for intense fun, foot is the way to go. These maps are much better suited for those who are less exicted about sitting in a tank than climbing up walls and zipping down from rooftops. The fora are full of griping, and we will see plenty here, about the technical hitches. It does seems amazing that EA again has released a buggy product. But the gameplay rocks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-2-special-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=384292">Expand</a></span>

On the other hand, I&apos;m really bored with playing the same game mode and dont understand why EA couldnt come up with other modes like demolition, breach, etc. There are so many possible modes for a game that focuses on modern combat and we&apos;re stuck fighting over flags :( I have to say that EA is notorious for releasing buggy/glitched games and BF2 is definitely one of them. Many people are having trouble playing the game becuase of problems with the EA downloader software and the 1.12 patch that was released in order for players to access the server list. EA is the number one publisher in the world according to Game Developer magazine and there are no excuses for releasing games that do not function properly. I personally feel that they&apos;ve gotten so big that customer service is low on the list of their priorites as long as the $$$ is rolling in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-2-special-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=384457">Expand</a></span>

I reccommend this game to every bf2 player. It seems some people are having performance and installation problems. I think these kinks will all get sorted out and the the game will last for a long time due to the high spec requirements.</span>

I&apos;ll try to list some of the reasons, but the honest truth is that there are so may problems with this game that it&apos;s almost impossible to list them all. Here&apos;s some of the low-lites: -*Requires internet play* (single player isn&apos;t there) -Internet server selection screen lists servers that cannot be joined. -Internet server screen frequently, spontaneously, and inexplicably drops all servers from list so there&apos;s nothing to join - requiring restart of game. -Punkbuster claims an unmodified game has been modified and will not allow you to play on any ranked servers (the only way to get points). -Tanks take impact damage going over small hills at low speed -- hills that a person on a bicycle could traverse safely at high speed (no, I&apos;m not kidding). And, my favorite new bug that was added after the new Spec. Ops. expansion (that I paid $30 for): -Grenade launcher sight is now off-centered - sporadically fires to the right (but not consistently, so that you can adjust for the sight&apos;s poor design). It amazes me that the biggest independent game designer in town (EA) can release a game in such a poor state, and then let several months pass and do virtually nothing to fix the innumerable problems that make me rate this game a ZERO. I will not play it anymore. I strongly suggest buyers steer clear of this one. Ifyou want a good shooter try Counterstrike Source, or the original Battle Field (1).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-2-special-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=384672">Expand</a></span>

The flag opton could remain, bu why not alternate obejctives, like blowing something up or rescuing hostages? You know, the kind of ops that real special forces do? I also think that this expansion, along with the core game, are horrenduously flawed. The periods where one can&apos;t logon to even play the game still persist as well as mundane flaws like being kicked for teamkilling when such an offense was not committed. Also, being a former Marine, I can attest to the games striking lack of realism with respect to the USMC. We did not have &quot;medics&quot;, the Army has those, we have Navy Corpsman. Also, the spec ops kit is obviously modelled after Delta Force, which a division of the Army. We have Recon and Force Recon, which should have been the spec ops kit. Also, the sniper weapon unlock, the Barrett sniper rifle, should not take more than one shot to kill. It&apos;s a FIFTY caliber weapon, that&apos;s a half-inch thick bullet, which would dismember a person who is shot with it, for which reason it is ONLY an anti-vehicle weapon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-2-special-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=384548">Expand</a></span>

Just to everyone who gives it a horrible score just because it doesn&apos;t work on their crappy computer, please don&apos;t rate it if you haven&apos;t played it because if you actually had the computer to play it you&apos;d see how great this game is. When everyone finally gets the good computer to run this they will be amazed how good it was especially for being released over a year ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-2-special-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=394577">Expand</a></span>

I mean being shot with a silenced 9mm from 200 yds?...ROTFLMAO!  The accuracy in this game is already bad enough, but to cheat for stats?  Is nothing sacred for those who like fairplay and sportsmanship anymore?   Like I said, oppose this and you&apos;re a contributing cheat...and ALSO like I said YOU HAVE NO SKILLS STATPADDER good for nothings.  Game could have been real great but Punkbuster comes up short.  Still unplayable almost due to punks.  If you are mature, you realize death is gonna&apos; come for you in this game...plenty.  But you guys with major points for nothing, 1 mile kills with a pistol, and shooting through walls all while going undetected is a laugh.  You are only good in your own mind, some of us like the satisfaction of actually EARNING our merits.  Thanks and good luck and good fortune to all of you who are honest in life&apos;s different endeavours  and.....GAMES!!  :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-2-special-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=65412">Expand</a></span>
