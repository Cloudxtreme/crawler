<br>Beware, however, that you won&apos;t be able to play with your friends if they own this game because the servers exist no more. You may try to find a way to play online with a program like hamachi, but I can guarantee that it won&apos;t be easy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spellforce-2-faith-in-destiny/user-reviews?user_review_id=3822232">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In short, its not Spellforce, the story is terrible, they add new characters with no backstory claiming its not important to have one, the game is short consisting of only 4 maps, the design of the new characters and enemies is awful, though that&apos;s my opinion and it just insults people that care about the series, the only reason it doesn&apos;t get a 1 out of 10 on here is because it has things I like, but they are all the things copied from the other two games. There was no effort put into this and it ends on a horrific cliffhanger and even goes out of its way to disregard plot/lore from the previous games. Avoid this one like the plague, pick up Shadow Wars or Dragon Storm instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spellforce-2-faith-in-destiny/user-reviews?user_review_id=2487547">Expand</a></span>

This game somehow managed to distort all those pleasant memories into something horrible. I&apos;ll keep it short. This game is a DISASTER. It has been so long in production maybe I expected much more, or maybe at least the same we got 5 YEARS AGO! Graphics aren&apos;t the problem, this game sucks on so many levels, there&apos;s nothing new besides a couple of new (enemy) units, story is horribly generic and uninteresting, it&apos;s TOO SHORT, voice-over is BAD, cut-scenes are garbage, everything looks like some unfinished product of developer&apos;s barren minds.
<br>
<br>I regret ever buying this game, if you&apos;re a fan of the series my recommendation is DON&apos;T BUY and  rather play Shadow Wars and Dragon Storm, they&apos;re diamonds compared to this BS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spellforce-2-faith-in-destiny/user-reviews?user_review_id=2512804">Expand</a></span>

Thumbs up and I hope we will get some DLC for it. Also a big highlight are the creative cut scenes, the intro as well as the outro. Fresh and stylish! And for 19,99 a good value for money!

Beginning of the story jumps straigh to a dialogue hard to pick up (needs to be corrected by devs). - There were long times during the base building that no music kicked in rare occasions. - Unit animation is well done, with fluid moves . - Day and night provide different atmosphere. - A great game to create a DOTA style of play map. - Few games of nowadays that actually kept lan mode to play at home with friends. - Unit animation when hit by enemies. - Each race has a Champion unit pretty well designed and nicely textured, your own Colossus to rally behind. - Not for COD &amp; Battlefield players: you can&apos;t have a game with those graphics in a RTS game, so don&apos;t wine about it. It&apos;s better than most mmo&apos;s around anyway (I&apos;ve seen the graphics argument on youtube and it&apos;s ridiculous, pure gratuitous bashing). - Allows to be played on older pcs since its graphical detail can be easely modified. - Your hero can mount a Dragon. Never seen in a RTS besides mmo&apos;s. - You can choose either to be nasty and devious or kind hearted and righteous in the outcomes of small quests (lie, help for example) - Unique sets to equip characters with bonuses found throughout the game. All in all it&apos;s a fundamental &quot;must have&quot; on rts based games ownership. There isn&apos;t much of this kind of quality games anymore and if you&apos;re a fan already of the series, it can be easily purchased on steam for example. Look for gameplay videos on youtube and check the site out and decide for yourself if it&apos;s worth or not, at least it&apos;s not a hyped game and from big corps advertising it everywhere and promising what they don&apos;t deliver. This is just my recommendation.
