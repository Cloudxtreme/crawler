Although new to the video game industry, Moon Studios&apos; Metroidvania was a blowout success and has won multiple awards, due to its impressive art style and solid mechanics. In this review, I will try to highlight why Ori and the Blind Forest has received such critical acclaim while sharing my personal experiences from my ten-hour playthrough of the game.
<br>Before delving into the game, it is important for you to understand what kind of person this review is coming from. Ori and the Blind Forest was my first ever Metroidvania style game to play, my usual repertoire consists mainly of story-driven platformers, such as the trine series. The key distinction between a Metroidvania style game compared to a regular platformer is the introduction of an open-world map and a progression tree. These distinct differences help to emphasize exploration within Metroidvania style games compared to platformers.
<br>With that out of the way, let&apos;s move onto one of the main reasons I couldn&apos;t put Ori and The Blind Forest down, during my playthrough: the Story. The general plot of the game consists around Ori&apos;s, a white guardian spirit, quest to rejuvenate her home forest, which has fallen into darkness, by recollecting the lost orbs which kept the forest in balance. Although there is no voice acting in the title, due to the beautiful animations and cutscenes, the player creates a strong emotional connection not only to the silent protagonist but also to the forest which is slowly coming back to life throughout the game. This in conjunction with the beautiful and emotive soundtrack by Gareth Coker creates such a strong and emotive storyline, that it is very hard to not be touched by the plights of Ori and the sacrifices she must make throughout the game.
<br>The main standout characteristic of the game has to be the beautiful art style that the game possesses. Although similar to Ubisoft&apos;s UbiArt graphics engine, which was used for Child of Light and the more recent Rayman games, the hand-drawn aesthetic which focuses on the light in such a big way, adds another layer of depth and makes the act of exploring the world interesting and engaging no matter where you are on the map, which is crucial in a Metroidvania style game, as it is crucial for the development of the story and the character that the player revisits already found areas with new abilities to progress through them further, or in an entirely new way.
<br>Although a fantastic story, an impeccable art style, and a near-perfect soundtrack can help to create a great game, unless the underlying mechanics and gameplay are rock-solid then it will all be for nothing. Thankfully, the mechanics and gameplay within Ori are smooth to use and especially later in the game the sense of motion that some of Ori&apos;s abilities possess create an exhilarating and satisfying experience for the user that highlight the fluidity of the gameplay.
<br>In conclusion, I would recommend anybody looking for a well styled and emotive Metroidvania game to give Moon Studio&apos;s first release a look and let themselves be sucked into this beautiful world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=7588594">Expand</a></span>

<br>However,</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The beginning of this game is nice and atmospheric, despite 1) there not being clear enough indications of when you can play and when you are watching a rendered video and 2) the characters moving super slow in some scenes which is really annoying. However, the beginning in general is really nice and you have to notice that the game&apos;s visuals and music are definitely wonderful.
<br>
<br>However, the gameplay itself is quite tedious. Basically, it&apos;s a large click fest. The enemies in this game are quite strong and Ori is kind of weak so most of the time you&apos;ll find yourself awkwardly trying to dodge enemy projectiles or attacks (which can often  2-shot you or even 1-shot you no matter how large your health is) while clicking like a madman in order to damage them with your flame. Not exactly something that you&apos;d be looking for in a platform game. The enemies respawn at the speed of light, not giving you a chance to rest in some portions of the game and you will be bored repeating the same area over and over again just because you are fighting a pig-ramming enemy that kills you in 2 hits and you try in vain to dodge his attacks by jumping around him and burning your index finger into your left mouse button.. This game is way too much focused on combat (which is not very well done, to make matters worse) rather than exploring which is the best portion of the game and definitely fulfills its role, as returning to areas and finding new items and powers are the best parts of this game.
<br>
<br>And by mentioning that, I have come to the biggest gripe of mine - this is the first platformer I have ever played that blocks you from returning to certain areas that you have already completed (which happens in platformers, right? but wait for it) WITHOUT giving you any sort of warning, basically giving you a middle finger if you want to 100% this game. When you are playing a game with a world of quite a large size that is filled with collectibles that you cannot get until you get specific upgrades and progress in the story and you are playing this game for the first time meaning you have no idea what you can get at what point in the game, the most idiotic idea I can think of is not letting you do so, because you go the &quot;wrong&quot; way once and accidentally lock unexplored areas behind you. What a stupid idea. This completely ruined the game for me after I finished the first dungeon and I no longer had the motivation to keep playing. Think what you want, but in my opinion this is a ridiculous designer flaw, especially for this kind of game that REVOLVES around revisiting areas and collecting stuff.
<br>
<br>Also, a certain specific ability of Ori&apos;s, Bash, is used really often and is quite frustrating to do, as the arrow of movement changes randomly while you are Bashing. So, if you have 4 Bash targets above you, then three times the arrow is pointing up as you want it to, but during the fourth time it is suddenly pointing downwards, most likely to a place of sure death which certainly does not help during some of the harder parts of the game or during escapes. It&apos;s more clicking and less exploring as well.
<br>
<br>The world of Ori and the Blind Forest is varied enough, but  I couldn&apos;t find any sort of transportation device or skip travel option and the constant running from one side of the world to the other just to get a single new collectible becomes a rather mundane task (mind that I have played Metroidvania games where this is not a problem, such as the Shantae series) if you are a completionist like me. But, in the end, it doesn&apos;t even matter (reference intended), as you will most likely not be able to 100% this game the first time you play, because it will lock you out of that option.
<br>
<br>So, to sum it up, this game tries to play on visual and atmospheric side in order to hide the fact that the gameplay is full of quite strange designer choices that make the game quite a chore to play as opposed to a fun ride. It&apos;s a shame, I was looking forward to this game, but I am not going to lie and pretend that this game is totally sublime when it&apos;s not. Maybe next time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5108518">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ The music sound amazing and fits well with the game.
<br>+ The story is simple but easy to understand and will play with your emotions.
<br>+ This game can be pretty difficult sometimes, but I like games with a good challenge.
<br>+ There is a talent tree, were you can upgrade Ori and it feels awesome every time you gain an ability point.
<br>+ Runs very smooth and is very polished.
<br>+ No loading screens.
<br>
<br>- There were a very few time I randomly fell through the map a died.
<br>- There is a lot of backtracking, but that is not that big of a deal.
<br>
<br>The game takes about 6-12 hours of game (1st time).

<br>Story
<br>
<br>The story of Ori was a very delightful experience and it was heart-warming to watch this tale unfold, and i feel like it gave me a Disney-esque feeling throughout. The story isn&apos;t anything phenomenal but it was charming and i enjoyed it throughout.
<br>
<br>Visuals/Presentation
<br>
<br>The visuals are pretty, and the art direction is well done and fits with the game. The game runs smooth and I experienced no hiccups, or slow downs throughout the game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>
<br>The gameplay mechanics for Ori are very well done and i found myself dying because of my actions not the controls, and you will die often because this game was a lot more challenging than expected and sometimes to the point of frustration. My favorite aspect of the Gameplay was the leveling up system in place and the fact that certain areas are locked off until you learn a new mechanic, and being able to implement that mechanic is a very rewarding experience.
<br>
<br>Verdict
<br>
<br>Overall, i really enjoyed my time with Ori and the Blind Forest, It took me roughly 15 hours to get through the charming journey, and the well implemented mechanics and leveling system, as well as the hidden things to find made me want to come back and explore more. This is a must have title for any Xbox owner who is fond of the platformer genre</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5334406">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>-the game looks gorgeous. it looks like you steeped into a fairy tale. The lighting makes some parts look nicer then they already do and it has that thing from the trine franchise where they will make an area look more polished then it really is so good points for the graphics
<br>-I like the way the story is being told. Nobody talks and that is exactly what i love about it. It plays with your emotions without saying a word
<br>- the gameplay is one of the best this year. It is challenging,difficult,engaging and most importantly its fun
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-i have no cons. this game is bloody perfect in my eyes</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5288204">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay mechanics are pretty good. The controls (although sadly not redefinable) are solid and precise, which is extremely important in Ori, since the trial &amp; error nature of the game: It can be very challenging and can sometimes be frustrating, so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a game for everyone.
<br>I&apos;ve seen some pointing out how it&apos;s short, but I don&apos;t agree, it&apos;s long enough and ends right before becoming stale.

However, at the end of the day its just a pretty bunch of fluff.  Save the magic forest with your magic soul powers and bring harmony to all its creatures!  Ori and the Blind Forest is not only a great platformer, its a stand-out title in the genre right now, but you all know what&apos;s coming next.  Is it the next Super Metroid?  Well the answer is with a great heavy sigh:  &quot;No.&quot;  No its not the next Super Metroid, its just the latest copy-cat, a great copy-cat, but nonetheless- a copy-cat of many other games.  Remember Aquaria?  Oh wait, no, no one does because they didn&apos;t have Microsoft Studios backing them up when Bit Blot subsequently released their own spin on the platformer genre to little fanfare several years before.  A lot of the mechanics are seemingly pulled right out of Metroid games, older 2-D platformers, etc.. I&apos;d reckon that most of the brilliant concepts in Ori lie in its visually pleasing story telling and setting- not the gameplay.  However, that&apos;s not entirely fair, there were several techniques that made the game quite unique, but then again those learned techniques late-game allowed the level designers to absolutely go nuts making wildly difficult segments of the game for the player to sort out on their own.  These were challenging portions for sure, but a few dozen tries later most people will get through them just fine.  Leaving very little &quot;exploration&quot; for the player was also not particularly thrilling to see here as well, since you ultimately find enough energy ta- I mean &quot;health containers&quot; and ability points to see you through the entire game.  Even worse the actual game is criminally short.  Between two days, I managed to beat it in about five hours, which is unbelievably criminal as well if you were planning on getting any replay value from it.  Which &quot;Ori&quot; has none of.  No one wants to go back through the escape segments again, unless you&apos;re speedrunning or doing something ridiculous like a &quot;no death&quot; speedrun or something equally as crazy.  Ori is also plagued by some niggling issues with control schemes such as being forced to utilize an Xbox gamepad in order for all the controls to register properly (since they won&apos;t with any other controller or anything like x360ce for instance).  The keyboard controls got me through the game just fine, but I always felt like it would&apos;ve been more intuitive had I had a controller that was compatible.  The story felt rather rushed, it felt like they were setting up something really interesting and then about half-way through it just totally dropped the ball.  I wanted it to just kind of be over with and I constantly found myself skipping over looking for &quot;stuff&quot; to find or abilities to upgrade because I was ready to finish the game by that point.  The abilities themselves were helpful, but you never seem to need all of them, nor do they make the game better or worse.  I think it could have easily done just fine without them.  Trapped inside the development team of Ori and the Blind Forest is a really good game, but its just not here yet, and I&apos;m shocked that so many people bought this game over something like Rayman Origins or Aquaria, since as far as platformers go, you couldn&apos;t go wrong with either of those.  Its a puzzling thing to see so much warmth and positivity over something really quite good, but ultimately coming off as a little full of itself- kind of like the fans of the game throwing it 9&apos;s and 10&apos;s when its really not much better than its older competition.  However, it has no competition this year, at least not yet anyway.  I enjoyed Ori, it was a solid title, but it left me feeling like it could have been much longer, a little bigger, a little darker, and a little less pretentious with its story telling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5122655">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-Graphics and art style that is pretty enough to be one of those artsy fartsy games, the games that are light on gameplay and say &quot;it&apos;s all about the expppeerriiennce,&quot; but not.
<br>-The characters are lovable and the story has serious tear jerking moments.
<br>-A whole list of moves that you gradually learn along your journey: jump, double jump, wall jump, wall climb, and you even have this move where you fling yourself off of your enemy. The level design, array of moves, and intricate ways of using those moves keep the platforming engaging and challenging.
<br>-Did I say challenging? I did! It&apos;s a real hard game. I&apos;m pretty sure I suck at these type of game but I stuck with it and enjoyed and respected this game.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-You have 3 tower escape levels (they are not literally towers, you&apos;re in a forest, but you know what I mean) and they largely revolve around memorizing a sequence of events in order to navigate around them. For instance there was a part where 3/4 of the roof collapsed and the only way you could survive is if you were already in or near the 1/4 side of the room where the roof remained in tact. For a game that is heavily revolved around player precision and skill this seemed a lot more of an arbitrary life or death toss up.
<br>-Save points are manual and they come from a collecting blue orbs (kinda like a mp gauge for save points) but there is rarely a high demand for those blue orbs as they are plentiful enough so you can save near constantly and be fine. It really defeats the purpose of the mechanic.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: More often than not games are either viscerally fun or a great experience. This is a rare instances where a game is both. I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5128261">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Not a fan of platformers, but this one grabbed me within the first 10 minutes, and continued to blow my mind 10 hours later.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5066776">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The games difficulty is medium/hard wise and place it in a nice spot where it is not too hard or too easy. The combat can i see it not the prime focus/ it is lacking a little. But nice story and good platforming which this game does not lack do i value much higher and i atm is growin a little tired of the many FPS and MMO&apos;s that focus on killing eveything.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere is one of the best i&apos;ve seen in years and made me enjoy each second in this game. Hand drawn art from the largest to the smallest detail.
<br>
<br>The music was the best part. Get a nice pair of headphones and let yourself drown in a ocean of symphonic master pieces.
<br>
<br>I do not know how they manage to sell it only at 20 Euro, i would gladly had paid 30-40. The game itself feel so well made and i hope to see more from Moonstudio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5076672">Expand</a></span>

There are many decades old games that are still better platformers than Ori. It&#x2019;s ironic how developers who more than likely grew up playing Castlevania: SOTN and Duck Tales can&#x2019;t create a game that topples their places as some of the best side-scrollers ever. This is tragic since Ori was developed over 5 years by a multinational team. It also shows how stagnant the gaming industry has become. When 20+ year old games are still considered the best in their genres, the future looks a bit glum for gamers.
<br>
<br>At $20, Ori is a diversion. And Microsoft acknowledges this by rightly pricing it well below triple-A games. MS could be testing the waters to see if gamers are willing to part with their fps titles long enough to realize other types of games exist. But there is a more likely reason. Since the developers created Ori as a side project, it had to be a fairly simple and undemanding concept. By today&#x2019;s standards, side-scrollers
<br>are indeed unsophisticated.
<br>
<br>After playing a few hours, I noticed Ori suffers from many of the same flaws seen in the today&#x2019;s bestselling games. First, Ori&#x2019;s mechanics panders to gamers. Players only need to spam a button to attack. Death is hardly inconvenient because players can create spawn points. Objective markers guide players to their destinations. The story isn&#x2019;t bad, but some of the best parts were revealed in the trailer which kinda ruined things. Ori wanted to be the next UP, but the movie didn&#x2019;t reveal its hand in the trailers.
<br>
<br>Second, Ori&#x2019;s emphasis is on visuals. Sure, Ori is pretty. But the platforming component&#x2014;which is supposedly the heart of this game&#x2014;is lackluster. Controlling the teensy creature is challenging enough without having to precisely land it on microscopic surfaces. Even on a 32&#x201D; screen, Ori is tiny. On the whole, the critter performs like a wet eel which results in an inordinate amount of frustration. Excellent visuals are trumped by imprecise controls. But numerous other decisions, such as bland map design and cheap deaths mar what could&#x2019;ve been one of the best gaming experiences in a while.
<br>
<br>Third, difficulty is often contrived. Ori is a die-to-learn type of game. The developers intended for players to die, frequently. Many of these deaths result from Ori&#x2019;s imprecise controls. Other times players have to take leaps of faith because the path forward isn&#x2019;t clear. This happens a lot. And some sequences are just damn frustrating. I&#x2019;ve read complaints by gamers who died 12+ times completing specific sections. Their complaints stem from radical difficulty spikes. Ori&#x2019;s difficulty spikes from a 5 to 15 in certain areas. Some deaths are just cheap since players have absolutely no chance of reacting to invisible traps. Difficulty should increase organically, something the best platformers do right. Cheap deaths are&#x2026;well&#x2026;cheap. And Ori has too many &#x201C;gotcha&#x201D; moments. Even worse, enemies kill Ori in 1 or 2 hits. Ori muddles the distinction between challenging and fun.
<br>
<br>Fourth, Ori suffers from poor level design. Progression is often hindered because hidden traps or overly difficult trial-and-error sequences stump players. Like the original Megaman games, Ori relies too much on memorization at times. And those games are notoriously tough to beat. Backtracking doesn&#x2019;t feel natural as it can be nearly as difficult traversing an area late in the game as it was at the start. That is a bit counterintuitive for this style game. Additionally, obstacles become too recurrent and powerups must be spammed to overcome them. There is nothing subtle about Ori&#x2019;s level design. It&#x2019;s boring and repetitive. I remember when Samus first descended into Brinstar. I&#x2019;ll have no such memories with Ori.
<br>
<br>Last, Ori is short. People reported completing it in 6 or less hours just after release. Players who&#x2019;ve taken longer the complete Ori mentioned their insanely high death counts. I read one player died 436 times. That&#x2019;s ridiculously high. Some of the numbers were high enough to make Dark Souls look easy in comparison. Basically, a decent gamer can complete Ori in 6-7 hours. A less skilled gamer or someone not acclimated to platformers could spend considerably more time. This additional time is attributed to unfair design.
<br>
<br>Underneath its pleasing aesthetics, Ori is an average platformer. It&#x2019;s exemplifies how terrible current games really are when a mundane, but pretty, platformer is given such rave reviews.
<br>
<br>At its core, Ori has very little in common with Super Metroid, a comparison critics keep throwing out there. Super Metroid is a combat orientated platformer with precise controls, distinguished environs, and upgrades that are important, but never overused. Ori is the opposite. It&#x2019;s full of undistinguished locations, slippery controls, and abused upgrades.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5138995">Expand</a></span>

Platforming was difficult at times but the convenient save feature did not make it as frustrating as I thought it might be. Amazing graphics/art style, memorable soundtrack, addicting RPG-upgrade usual castlevania mechanics. Story was a little light but everything else made up for it.</span>

<br>Controls are very fluid, although i recommend using a game pad over keyboard+mouse.
<br>The only minor downside (for some people) is that some sections of game can be quite difficult and therefore frustrating (its not Dark souls but still you will die a lot). But nothing you cant overcome, and satisfaction is great.
<br>Its clearly one of best platformers ever made. A real masterpiece. I recommend this fantastic journey for everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5097586">Expand</a></span>

<br>I do not remember games that could squeeze out of my tears . Tears of sadness , tears of joy , tears of emotion .
<br>
<br>Ori forever remain in the memory of players. I really hope for a continuation of this tale.
<br>
<br>Very painful and hard on what it&apos;s over.</span>

The gameplay and controls are precise, the mechanics are excellently thought out, and the world is stunning. Everything in here was done with an immense amount of care and I cannot wait to see what Moon Studios do next.</span>

I wonder how could they manage to make such an artwork? The Skill Tree is perfectly designed. Without any exaggeration this is the most simple Skill Tree I&apos;ve ever seen and it works perfectly. Soundtrack is fabulous! It keeps pace with Coeur de Pirate&apos;s beautiful work for &quot;Child of Light&quot;. To be frank about the main theme. I don&apos;t know which one is superior but both are exceptional!

The controls feel sleek and refined, the gameplay never gets repetitive (or at least I didn&apos;t think so.) It has a wonderful soundtrack, and pretty good, sweet story. It is definitely worth the mere 20 dollars it&apos;s currently going for. If you like platformers, you can&apos;t go wrong with this one.</span>

As you progress, its getting so hard and irritating so that you can&apos;t see its beauty any more and merely struggle not to chuck the controller to the screen. One small mistake and you have to restart the same long sequence of actions over and over and over and over again - extremely frustrating. I should have read the rewiews before buying the game.</span>

Heavy on style, this game has a very strong visual style to it, with excellent-looking environments and enemies and allies that fit into the style of the world very well.
<br>
<br>Accompanied by Sein, a ball of light which represents the last spark of the Tree Spirit&#x2019;s power, and whose voice is strongly reminiscent of Navi the fairy from Ocarina of Time, Ori is tasked with restoring the wind, water, and fires for the forest to revive the Spirit Tree before the woods die for good.
<br>
<br>The narrative is woven into the gameplay, but while the narration (spoken in a nonsense language, translated to English on-screen) works well enough, only the prologue really blows you away. At twelve minutes long, it is kind of pushing it as far as intro cutscenes go, even if you can technically &#x201C;interact&#x201D; with the environment in meaningless ways, but it does an excellent job of setting the emotional grounds for the rest of the game, even if the character we end up bonding with isn&#x2019;t the one we spend most of the game trying to save (which is rather unfortunate, given that I cared much more about them than I did about the deep-voiced Spirit Tree). Still, it made me want to see more, and while some of the later cutscenes are of reasonable quality, they&#x2019;re just not as good as the story at the start of the game.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay itself, it works great. The controls are tight, the abilities you acquire over the course of the game are mostly used in interesting ways (with one kind of lame exception), and the gameplay brings together all your abilities in natural-feeling ways to make exploring the environment of the game-world a fun and enjoyable experience. The environment are interesting, both visually and technically, and there are a reasonable range of challenges, including offbeat gameplay elements in the first two &#x201C;dungeons&#x201D; in the game, with the third and final dungeon being sort of a recap dungeon that tests your ability to use your abilities to the fullest.
<br>
<br>The overall progression in the game feels mostly natural &#x2013; you get your abilities, and your new abilities allow you to visit new areas. But more, your beating the dungeons actually changes the world environment in significant ways which further your ability to explore. The first dungeon cleanses the water of the world, letting you swim around the environment, while the second produces updrafts of wind in certain areas which allow you to fly using your parachute ability. Both of these follow naturally from the themes of the dungeons, and they both feel like they have real repercussions in the game world, furthering the game&#x2019;s theme of restoring the forest to life.
<br>
<br>The enemies, too, are mostly pretty reasonable, though unfortunately the variety on them does begin to wear thin after a while. The game is about ten hours long, but you encounter all of the enemies in the game before you even reach the final dungeon &#x2013; indeed, you may encounter them all before you even enter the first dungeon, if you go out of your way to explore as much as you can. While they do a pretty good job of exploiting the game mechanics, after a while they do start to feel a little repetitive rather than fresh. Still, the environments tend to be novel enough that this isn&#x2019;t a huge deal.
<br>
<br>The secrets are decently hidden &#x2013; there is no guidebook necessary to find them, as you can unlock the ability to reveal them on your map, or even visually on-screen. Some of them are kind of a bit boring to get back to, involving boring backtracking to just use one new ability somewhere, but some of them are well-hidden at the end of miniature mazes, and those feel rewarding. These secrets unlock more health, energy (used for a couple of your abilities &#x2013; including the ability to create save points anywhere, which can also be used to restore your health somewhat), and improved versions of your basic abilities on your skill tree. There are enough that they feel interesting to find, but not so many that they&#x2019;re onerous to collect; even still, the &#x201C;find all the secrets&#x201D; achievement is a bit dumb, because there are some secrets which are not revealed on your mini-map from unlocking your skill tree.
<br>
<br>This sort of minor design oversight shows up a few times in the game &#x2013; one of the achievements just plain old didn&#x2019;t work for no apparent reason, and none of the dungeons can be revisited in order to collect secrets you missed, which is kind of annoying if you&#x2019;re a completionist type.
<br>
<br>On the whole, Ori and the Blind Forest is a good game, but not a great one. It has some flaws, but its overall quality makes you want to forgive it for them. You generally have fun going through the game, and the platforming challenges feel fresh and challenging. At about ten hours long to get 100% completion, it isn&#x2019;t so long that it wears out its welcome, but isn&#x2019;t so short that you are left wanting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5849443">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My deduction of points for the game is for how hard it is. You guys think Dark Souls is hard. Child&apos;s play. I think I&apos;ve died nearly a 1000 times by now. Now I know this is a fantasy world but let&apos;s imagine it&apos;s a real world and adventure. I mean if we can imagine the game, why can we not imagine the critique? If this little dude went on an adventure to save the tree/forest he&apos;d be dead in 100 steps lol I mean did it really need to be to this level of difficult? I&apos;m usually a very calm gamer but one section had me so frustrated that I thought I was going to spirit flame my cat with my controller. Otherwise, a really brilliant piece of work here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5163140">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m a thirty-year-old, bulky, bald guy yet at many occasions I bursted out in tears like a child during experiencing this miracle. It truly touched my soul and brought back my deepest, subliminal childhood memories and fantasies. Wow, just wow, I never thought that at this point of my life I could re-experience the magic of fairy-tales. I don&apos;t know much about psychology, but this game operates on a very deep, dare I say Jungian level: makes you delve deep into those ancient, archetypical memories, desires and fears that all humans share deep down in their souls and genetic codes.
<br>
<br>This game deserves all the praise as an experience, but it is also an excellent game: a real challenge but not unfair with interesting gameplay. As of now this is my game of the year. Not long I fear since I&apos;m a huge The Witcher fan, but still it is one of the strongest contenders this year. A game which is in my top 10 of all times for sure.
<br>
<br>I will replay this one many times and here&apos;s hoping they will make a sequel for it. I highly recommend Ori and The Blind Forest to anyone. People, don&apos;t miss this one even if you are not platformer fan (I&apos;m not too big on platformers either). This game deserves to be known and expereinced. And here I intentionally use the word &quot;experienced&quot; instead of played.
<br>
<br>I mean I love games like The Witcher, Mass Effect or Dragon Age because they tell interesting stories, introduce unforgettable characters and universes and make me enter the realm of epic, dark and heroic fantasies which let me forget about everyday problems for a short time, but this little gem with its innocence, simplicity and sincerity brings it all to a new level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5185754">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you&apos;re the sort of person who is put off by 2D</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">There is no honest way to put into words how this game makes you feel. It has the visuals, it has the emotion, and it has quite possibly the most intricate and moving soundtrack I have ever heard in a game environment. This game... this *masterpiece* is by far the most rewarding little game I have ever had the pleasure of playing.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re the sort of person who is put off by 2D platformers, or small &apos;indie&apos; games, don&apos;t worry, because I&apos;m the same. But this game... Seriously, buy it.

The graphics are pretty, the music is beautiful, the controls are precise and tight and the story is moving. Even thought this is an artwork out of the ordinary, this game have a few problems.
<br>
<br>The controls for PC (Steam) when you want to use a gamepad, are not possible to customize in game. In order for me to get the controls like they would be on the Xbox 360, I had to use my Logitech Profiler tool (which maps buttons on the gamepad and translate that into a keyboard-keys), and by doing this, the game showed hints in both keyboard and gamepad depending on which button I&apos;ve used last.
<br>
<br>Also the game has bugs where if you get stuck and if you are so unlucky you have saved, the game has to be restarted.
<br>
<br>The last issue with this game is the difficulty curve. The game is fairly easy in most parts, except when you&apos;ve completed one of the main events in the game which fires a sequence where the curve is a bit too steep compared to the rest of the game.
<br>
<br>All in all a really good game, except for the three issues mentioned above.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5107743">Expand</a></span>

If you like platformers, then you&apos;ll like this game. If you like puzzle games, then you&apos;ll enjoy this game. If you like neither of those, then you probably won&apos;t like this game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise, using an XBOX controller, the controls for the most part feel good and responsive. When I did get frustrated with the controls, it was when using the Bash ability that lets you aim your character (Ori) in a direction before firing him off. The XBOX thumb stick felt way too sensitive for this, which made precise aiming very difficult, but I eventually got used to it and gave up trying to make super precise shots (just &quot;good enough&quot; shots instead). The controls might be more precise with a keyboard and mouse, but I never tried them, so I don&apos;t know.
<br>
<br>Also, I mentioned that this game is challenging. YOU WILL DIE, and you&apos;ll die a lot. Some sections of the game lack save points, which can make them super frustrating after you&apos;ve attempted to finish them (and failed) 15 times in a row.
<br>
<br>Besides those two points, the gameplay is fairly enjoyable. There are many different ways to kill enemies, and the game gives you a lot of freedom to be creative and experiment with them. You can reflect projectiles back at enemies, push enemies into spikes, or do a devastating combo attack like Bashing an owl down to the ground, then finishing it off with a ground slam. (Note that this game doesn&apos;t implement a formal combo system, I just used the term combo informally)
<br>
<br>The level design is very creative, with some levels utilizing back-tracking in really interesting and unexpected ways. The levels will really push you as a player to use all of your abilities to the best of your ability.
<br>
<br>The visual aesthetic of this game is BEAUTIFUL. Combined with the great soundtrack, this game really knows how to move you emotionally. It&apos;s almost like playing an interactive Disney movie.
<br>
<br>I was surprised by how relatively quickly I finished the game (11 hours). I suppose that&apos;s normal for a platformer though. There&apos;s actually an achievement for finishing the game in 3 hours.
<br>
<br>So again, if you really like challenging platformers (along with some puzzle solving), then you&apos;ll probably really like Ori and the Blind Forest. But if you don&apos;t enjoy platformers that much, then Ori and the Blind Forest will probably frustrate you to no end, and you&apos;ll probably end up rage quitting (and uninstalling) the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=6109969">Expand</a></span>

From the very moment the game starts its hard not to appreciate just how beautiful the game is. But don&apos;t let that beauty and artistry fool you. Beneath the vivid color pallete and wonderful animation lies a incredibly challenging 2-D platformer.
<br>
<br>Ori is proof that you don&apos;t need a complex story to have a good story. Its story is simple but evocative. Within the first ten minutes of the game you will find your heartstrings being pulled. It also needs to be said that Ori&apos;s soundtrack and audio are superb. From the opening score the music helps to draw you into the world.
<br>
<br>Its quite clear to me that the game drew inspiration from classic NES platformers like Metroid and Kid Icarus. But Ori finds clever new ways to use similar ideas to make it feel like a wholy unique experience. For example in Metroid you often download a map for the area using a map station; or come to areas you can&apos;t access yet. This idea is present in Ori as well but you can only do so after you obtain map fragments. This encourages exploration. And like Metroid you will find areas that are only accessible after you acquire a new ability. In one sequence there are these glowing tubes that propel you off screen only to show up on the opposite side of the screen. This is a mechanic that appeared in Kid Icarus. There are also tubes on the top and bottom of the screen. These &apos;tubes&apos; have force and can send you to your death if you aren&apos;t careful.
<br>
<br>Ori has a surprising level of character progression. You can pick up spheres to gain ability points, or increase your health/magic. These act like Energy tanks or missile expansions in Metroid. The game has save points but you are able to use a bit of your &apos;magic&apos; (blue energy) to create a save point of your own. This also serves to assign ability points to upgrade your abilities. These abilites can range from increased damage, or automatic pickup of health/magic etc.
<br>
<br>Ori is a truly gorgeous game that while perhaps inspired by classic NES platformers; it manages to stand on its own. Like its predecessor&apos;s the game isn&apos;t afraid to challenge you. And when you complete a difficult section its all the more satisfying. This game is worth every penny; and should not be missed. If you enjoyed games like Super Metroid your going to love Ori.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=6112681">Expand</a></span>

It creates all the polished visual spectacle you would associate with a prime Studio Ghibli animation, with a compact and satisfying narrative. The gameplay mechanics are excellent throughout with some novel elements alongside more traditional elements. The character animations are noteworthy within a game that excels in almost every department. My only criticism is, that whilst the game is challenging throughout, offering new skills commensurate to the difficulty, towards the end of the game you are quite hard to kill by regular enemies. This renders them as a subordinate peril to the increasingly dangerous environment. Often just an inconvenience instead of a challenge. That aside, this is the best platform experience I can remember. A wonderful, unexpected, treat of a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5082304">Expand</a></span>

Also the soundtrack will blow you away in certain situations since it just fits so well to the narrative and the entire atmosphere of the game.
<br>
<br>The mechanics with all the Super Metroid like power-ups (e.g. double-jump, wall run, dash through opponents, and many more) are really refreshing and make this game a real challenge to beat at times.
<br>
<br>There is really 0 reason why anyone shouldn&apos;t pick this game up! Go get it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5114781">Expand</a></span>

The music, atmosphere, unbelievably gorgeous visuals, story, even the physics and controls are fantastic! It could be hard at some parts but it wouldn&apos;t be a good game without challenge.</span>

Enemies do respawn, but it takes a few minutes, so it&apos;s definitely not a problem. Not once did I die due to enemies respawning too fast.
<br>I must, however, say that this game is meant to be played with a controller. If you don&apos;t have one, keyboard (which is what I used) is the second best choice. The keyboard+mouse combo is awkward and a big, annoying glowing cursor is on screen all the time.
<br>The game looks and sounds like an animated movie, and watching the trailer alone convinced me to buy it. You can currently get the soundtrack on Steam, and I highly recommend it. If you like beautiful looking games, this one&apos;s just for you.
<br>
<br>Now for the negatives: this is a Metroid type of game, meaning new areas become accessible as you learn new abilities. This is all great, but the game world is quite huge and there seems to be no fast travel system at all. You will obviously be doing a lot of backtracking, and doing so without fast travel is annoying to say the least.
<br>There are also a few areas where you have to run away from water/lava/the antagonist which contain collectibles, but after you successfully complete the sequence the area will remain locked, meaning you have no way of going back and collecting the items. These collectibles just grant extra experience points, though, and aren&apos;t essential to the game.
<br>The gameplay is solid, if a bit frustrating at times. You will be dying a lot, especially in the chase sections, until you master the sequence.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a great game. It&apos;s not flawless, but it comes pretty close. I&apos;d compare it to Rayman Origins: a platformer that looks like a kids&apos; game, but is so challenging even adults will enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5353440">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game goes hands down in my TOP PC or even any console. This game deserves to be in your game library, if it is not done ..

The details are exquisite, and the simple story is compelling and connects you to the characters. At times it hits you in the feels much like a good Disney/Pixar movie might and I think that is what the developers were getting at. Playing to the emotional/nostalgic ties of us 80s/90s kids. Bringing us gameplay that harkens back to Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario Bros. in a modern and action-packed way. The game forces you to dust off your old-school 2D scroller skills with a controller (I think the best way to play this) and leave your mouse and keyboard for a time. This game was super fun and challenging too. If you have a moderately good PC or an XBox, get this game. &#x202A;#&#x200E;classicallytrainedgamer&#x202C;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5365850">Expand</a></span>

The aesthetics of the game are beautiful with many different &apos;themes&apos; as your move around the large map. The game is so gorgeous looking, it&apos;s filled with &apos;wallpaper&apos; quality screens all the time.
<br>The gameplay is very fun and challenging but not to the point (personally) where you feel like raging, it&apos;s just takes some practice but with the fights and traversal being fun, it keeps you going. The controls are perfect in my opinion, there isn&apos;t a single point in this game where you can blame it for getting you injured or killed, if it happens, it&apos;s your fault. There hasn&apos;t been a game from memory as I type this that&apos;s had such fluid control. I would recommend controller for this if you&apos;re going to play on PC.
<br>The music is a bit of everything, it&apos;s emotional, it&apos;s spiritual, it&apos;s tense, it&apos;s calming. I still listen to the OST from it&apos;s release day when I purchased it.
<br>Every character, and enemy you encounter in this game really does feel special and Kuro (the bird), just wow, her design and vibe is just awesome.

<br>I honestly don&apos;t know what else to say about this game for this moment, but I guarantee it&apos;ll be one of the best if not the best gaming experience you&apos;ll have had in a long time. It sounds like I&apos;m really riding this game but that&apos;s because I am, it just wonderful. Please go buy it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5942758">Expand</a></span>

<br>This sensation may accompany you for the rest of the game,  sometime a sequence seem downright impossible, at least for who&apos;s an average gamer like me, without any specific skills in platform like games, but the  story alone push you to try and try again, and if I can do it, I think everybody can get to the end without bashing her head on the wall.
<br>The graphic and the atmosphere is incredible, I got enthralled by the visuals and the music, flowing together into a unique experience, just after the heart-wrenching intro you&apos;ll find yourself pulled into Nibel and it&apos;s spirits, the good and the bad ones, their stories in a roller-coaster of  emotions, I have cried i have smiled and I have exulted at the story that slowly unwrapped in front of me.
<br>
<br>So, may the light of the spirit tree guide you through Nibel , I hope you&apos;ll really feel this game, it was very emotional for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ori-and-the-blind-forest/user-reviews?user_review_id=5428621">Expand</a></span>
