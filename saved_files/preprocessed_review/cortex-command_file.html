No matter how large you make the campaign, I always end up doing the same things for attack and defense. For defense, simply place four AntiAir bots around the map and the enemy will never be able to land. For attacking, drop in a single trooper, dig down underground to the enemy brain&apos;s safe room, dig through the walls, and blam: Game Over, You Win, Please Insert Coin to Play Again.

<br>What&apos;s more, the game has some very inexcusable flaws. First and foremost, I&apos;m told that I can hit Alt + Enter to go to Fullscreen mode. Except I can&apos;t do that. A lot of the game&apos;s art work features units like large two-legged mechs, but they aren&apos;t actually in the game. If the game was eleven years in the making, they must&apos;ve spent ten of those years sitting around trying to think of a witty name.

<br>Over all, I&apos;d recommend waiting a while for the developers to get their act together and pump more assets into the game before you buy it.

<br>The action is fast-paced and exciting, the physics are amazing, and the gameplay is just right.

The 2 hour long campaign is very hit and miss, where as there are also difficulty bumps. What are difficulty bumps? Difficulty bumps are where there is a easy level then the next level is REALLY hard, and afterwards and the next level is REALLY EASY, The tutorial, however can be useful and fun. Mods can be crazy and fun, like for example, There is a mod that gives you ALLOT OF CRAP, that can be fun to screw with! Endless Skirmishes can be fun too, and lets not forget multiplayer  (It&apos;s local ONLY, so a controller MIGHT be recommended). I have heard of some bugs but I never found any. So overall SCREW THE CRITICS THIS GAME IS EPIC, only pay attention to the reviews because of: Bugs? and/or the hit and miss campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3817145">Expand</a></span>

In deed, I&apos;ve never played a game like this before. Unfortunately, Cortex Command feels absolutely unfinished and unclean. Okay, I&apos;ve be warned, this game is not yet finished, but after 11 years development, I&apos;ve expected more. The game control is cumbersome and fuzzy. The AI is  disastrous stupid... is mostly unimaginative and never adapts to the game. The campaign makes fun, if we ignore the stupid AI. It turns out to be a kind of tower defense and action-sidescroller mixture that can be a lot of fun.
<br>The different factions are designed very lovingly and original.
<br>There is also no lack of weapon variety and equipment for the troops.
<br>And I like the grafic. But the low content, much bugs, and the bad game control, detract the good expectations and impression of this unusual game immense.
<br>It hurts when such a good concept after 11 years of development has been so poorly implemented.
<br>There is no consolation too about the many modifications made &#x200B;&#x200B;by long-time fans for Cortex Command. All in all, and with modifications the game has just tied me up for a week, unfortunately.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3038697">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The AI deserves some improvements, but manually switching and controlling your soldiers is part of the gameplay anyways. Overall the game is great for people who like to experiment and are bored from mainstream games.
<br>
<br>Many people complain about the controls, but I got used to that in about one hour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2723453">Expand</a></span>

Besides a barely functional campaign the answer is nothing.  This game can be a lot of fun at times but $20 on steam is a joke.   If you are thinking about purchasing this game I would suggest finding an old demo version first as it will most likely be nearly identical to what you would be buying.  I have given my money to many indie games while they were still in development and this is the only time I have been disappointed with the outcome.  If the developer was as committed to the game as he is to replying to every critic on steam with bs excuses this game could have been finished years ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2766427">Expand</a></span>

Also, there are some annoying flaws, such as units eventually making mistakes and/or finding some way to destroy themselves by accident, but this should be taken in stride, as part of the challenge. Be aware that this is still in development, but has much more potential than anyone seems to have credited it with. Yes, the engine does take a toll, especially when units begin to cluster and collide in an isolated area, but that shouldn&apos;t be an issue, unless for some reason the clustering occurs away from the primary area of interest. I&apos;ve noticed the engine only seems to slow down when units (especially enemies) in a crowd are out of view, and not being dealt with. This is a game for creative users, who like to develop plans to deal with things, and think on their feet. If you can&apos;t do any of those even a little, then sure, don&apos;t buy it. But if strategy is your style, you will absolutely love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2871635">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s somewhat true, but Cortex Command definitely lack the polish Terraria has...
<br>Got to admit I have a love/Hate relationship with this one...
<br>
<br>Hate: Tutorial... Probably one of the few tutorial in my life I managed to fail... It show you what you can do when controlling a robot, then you&apos;re on your own, when the enemy AI sends it&apos;s bots to kill your Brain...
<br>Love: Dropship... So much Robot/weapons/tools/etc... combos you can buy and drop everywhere on the map... Although be careful or the enemy may shoot it down if you try to drop your stuff too close to him...
<br>Hate: AI... It sure don&apos;t know how to hunt enemies or mine gold properly... A few times I lost a robot to a suicide mission (like a bot with a digger gun shot down trying to dig the enemy base) or going beyond the edge of the map (usualy the bottom edge) meaning losing contact...
<br>Love: Same AI... It sure know how to shoot... Seeing a shootout between robots is a blast...
<br>Hate: Because of said AI, you have to control each and every one of your Robots, jumping from one to another all the time... Making a mission far more tedious than it should be... Add to that the slow pace your robots walks... And I challenge you not making Jetpacks your basic movement!...
<br>Love: Miscalculate a jetpack burst and you can end landing head first or even broken...  Or in enemy line of fire... Hate: Robot control... For Robots, they&apos;re surely spineless and difficult to control... Try controlling a robot to climb a ladder that is incomplete or damaged... Or using a jetpack in a narrow corridor...
<br>Love: Robots, when shot, can lose arms (you can&apos;t use weapons) or legs (you can only jetpack to move, no walking) or if damaged badly, health can goes down 1 point per second, until it&apos;s destroyed...
<br>Hate: Campaign and missions are generally a mess... Massacre mission, for example, have no AI in it even if one is selected... You&apos;re alone. A good way to learn to control your robots, building a bunker, buying things, etc... though...
<br>Love: Terrain... One pixel = something &apos;living&apos;... One dirt pixel will fall by gravity, changing the layout of the map... One gold pixel means 1$ if harvested by a digger gun... One cartridge ejected from a gun firing means one pixel you have to climb. And when a turret fires a lot, you&apos;ll have a little mountain of cartridge you&apos;ll have to climb, or clean with a digger gun... etc...
<br>Hate: Some Missions forcing you to have a LoS between your Brain and the sky, making impossible to put your brain deep into your bunker... You&apos;re usually forced to use a walking brain and walk him deep into your bunker... And hope the damn thing will not do stupid things like getting out of it&apos;s safe spot and try killing the enemy by itself or it&apos;s Game Over!... Maybe having the option of locking a door closed should be available... Love: When you win your 1st mission (Dummy Assault, in my case), all the frustration of a long battle seems to fade and satisfaction takes its place... Hate: No save games... So when you start a mission, you have to finish it... And Esc sometimes makes you quit the game entirely, without even a yes/no confirmation... In other word, don&apos;t touch ESC...
<br>
<br>An OK game, overall (when you spent enough time learning how the game works) but serious patching/tweaking needed to reach goodness or even greatness...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2661782">Expand</a></span>

This game disapointed on every front. The interface is un-intuitive and does little to help the player navigate through the many options. The controls feel clunky and take some time to get used to. The AI is... quite simple and unimaginative. It took a couple hours to get the hang of the game and after that, only a couple more hours to figure out an infallible strategy. At that point, I had no interest in playing anymore. On the other hand, the concept of the game is incredible. The amount of work gone into it must have been staggering and the physics engine it&apos;s so proud of is quite fun at times. The different factions are varied enough to make it fun to switch although it might benefit to add some higher tiered units on all factions. Overall, the concept is wonderful but it fails to deliver and create a positive lasting experience. This game seemed to me more like a proof-of-concept that this could be a game someday. Not worth the money or the time the way it is now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2817049">Expand</a></span>

It seemed a bit tricky at first but after a gameplay video on youtube I felt quiet comfortable in Cortex Command. It got robots, disembodied brains walking around in robots, walking turrets, stationary turrets, bunker building and lots of different factions with their own soldiers and weapons. The basics of Cortex Command: For the campaign mode you have a set number of brains from the beginning, human brains which are stored in a glass bowl and these brains controls minions. You must protect these brains at each site, sites which you must control. Until you have gained control of a site you must do your best to protect the brain, for instance dig it deep down in the ground and have it mine gold while down there. The gold you dig out is used for buying more units, these units you must use to defend your brain and attack your opponent(s) brain(s). When you control a site you can then start building a bunker for your brain at that site to protect it. I would like to dive in to building my own bunker complex but until now I have just used the AI to auto build it. The AI usually do a decent job at this. There are also some scenarios which can be played and from what I understand you can find even more scenarios on the net. You can also get custom factions and weapons for the game. As far as I know the developer has made it easy for modders to add content to the game, some of this can be done with the build in editors. To be honest I have been playing campaign mode most of the time and I have not really spend much time exploring other options in the game, apart from a couple of hours with the scenario &quot;Bunker Breach&quot;. It is a fresh and innovative addition to my game library. See a couple of gameplay videos and consider it if this sounds like something that&apos;s down your ally :-)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2916382">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a great game buried in here, with some really interesting mechanics. However, the abundance of rough edges and clunky gameplay makes it difficult to do more than just mess around with the destruction engine for a couple hours and ragequit when you get sick of, for instance, having to go all the way back out to the main menu if you want to restart a scenario.

You&apos;ll do the things it directs and swiftly get murdered by the AI, then wonder why the light soldier you bought lasted longer than your dummy with an AK did. Once past that hurdle(as in, being able to completely destroy the tutorial with ease every single time), the game opens up into something absurdly fun. Dropship parts seeming to purposefully seek out and kill units, units run headlong into single pixels of dirt and kill themselves, explosions knocking guns out of units&apos; hands seem like bugs, but they&apos;re direct products of having every single drawn pixel be a physics-activated object, and often, part of the fun. One can build an impenetrable base, filled with sentries, concrete and metal everywhere, watch the AI send its own dropships into spinning, flaming death, and as you watch the carnage, your brain is murdered by a unit with a digger and nothing else. It seems unfair, but you can always do the same.  Due to the engine being as such, it is completely unfeasible to incorporate networked multiplayer as well as being very hard on low-clockrate CPUs(core count does not matter; it utilises only one core and if said core is not up to it, &quot;tough&quot; says the game). When a unit walks painfully slowly, that is the CPU telling you that it shouldn&apos;t be running this game. 1GHz is definitely the minimum, but you&apos;ll need at least 2.6GHz to have fun on a serious level, 3 for almost no lag at all. Again, core count is irrelevant. So if you can run it, if you can outplay the AI/if you have a couple bros who also by chance know how to play it, it is a spectacular game, well worth its price. All in all, it&apos;s like an RTS that doesn&apos;t suck, made for the man who knows his build and likes chaos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2724752">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It has its moments though. It&apos;s something special shooting out one of the engines from a ship and watching it crash into the soldiers it just dropped off, or having your grenade launcher fly out of your hands after a fragment of your own grenade flies into it. You can&apos;t help but chuckle when your human soldier ends up squishing into the ground after you lose control of his jetpack.
<br>
<br>With a lot of polish and tweaking this would be a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3277536">Expand</a></span>

In addition to its unfinished state and numerous gamebreaking bugs (such as random unit explosions and various screen issues) there are fundamental flaws in the game that will most certainly never be fixed, such as inability to incorporate online multiplayer and an engine that taxes a single core of the processor so badly that as the battles get longer, the game gets slower.

<br>
<br>The game play itself is painfully slow.  I am a patient person, but the speed at which bots move is unbearably slow.  It becomes almost painful to hold down the key/button to make your bot walk all the way across your bunker.  Most of what you do is make the bots walk to where they need to be so this is a real problem. Bot movement is very goofy.  I am still not sure if this was an intentional design choice as you are supposed to remote controlling these bots.  The physics were just off in a lot of situations.  Several of my bots stuck to walls or fell off the edge of the map, never to be seen again.
<br>
<br>I have heard that the developer is still working on the game actively.  If there are improvements made this score could jump higher. But as-is this is not worth $20.  There are so many better indie games out there for a lot less.  I would wait until the developer has made an effort to fix this mess before trying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2657841">Expand</a></span>

<br>To all the people who are complaining about the game lagging or having no online multiplayer - please be aware that the game makes use of complex physics interactions such as particle simulation. Sure the physics engine could have better CPU threading or hardware acceleration but expecting effective online support is ludicrous.

<br>The game is what you make of it, it can only be as good as you let it be. If all you play is Call of Duty and Halo then I am sorry, this just wasn&apos;t made for your of aptitude.

<br>The game has numerous game breaking bugs that can be classified as show stoppers. Given the price of 20$ for this game, this is simply unacceptable.</span>

It even lacks a full screen option, it puts the game in a small little windowed mode, of course when the game pops up it clearly states you can put it in full screen by pressing Alt+Enter. This is hardly a problem, but just goes to show how they didn&apos;t add some simple options. The games controls are difficult to understand, and even after playing hours of the game, you will still get enraged when you press Esc to close the buy menu and you exit the game. The tutorial is very lacking and you will have to result to youtube to learn how to play. Lastly the A.I. is very poor, but in a game like this i see why, so it doesn&apos;t harm the fun I have in this game. For example in the beginning of any campaign almost everyone has at least once flew their drop ship into the enemy brain for an easy victory. There are many ways of defeating the A.I. in a matter of seconds in the start of a match, and if you let him live, winning will be hard, because they spawn units faster than humanly possible. I A.I. will fall into simple holes and take awhile to get out, which the developers have done a very good job of getting around. Now on to the good things. Most of all the bugs don&apos;t really harm how much fun you will have with this game, before i even knew how to play, I had a blast with this game, Just the making a hole, hiding in it, poking your head out, shooting something that explodes and ends up killing you with the debris, just a blast. The game has a very fun combat, and when playing with friends (using the same computer because Online isn&apos;t in the game) is just a blast. If you set up some simple ground rules, like don&apos;t just run your dropship into the other person&apos;s brain on game start, and other small rules, you can have a very fun and competitive time with your friends. This game has a decent modding community behind it, which makes the fun last even longer. This game is pretty complicated with the right click button opening up a menu of sorts that allows you to click many commands that you have to use all the time. These commands range from reloading, the buy menu, dropping and picking up guns, changing which gun you are using, and telling the character you are controlling what to do after you control a different character. This game has an interesting mix of managing your own A.I. and playing a character to defeat the enemy A.I.
<br>All in all, i have had a great time with this game, and if they added Online and made more options to change in the options and made some balancing to the A.I. and how it works, this game would be an easy 10/10
<br>Thanks for reading hit me up anytime through steam if you have any questions/comments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3135589">Expand</a></span>

There is more that they updated but I&apos;m not going to go into all the details about that. The game has really turned itself around.  It&apos;s not that sh*t game where no one plays it anymore. If you like Terraria, shooters, retro games, and a bit of strategy with awesome mod support, This game is for you.</span>

The gameplay is going to feel VERY foreign to anyone who picks it up. The controls will feel clustered and anti-intuitive, but i assure you that it actually isn&apos;t that bad and is quickly picked up. As far as gameplay if you hate 2D games you can stop reading my review right now. But the game is based off of a physics system that basically relates to EVERYTHING. Between movement, projectiles, destruction, and basically everything else; the game doesn&apos;t really relate to damage as much as the physics. Hit a guy in the neck, he bleeds out. Blow off a left leg...a right leg...guy limps, he hops, he crawls, and if you blow off both legs...well hes a legless jet with a gun. And destruction is like minecraft. You chip away at things until it breaks into a bunch of smaller...things/particles. All the damage on the maps stays. So your campaign is very dynamic and fun. The game only lucks AI intelligence...and i mean sometimes its amazing...other times its worse than a game from 1995. Seriously, some gun fights, your troops are ducking and moving to avoid projectiles and using everything they got. Other battles my guys shoot in the wrong direction, jump onto grenades, and/or pull out a digging gun for a gun fight. So with patches and what not, the AI will become better. The campagin is a giant sandbox that you pick up to 4 teams, and then up to 12 gold sites. You fight over these gold sites until everyones &quot;deploys&quot; every brain they have. After every brain is deployed. The game decides who wins by either who has the most sites, or if theres equal amounts of sites owned, who has the most gold. So basically it&apos;s your own story every time. I can say the game is fluent and fun with some bugs and lacking stuff. But theres enough content to keep you going. Mods bring the game to shine even brighter if you dont mind using them. So i give the game a 9. Just one point off for the confused AI(never can decide whether it wants to be a good AI or horrible AI). Give the game a try, it didn&apos;t seem to look good but after playing it i can say it&apos;s great and still improving.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2750655">Expand</a></span>

<br>I gave it a 7 because there are 2 things that practically overpower the bad stuff, First of all, I really enjoy building the bunkers, sometimes I spend an hour building an insane base to just close the game since I don&apos;t feel like fighting and then there&apos;s simply the fact that I had so much fun with the game, there&apos;s so many epic moments that make me smile for the next hour that I just play it for that.
<br>
<br>This is with mods though, game is something else entirely when you add mods, it&apos;s still fun without them though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2784586">Expand</a></span>

The combat is satisfying and the bunker design is interesting for those who like to build things. Although learning how to control the bots without crushing your head on the ceiling and controlling your troops can be frustrating, the game is still very fun. On the contrary to what others say, the game can have a fair amount of re-playability if you take advantage of all the features and try new things.  There is a surprisingly active modding community that creates a large amount of content, from full conversion mods that change movement to faction and weapon packs. In all, I think that this game is easily misunderstood and will not appeal to some people, but others will love it. While the physics and AI could really use improvement, the game is very fun once you get used to it and has its own charm. The graphics style is quite appealing and works very well with the physics and world. I would wholly recommend this game despite its shortcomings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2787653">Expand</a></span>

The game can create so many hours of fun for you and your friends with the 4 player local co-op or vs. Cortex Command is constantly being developed so more content is on the way so patience is key; However as is this game is great despite a few bugs which are to be expected from a game still in development.</span>

If the Dev&apos;s make more content for it and fix the bugs it might be worth the cost. For now, go play something else like Skyrim or something.</span>

<br>There are hundreds of mods, from Half Life 2, Warhammer 40K, Halo: Reach, and Star Wars factions, to campaigns spanning multiple missions. I will agree with the consensus that the vanilla game leaves a lot to be desired. But all the game files and logic are exposed, easily edited to your liking.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t play this seriously, consider it a physics sandbox with elements of Tribes, Men of War, and Worms. Local multiplayer and coop are a blast if you can get some buddies to play too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3299563">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game has been playable on any machine for me. Sure, considering it is designed for single core machines, it is a lot slower than it should be, but multi-core processors were a big thing in the early 2000s or late 1990&apos;s, and weren&apos;t available commercially. When you design an engine, it is really hard to go back and fix it. In fact, to be able to support a multi-core processor, you need to completely redesign the engine. They are a pain to have a program utilize.
<br>
<br>As for gameplay, the metagame gets old really fast, but I find lots of the senario battles are fun, as you can find different ways to solve a problem. The game truly depends on user generated content, but, then again, so do a huge amount of the crap indie games out there.
<br>
<br>I can accept bad graphics in this case, as each pixel can be physics object, therefore, HD gameplay would make the lag worse than it already is.
<br>
<br>As for multiplayer, there was a mod adding multiplayer, but it was not the easiest thing to make, or update. I would
<br>
<br>As for the developer insulting and leaving the community, there are reasons. Justifiable reasons. You treated him as if he was a corporate entity. You expected everything to be fixed on the spot. He made the game to make the game, not to listen to your **** It&apos;s his game after all, your choice if you wanted to buy it. Also, he has a job, and a life.
<br>
<br>The learning curve is a bit like, I dunno, a challenge? The amount of games who are actually hard is incredibly small. Don&apos;t expect to be able to pickup and play like COD, this is a RTS, not some silly run around shooting people and swearing over the internet. (Ok, maybe it is silly.)
<br>
<br>I would say play it before you buy it. If you like it, you can then buy it, and fool around. If you can&apos;t figure it out, you didn&apos;t waste any money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3914129">Expand</a></span>

If this had been an early access or beta participation title before it launched the reviews would have been amazing. Now that the studio has returned to the project and the mod support is more unified I thoroughly recommend it t anyone looking for a mad 2d multiplayer strategy game.</span>

<br>
<br>The interfaces are easy to orientate, the possibility of multiplayer through the use of multiple controls, such as keyboards also appealed to me as alot of the time i like to vs my friends in these games. The let down was the non inclusion of online multiplayer which i believe would of enhanced the experience and would have been an instant hit in the gaming industry, as bots become a little predictable and easy to beat after time and overall boring once you have completed the campaign of the game. The game became a game in which i would start up occasionly to enjoy the unique and awesome gameplay.
<br>
<br>Overall this game is worth the price or even to try the demo if you are skeptical of the title, if its not your taste then you are not going to have a good exsperiance but if its the art style and indie style in which you enjoy, you will be in for a treat. The Games art style is brilliant and ultimately love the graphic detail in which was put into it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=5094254">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For example you can fill a drop ship full of Napalm bombs to bomb out your enemy, even though it may lag out the game and crash.
<br>
<br>There are many modes that you can play and download from the workshop, such as Dummy Brain vs Brain. In Brain vs Brain you need to defend your brain as well as attack the opposing team and get through to destroy their brain to win the game.
<br>
<br>And I have to say, it&apos;s not easy. No matter what difficulty you choose, you can still lose. Even if you use a pretty OP faction, the AI can still mow you down as if they were a wrecking ball and you were a wall.
<br>
<br>What I really love about the game is that there is a TON of mods on the Steam workshops that you can download and use in game. For example; you can download more factions for more weapons, actors and ships. What also cool is that you can make your own base/scene which you can use in battle against opponents.
<br>
<br>What I also like is setting your actors certain tasks to do, like activating Brain Hunt AI mode, Gold dig and patrol. You could also form a squad of soldiers to go and destroy the enemy brain or just patrol.
<br>
<br>I have never seen any other game use this sort of idea before, as I haven&apos;t seen features like these, in a game, before.
<br>
<br>Off topic: Seriously IGN? You gave it a 5.0/10? That is just rediculous, it took like some-what almost ten years to develop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cortex-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=6879729">Expand</a></span>
