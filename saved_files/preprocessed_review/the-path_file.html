That being said, there is a sizable laundry list of points that show lack of polish, and a few design choices that will leave you upset: After all, with a bit more interactivity, never mind great moments in video gaming, you could be looking at life-defining moments. But as it is, &quot;The Path&quot; take the first few awkward, stumbling steps towards a revolution, and it deserves a serious round of applause for this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-path/user-reviews?user_review_id=423110">Expand</a></span>

This is not a FUN thing to play. It is not a shoot em up romp through a dark forest killing zombies and aliens. No --- this is a modernization of the age old fairy tale. Bringing the truth of these tales to a modern format. This is the realization of old into new. What this &quot;game&quot; is --- is a telling of a fairy tale without the happy little ending most people have converted them to. The true fairy tales before they were exploited by the hug a tree generations. You do not just get involved with the characters in this story --- you fall in love with them. Their nuances that you learn through their interactions with things in the world around them. Their personalities. Their loves and hates. You learn these things if you only have the patience (as most don&apos;t) to really play this through. You realize that these are not just a bunch of EMO-Goth girls as most people think --- but each with a different personality befitting their age range. It shows you the complete opposite of what one person said of this game: &quot;This game shows that you can only succeed by leaving the path in life&quot; --- no --- this is showing that yes, indeed, you have to leave the path to &quot;succeed&quot; in this game --- but that success is only so you can learn that one is best suited to the path. Just as the ancient fairy tales have always told. They are shock stories meant to keep kids &quot;in line&quot; and &quot;on the path&quot; and this is exactly what this &quot;game&quot; has come to do. So if you are going to rate it --- rate it based on that. So --- in that aspect, I give it a 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-path/user-reviews?user_review_id=424415">Expand</a></span>

There is no clear message or story, the focus of this game is on surreal imagery and emotion. I would describe the mood of this game as creepy yet beautiful.

I wondered around slowly in the forest for a while, picking up objects for no reason that I could discern, found locations triggering events that didn&apos;t make much sense.  I understand from other reviews that there&apos;s likely a story here, but nothing compelled me to keep playing beyond my first couple of tries.  Normally I like world exploration, but this was not rewarding.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m glad I played through it a couple of times in effort to understand what folks were saying about the game, but I just found it slow and unengaging.

The Path, however, just didn&apos;t do much for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-path/user-reviews?user_review_id=5768109">Expand</a></span>

Clearly, a misunderstood gem, this software goes beyond gaming and turns into art as soon as you realize that your actions are a consequence of decisions very similar to those one would take in a real situation. Curiosity, ability to awe and imagination are a requirement to unlock the full potential of this art piece that demands a user interaction in order to achieve its narrative goal. Granted, graphics are not bleeding edge and controls could be slightly better, but the heavy aesthetic and psychological value are priceless, and beyond anything else has attempted before. While Amnesia: The Dark Descent keeps the prize as Best Horror game, The Path secures a solid second place thanks to very dark, macabre and disturbing content... which is almost in its entirety imagined by you. There&apos;s where its genius resides. If you get bored, well, most likely you&apos;re the type of person that gets bored in museums as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-path/user-reviews?user_review_id=1706148">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It doesnt keep you into the game, after walking for half hour you will get extremely bored. There is nothing artistic about this game. With weird sound(Chains etc.) they try to create a horror scene with some macabre scenery.

While there certainly are some horror aspects to the software, it isn&apos;t a game in the traditional sense of the word. It&apos;s more like a toy, or interactive fiction. All games either have a goal, or something to work towards, this software does not. You will definitely be disappointed if you purchased this expecting a game. Once I understood that I was looking at an art piece, and not a game, it was better, but still far from good. The controls are intentionally bad, I understand the developers were trying to make a point with this, but bad controls never make anything more fun. Speaking of fun, &apos;The Path&apos; never makes any effort to be fun in any way. Sometimes it tries (and fails) to be playful, there are some moments of horror, but a large majority of the time it&apos;s just watching a slow (even when running) girl getting lost in the woods.

<br>
<br>The Path is a mystery that needs to be unraveled. As you explore, you find more things and learn more about each of the girls, and you may bump into the &quot;wolf&quot;. For each of the girls, meeting the wolf is a life-changing experience.
<br>
<br>The game is a very interesting mystery and an engaging metaphor, but when held to the normal standards for a video game, The Path is severely lacking. The controls are completely awful. The aesthetic is nice, but the actual graphic quality is pretty poor. The sound is odd, which is fitting for this game. The gameplay is slow. Really, really slow. You&apos;ll need a lot of patience.
<br>
<br>The game description on Steam should be taken seriously. This game is not for children.

<br>The Path is definitely not for everyone. Pick it up if an arthouse title with difficult metaphors interests you, but if you&apos;re looking for a fun game, this is not it. $10 is probably a bit much; wait for it to go on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-path/user-reviews?user_review_id=3255907">Expand</a></span>

Your character walks slowly, and when you attempt to run the camera gets positioned at an inconvenient angle, as if punishing you. This game makes an impression that it was done not for the players (who actually paid for the game) but for the devs themselves. Guys, it&apos;s not painting where you make some picture, put it up in an exhibition and wait for a rich guy to come and buy it. This is entertainment software. If it doesn&apos;t entertain, don&apos;t call it a game. Yes, the game is notable as a message in the lines of &quot;we wanted to do it different&quot; and I get this message, but the product itself is not playable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-path/user-reviews?user_review_id=3128199">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not what some would consider a &quot;game&quot;, but more of a story shrouded by symbolism and is incredibly artsy. If you hate games that are almost purely story driven and more of an experience, then you might want to look elsewhere.
<br>
<br>For a person like me, The Path is just the type of thing I love. Not only is there dark and mature themes, but the symbolism is absolutely brilliant if you notice them. I also enjoyed the &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; theme the game had going for it. After replaying a few times and discussing the story with others, I realized the game is actually very open for a lot of interpretation. More so than I anticipated. The ideas that many have come up with have only enriched the experience for me.
<br>
<br>Basically, you have several sisters, each very different from each other, and their goal is to get to grandmothers house to deliver some goods. The rule is to not stray from the path, but it has to be broken in order for the girls to encounter the wolf. If you do not want to be spoiled or have my opinion on the wolves and their interpretation with each girl, please skip the next paragraph.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, each girl represents a stage of life. The wolves are an experience that one must go through to grow up. These experiences may be harmful or scarring, but like in the game, the girls get up, wounded, and make their way back to grandma&apos;s house. The whole story is about growing up. Letting your curiosity getting the better of you, getting wounded, but growing up a little. The path is a safe life without exploration. There is no harm, but neither do you learn anything. That is why you get a failure screen when you do not encounter the wolf.
<br>
<br>As for it&apos;s length, if you just buzz through the main task at hand, it is very short and you also miss a lot of added story. Each girl has items and unlockables. There is also 144 &quot;flower coins&quot; to collect if you so chose. In my opinion, the replay value only lasts as long as there is something that you missed, which just to note that the forest is randomly generated each time so finding everything will be a challenge if you switch girls or start over. Unless you are the type that enjoys resetting the game and starting fresh repeatedly, you probably will complete the game once and rarely touch it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-path/user-reviews?user_review_id=3891895">Expand</a></span>
