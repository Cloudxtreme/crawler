The drawback is that it&apos;s not very &quot;newbie friendly.&quot; New players will often be wondering what the hell is going on and how they play. After a day I have learned a lot of things, but not nearly everything. I think it will take about a week before I am a real asset to squads. The Certification system is quite good and allows for a bit of customization. Not everyone has the same guns, and not everyone can do everything. In fact, most people at the moment can only do 1 thing (hacking, repairing, flying, etc.) That will soon change though. If you are not good at First Person Shooters and are looking for a game where that doesn&apos;t really matter, stay away. Even though there are &quot;levels&quot; and skills, your hand-eye coordination still counts for a bunch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside/user-reviews?user_review_id=368749">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Man, Planetside is a fantastic game and i whole heartedly recommend it to fans of the classics BF1942 and CS. Imagine a Futuristc BF1942 on a global scale 24/7, thats Pside. I,ve read comments about the cost but i think its quite resonable. The game cheaper than most and the cost per month is the same as about a couple of magazines. I gave this a 9 as i&apos;m sure it will only get better.</span>

I am Battle Rank 14.5 (out of 20) and I am Command Rank 1 (CR goes 0-5, 1 not being hard to get).  This game is only getting better.  The lag has gotten a lot better, but is not completely gone.  Right now they are making some much needed patches (the server is down for it) so that the balance is better and plus some fun things like outfit decals are being fixed.  If you read their plans for the next 2 weeks to the next few months, they have a lot of big, and good, ideas.  I encourage everyone who has bought it to try it out for the next month while it&apos;s free.  The cost is very reasonable because other games charge the same thing!  Respawn times are being taken down, new vehicles are being added.  If you are having a bad time in this game, but you can imagine where it would be fun, get in an outfit!  Get in an outfit of people that you like and work together.  I am part of one and we play together every night, often making up 5+ members of the squad of 10 or less.  We all work together and know what we are doing, each person having specific kills.  We level fast and are deadly.  Nothing is more enjoyable than capturing a base after a 30 minute non-stop firefight.  It&apos;s crazy fun.  Some people won&apos;t like it, not everyone should like any game.  It&apos;s not for everyone, but if you can CONCIEVE an idea where it might be fun then it will be if you work for your goal.  Like I said, it&apos;s only getting better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside/user-reviews?user_review_id=53069">Expand</a></span>

Mr. zero there obviously has an axe to grind or he wouldn&apos;t be trying to constantly skew the results of this score. For me, the game has been a great find. A game with some character persistancy and massive battles to boot. I enjoy being able to get on the same server and play with the same people each evening. Almost nightly, I will be involved in a battle with 100-150+ people. It is unlike anything you&apos;ve experienced to this point. Some may not like it and for that I say each to his own, but for me I&apos;d recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside/user-reviews?user_review_id=367912">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only thing I dislike about the gameplay are the caverns. There are barely any people there, but you need to kill people in them in order to unlock several types of weaponry. Plus you can&apos;t use vehicles in them.
<br>
<br>So the gameplay is greay overall. My real qualm with the game is the bugginess. In fact, I can barely play it on my new PC. It freezes after about 10 minutes and I need to reboot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside/user-reviews?user_review_id=81621">Expand</a></span>

I outright feel he is totally wrong. He cites the $50 purchase fee as more then adequate to fund not only all the developmental costs but also the upkeep and maintenance of the servers as well as the game code itself. Of course, this is ludicrous. You think $50 is an outrageous price for a PC game? I think not, considering as far as I can remember games have always gone for the hallmark $50, I find it impressive that even with inflation and the expanding piracy markets that they haven&apos;t raised that unofficial standard price yet. As for the monthly charge, it goes towards covering the costs of maintaining a PERSISTENT game world. Your money funds the servers the game resides on as well as pays the coders who are constantly working on new patches to both enhance and keep the game world moving. To be blatantly honest, I do not think your proposed advertising method of revenue would be profitable. For starters, people hate the pop-up ads you compare it to. In fact, how many of you actually click on any of that pop-up ad crap? I would say slim to none. People hate the imbedded ads. When I play a game, I want to play the game, I don&apos;t want to be bombarded with 300 &quot;special offers&quot; or whatever. I could take this rant on and on, but basically I wanted to make the point that despite your good grammar and format and all that jazz, your point is rather ill-thought and your so-called boycott is just dumb. You want the best of both worlds - for free. I&apos;ve got news for you, you will never get it. Sure you have online games that are free, but they lack any kind of cohesive persistent world. That is what you pay for, and it will never be free because of the associated ongoing costs. That being said, I&apos;d like to make the next point that THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO POST RANTS ABOUT SUBSCRIPTION BASED GAMING. The point of this board is to rate the game based on what it is, not to fault it for what you feel the industry should be. Your ranking of 1 should be dismissed and your comments stricken. Basically, go somewhere else unless you plan to actually review the game.........</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside/user-reviews?user_review_id=367440">Expand</a></span>

Nothing feels quite like driving a tank with a gunner in voice communications (you will need access to a voice comms client to get the most out of this game) choosing targets and avoiding enemy fire. The net code is seriously flawed, the game has several unfixed bugs and exploits,  the learning curve can be fiendishly hard and some aspects of the game are just incredibly dull. However most of the core online community are back in this game on the news of Planetside Next, so if you&apos;ve never experienced Planetside, now is not a bad time to see it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside/user-reviews?user_review_id=1491709">Expand</a></span>

I have no doubt that PlanteSide is an impressive game. However, the idea of paying $50 for a video game and then having to pay an additional $13 a month to be able to play the game is ridiculous to me. I realize that SOE offers the first month of service for free. However, after that first month the game is rendered useless unless the consumer chooses to enroll in a month by month subscription fee. I don&apos;t pretend to be a financial expert or a CEO of some big company. However, I would still like to ask the question: is &quot;the cost of bandwidth, server maintenance, continuous feature improvements and content updates, as well as customer support&quot; so much that SOE cannot absorb these costs through the already exaggerated purchasing price of the game ($50)? If not, how in the world did all of SOE&apos;s predecessors afford to produce similar games to this one for the past five or more years without the subscription fee? I know gaming companies such as SOE are attempting to justify this kind of subscription service to that of cable services, telephone services, and the like. However -- again realizing that I am not an expert but making the assertion anyway -- this kind of comparison is completely false considering that there is no way that support for a single game such as PlanetSide requires the kind of hardware to setup a nationwide cable service or telephone service. I have yet to see employees of SOE in my neighborhood burying underground cable or in my home installing cable boxes. Nor should SOE and the like attempt to compare such gaming services to that of online services such as AOL or MSN. There is no comparison between an online service encompassing universal need and ever expanding use versus a limited use game that will be out of date within two or thee months. To make that comparison would require lowering the games purchasing price to that of the first month subscription (i.e. $13 or free for the first 1400 or more hours of use as AOL does) and then offer free expansion packs every time computer performance and online service increases. In an attempt to keep this posting from being nothing more then trivial complaining, I would like to offer what I see as a viable solution to the monthly subscription service charged to the consumers. The solution is found by looking at all of the other free online services throughout the internet. Visit any site on the internet and one of the first things to pop-up is an advertisement from some sponsor supporting the cite. Again, I am not aware of the legality or the technical difficulties in implementing something similar in the content of an MMORPG, but I am almost certain that it can be done. Hollywood does it all time in the production of their movies. What is keeping the makers of MMORPG&apos;s from enlisting the help of sponsors to help pay for the aforementioned monthly company costs instead of placing the burden on consumers who already paid for an overpriced game? Companies such as SOE could simply put sponsors on a monthly subscription fee and then place adds for each sponsor throughout the MMORPG environment. I&apos;m sure my idea is oversimplified, but I can almost guarantee that the solution would be much more popular than the current practice. I personally hope that some company does implement this or some other solution and puts all of these other MMORPG monthly subscription services out of business. To help speed along the process, I recommend that people cease the purchase of such games as these until a change is made. Thank you for your time.

Therefore, I went ahead and bought the game to give it a fair chance.  I&apos;ll admit I was wrong about one thing.  THIS IS NOT AN IMPRESSIVE GAME.  Trust me on this.  It comes no where near the game play of say a game like BF1942.  Assuming that you are not fighting a never ending battle with constant patch downloads, considerable choppy game play no matter how good a system you own, and ever too frequent game lock-ups, your remaining game play encompasses repetitive battle sequences where no one ever really wins and your supposed role-playing character never really improves.  When it comes to the environment, my suggestion to add advertisement adds might actually spice up the rather mundane world in which the only thing that really ever changes might be a different style of tree or fern here and there.  Anyway, this game really isn&apos;t worth another rant on my part.  There are plenty of other users who have a lot worse things to say about this game on &quot;PlanetSides?&quot; own website.  However, you&apos;ll have to check steadily and frequently because any bad press on the site has a tendency to get deleted within a day or two after being posted.  I stick with my original rating of 1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside/user-reviews?user_review_id=86416">Expand</a></span>
