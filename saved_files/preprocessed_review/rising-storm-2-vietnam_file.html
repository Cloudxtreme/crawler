It will remind you of BFBC: Vietnam and Battlefield: Vietnam but in hardcore mode. The music, the gun sounds, the yelling, captures how the Vietnam war must have been, the game play is incredible. It shows how much time and testing was put into this game too,  the maps are perfectly balanced, the game play is immersive, your adrenaline will be pumping during each round. The guns do a realistic amount of damage; you&apos;ll be dropped off in the jungle by helicopter, looking for Charlie. Out of nowhere an ambush will light up the tree line with gunfire, dropping GI&apos;s like flies. Just when you feel like the enemy has the upper hand, a napalm strike will clear the battlefield and a epic battle ensues, my hands are still shaking from the last round I played. The price is right, there&apos;s no pay to play, it&apos;s the best FPS I&apos;ve played in a very long time 10/10. See you in the jungle boys. I love the smell of napalm in the morning...smells like....Victory...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm-2-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=7332438">Expand</a></span>

If they can fix the fps drops across large distances and sort out why everyone has 100ms pings it will easily be my go to shooter. I am not even interested now in CODWW2 or Battlefield or Titanfall which i had on my list against this one. It is simply the best 64player shooter out there at the minute.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm-2-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=7333653">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game looks great and runs well.  Haven&apos;t had any performance issues but I well exceed the minimum specs.  Sound effects are really good.  Gameplay is very similar to past Red Orchestra games.  Teams are broken up into squads with an squad leader who can help players respawn closer to the front lines.  Maps revolve around assaulting key points in order or a conquest style mode similar to the Battlefield series.  Players select a role or class that determines the weapons and gear available to them.  VC roles can lay traps, place tunnels for closer respawns, and conceal themselves from the map and recon planes by hiding in foliage.  US roles have flamethrowers, close air support and transport helicopters, and the usual FPS fare.
<br>
<br>Like previous RO games, each team has a commander who can use radios to call in artillery and air strikes, recon planes, and for the US, an aerial gunship that can orbit the map and rain down chaingun fire on a designated area.  To counter, VC commanders can activate anti-air to shoot these assets down.  Squad leaders must place markers on the map for commanders to call in some of these assets.  A radioman class can allow commanders to be closer to the front by providing a portable radio.  In my experience in public games, commanders rarely utilize radiomen when available and instead sit at the back of the line glued to the radio.  Even using voice comms to encourage commanders to utilize my portable radio, I wasn&apos;t able to get them to budge.  Your mileage may vary.
<br>
<br>All that said, there is a degree of teamwork required to do well in Rising Storm 2.  SL&apos;s must place markers and commanders must call in assets at the right time.  Friendly players must also watch the map for asset markers to avoid dying from friendly air support or artillery.  As a result, some people may find frustration in public games when teams lack cohesion or players just don&apos;t want to coordinate.  Don&apos;t let that discourage you as you can still me an effective player in your role even when others aren&apos;t pulling through.
<br>
<br>One minor issue I ran into was frequently getting stuck in level geometry or hitting obstacles that seemed like I should be able to simply walk over but required vaulting with space bar.  It&apos;s very frustrating sprinting to cover under fire and then dying because my character hit a tiny slope or a small step that stopped his movement.
<br>
<br>Any fan of Red Orchestra or the first Rising Storm should buy this.  Any fan of Battlefield who laments the recent direction of the franchise should buy this.  Rising Storm 2 Vietnam is a nice balance between the hyper-realism of games like Squad or ARMA and the more action oriented FPS games like Battlefield.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm-2-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=7365880">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In the first day of September I was scrolling trough the Steam Store and found out that RS2 : Vietnam was on &quot;Free Weekend&quot; and I was very hyped. I downloaded it and start playing it immediately , the first hour wasn&#xB4;t that good at all because my internet was bad and I killed my mates so many times because I couldn&#xB4;t recognise the models.
<br>
<br>After some hours played I got better and didn&#xB4;t TeamKill often and I even made 8 kills alone to capture B (Then my mates came and we captured it).
<br>
<br>The more I played the game the more I would enjoy it.
<br>
<br>In my opinion it&#xB4;s not the best game and it needs some improvements such as the models recognising for &quot;newbies&quot; and maybe some official servers for skill-based lobbies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm-2-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=7490220">Expand</a></span>

Rising storm 2 is a bit more tactical than say BF1 but if you want tactical gameplay there are much better options available (Squad, Arma). Movement is clunky/stiff and you get stuck in hidden barriers at times. When I played I got the feeling that the maps are to small for the rifle mechanics, if that makes sense, I dunno. Some one said this game is balanced, it is not. As you might expect the balance is shifted towards the US.US rifles are easier to aim with (m16 VS AKs), air support is op, Americans are harder to spot in jungle areas (Gis are green NV are light brown against a jungle/green background) among other things. However, the sounds is where this game shines tho, bombardments, explosions and rifle fire (both distant and close) sound **** awesome! All that said, if you liked BF2:BC/vietnam or BF1 you will likely enjoy this. For 25$/250kr/25Eur you can do much worse, it&apos;s good for a few hours of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm-2-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=7339254">Expand</a></span>

Get killed by Napalm that extinguished 15 seconds prior. Get killed by shotguns that have better range than AKs and M16s. Get cooked with Flamethrower that kills you from utterly ridiculous ranges and it matters not if you are behind a wall or inside a room.

To be honest Red Orchestra 2 almost felt unplayable for me most of the time since i have pretty high standards regarding net code. Graphics are also very nice for an indie game, much better then Insurgency, Day of Infamy and Verdun. I use to play Battlefield 1 maxed out and when i switch to Rising Storm 2 i don&apos;t think &apos;damn dat ugly graphics&apos; like in a lot of other low budget games.
<br>It&apos;s actually pretty balanced now too, it&apos;s just a bit asymmetrical. (as you would expect a semi-realistic Vietnam-setting game) When playing as Vietcong,  you just have to use your environement to your advantage, for example climb up the pipes on buildings, use tunnels to flank the enemy, (only Vietnamese Forces can use their primary weapons when in tunnels) set traps and deploy spawn tunnels purposefully, their weapons aren&apos;t bad at all and in one of the recent patches the AK recoil has been reduced quite noticeably, use it in semi-auto mode for higher accuracy. Also there are plenty of Anti Air weapons, so helicopters are not OP at all, as some people who haven&apos;t played the game for more than a few hours claim. Also when playing as a commander on vietnamese side, you have some very useful abilities such as AA missiles and Recon (uncovers all enemys that are not concealed on the entire map as long as you stay near a radio station)
<br>
<br>Keep in Mind the low price of the game, so at the moment the game is lacking content, but more maps, weapons and factions (can i has Stoner 63 plz) are already announced. Probably there&apos;s also some more open maps with ground vehicles coming.
<br>
<br>So for the low price i definetly recommend Rising Storm 2 Vietnam for players who liked the predecessors or any of the other games mentioned in this review or multiplayer shooters in general where you are meant to communicate with your teammates. However if you are expecting run&apos;n&apos;gun gameplay like Call of Duty, then avoid like the plague.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm-2-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=7471747">Expand</a></span>

<br>Movement is a bit clunky, as in the previous games. You do get stuck behind small objects way too often.
<br>Hit registration has some issues, some objects look like they should be easy to penetrate, but somehow stop 10 AK rounds. Sometimes your bullets hit an object or the ground in front of you, while the object is not visible in your iron sights.
<br>Territory mode is still fun if you have a good team. This is a game where you don&apos;t want to be on the losing side though. Not sure why they made a new mode that is basically Conquest from Battlefield, but a lot worse. Territory is where the game shines, but unfortunately there are only 3 maps that support 64 players.
<br>The gun selection is small, but it serves its purpose.
<br>
<br>I have always loved games by Tripwire in the past, but this one definitely feels sub par.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm-2-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=7364614">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only drawbacks are some encounters of player toxicity, team killers, commanders who don&apos;t do their job, and the Vietcong having advantages on many maps, and their weapons outclassing the US by a decent notch.
<br>
<br>The M16 and M14 are great guns but have very poor iron sights with terrible field of view, while the AK and SKS sights are much nicer.
<br>
<br>The M60 and the Flamethrower are an awesome advantage for the US, the M60 is overall better than the RPD/RPK, and the flamethrower if used correctly, can clean house.
<br>
<br>The IZH double Barrel hunting shotgun and the PPSH are respectively better than the trench gun and grease gun. The trench gun has more rounds, but the IZH has less spread, more stopping power, more range and faster movement speed. The PPSH is a little less accurate and has less range, but the ammo capacity and the firing speed and damage far surpasses the grease gun&apos;s, not to mention the sight on the grease gun is like trying to look through a tin can with a hole poked through it.
<br>
<br>Snipers are snipers, not much to change, they all pretty much one shot, have the same range and negligible differences in accuracy. However, on certain maps, the US snipers get a silencer on certain rifles, which dampens noise and has no muzzle flash or smoke, allowing you to hide more safely. This is a definite advantage for the US.
<br>
<br>Grenade launcher vs RPG. Enough said.
<br>
<br>As the RPG class you can have a rifle and an RPG whilst only being able to have the grenade launcher and a pistol on the grenadier class. Overall, explosion radius is not great, you basically use one grenade per one to two kills, and it is decent for suppression. The RPG only has 2-3 rockets, but fires with pinpoint accuracy and has a much bigger explosion radius, easily clearing trenches and houses with a single well placed rocket.
<br>
<br>Overall, your victory will be heavily reliant on your teamwork, strategy and the cunning of your squad leaders and commander. Never blame one person for the loss, even though a **** commander can easily lose the game for you so don&apos;t be afraid to give constructive criticism on how he can do better. If you don&apos;t know how he can do better, or don&apos;t think you can do better yourself, don&apos;t complain, it&apos;s that simple.
<br>
<br>Have fun fellas</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm-2-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=7559968">Expand</a></span>
