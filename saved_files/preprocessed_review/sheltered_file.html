<br>I like the art style graphics personally, but it screams out indie game, and there&apos;s not a great deal of sound impact.
<br>
<br>If there were different levels of commitment on Sheltered, it would probably feel more playable.  However, it feels pedantic on detail.  Literally everything feels like it needs micro-managing and whilst in some titles this can be a benefit, here it really does feel like a chore.  Crafting seems illogical at times and it becomes frustrating more than enjoyable pretty fast.  Enemies can be really frustrating also.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t recommend this over it&apos;s influences.  Fallout Shelter feels more polished and as an app, it works really well, whilst This War of Mine feels like the more weighty game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sheltered/user-reviews?user_review_id=6193867">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps it was a virus set to destroy the world, or maybe another zombie outbreak. In many games it was just hunger that had to be survived. In this case we must again survive after a nuclear apocalypse by fighting away all of the harm that the new, twisted world provides. Sheltered is initially quite fun. The first couple of hours of the game are spent explaining systems, exploring, and helping this family and their dog survive the harsh new reality...but all of the fun very quickly dies off and it becomes repetitive and uninteresting once you&#x2019;ve spent quite a bit of time with it. Graphically, Sheltered is just boring. The characters lack personality. Everything is rendered in an old school style that doesn&#x2019;t interest me. While the style works and it well put together for the game, it didn&#x2019;t draw me in at all. On an audio level, I believe this game is excellent. The sound effects and the creepy mood music really set the tone to create a great atmosphere, but the systems in the game are a chore.
<br>I feel more than any other survival type game you micromanage constantly to the point that unless you really enjoy micromanaging, the joy is just taken away and turned into a chore. In my opinion, video games are meant to be fun, not full of chores. While I understand that in the real apocalypse life would be pretty mundane and you&#x2019;d need a strong discipline to survive, it just doesn&#x2019;t translate well to a fun video game. Although the atmosphere and music are eerie and exciting, there are just simply better &#x201C;Shelter&#x201D; experiences out there. You cannot help but compare this game to Fallout Shelter or perhaps This War of Mine which harnesses much more charm and in the case of Fallout Shelter, more joy for the player than this game can.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sheltered/user-reviews?user_review_id=6411067">Expand</a></span>

Sometimes you&apos;ll get lucky, sometimes you won&apos;t, and it seems like the game keeps chugging along regardless, like with rain occurring coincidentally every X days. Most of the time you&apos;ll just be watching boring things happen, like an extremely lengthy repair of an oxygen filter, or extremely long and mundane combat. One interesting pro is the ability to character create children (which are often missing in survival games), but ultimately they don&apos;t matter too much to the gameplay or story. There are many better survival / personal base management sims out there, skip this if you haven&apos;t tried any others yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sheltered/user-reviews?user_review_id=6309386">Expand</a></span>

It gets pretty boring more or less after you&apos;ve learnt how to play it.
<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>- its gameplay is generally like in This War of Mine and others mentioned above: you manage a group of survivors, build and craft stuff, go out with small groups to explore and scavenge nearby locations, barter and fight
<br>- the music is fine
<br>- characters have stats, 1 perk and 1 disadvantage each, characters train in missions or from special crafted objects
<br>
<br>The So-so:
<br>- pixelated graphics. Some will say it&apos;s ugly but I found it fine. There is even a decent selection of characters&apos; appearances, e.g. haircuts, and each haircut is made from ~25 brown pixels.
<br>- despite the somewhat too 80s-like graphics, it still has some post-apocalyptic atmosphere, though the characters feel pretty anonymous (no biographies, no clear portraits, just stats)
<br>- characters can be transferred to partial AI&apos;s control, and they will attempt to fulfill their needs by themselves (like in Sims), but they don&apos;t do that well, and they won&apos;t guess to repair things. So, e.g. if your shower breaks down, they will stand around it with &quot;shower&quot; bubble above their heads instead of repairing it.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>- poor controls. The game would need a panel with characters&apos; portraits, a-la Jagged Alliance 2 or Baldur&apos;s Gate. Clicking on characters in the game world to select them isn&apos;t always precise enough and instead gives movement order to another character you had previously selected
<br>- multiple design errors. E.g. if you are out of water, you can&apos;t go out to get any water (sending scavengers costs water), and all you can do is simply wait for rain and watch your characters get angry from thirst. Or: the tool to recycle useless items needs lvl 4 workbench, and you will only get that late in the game. Meaning that you will stockpile garbage items for most of the game to finally recycle them when you are swimming in mats anyway. The freezer for meat you get much later than you can make a trap to catch animals (which gives meat). Or: loot in sectors restocks pretty fast, so there is no real need to go too far or explore the world at all; you can just circle around the few nearest points of interest almost daily, gathering loot until you build everything
<br>- tons of micromanagement because the equipment breaks very fast and you need to repair it. You can&apos;t queue more than 2 orders (in Sims 1 you could queue at least 10 orders), and you can&apos;t make a production queue at the workbench, so you will need to craft every sack of cement and every gas mask individually
<br>- clumsy and too simplistic combat, with ugly graphics and unclear rules (a small girl with strength 1 does roughly the same melee damage as a bear?)
<br>
<br>Judging by the sheer number of features the game has and the complexity of the simulation, I see that the authors wanted to make it all realistic, atmospheric and interesting. However, it all doesn&apos;t really work well and results mostly in a tedious routine. Probably they haven&apos;t tested the game much. When I think of it, even Rebuild, a flash game about fighting off zombies and capturing sectors was more fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sheltered/user-reviews?user_review_id=6394424">Expand</a></span>

<br>There is a large assortment of items obtainable in the game, along with a plethora of craftables. The loot is RNG, what traders have is RNG and that is a good thing. You have to craft stuff to gain more from expeditions, in order to craft more stuff... Except any challenge this game presents can end very early on. Survival becomes incredibly easy and fights from the start can be incredibly easy with the right pet (RIP bears).
<br>
<br>For some reason, during encounters on expeditions, the game seems to randomly select 1 of the 2 characters to interact - meaning you basically want 2 characters with all high stats. If my high charisma character is not engaging in conversation with a stranger, then it just doesn&apos;t make sense since I cannot choose so.
<br>
<br>Despite a character joining my shelter and having no stress, within a few real-time minutes they said they were too stressed out and leaving, so they set fire to something. This bizarre occurrence made me not want new characters because I was doing just fine and you cannot take the auto-mode off them (their loyalty needs time to increase). Yes, they consume your precious resources... unless you manually set them tasks.
<br>
<br>Gas masks. Your characters will get radiation poisoning if you don&apos;t equip them with gas masks for expeditions, but each of these requires 2 plastic, meaning if you run out of plastic, you are stuck to broadcasting for traders and the game is pretty boring with no ongoing expeditions. This wouldn&apos;t be a big problem if you didn&apos;t need a lot of plastic to build certain items... Such as the recycling machine. And when you do make it and start recycling... It tells you to wait 30+ real-time minutes. When you spent over two hours just waiting to make this and get told that, it&apos;s pretty ****
<br>
<br>The game does some things right, but even after 40 days, I still wasn&apos;t getting attacked and didn&apos;t need to build any defences in my shelter... If all these things I listed were fixed then maybe I would play longer but it barely holds your attention and quickly gets repetitive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sheltered/user-reviews?user_review_id=6903799">Expand</a></span>
