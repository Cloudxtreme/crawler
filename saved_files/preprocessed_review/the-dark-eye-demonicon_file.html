                                        <span>&quot;Demonicon is a game with a lot of heart. Built on a solid well balanced combat system, the creators crafted a compelling narrative filled with interesting characters. The technical aspects do mar the vision, but the strength of the narrative and gameplay rise above these problems.&quot; -http://www.twinfinite.net-  Can&apos;t say it better.</span>

The game does feel a little rushed at times though as I get noticeable texture load lag on sudden camera angle changes epically in the cut scenes even running an oc&apos;d I72600k with  dual 7950&apos;s. That said though the story is this games main selling point, it is well paced with interesting characters and is deficiently worth a look for somebody who wants a good yarn. The gameplay on normal difficulty is a little on the easy side though so hardcore masochists may want to look elsewhere.
<br>
<br>Basically barring a slight lack of polish this is a very good game and hopefully the texture problems will be sorted out with a patch</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-dark-eye-demonicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3670779">Expand</a></span>

<br>Things I didn&apos;t like is the whole &quot;Look&quot; of the game, which doesn&apos;t fit the atmospheric Dark Eye universe. It just fails to hit that tone. Also the whole story and presentation cannot compete with todays standards. It&apos;s sad because this game has potential, but the developers made the wrong decisions and quite frankly I think that they lack a serious portion of talent. Sorry to say that, but the things that are wrong with this game cannot just simply be explained with the usual &quot;Sorry, we ran out of money&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-dark-eye-demonicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3679144">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay feels like Dragon Age light-and-slow. It&apos;s called an &apos;action RPG&apos;, but the combat animations are way too slow to make me feel any action.
<br>The whole interface looks exactly like the &apos;Game of Thrones&apos;-RPG... only without the &apos;save game&apos; option.
<br>
<br>Also I&apos;ve got a problem with the resolution adaption. I play on 1920x1080, which is not that unusual, is it?
<br>The ingame graphics are okay (means: I didn&apos;t expect more), but when I need to read something in the inventory, the text is really blurry, which makes me a little dizzy.
<br>
<br>The story... well... maybe I&apos;ll find my way into it but I&apos;m not that hooked at the moment.

Schnitzel, Emmanuel Kant, Wagner&apos;s Ring Cycle, Albrecht Durer, Octoberfest, the contributions of the German culture are significant. The Dark Eye: Demonicon  however, makes one fact abundantly clear: German RPGs are insane. And I don&apos;t mean quirky or bogged down by nuances of culture which fail to translate, but full blown bat  straight jacket crazy. I am speaking of the narrative itself, a storyline which consists of a steady stream of atrocities, delivered in narration and dialog which fluctuates between hilarious and horrendous. I am not going to warn you of spoilers, because nothing I could say could conceivably spoil this game further. A short list of the classy content you will be exposed to: incest (multiple counts), necrophilia prostitution, Cannibalism, orphan mutilation, burning children alive, using a woman as rape bait to distract a man you are framing for heretical crimes (who you&apos;ve never met), and a demonic tree beneath which hookers leave their infants to be tortured by a nightmare demon because it keeps them quiet. I&apos;m not making any of that  up.
<br>In Demonicon, an RPG, you play a set character. You do not create or customize your characters appearance, choose a class, or roll for stats. You are Cairon, Demonicon&apos;s Commander Shepard inspired all-purpose, almost hero.The game starts by letting you know two things: Your sister is missing in a dark mountain dungeon and you want to have sex with your sister. Your only choice is how MUCH you want to have sex with your sister., and whether you act on this impulse. Thirty seconds in and the game is slapping you with incest. That is the kind of game Demonicon is. When most games are trying to teach you to use your dodge skill and attack by killing some rats, this game is forcing you to mentally recover from the very clear fact that you want to bone your sibling. The combat by the by, is painfully paced, and stutters and staggers in the graphic engine equivalent of epilepsy.  This freak out also occurs when detecting traps, and let me assure you it is not my PC, as I have been running Battlefield 4 on Ultra high settings with no stutter whatsoever. Demonicon is not ugly, but it looks like it came out circa 2006 in terms of texture and lighting, and contains embarrassingly rough set pieces and completely static skies. And if a game is sufficiently  ambitious in scope, I can forgive a lack of polish, but this is not the case. There are four locations in the game, none of which are very large: the town of Warrunk, the swamp, the mountain caves and an end game temple. None of the areas are very large, and the game feels incredibly small and confining, exacerbated by the fact that you retread the same maps multiple times, facing exactly the same enemies (I think there are about a dozen enemy types, and I may be over shooting).
<br>The skills and combat tree system are interesting, interesting enough that I finished an otherwise almost unplayable game. I am earnestly interested in The Dark Eye as an RPG system, and curious what a Skyrim or Neverwinter Nights style game set in its world would be like. Demonicon is tragically lacking in ambition, and comes across as weak storytelling, poorly executed graphics and a clunky combat system. There are shining moments of amusement when Cairon&apos;s voice actor says exactly what you are thinking, expressing incredulity, disgust and bemusement at the world around him, but whether or not that warrants playing a game this riddled with failures is up to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-dark-eye-demonicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3776302">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Expecting something akin to Drakensang starting this game was like getting a punch in the face.
<br>
<br>The UI is laughable compared to that of the Drakensang games. Whereas the game itself scales to any resolution, the UI is really low res. Gone are the nice, efficient inventory system of Drakensang, and instead we get the typical list inventory obligatory for any multi platform game (consoles, apparently, can not render grids). Being able to save manually is obviously not supported, as consoles don&apos;t support this either.
<br>
<br>The RPG system has been dumbed down pretty much across the board, and you have less of everything in terms of skills, abilities, spells and item stats.
<br>The combat and overall gameplay has been dumbed down as well, but to be honest I didn&apos;t play it very long so maybe it picks up after a while...
<br>
<br>The graphics are on par with Drakensang at best, but since this was released 4 years later that is not very impressive.
<br>
<br>To summarize, I don&apos;t know why they bothered with a PC version at all. They actually did include more than a dozen video options, but that seems to be the only change they made for the PC version aside from reassigning the keys. With all the brilliant RPG&apos;s available on PC I simply don&apos;t see why anyone would get this game, unless they sink to my level of incompetency and buy it without reading the reviews.
<br>
<br>On a console this game might be a decent effort, and I am sure it compares more favorably to the games available there, but if you are a PC gamer I would much rather get the old Drakensang games, or one of the decent new RPG&apos;s like Witcher 2 or Skyrim.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-dark-eye-demonicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3670210">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dont get me wrong. The game is not that bad at all, but it is never worth over 15 dolars. Save your money till there is a good sale at steam.

It reminds me of NwN2 in a lot of ways, with most of the content feeling as though it was rushed in at the last minute: dialog that doesn&apos;t seem stitched together properly, odd decision trees that don&apos;t seem to make sense half the time,  Gothic 1 style animations, a story that has potential but falls woefully short, and way too much back tracking reminiscent of DA2.
<br>
<br>All in all the game was disappointing. I can live with dated graphics/mechanics, but where an indie game needs to shine is the story line. Demonicon had the framework for a solid, distracting rpg, but failed to follow through.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re desperate for any semblance of an RPG like experience, give it a shot when it hits for 80% off. Otherwise, don&apos;t bother. Go back and play the Piranha Bytes games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-dark-eye-demonicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3684181">Expand</a></span>

I did notice a fairly high amount of graphical glitches, but I still kept playing. I did get really annoyed by the main character you played as on multiple occasions because he just always seemed to be so mad. I was also annoyed how the game kept pushing the brother-sister romance on you and the only way to deny her was to be a jerk, and even then the game still seemed to think you loved her. One other think that annoyed me was how your sister looked like she has plastic surgery and wore tons and tons of make-up, yet they&apos;re in a world with plague, demons, and death. The choices in the games were medicore and they rarely made it hard to decide out of the TWO choices (and the choices were usually something like Jerk or Super Jerk).  Anyway, besides the ton of annoyances I had with the characters and story, I was impressed a bit by the fighting. It wasn&apos;t completely mindless clicking, although I was annoyed by the slow down every time on a special attack. Anyway, the ending of the game was... okay. I did like how they finally recognized that I wasn&apos;t interested in the sister, but sadly I had to be mean and cold (as she said) just to turn her down.  I could go on and on about the annoyances, but I&apos;ll end my review here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-dark-eye-demonicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3714834">Expand</a></span>

It seems sluggish (at first) but it&apos;s intentional as it gives the player time to decide to dodge/cast a spell/throw a dagger. It&apos;s not a hack and slash and more chess-like with what move to make next. The story is dark and the first few themes/quests set the tone for a grim experience. The game is also FULLY voice acted and the English actors are excellent. The skill(s) tree has depth and I keep questioning my point allocation for future events. There is much to consider when leveling up. The game could do with a bit more optimising as I felt the FPS in the city/towns needs tightening up. Apart from that, I&apos;m really enjoying Demonicon. If I were to grade it, I&apos;d say 7.5 out of 10 if comparing it to other, similar polished RPG&apos;s (rounded up to an 8). I look forward to completing the game and the sequel(s).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-dark-eye-demonicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797618">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Still i enjoy the game very much and have almost reached the end  without getting bored so far. Atmosphere and story are good. The voice acting is everywhere, and most of it is done rather well. Once i got used to combat i found it much more tactical than usual hack-and-slash style fighting. At least on hard mode you have to time attacks/skills/dogding/healing to survive. The nice selection of non-combat skills is fun and usefull but not game changing/breaking. Your decisions and dialogue choices actually impact the storyline.
<br>

You have to play at least  2 chapters to like this... however  this game certainly has its own hare of glitches  but over all this was certainly a smooth and enjoyable ride...The story is the most strongest part of this game...graphics, game play,sound all deserve average 7 mark and story should get a solid 10.</span>

There are a fair amount of twists and the story tends to stay fairly interesting throughout. There&apos;s a lot of choice and consequence throughout, though the ending is a let down in this aspect.
<br>
<br>It uses The Dark Eye rule system (like Drakensang and Blackguards) which tends to make character progression and building quite fun and rewarding. There&apos;s a handful of normal stats and skills and you get rewarded for making potions, opening locks, identifying lore, collecting plants etc.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s an ARPG due to the action combat, which I hate, by it&apos;s far from the worst implementation I&apos;ve ever played. I never found combat to be overly clunky or difficult and the story was good enough for me to push through to the end. I did find that spell points to use for improving spells being rewarded based on spell usage during a fight to be a nice feature.
<br>
<br>There are some annoyances worth mentioning though. Demonicon does seem like a budget title (though with very solid writing). It isn&apos;t a long game, taking me about 10 hours to complete the entire game plus all the side quests I could find. Levels are fairly railroady and there&apos;s limited exploration (think Dragon Age 2). There&apos;s also a limited number of game areas and one dungeon gets reused 4 times for different quests. There&apos;s also semi limited itemization (this is no Baldur&apos;s Gate, but a fry cry from say Of Orcs and Men). It also uses an auto save feature rather than save anywhere which can be quite annoying.
<br>
<br>Overall I enjoyed most of the experience and would pick up another RPG by the developer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-dark-eye-demonicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=5185487">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well, the combat was extremely weird.. didn&apos;t feel good at all. Slow, sluggish and wasn&apos;t particularly well made at all. Enemies seemed rather dull and sluggish as well, as they seemed to wait for your attacks to finish before they tried anything sinister so unless you missed the combat rhythm, you can practically slay an army of dumbly idle and waiting foes.
<br>
<br>The animations are so bad that it&apos;s almost comical.. the PC is stiff, rigid and awkward while &quot;exploring&quot; and while it is slightly better during combat it wasn&apos;t particularly impressive there either.
<br>
<br>If you are really starved on action RPG&apos;s you might wanna give this one a chance but I&apos;d rather spend quality time with a bad friend than trying to carve some enjoyment out of this mess.
<br>
<br>The story is OK so if the combat wasn&apos;t so extremely poorly made, I&apos;d suffer through everything else just to see it through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-dark-eye-demonicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3879953">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are okay. The general plot is not bad but underdeveloped. The voice acting is not exactly top notch. All in all just fro that, there are much better games out there that would score higher and this game wouldn&apos;t be worth more than $10.
<br>
<br>However, I am extremely sorry that I bought it at all because it is a sick and disturbing game. Incest as a romantic option?!? Sick. Having an option that is basically 1- kill evil murdering guy but condemn people to horrific death or 2- save people from horrific death and let evil murdering guy go to start his evil and murder again, is just plain madness. This game is a desperate attempt to be edgy and mystical dark in a genre of lots of games trying so painfully hard to do the &apos;every choice counts&apos; thing. The problem is it is just evil and twisted and to use a word &apos;immoral&apos;. I wish I had not bought it and I think the writer needs to have a mental assessment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-dark-eye-demonicon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4242798">Expand</a></span>
