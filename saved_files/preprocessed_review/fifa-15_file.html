This game is so **** easy and so **** fast as well and as a result, this game offers no &apos;reality&apos;, no &apos;football&apos;! If you have always been a FIFA fan, don&apos;t buy this game. You will definitely get disappointed. What happens if you buy? Let me tell you. Every time you play, you&apos;ll laugh and laugh more, get burst, then laugh again and again, and start to bewail with tears the money you spent to this game after a few minutes when you regain consciousness. This may end up with a broken Logitech gamepad.

<br>I play career mode and have done on all football games since I started back in the 90s.  Cant be bothered with online, people &quot;disconnecting&quot; and all of the **** that comes with other humans.
<br>
<br>Trouble is, they have forgotten so much:
<br>
<br>International breaks for example havent been taken into account for lower leagues, so when your players are off and you cant muster 18, you have to forfeit the match.
<br>
<br>GTN is still crap and unpredictable, you cant scout in any meaningful way.
<br>
<br>You cant save formations to switch to in game any more.
<br>
<br>Players develop either ridiculously quickly or not at all.
<br>
<br>You get sacked for not gaining double promotions after being promoted previous season.
<br>
<br>Budgets are still independent of league, so you take Barnet to the prem you&apos;ll have a hefty 600k to spend on players.
<br>
<br>End of the day it all adds up and makes the mode unplayable, and therefore for me, the game completely useless.  Do EA listen? No.  They dont even bother monitoring their own forums.  Avoid this game if you enjoy career mode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4568052">Expand</a></span>

However, thats where the postives end. There are innumerable problems with the gameplay.
<br>Firstly, AI defence is unreal. Like well and truly, no matter who you are playing against and who you are playing as, if you&apos;re playing against the computer in World Class or higher it is almost impossible to get past ANY of their players, not only the defenders. The AI literally makes 90%+ of their tackles, which I wouldn&apos;t have a problem with if your team AI did the same, but it doesn&apos;t. Whenever your defending its like 11 against 1. The only person doing any actually defending most of the time is whoever you are controlling. Secondly, scoring is absurdly difficult. Not only have they made goalkeepers MUCH better (again no problems, much more realistic now, but just like the defending your goalkeeper always is worse than the AI, even if they have better stats) they have also made shooting much more inaccurate. I can&apos;t even count the amount of times that I have had 1v1 shots with the keeper using players like messi and ronaldo go wide, while the same shots could have easily scored in Fifa 14. Thirdly, passing is just stupid. Atlteast a quarter to a fifth of passes go completely astray, in the wrong direction or to the wrong person. You could be trying to play a ground through ball and move the joystick completely left, and the player makes a square pass to the nearest opposing defender, and this is a regular occurrence. Also, if you aren&apos;t in control of your players, regardless of whether your defending or attacking, they just stand around high workrate or low workrate. Again, I can&apos;t count the amount of times a defender has just let an attacker take a huge touch right in front of them and run right past, while the AI defender would make a perfect tackle against even the best touch, and so many times have I shot a cross or low ball into the box to have my attackers watch it roll past them.

<br>TL;DR Don&apos;t buy this game, it basically unfinished and ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4559366">Expand</a></span>

Goalkeepers are either impenetrable or useless as a teammate nothing in between. headers are completely nerfed on any difficulty except beginner and amateur difficulty. scripting still exists in the form of attribute boosts based on a so called emotional reaction during the match. overall very frustrating on any setting other than semi- pro or below Professional difficulty being tolerable yet displays too much mental handicapping of teammates to be consistent or enjoyable. don&apos;t buy this game or at least give Pro Evolution a look before you decide.
<br>making the opponent super strong and invulnerable for short periods, survive the untouchable period and you may survive the match.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4613138">Expand</a></span>

<br>Goalkeepers are oily, the defence phase is utterly broken (you can score from the kick off or after you concede a goal, by mean of only two dribblings, and in general the AI in defense is firm and does not follow the action with criterion ). Playing against the CPU is terrible because the flawed AI. In addition, each opponent plays the same way: Real Madrid or Sassuolo.
<br>The new technology gol/not gol does not work.
<br>Handballs are not implemented, but the options provide thems.
<br>Results from other matches are not implemented well (often do not start altogether) in career.
<br>The Career is copy/past from FIFA 13 and 14: EA did no work for a whole year, once again.
<br>The game pace is too fast at normal speed, fast al slow speed. You can choose a lesser pace by using the sliders, but the AI responsiveness becomes even worse.
<br>The interludes during the game are too many and often you can not skip them.
<br>And so on...
<br>In this state the game is excellent as a basket arcade game. Footbaal is another thing.
<br>I hope EA comes out with a serious patch and not the usual cloud of smoke.
<br>I do not recommend the game to football fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4615257">Expand</a></span>

<br>In the vastly popular game mode &apos;Ultimate Team&apos;, you can now loan players to play a set number of matches. All of the English Premier League teams stadiums are officially licensed and in-game - what does this mean? The real name of the stadium is displayed before kickoff and the surroundings slightly resemble that of the real stadium. Brazilian League is not included but the Turkish league returns. The gameplay, simply hasn&apos;t changed, neither has manager mode (single player).
<br>I have included information on the previous game via a link because it is my belief that there has been little to no changes in gameplay or modes, so I would be repeating myself,
<br>
<br>Positives
<br>With the progression of technology and the release of new video game consoles, graphics must keep improving. That being said, the graphics don&apos;t necessarily improve in FIFA, its more accurate to say that the more prominent a player becomes in the real world, the better the likeness in-game (Antonio Valencia has looked like the same default, generic black guy since 2009) so the addition of more &apos;likeness&apos; is always welcome. Thanks to this years game and download updates, players play for there current teams. Of course, you could always spend 20 minutes and just manually transfer the players yourself on your old copy of FIFA - but who would waste time doing that when you can just spend another 50? All teams wear this seasons fashion! Sporting the teams recent logos and sponsors with minimal pattern changes.
<br>
<br>Negatives
<br>_Where to start?_ The Price - From Origin, EA&apos;s very own download manager, the source of this game if you will - Standard Edition - for a PC Download - a digital version only - &#xA3;49.99... Fifty quid for a game that was copied and pasted from last years rendition, that was made in one year with no testing, that will continue to charge you for using the &apos;best&apos; it has to offer via Ultimate Team... Granted, you can find it for &#xA3;40 on other retail websites, for PHYSICAL COPIES - but how mind boggling is it that the developer/publisher of a game tries to flog a VIRTUAL COPY for &#xA3;10 more?! Then theres the &apos;Ultimate&apos; Edition which is the staggering &#xA3;59.99! And for what? 40 FUT Gold Packs, a friendlies only All-Star Team, borrowing Messi&apos;s overrated self for FUT LOAN ONLY Player, a worthless adidas Boot Bundle, pointless Historic Kit and probable unlockable Goal Celebrations, wow, just wow. As usual, don&apos;t get me started on the soundtrack: the older games may have had the odd surprise song but now it&apos;s a smorgasbord of complete awfulness. Add to that, all of the previous 5 games faults and you get a rough idea of the quality of this game.
<br>
<br>A Few Examples
<br>One need only glimpse online or at a television to be bombarded with the soulless advertising of an overrated and unimproved game series. Social networking lends a hand too: but not boasting the superiority of said &#xA3;60 hoik. Before FIFA 15 was even released, the game was getting the full on hate of a country when the _brains_ at EA decided to lower the overall rating of national football hero, Tim Cahill. Cahill, famous for previously wearing the scummy blue of Everton and captaining the national team, is without a doubt, the most popular and well known Australian footballer. So when his stock plummeted, making him drop out of the top 50, FIFTY, players in the MLS... the complaints rolled in sharpish. With this kind of shoddy programming, how can they please anyone let alone everyone, when the &apos;skill&apos; of players is rated in such a knee-jerk way?
<br>
<br>Comical goals are always being uploaded from FIFA games, that&apos;s why there is the ability to save replays - however, I doubt this was intended for highlighting the frailties, glitches and down right cheating of a game system. Barely 2 days into its tenure, no.15 told every gamer what we already knew - the game still has the dreaded &apos;momentum engine&apos;. Leaked coding from 2010 confirmed everyones suspicions, that the game had a built in directive that effectively &apos;boosted&apos; the points of AI controlled players to force a goal. Evidence of this is in a slightly hilarious but equally painful, goal replay (indicated by the tag of &apos;Just conceded a f***ing front flip goal... 90th min bulls***&apos;) - Basically the opposition attacker falls over the human controlled, rushing goalkeeper, performs a front flip, heels the balls towards goal mid-air, towards a defender on the line, whose clearance only scrapes the ball into the goal. Just google the title and hit the very first link under news to see what I&apos;m talking about..
<br>
<br>Why do I bother?
<br>It&apos;s &#xA3;30 on Kinguin, for one. I&apos;d never pay the extortionate prices EA claim. But I do love football. Especially from the managers chair. I don&apos;t care for spending vast amounts of REAL money on VIRTUAL players and playing against children or people I don&apos;t know. So the Single-Player mode is what I look forward to, alongside the camaraderie that brings with friends and LOCAL multiplayer. I don&apos;t want these games to be bad..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4647035">Expand</a></span>

If you liked how bull crap of a simulation FIFA series was then this is for you if not, it&apos;s all the same non-realistic frustrating experience. Graphics improved, but no where near stunning. The only positive thing about this game is it&apos;s not bad if you decide to play offline against AI. Against legendary difficulty, it was difficult at first but I worked it out and was quite fun and rewarding. The nightmare begins when you play online. I&apos;m about Division 1 - 2 level player. Online play exposes how crap this is as a football simulation. Players once again have no &quot;context&quot; awareness. When an attacker is coming to take a leg off one of your players, he just casually tries to do his own thing without a care in the world. When dispossessed, it takes about a second for him to realise the situation and can never catch up with players like Ronaldo, Bale even though they have a ball to carry and need to control it all the way through. Goal keepers come out when they shouldn&apos;t and don&apos;t grab the ball when you tell them to, presenting unrealistic goals that you never see on TV. They messed up passing system so that a player worth 80m Euros can&apos;t pass the ball but inexplicably put it on the path of the likes of Ronaldo, Bale and other opposing superstars where they will sprint and score. Take Xavi for instance, he&apos;s small not so physical and not fast. In real life, what makes Xavi good is his vision, ability to keep the ball, awareness of his surroundings and his positioning. In this game, although the stats say 88, he&apos;s a total failure. slow, small, weak, inexplicably gives away possession, miss the simplest passes, inexplicably pass it to the wrong choice and get dispossessed. If you had 10 Ronaldos on your team, this would be invincible and this shows what a crap football game FIFA is. No one can catch up with Ronaldo, he&apos;s excellent in dribbling (in real life, you hardly see him pass any world class defenders), never can hassel him with shoulder to shoulder. This just sounds like someone trying to make him score because they couldn&apos;t represent him correctly.
<br>
<br>You basically have to play in the bull crap way EA has devised and it&apos;s not a football game you&apos;re playing if you do. Scoring goals for instance. I realised this version, they made it easier to score when you shoot as the keeper is moving out. When he&apos;s not off his line, even though you have a perfect one on one and in real life you&apos;ll be hard pressed to find any professional player missing the chance, the keeper saves it. I wanted to play a &quot;football&quot; game because I like football. I realised this is not a &quot;football&quot; game. Not online anyway. I&apos;m just gonna play offline from now on and wont&apos; buy it anymore, I&apos;ll just pirate it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4640746">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t make my mistake, DON&apos;T BUY this if you want to play online.

Defending is almost impossible since all defenders stay as plonkers. Poor realism. Flustrating. Ball hits score too often from distance. No strategic mind needed for winning.

<br>In my opinion, this is the worst FIFA game ever made. I am really curious about how Electronic Arts test their games. It has no physics, game-play, reality and so on. Subjectively, the first thing I look for in games is physics and I suppose, EA developers do not know what is momentum and classic mechanics. Every player passes like Gerrard or Messi (even defenders). If EA wants to make arcade game lovers happy, they are on the right way. But, I wouldn&apos;t pay even 1 cent for this ridiculous game. There is no manual match search which means you have to face lob pass to Aubameyang every single game. I am not going to pay for FIFA 16 if these absurdity remain.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=5102152">Expand</a></span>

But that is not saying much, the intro is still far from perfect.
<br>
<br>Now to the backbone of the review - the Cons. In overall the game sucks. I&apos;m so tired of this rubbish dirt year after year after year. Majority of the game modes have not been updated since Fifa 13, main focus of the game is Ultimate Team. Why? Because $60 is not enough for EA and they want to milk their customers like a cow all year long forcing them to buy Fifa Points for packs. Ultimate Team itself is a dirty place, online in general is dirty, everyone will try to exploit the game through tons of glitches which are never patched and abuse the game with pacewhoring. Speaking of the latter, all you need in this game to win is speed. Pacey player with zero shot will stomp over a slow player with %100 shooting. Pace, pace, pace. Ever heard of the guy called Ibarbo? Well, in Fifa he&apos;s better than the legends such as Gerrard because Ibarbo can outrun the entire defense. Doesn&apos;t help that the defending is stiff and atrocious, you force your defenders into pressuring the opponents and they just run past the ball like kids! EA even forces you to use their horrendous Tactical Defending in online matches to make things worse. You send your defender to get the ball and he just stands there joggling, GO GET THE BALL!!!! Meanwhile you can&apos;t pass the AI defenders without being forced to use 50 dribbling combinations which is this game&apos;s second main problem after pace abuse. How many times do you see real world class players use skill moves in a soccer match? Will be lucky to see 1 huh, but in Fifa games it&apos;s all about a freaking dribbling and skill moves. And you&apos;re forced to learn all this stuff because without dribbling your strikers can&apos;t pass the defenders for sh*t (if they are not 90 pace of course). So yeah, hours after hours in practice mode learning 4 start button combinations. Did I pay $60 to have fun or to f**cking learn and memorize like a math class of some sort?! Give me a break. The old players are useless in career mode, legends such as Gudjohnsen and Ferdinand are getting schooled by the youth reserve because EA wrecks their pace and balance stats to non-playable. Just because they are over 30... Anyways I can go on all day about why this game is bad but I&apos;m sure you&apos;re not gonna read that much. Thanks for paying attention all the way up to this point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=5060630">Expand</a></span>

<br>For me there is no incentive to play this game.
<br>The only reason why this game is still played, the Bundesliga are licenses. But you may Easy patch in PES and also use online</span>

                                        <span>Honestly, fraud by EA. Netcode sucks so hard, i think about bringing free 56k modems to my steam-machine-powered-dial-up-modem-laggers of opponents from Somewherebeyondhoriziston. AI sucks on GKs. Just use RB/R1 to score 100% within the zone. AAAAAAND: It is all about speed. Take a fast player and learn use LT/L2 randomly -&gt; proof non-existance of defense.
<br>It is, sure enough, FIFA after all.</span>

Improving on the graphics and changes interface.
<br>Still better than Pro Evolution Soccer so far.</span>

<br>So, firstly about FUT. FUT is sh*t. Just basicaly pay to win sh*t. I&apos;ve reported numerous bugs on EA forums, mainly about persons disconnecting after conceding the goal in the end of the match which leads to match not being scored, you getting nothing and wasting 15 minutes of your life for nothing, except playing scripted ****
<br>Next problem is EA support for this game. As I said, I&apos;ve reported several bugs and sent (!!!) solution to those problems, BUT NO GODDAMN REACTION FROM THEIR SIDE. But yeah, they get money for FIFA points, stupid people pay even more than 50 dollars for this game just cause of addiction to this scripted gameplay.
<br>And about gameplay-I&apos;ve participated in some tournaments and understood, what you can beat everyone without passing, using skills, etc by players like Walcott, Sanchez, Balotelli because they are OP. Many players in this game are OP as hell. But players like Xavi, Iniesta, Modric are useless. Because  Americans don&apos;t know anything about football. Neither do Canadians.
<br>Pro clubs: &apos;nuff said, bots are useless piece of crap, they can&apos;t do nothing except scoring in your own goal. I&apos;ve played 200 games in Pro clubs. Won&apos;t play this game anymore. It&apos;s enough for me.
<br>310, don&apos;t buy FIFA 15 or FIFA 16, nothing will change, they just want your money</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=5123514">Expand</a></span>

Gotta say this year it stooped to a new low. The bad far outweigh the good. I can honestly say I found only 2 positives from this year&apos;s version: 1. the graphics - The game looks absolutely stunning, it&apos;s so obvious. Simply amazing. Love all the animations (except the ones you can&apos;t skip, specifically when there&apos;s a foul and the players start pushing each other around and the penalties!!... God, the penalty animation sucks!!) I like how in the middle of a match they show you highlights of goals or upcoming matches. That was quite creative. 2. The soundtrack - FIFA know how to select their music, I always give them that. This year the OST totally blew me away. I actually like more, if not half the songs in there (The Valleys, Busy Earning, Uh La La, Wild heart and Come Alive being my faves) The soundtrack almost make up for what a stupid game fifa has become.
<br>Now.... the negatives! Where to start?? Well, the game is terribly difficult!! I play mostly against the AI (Career mode) and I&apos;ve found it difficult to get past Professional. It&apos;s become almost impossible to score, not that you are not skilled, but I feel the AI tries as hard as possible to beat you, hence making it a bit unrealistic. For example, when pressing AI players you&apos;ll take about five seconds (if you are lucky) to dispossess them of the ball. however the reverse takes less than a second. The slightest push on your player and the ball changes possession. It pisses me off ESPECIALLY when even stats state otherwise. Once Raheem Sterling effortlessly took the ball from Daley Blind and I was like... &quot;did that just happen?&quot; Sterling (aggression 34, strength 67)pushed Blind off the ball? Ridiculous! And air balls are a pain in the neck. Your players make no effort whatsoever to reach them. Crosses just end up on a defenders head then you hear Martin Tyler go &quot;And that&apos;s a great defensive header...&quot;always feel like throwing up. They threw gameplay physics down the drain with this one. Then there&apos;s GTN which is absolutely useless. I liked fifa 13 bcs you knew all the players ratings rather than wasting 18 days to scout a player just to find out he&apos;s rated 68. Who has time for that when the January window is only 30 days?? And why the hell did they remove saving replays?? What&apos;s the point of scoring hard fought goals if you can&apos;t go back and watch them?? And custom playlists?? Just disappeared!! Totally outrageous!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=5175422">Expand</a></span>

The matches themselves feel very &quot;scripted&quot; and I have never lost soo many 50/50 duals in my life. It is not acceptable to charge full retail for this, get ur head out of ur ass EA and listen to the fans and for gods sake Stop release unfinished games.. or we will give U the grand prize of &quot;worst company in america&quot;...4 the 3:e time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4554491">Expand</a></span>

One user shot authenticity in the foot by saying how much he enjoyed what they&apos;ve done with career mode this year. Really? They&apos;ve done zilch buddy, except a reskin...stop lying for EA.
<br>
<br>In short there is no way this game should get more than 5/10, because a footy sim it isn&apos;t! The scripts determine who is going to win, which is basically the underdog, so expect to whip Barcelona 3-0 every frigging time but struggle against Yeovil town because in EAs infinite wisdom, it&apos;s good to manufacture a challenge by boosting poor teams stats while dumbing down your teams AI, so you can&apos;t defend. Defending is awful anyway, there&apos;s just no way to overcome the AIs psychic or zero reflex time ability to turn on a dime and dribble past you. I&apos;ve tried contain, high pressure and second player contain but it counts for naught because the controls stop responding to your input when the scripting kicks in (ie when the algorithms want the CPU to score). And I really mean stop responding, not just delayed. Corners conceded around the 45 or 90 minute mark, well, don&apos;t expect your 7 foot power heading CB to do anything except move out of the way to allow the 5 foot striker to head into the corner. And the goalies? My goodness, they range from being superhuman to assisting bystanders, actually moving out of the way of the ball if the AI wants a goal!
<br>
<br>In short this game is a mess, lots of mini scripts within a 90 minute game leave you either feeling robbed or the game gave it to you. No point building up an 80+ rated team in career mode because stats are irrelevant thanks to all the scripting going on. There&apos;s also no need for a midfield as the most effective way to score sadly is the hoof to a fast player method. So pack your defence with 6 players and buy 4 fast strikers, and as for the keeper, well it don&apos;t matter. Regardless of who you buy, there&apos;s no discernible difference in ability between a 50 rated melon and a 85 rated super star. The same types of shots will be goals or not irrespective of Keeper ability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4608209">Expand</a></span>

I really feel EA should try something new and let a real person play the game and listen to their concerns before it is released. I also know this will never happen as the only time FIFA will improve is when another company comes along and produces a better game. (It took PES in the 90s to do it.) as EA realised it was worth investing the money for the return.
<br>This feels like EA have gone the same route as the Football Manager series has gone. Player stats mean diddly squat as a player with a speed of 85 (Human controlled.) will be caught overtaken and tackled by a player with speed of 60 (CPU controlled.) I hit the post and bar at least eight times in one match the comp had one shot in extra time and won. (Just like a match in FM14.) Even when I do score there is no great feeling of satisfaction as there where in other FIFA / PES games.
<br>Now lets start on the referee, if you give an opposing player a dirty look your in the book but they hack ten bells out of you and nothing.
<br>I feel EA are really trying to cover up the extremely poor AI by making the game excessively bias. Why are my players stupid and the computer controlled players are all golden balls. The only player on the pitch that is of any use is the one you control.
<br>On the plus side it looks great. Once you turn your crossfire/sli off and mess about with driver settings to stop the micro stutter and fix FPS.
<br>EA makes a huge amount of money from us and I truly believe their company motto should read &quot;EA. The Consumer Sucks.&quot; After all it is not like we pay their wages or anything.
<br>Free kicks, corners, penalties and throw ins are still by far the worst in any footy game ever.
<br>Anyways if you look at this as a computer game of a made up sport it is O.K. and I am sure I will have hours of (was going to say fun.) game time.
<br>Please, please, please can a software house start making a footy game and put it out as early access and listen to US the consumer. I want a new king of the Great Game.
<br>EA you need to take a long hard look at yourself for your own good, not mine.
<br>People really are getting fed up with you and your money grabbing ways.
<br>Not a bad GAME. I just expected more changes to what have been spoken about for at least five years now, but nothing :-(
<br>Glitz and glamour alone does not make a great game. Do not give up just get a group of experienced football gamers together and LISTEN.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612809">Expand</a></span>

Likewise, it does not deserve a ten unless the last football game you played was International Superstar Soccer on Super Nintendo. Now that would be a mind-blowing transition! I should also note that I&apos;m reviewing this game primarily from a career/FUT mode perspective, and that at the moment I am playing at a Professional/World Class difficulty level (I have played exclusively at World Class difficulty for the last few years, but I&apos;m struggling with FIFA 15); so, no, I am not a virtual superstar, and I&apos;ll have no choice but to tell you to jog on if the sole rebuttal you can provide is &quot;youz jus suxxors at dis game.&quot;
<br>
<br>There&apos;s no doubt that the graphics and user interface update is smooth and beautiful - coming from FIFA 13, it&apos;s a marked improvement. The menu is far less clunky and navigating your way around the various modes and settings is easy. The actual game graphics are pleasant to look at, with the more realistic animations and crowds adding atmosphere. It would have been nice to have more video options than 0x/2x/4x MSAA and Low/High rendering quality, but that&apos;s a fairly minor gripe.
<br>
<br>However, despite the shiny new interface and the graphical realism, EA has consistently failed to address the underlying flaws that have been at the core of the franchise for a number of years. In fact, that&apos;s why I skipped 2014&apos;s version (and only the second time I skipped a FIFA game going back to FIFA 97). The tone and &apos;feel&apos; of the game has changed significantly, now sporting a frenetic end-to-end battle that allows for very little build-up and no real midfield competition. Although this in itself doesn&apos;t seem that representative of football in reality, it&apos;s not as much of a problem compared to the AI. In some ways, it&apos;s the behaviour of the AI that exacerbates the absurdity of this play style. Friendly AI has practically remained unchanged for years: they remain static, rigid and lack any of the dynamic smarts or vision that the CPU AI enjoys at the higher difficulty levels. Friendly defenders get drawn out of position all over the place and don&apos;t react well to the way the attack is being setup, leaving massive gaps everywhere that inevitably results in you the AI having acres of space. Frankly, at the mid-to-upper difficulties, the defenders are mostly useless, with the player often frantically scrambling all over the shop to stop the opposition from scoring. Combine that with the champagne one-touch football that the CPU employs at World Class+, it seems like a losing battle, even if they don&apos;t score as often as they probably should.
<br>
<br>Of course, this wouldn&apos;t be such a major issue if it weren&apos;t for the fact that your attack, in terms of penetration and getting in and behind the defence, is like being Accrington Stanley vs Bayern Munich. It&apos;s practically impossible to play any tight one-twos near the D to get past their defensive wall, often having to resort to long shots or crossing just to create half-chances. I can only assume that the CPU AI defense are some kind of hive mind, each knowing exactly what the others will do and where to go accordingly. The semi-randomised shooting just compounds matters. Of course there is the counter-attack, which is a reasonably successful tactic, providing you can outpace the defense. Even should you beat the man, he will turn on a dime and catch up to you faster than the Flash on amphetamines, so it&apos;s never a done deal even when you manage to bypass the defender. Basically, FIFA 15 (and its predecessors) almost have two sets of rules and behaviours - one for your AI, and one for the CPUs. EA can bang out all the catchy slogans they want or talk about their new &apos;next-gen&apos; mechanic, but it&apos;s not what they should be looking to improve. It&apos;s the core behaviour that needs an overhaul.
<br>
<br>Ultimate Team is practically unchanged to previous versions. This mode could probably use a bit of an overhaul - particularly when it comes to chemistry. I don&apos;t see why chemistry shouldn&apos;t increase as the team plays more together, with the degree of improvement linked to the skill of the player (e.g. that world class players are good enough to slot in new squads quickly, etc). Likewise, Career mode remains a staple that progresses much as it has before hand. Yet again, my favourite &apos;mode&apos; is simply playing co-op leagues/tournaments with a couple of beers - it&apos;s about the only time I don&apos;t get irritated at FIFA&apos;s lack of genuine improvement and innovation.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a fun game, don&apos;t get me wrong, and I&apos;ll like spend hundreds of hours playing it as I have with the others, but it&apos;s about time EA really pushed the envelope. It&apos;s a shame EA are such bastards with licensing, it could do with some serious competition to keep things moving forward instead of relying solely on yanking the status quo teat of the cash cow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4565125">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>experience of the game was far from awful, it was horrid and nightmarish. I remember me and my buddies were playing a
<br>
<br>tournament on my PC which was averaging well not averaging, playing at a steady 60 fps and we came to an unanimous
<br>
<br>conclusion with regard to the feedback we got from the game, which were four - 1. Graphics - even though it was not on
<br>
<br>Ignite, the game looked good...very improved...the lighting, shading, player modeling although many other players often
<br>
<br>appeared to look more generic. 2. Commentary - Previously we had given Fifa08 the honours and until with 14, 08 was still
<br>
<br>the supreme in terms of commentary because of the ability to &apos;remember&apos; previous matches, previous players&apos; clubs
<br>
<br>especially when playing against them and so on...something that could have been added on in fifa titles long long ago.
<br>
<br>But then  that was just our united opinion . 3. Shooting...actually the actual shots...they were more satisfying...more
<br>
<br>gratifying...the fact that they took ages to be executed almost robbed 14 of this key positive point. 4. Celebrations -
<br>
<br>That alone was the only thing that implored me to try harder at getting the store where I bought my FIFA copy to give me
<br>
<br>my money back instead of EA Sports who refused to by ignoring my efforts. Other than that, FIFA 14 was hogwash, and was
<br>
<br>never worth hours spent on it...infact we spent a lot of periods moving from Fifa 08 and then to FIFA 11 lamenting the
<br>
<br>lack of the graphics fidelity, shooting and celebrations of the fifa 14 title.
<br>
<br>You so called review fails to answer a would be buyer&apos;s question before spending money on this games just as it failed me with the previous iteration (fifa14). You guys (Metacritic) suck at game reviews but I am gonna have a go anyway...or maybe they pay you for hyping their games?
<br>
<br>Now coming to 15, is it still akin to 14 in these terms?
<br>
<br># Jerk you around - Give you control of the model...then take it away and make the model do something stupid then give
<br>
<br>back control and then abruptly take it away again then give it back then take it away...all that in the space of a few
<br>
<br>seconds...and that is EA Sports...it&apos;s in the game!
<br>
<br>1. GPS Navigation: where player models moved to where directed (attempted to anyway) using a predefined pattern, motion
<br>
<br>and &apos;precision&apos;? Oblivious to inputed direction of the user? They move like cars...braking then stopping and then
<br>
<br>starting and then moving and the accelerating then overshooting and that oh so undeniable turning circle of a
<br>
<br>truck...good gawd....and you can even more than imagine the soft but impending voice of the GPS navigator going:
<br>
<br>&quot;Calculating...calculating&quot; as your player model moves in a circular motion with a berth of a meter to attend the ball
<br>
<br>that is to the left or right of him. Splendid work chaps...jolly good show.

2. Command versus Suggestion System: where the controlling user (You or me or both...using a system of +60 fps playing

rig) seems to suggest an action of either a pass, a shot, movement left or right, a run...a tackle and also the lack of

fouling - 08 used to be able to allow you to deliberately foul an opponent and pull him to the ground...and so on? Where

after pressing the pass or shoot or any other previously abled button, the model seem to think about it first before

agreeing and then executing much of which led to the loss of matches, opportunities, offside calls and so on...none of

which was totally non-existent in 08...well not totally but barely? What i am saying is we seem to be suggesting actions

rather than commanding the player models, is this still true in 15?
3. Ballophobia - This I happened to notice first in fifa 12, the horror and disgust of when a controlled player model

brakes in front of the  ball when the ball is not being contested and contrary to the actual control being subjected on

the model to assume control of the ball. This includes assuming control or kicking the ball when it is spiraling in a

particular direction, at a particular point, from a particular angle. This resulted in a lot of throw-ins conceded, a lot

of corners where models will run &apos;act like they be running&apos; after the ball and only engage the ball after it has crossed

the out of bounds line. The leaving it until late before intercepting an aerial ball going out of bounds/play...all of

this oblivious to the movement and engage commands made by the user on the player with the indicator. They literally run

away from the bomb or we probably should not judge, there might be a ticking sound that we with controllers in our hands

do not see.

4. Defending - Fifa12 saw us being introduced to a new feature called tactical defending, this meant that you no longer

pressed the standing tackle button and thus see your controlled model running at the ball to take possession by &apos;stand&apos;

tackling and shoving, pushing and so on...the right word that I am not keen on using would be auto marking...instead you

have to manually navigate your model into a position where when the standing tackling button is pressed, the model would

dispossess the opponent and assume possession or fail excellently by looking like a cockroach killer in a soccer kit

stomping the ground and being tripped by invisible little stadium pitch gnomes. First of all, because you are never given

total control of the controlled model, that personally has failed because I would be frustrated by my supposedly

controlled player model as he nears the opponent where he would automatically slow down and start waiving his hands about

attempting to either search the accosted player, read his braille tattoos or tickle him and spend a good valuable 30

seconds following him round that way before I would change to another player model in complete frustration. Since then in

Fifa 12, the tactical defending brought in the containing method of play as part of a defending where according to me,

the train of thought in regard to the introduction of this was to allow for the containing of the player with the ball so

that they could be tactically defended, but when using legacy which was a much more better and preferred personally way

of defending, since Fifa12, that underwent a serious castration. as even the legacy defending In 14, we saw

players...defenders moving out of position to follow attacking opposition players, going on a leg fetish rampage and

blatantly ignoring the ball and going after the opposition models...knocking them down, tripping them, getting in front

of them and blocking them whilst the ball rolled unattended toward another opposing player or toward a dangerous set-

piece opportunity for the opposition...often so, you will witness defenders slowing down so that they interact with the

ball from a bickering position instead of fighting to reach the ball first and then passing it or clearing it out of

danger...holding the legacy defending button since fifa 12 has been a recipe for disaster we wonder if that still is the

case in 15? Fifa 11 was  true to defending as any player playing and using that system is or was. you could press it and

release it when u notice that you player is opting to go &apos;kit number reading&apos; (following) aimlessly and accompanying the

opposition to score..you could navigate them into a better position where they would jostle, push and bump and you would

see it and it was immediate and they always went for the ball and were not GPS guided and they would be always open to

correction...as for 08, holding the button would result in a foul...a deliberate foul which ceased to exist since fifa12.

I doubt if this has changed in 15 as well.

5. The Flora syndrome: This is something you happen to notice immediately after first starting to play fifa14, the

immobility of the players about to receive the ball. You cant do jack. They would be stand there...planted...waiting for

the ball to come to them, this would happen TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME...them morons would be planted. Moving

to meet the ball or foil an interception is a fallacy and raises the serious question of &apos;control&apos; especially with the

device within the human user&apos;s upper limbs&apos; functional ends (hands). QA Staff failure I suppose more than anything here.

An exercise to try: In controller settings, choose Manual instead of the widely preached airballs option for the

autoselect feature...and see how many times your controlled model will go after a an incoming aerial ball, I have tried a

million times to manually move the player toward where the ball will be landing; fruitlessly. At times even moving the

model with my indicator will prove null and void and only be awakened to me controlling him after the ball has bounced

and when the AI sharing control of my assumed player model with me grants me only to take it again when I am in the

proximity of an opponent to shape how I lose the game.

6. Hollywood:
Acting - the art of representing a character on a stage or before a camera by means of movement, gesture, and intonation.
What would constitute bad acting? bad acting would be constituted by ill representation of my wishes within the context

of the the game of which I am the player of. Player models acting like they are seeing the ball, running toward the ball

only to run over the ball, bump into the ball (this happens when mostly when a certain run animation sequences are not

completed when the model reaches the ball) and then they stop track back and start jogging to go and bump into the ball

again to the comic entertainment of audiences. In-fact, I have become aware of a certain group of gaming audience pundits

of Fifa14 who would come to our tournaments just for the comic relief of models doing things that if looked at through

that perspective, would put this title in the category of the Seinfelds of eSports. Lots of drama in the title, the

trapping of the ball, the passing of the ball and then falling down, the heading of the rolling balls...and jumping and

missing of the ball for just the dramatic effect of playing the game. Fifa 14 was made to be watched and not played

because in most reviews you got the synonymous rephrasing of the words...&apos;visually appealing&apos; especially when they

applaud and comment the trots before runs and the prancing about when the player is about to contain a striker...and so

on. Does 15 have this wonderful qualities? Yes...please note the sarcasm in that question.

7. Jedi ability: AI controlled players are just Jedis. The force is strong about them that redirects your controlled

player when they come in with attempts to take the ball. This force repels and also attracts your models at will, putting

them out of position as such enabling your opposition to do as he wishes in your 18th area. And sporadically you would

have a player in your team reaching Sith mode and coming from nowhere running to double leg tackle the Jedi and free the

ball from the forceful ones...more often than most out into the outfield or onto another Jedi&apos;s feet and then the circle

would go on.

8. WTF!: This happens where you will have your controlled players turning into tennis players. They will be oblivious to

the ball and the going ons about them to the detriment of your efforts to at least let them be elementary school soccer

players who will all want to chase the ball and get a touch of it. These sons of pixels will run, turn their heads at 90

degrees to the body &apos;watching&apos; the ball, jump the circular thing, side-step beside it, jump it again and hop around it to

trap it with such high potency of drama that he leaves it there to collide with a team mate a few yards away.

Anticipatory football ceases to exist because if the controlled player did not compute covering the empty space  between

the running player down the pitch, the user anticipated through ball will be just watched as it rolls past toward the

running attacker with the number 7 on the jersey and then goal.

Now I ask, are any of these beside the presentation much spoken about in 15 and the ignite engine, still present or

corrected in EA Sports&apos; new FIFA title?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4692945">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>one noticeable change is that there tends to be more goal mouth frenzy and deflections in this edition. in the last three hours, i&apos;ve probably scored more deflected goals than my entire FIFA14 play through. the goalkeeping handling is also more realistic with more spilled shots and slightly slower reflex saves. there are noticeable attempts to incorporate more AI management (the AI manager does occasionally switch formations and tactics during the course of a game).
<br>
<br>but unfortunately, underneath all that glitter and bling, there are still some pretty irritating and poor aspects of the game especially in career mode when you control only your player. player AI is still generally poor with limited wing play and crossing. way too many square passes to each other and the less said about your team&apos;s AI defence the better (like having 4 Djimi Traores in your defence ...). the AI problem is highlighted as generally chances are only created by your player either actively or passively (i.e. either beating your man, giving/getting a through ball, or crossing) which means that the opposition team has a really hard time scoring. on legendary setting with default sliders (except for injuries which i turned up), in 20 games, my AFC Wimbledon has only conceded 1 goal ... as much as I like winning games, there isn&apos;t much point if there really isn&apos;t that much of a challenge. also, they really need to work on the realism aspect of the game somewhat, i get it that England sucks in real life, but getting a call up in my rookie season while playing in League Two is stretching it a bit.
<br>
<br>so after a few hours into the game, it&apos;s pretty much more of the same except that it&apos;s better looking. don&apos;t get me wrong, while it&apos;s not a bad game and it&apos;s pretty fun, aside from all the cosmetic differences, i am a little disappointed that there aren&apos;t more real changes to gameplay/simulation in FIFA15 - for starters, better AI team-mates and opposition, more intelligent/realistic management, and less arbitrary match ratings (i get more points standing around doing nothing sometimes than actively pressing and defending). oh yes, and still the worse set pieces and set piece AI this side of the known universe. freekicks are pretty much an exercise in randomness, the AI&apos;s set-piece taker&apos;s decision making leaves so much to be desired, a throw-in routine routinely gives the ball back to the opposition 50% of the time</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4528018">Expand</a></span>

I first reviewed this game and game it a 4, believing I had played enough games to make an accurate determination. I decided to go give it another go, ramping up the difficulty to World Class, adjust some sliders to slightly increase the CPU&apos;s error frequency in passing and first touch. The result? A MUCH more rewarding experience! Now, I am having to seriously play the ball, and, giving the my players a little more time while holding the ball, they actually do run into space more intelligently than I thought.
<br>You see the truth is, in previous FIFA outings, I would dink the ball about the pitch fairly quickly, trying to move it up as quickly as possible, and it worked. Trying to do the same again in 15 can work, but it was this way of playing that caused me to become frustrated. Holding onto the ball, waiting for the runs, and being a little bit more patient is paramount.
<br>I&apos;ve played about 10 games on World Class now and I am thinking more about my tactics, what instructions to  give my players and using more quick tactics than ever before.
<br>World Class seems to also have unlocked varied ways in which the CPU will try and score against you. I mentioned before that most of the time, on Professional, they would constantly trot up to my corners and then try and wind in. Now I&apos;m getting shots coming at me from all over the pitch which is much better.
<br>
<br>Finally, the biggest revelation and realisation that occurred to me last night is when I realised that defending is VERY different to how you would approach it compared to FIFA 14. I used to use the jockey and contain buttons all the time, but it seems they have been nerfed in 15, now instead, the trick seems to be to get close enough to the opposition player and time the standing tackle right, and suddenly, your defenders are not useless anymore!
<br>
<br>So, I can&apos;t delete my initial review, and I will caveat the positives with the fact that it is still a bit of a grind and not quite the beautiful game of football we would all love to play and see, but putting more time in to this game has made me realise I was wrong on some aspects.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m somewhat nervous to play online because I think that will just annoy the living **** out of me again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4539979">Expand</a></span>

Abysmal. 3 steps on how to succeed on Fifa 15. Step 1 Never try to actually tackle anyone because tackling leads to giving the ball to the opposition and constant fouls. Step 2: Use the LB Y button as Real Madrid and you instantly win 15-0. Step 3: Hold down the sprint button for maximum skill plays. If I could get a refund on this pile of rubbish I would. If anyone reads this and hasn&apos;t bought the game, keep away.
<br>The online modes, co-op seasons/seasons, Pro clubs all have delay built in + most of the player base seem to be in 3rd world internet countries like Russia and Mongolia. If you want a football game for the realism I would rather play club penguin as that shows more football realism. Honestly I am not even joking, do not buy it.
<br>On the other hand if EA were to re market Fifa 15 as a game made as a joke game then go for it. The amount of times I have seen defenders run into each other, the keeper running out to claim the ball and then leaves it for maximum bants. Not to mention the AI which has amazing talent when defending. On top of that the Fifa 15 PC community seems to consist of sweaty, LB Y through ball Real Madrid baddies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4889805">Expand</a></span>

With the Ignite engine&apos;s new physics and animations, the game definitely feels a lot more realistic in terms of the players looking like real people and showing emotion, as well as the expanded techniques for shooting, making saves, etc.
<br>
<br>However, despite the new engine, the game doesn&apos;t feel hugely different, as you&apos;d expect with this type of game that&apos;s simply recycled annually. There are still so many bugs in-game too, and considering the game doesn&apos;t expand beyond the stadium, I&apos;d expect them to iron out all glitches and bugs by now. If MMO&apos;s can be bug free on release, surely this game should. I&apos;ve already experienced moments where the ref is giving my player a yellow card, and the screen just gets stuck looking at the ref, I had to wait about a minute for it to return to the game.
<br>
<br>PC performance is also poor. When the game runs normally, I get well over 100fps on max settings and everything is fine. However, for some stupid reason, when going into replay animations or taking a goal kick, the FPS drops to 30, it&apos;s extremely annoying (I have turned off Vsync for those that may wonder). I also cannot Alt+TAB out of the game, because when returning to FIFA, it enters windowed mode with a letterbox view which is unchangeable unless I restart the game.
<br>
<br>Players still act like idiots as well. Goalkeepers still make saves and take about 5 seconds to stand up again, meanwhile the opponent has tapped in a rebound shot. Players go flying to the floor (due to the physics engine) from the smallest of contact. Players go to control the ball and somehow it deflects off their shin about 6 metres ahead of them, despite the pass being extremely low powered. etc, etc, etc, the list goes on.
<br>
<br>Oh, and Ultimate Team FIFA points are far too expensive as always.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4542019">Expand</a></span>

But while some of FIFA 15&#x2019;s refinements are worthwhile &#x2013; and a tangible improvement on FIFA 14 &#x2013; its flaws stand out all the more. In some ways it&#x2019;s a step forward, in others a step back - and with Konami&#x2019;s PES seemingly in resurgent form, EA Sports can&#x2019;t afford to take its eye off the ball. Such an approach might not have an enormous amount of depth, but that&apos;s not so much of an issue for a series that sees one core release every year. If you&apos;re looking for football that is exciting, exaggerated, and immensely entertaining, FIFA 15 is the game to get. Here is the pros and cons:
<br>+New goalkeeper animations add diversity and visual flair
<br>+Opposition AI is more adaptable, less predictable
<br>+Ultimate Team&apos;s &apos;loan&apos; system reduces the mode&apos;s inherent grind
<br>+Tactics and formations are easier to implement and design
<br>+Focus on attacking play makes for great online matches
<br>-Commentary remains awkward
<br>-Emphasis on exciting football could limit long-term depth</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4542288">Expand</a></span>

The atmosphere in each stadium comes to live, for example if you pick the team Manchester United, playing at Old Trafford, when your players score the whole stadium erupts, while if the opponent score, they dash to the opponent fan section and they celebrate with them. I must say how impressed I am with almost every player presentation, they look almost ridiculously identical and also I like how they&apos;ve amped up the speed and acceleration of the game. Now, not every game is perfect as there are hideous amount of stutters in game, I hope they this fix asap because other than that I don&apos;t see why this is&apos;nt the best FIFA title I have ever played</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4527891">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But the core game itself is fine (odd random bug aside) with improved AI movement, greatly improved goalkeepers, a smarter aerial system where headers aren&apos;t the equivalent of a cheat mode and, last and least importantly, the graphics.
<br>
<br>The scripting arguments are, as per usual, stupid, but it&apos;s going to happen when a shot hits the post late on or you concede a scrappy goal, because nerd raging at the game itself is easier than looking at where you got it wrong. It&apos;s common in the Football Manager community too, it&apos;s the nature of the beast with sports gamers.
<br>
<br>As noted, bugs exist. I&apos;ve played the PC and PS4 versions (the PC version, barring FUT, is probably the superior version surprisingly), and frame rate issues are real at times and ruin immersion in the game.
<br>
<br>But there&apos;s nothing inherently wrong with this title. Metacritic, for all its&apos; plus points, will never reflect with a user score the games quality, so my advice is to ignore what everyone here says (including me) and play the free demo. You&apos;ll know inside 5 minutes whether you rate it or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4542105">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Navigational Control of the ball with attitude I have never seen in Fifa 14; most notably when one picks up the Skilled Dribbler Specialty.
<br>
<br>The visual graphics are incredible compared to Fifa 14; if one doesn&apos;t pay close attention... the crowd looks very diverse...
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a tad bit harder to score with the same sense of feel used in Fifa 14; one can&apos;t just mash the button and get ball in the upper corners of the goal.
<br>================================================================================
<br>Cons:
<br>My game is unstable in Fullscreen mode and I have to run windowed to keep it form freezing; when game does freeze I would just Ctrl+Tab to go to windowed mode and it unlocks.  Still better than having to lose the whole match and Save Point.
<br>
<br>If one just barely misses the post, the ball will bounce off instead of flying out of bounds.
<br>
<br>Still can&apos;t see the contract length with your current club.
<br>
<br>The music compared to Fifa 14 sucks; they tried to reinvent the wheel.
<br>================================================================================
<br>
<br>All in all, I still enjoy playing Fifa 15 over Fifa 14.  The control is much better and one can actually draw fouls in Fifa 15 with ease.  I used to never get fouled in Fifa 14; but I have noticed that the AI does some heavy tackles in Fifa 15 and it does irk me when I get heavy tackled 3 times in a row and no foul is called....   It&apos;s still realistic about fouls...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4532543">Expand</a></span>

Much faster gameplay, first touch is much more intuitive with the higher skilled players being able to do quicker moves, taking on and beating players 1 on 1 running , dodging, doing special moves has never felt so good.</span>

Your play no longer stops dead after you pass to a player who was standing still.   More teammates will be looking to make offensive runs.   First touches are more controlled but seem just as dynamic as last year.   All the new animations really make gameplay more fluid... seeing a teammate jump backward to chest a ball down to the ground is amazing to watch, and has positive gameplay repercussions.  Many lament the &quot;arcadeification&quot; of this year&apos;s version... but to me it really just seems like defending is just all that much more meaningful, and even... fun.
<br>
<br>The PC version is extremely playable!  Few bugs but zero showstoppers.  Don&apos;t bother with Ultimate Team though, just like in all the other versions, the transfer market is all bots.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4559510">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s nothing like pc fifa 14 which was just a rehash for 13/12 etc This is a massive step up in graphics, gameplay, but the biggest let down for me is they removed training? WHY?! I can&apos;t practice free kicks anymore.
<br>
<br>The game is a solid 9/10 but because people are being butthurt giving it 0s I&apos;m giving it a 10 to get it near the correct ranking.
<br>
<br>What those butt hurt gamers are doing is making the devs think &quot;we just migrated our ignite engine for nothing, they prefer the old rehash so lets stick with that&quot; you&apos;ll ruin it for yourselves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4630325">Expand</a></span>

While the animations and physics have improved drastically this year as every year EA can&apos;t shake off the desire to simplify and dumb down the game to the extent that speed passing and silly tricks are promoted over teamwork and tactics.  Pro clubs is especially rife with the &apos;win at all costs&apos; mobs who seek to use exploits, speed passing and cheap gameplay tricks to win instead of working to a game plan.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately Pro Evolution Soccer, which has historically been the football game for the genuine football fan is still lagging behind.  Hopefully one day it&apos;ll catch up, but for now we can just wish for the day when beauty will return to the beautiful game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4954091">Expand</a></span>

<br>But I hate that it focuses only on that FUT feature that for me is not existent.
<br>
<br>I play single player career mode and here is very poor experience. My player contract in first team never expires so I always earn the same amount of money even if I am great player.
<br>That achievement system that develops my player is uber idiotic. I liked how earlier PES dealt with that. It was fun to develop player while in FIFA it is ALWAYS the same. I like to be striker and I have only 3 YES freaking 3 options to make my stats start from different values! PES always put random numbers and that was freaking awesome compared to FIFA idiotic stat system. Then I am always developed in the same way because my gameplay style is the same so every year fifas experience in terms of player development is the same. THAT IS PATHETIC!
<br>Also game forces player to be the best! Very early player can get offer from best teams! I remember in PES it was hard to be popular while in FIFA it is like OH you scored 15 goals in season for team in english league 2 so Bayern Monachium want you badly! PATHETIC!!!!!
<br>
<br>They ignored completely bug that is present in importing game face. Player have gum teeth and his ears have no texture making ears look detailed like other players ears on field. Again all they care is that F**** FUT because it is popular between casuals that care only about beating some human through game. Pathetic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=5159512">Expand</a></span>

<br>Every year people are complaining that FIFA is the same as last year, but, it is always WORSE than last year. EA does not care about customers at all because no matter what they do they would make money anyway.

The visuals are excellent, best licensing in a football game, the gameplay has moderately improved, the soundtrack is one of the best so far, and there are more features. However, despite all that, this game has some severe flaws, which luckily seems to be what EA is working on in the next game. The main flaw is in the defensive gameplay. While playing this game, I have noticed what many have, which is that the defensive AI is distressingly incompetent. The reason I say this, is because the defenders do not mark players properly, tackling is very weak, and somehow defenders are able to catch up with players which have high-level pace. In addition, there are more AI problems. When you go up against the World Class and Legendary AI in the game, every team you can think of, suddenly has the same skill and speed as a five-star team (ex. Real Madrid, Chelsea) and that is unfair to the player. After getting passed the learning curve, you can beat the AI, but their aggressiveness is annoying to deal with as they pull on you shirt without getting a foul/booking and they constantly time waste towards the end of the match, when the score is on their side. In Ultimate Team, price ranges have been recently added, and I fully support them, but they do need an overhaul. Finally, many players have complained about the EA servers, and nothing has been done about it. In this review, the positives and negatives of the game have been highlighted. The reason I focus on the negative a bit more, is because these are problems that need fixing. In conclusion, this game is a major improvement in the FIFA series, but it still yields some problems that have not been fixed since FIFA 14, or new problems that need to be fixed. Good news is that EA are working on defensive AI for the next game, FIFA 16. Thank you if you made it this far, I hope this was informative.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=5400275">Expand</a></span>

<br>Cons: The defense! Holding the a button is pointless. If the player on offense stops running then the defender will run 5 yards past the marked player. A player could run straight down the middle and score. Holding the double team button is pointless in many cases as your teammates will only get in the way. The penalties you will conceive are awful. The golies are stupid. Balls can bounce off a top golies head and go in. On offense the free kick is overpowered. The players don&apos;t run properly which is inexcusable for a next gen game. This will cause you nothing but headaches and lead you to waste your money. Stick with an older FIFA game or go with PES unless you like wasting your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4857839">Expand</a></span>
