<br>Unfortunately, That Dragon, Cancer, is about as much of a game as is The Stanley Parable or any other &quot;games&quot; that make an attempt to to make some sort of commentary on life, love or the state of the industry.
<br>
<br>Further, it also doesn&apos;t excuse the product from criticism, regardless of the message, no matter how personal or emotional.
<br>
<br>As a digital product, advertised as a &quot;game&quot; (and I use that term loosely), That Dragon, Cancer suffers from a hodgepodge of bugs, glitches and other technical difficulties.
<br>
<br>The reality is, this product does nothing new, it has nothing revolutionary about it. And I simply cannot review a product based solely on the level of emotional attachment some people may develop for this product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6009819">Expand</a></span>

<br>The end of the &apos;&apos;game&apos;&apos; it reads &quot;thank you for playing&apos;&apos;, but there is zero gameplay, nor is this a game. i really don&apos;t see how 14.99 justifies what i just went through. Also, imo, the controls are wonky as heck. i feel like the button mapping could have been made easier. I think i spent about an hour and a half on this, and there were a few times i was kind of stuck, once underwater trying to (incorrectly) swim up, another time in a hospital room with Joel crying on a loop, and a 3rd time infront of candles in the church where i found myself playing repeater a few times before progressing.
<br>
<br>kudos, for the artistic approach, i thought that was a nice touch.
<br>
<br>i&apos;m not going to really touch too much on belief, bc i don&apos;t feel like that should warrant a positive/negative review just bc someone might share a different belief; mine, may be similar, who knows.. But, i kind of wish it was less about &apos;&apos;us&apos;&apos; knowing what exists and that Joel is alright now, and more about how Joel positively left a good imprint on others whilst he was here. it&apos;s not my story. it was heartfelt.
<br>
<br>basically, bc of what i thought were weak controls. and, the fact that it&apos;s simply not a game. i don&apos;t feel it warrants a 15 USD price tag.
<br>
<br>i dislike giving this a negative review. rip, Joel, and to the family, all the best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6090376">Expand</a></span>

If this story was made into some sort of hour-long documentary, I would&apos;ve watched and loved it. The reason this game gets a 4 and not lower is that I really did feel for the characters of the story (and it honestly broke my heart when I learned it was a true one) and I wanted to know more about it. But after about an hour and a half, everything was over and there was a whole lot of nothing left behind. As Yahtzee Croshaw stated when talking about Everybody&apos;s Gone To the Rapture, &quot;once you remove the fun and interactivity of The Stanley Parable, you ARE supposed to replace it with something&quot;. I simply don&apos;t think that &quot;but it&apos;s art!!!&quot; is an excuse for glitchy sections and overly-dragging monologues. Heavy Rain worked, The Beginner&apos;s Guide worked, but this, unfortunately, does not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6025378">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s an exciting time for gaming; we&apos;re starting to see a lot of indie titles like this that challenge the conventional idea of what a game is. While such titles tend to have little actual gameplay and may not be what you could call &quot;entertaining&quot;, they often use the medium in interesting ways to tell stories or evoke some sort of emotional response from the player that&apos;s different from what might be possible with more traditional forms of media like film or literature.
<br>
<br>Like Gone Home, Depression Quest, or To the Moon, That Dragon, Cancer, is one such game.
<br>If you have an interest in unique, narrative-focused games and are thinking about testing this one out, I&apos;d suggest you pick up one of the other titles I just mentioned instead.
<br>
<br>I was drawn to That Dragon, Cancer by glowing reviews from critics and testaments from players that the game could reduce even the most hardened of men to bawling wrecks. Now I&apos;m a susceptible to certain films starring Anne Hathaway or any story featuring a dead dog plotline as the next person, but I was surprised to find myself completely dry-eyed at the end of this.
<br>
<br>So maybe I&apos;m cold and heartless for failing to be moved by this story about the tragic death of a five-year-old from cancer, or maybe this game is just hugely overrated.
<br>
<br>Before I get into what specifically I disliked about That Dragon, Cancer, I want to say that I&apos;m grateful that games like this exist, and I respect the Greens&apos; using a game as a way of sharing their painful experience with the world. Despite all that, personally, it just wasn&apos;t worth my Saturday afternoon.
<br>
<br>I did try to engage with That Dragon, Cancer, but something always kept throwing me off, whether it be the game&apos;s clunky mechanics, which left me wondering what exactly I had to do to progress to the next level, or slightly hackneyed monologues that expressed the characters&apos; thoughts and feelings a little too overtly for my liking.
<br>
<br>The biggest thing that threw me was That Dragon, Cancer&apos;s preoccupation with Christianity. While I understand that faith is important to the Greens and their in-game counterparts, the Christian elements of the game were so overwhelming that they drowned out pretty much everything else. I feel like the developers took a story that could have potentially been relatable to everybody, and made it relatable only to those who share their beliefs.
<br>
<br>From the soundtrack to the letters written by loved ones of those who have passed away from cancer scattered throughout the game, almost everything had a Christian element, making this game feel like two parts religious allegory and only one part personal tragedy.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d rather not end on a sour note, so I won&apos;t sign off without first mentioning a few things that I did like about That Dragon, Cancer. The game&apos;s most subtle moments are it&apos;s best. Snippets of conversations with the family&apos;s elder children, and the messages left from Amy on Ryan&apos;s phone, which offer a glimpse at the couple&apos;s everyday life caring for a sick child, but also carry an undercurrent of hope and love.
<br>
<br>As gaming continues to evolve, I hope that other developers will be inspired by games like this to tell stories in a creative way. Even if the execution isn&apos;t great, That Dragon, Cancer offers a glimpse at what a game can be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6113738">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A true story of a child&apos;s battle with cancer shown through symbolic scenes and sad tones. It&apos;s supposed to make you feel uncomfortable all the way through. It was a sad story, but unless if you&apos;re a fan of sad stories or symbolic ones, this game is just another indie game with a sad story. Not worth playing if you don&apos;t want to hear a story of sadness. Biggest complaint, is the pricing. This game is just a unity project with minimalistic graphics, and they are asking for 15 dollars on Steam. Why? Did they make this game to make money off of people&apos;s reactions to the story, or are they funding cancer research?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6050648">Expand</a></span>

I am pretty tired of this discussion of what is and isn&apos;t a game.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I think TDC is a great example of why, as the medium of videogames has evolved in terms of artistic sensibility, its really weird to grade them on old rubrics like difficulty, replayability, and fun factor. Critics keep doing this in their reviews though even though most people have eschewed the categories themselves.
<br>
<br>What you need to know about TDC is that it is incredibly compelling, incredibly heartfelt, and incredibly emotionally challenging in all the right ways. Its not mechanically challenging or even mechanically novel, however, its mechanics poetically illustrate the value of grief, something I have never experienced in a game before. This game wrecked me. It made me feel for the Greens, more than that, it made me determined to love people who grieve. How does one possibly grade that experience on a 10 point scale? You can&apos;t really, or at least it feels very weird to experience that and shave off 2 points for a couple glitches and floaty platforming mechanics.
<br>
<br>If your rubric keeps you from experiencing the emotional power of a game because of these types of things, your rubric probably needs to be thrown out. Start from scratch. Experience things as a human being before you experience them as a &quot;gamer.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6010822">Expand</a></span>

And I&apos;m not talking about the frustration that comes with difficult or buggy games, or anger at a boss or enemy. This was pure emotion.

<br>Stay away if you&apos;re looking for a game, and beware, there is lots of religious thought. But you&apos;re not playing a game and these people aren&apos;t selling an ideology, they&apos;re just sharing an experience in the only way they know how.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6009604">Expand</a></span>

The journey is such a soul-crushing and heartfelt sentiment, and evokes all sorts of emotion into the player. The game is well written, well-paced, and overall really well done.
<br>
<br>My biggest issue with the game, and I really tried to get past it, were the bugs and glitches. Several times I found myself losing sound, or having to re-start because the game would freeze up. I even hit a glitch where the beginning of the 3rd scene wouldn&apos;t continue because a visual cue wouldn&apos;t trigger, and no matter what I did I couldn&apos;t get the game to continue. Luckily, you can skip from scene to scene and I was able to continue past the 3rd scene altogether.
<br>
<br>Other than that the game features a neat polygonal art style, and cool point of view work, where you are constantly switching from who or what you are seeing the story unfold. The game uses point and click to do everything, include walk around (no WASD used), which was okay. If you get past the technical issues, and just take the emotion beat for beat as you go along, this story will touch you, and for anyone out there that has lost someone to cancer this game will take you right back to that time. The story and dialogue are out of this world, and some of the ideas are so out of the box that you have to give it a good thumbs up in those departments.
<br>
<br>I would definitely recommend everyone give this a play-through, and with proceeds going to charity there is no good reason not to try it. Well done Nominous Games!

It&apos;s a scam riding one of the oldest ponies for easy dosh and easy ego-boost. Pay up and say you love it, or else you&apos;re like Hitler and wish bad for all people. Disgusting, yet effective. Just like any other emotionally blackmailing scam out there. To all these naive people who try to defend this product: do you really think that the developers will donate all their income from this to help fight cancer? Yeah, probably not, but pay us more!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6027004">Expand</a></span>

So I  saw this game get really high ratings and the art style intrigued me. I was verrrry disappointed. I guess people rate it highly because it&apos;s about a kid with cancer. I had to MAKE myself finish it to see if it maybe/ hopefully got better, it didn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>The voice acting was imo the most unbearable part (I&apos;m assuming they are the actual parents). I couldn&apos;t help but feel like the whole game wasn&apos;t even about the kid, it&apos;s just the parents moping and trying to say &quot;deep&quot; things to show how much of a struggle they&apos;ve had having a kid with cancer. Literally, the whole game is some kind of vanity project to tell the world how hard it is/was for them and how amazingly they fought through it.
<br>
<br>Overall, the idea of a game about childhood cancer is great and has lots of potential, but more metaphorically. Actually listening to the parents complain about their babies crying is wayyyy too literal and an absolutely annoying experience for the player. No one wants to hear these people complain forever but instead they could have focused on broader ideas like loss and staring death in the face. The game shouldn&apos;t be about them it should be about the whole issue and presenting it in a way that the player will be able to relate. But the creators literally made the whole game about them and their kids even going so far as to use their appearances, voices, and names. They also pretty much tell you in the game that they are game developers. No one cares they are game developers. It&apos;s a game about cancer, or is it?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6469743">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are a number of bad reviews for this title that bother me tremendously. There seems to be a couple unifying themes to all of these bad reviews: 1) This is not a game.  2) This is not worth $15 dollars.
<br>
<br>#1 seems to be a failure among these critics to understand or ignore a key point in the evolution of the video game medium.  Video games are no longer just games.  They are an artistic medium.  Whether an artist working in this medium wants to provide the consumer with a traditional interactive gameplay experience, a narrative driven passive experience with varying degrees of interaction, an abstract audio/visual experience with any sort of imaginable interaction from the consumer, or any combination of the above, is an artistic decision at the liberty of the developer&apos;s discretion. Today a video game can literally be any artistic software experience.
<br>
<br>#2 The value of art is entirely subjective. Critics are complaining that $15 is too steep a price for a video game without gaming mechanics, and that could be an entirely correct statement for those particular people. Anyone can assign any value they want to any artistic work. I&apos;m sure some of those same critics have had no problem paying $15 for a movie or an album that I would not pay $5 for, and that&apos;s ok.  The developer is certainly entitled to what they feel their work is worth. It&apos;s also fair to say their opinion is the only relevant opinion, considering they are the only people with any tangible investment into the creation of their work.
<br>
<br>From what I&apos;ve learned of the game, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m prepared to drop $15 for it.  I am, however, interested in experiencing the game, I just happen to feel that my $15 is better spent on other pursuits atm. Perhaps when this title goes on sale, is featured in a humble bundle, or my recreational preferences change, I&apos;ll pick it up. In the meantime, I felt like I need to express my frustration with these unfair negative criticisms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6135372">Expand</a></span>

<br>There are no puzzles, there is no arcade (well, there is one actually), here the mechanics serve the feelings and the storytelling. And they do it well.
<br>One remarkable things that was done right is the use of game-play to communicate discomfort. To do so you have to put the player in an annoying and frustrating situation, without giving any obvious action to take. Feeling lost can be a deal breaker to many players and it is a very risky design choice, but here it is done very well. You will feel that discomfort, you will feel the frustration as the protagonist does, yet it won&apos;t last too long to become redundant and pointless.
<br>There is also bit where you are invited to follow a conversation exploring the different point of views.

It&apos;s not a game that you play. It&apos;s a game that tells a story, almost like a movie. You&apos;re just along for the ride. Yes there are some things that could be better, and there are bugs, but the point of this game isn&apos;t for it to be played. The point of this game is to tell the story of Joel and his family living through the struggle of cancer, which is something I have gone through. Because of that I was re experiencing that time of my life when my mom had cancer, and that made the message of this game so much clearer. People complain that this game costs $15, but for that price you get this real story that many people can connect with. For 4 times the price you could go buy a Call of Duty game, a game franchise that&apos;s story hasn&apos;t made me feel for a character since MW3. But that&apos;s all those games are. Fictional stories about fictional people. That Dragon, Cancer is a real story about real people. That $15 is paying for you to experience the Green family going through an extremely hard time. It&apos;s an emotional game. It&apos;s not right to rate it the same way you rate Call of Duty.
<br>
<br>And if you can&apos;t connect to this game, go watch the videos that Mini Ladd, Markiplier, JackSepticEye, and many other people have made. See how emotional they get. Go watch the video by SoulPancake, who meets Joel. That is the character from the game you played.
<br>
<br>I feel for Ryan and Amy as I play or watch this game, and I hope you do as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7208896">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Rarely do we see a story about cancer told as honestly as TDC portrays it.  It is short, perhaps the length of a  movie that you&apos;d pay the same amount to see in theaters.  If that is not something you&apos;re willing to pay for, that&apos;s understandable.  Some people don&apos;t like confronting cancer, and that&apos;s understandable.  Some people say this isn&apos;t a game, and I respect their opinion.
<br>
<br>However, if, like me, you long to be moved by art, not just play the latest COD, or puzzle your way through an Undertale, consider That Dragon, Cancer.  It is not a game; it is art, and as such, it exists as an expression of the artist&apos;s soul, his experiences, and his pain, and unlike other mediums, we are allowed and invited to join him in both his pain and his acceptance, and hopefully find peace as well.
<br>
<br>I rate it 10/10, for this is art at its finest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/that-dragon-cancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7446664">Expand</a></span>
