<br>so list:
<br>capturing frigates on mission 3 fails to give you back the captured ships.
<br>
<br>because the physics (ballistic) system is not being used gearbox modified all the unit stats and balance around the RNG system, meaning ships like destroyers are hard countering frigates, ships move weirdly.
<br>I did warn people about this change, but everyone said it was not a big deal... now you are seeing the consequences.
<br>
<br>Multiple queues are limited to 2, this broke balance further in hw1.
<br>
<br>Support frigates needing to dock with ships means they cannot repair fast nor at long range nor actually support.
<br>
<br>support frigates cannot hyperspace while carrying strike craft.
<br>
<br>Formations are completely broken (they are not working at all) this also is because the game is using RNG instead of ballistic system.
<br>
<br>capturing carriers or alike will not allow you to build ships with them.
<br>
<br>because they are using triggers instead of game mechanics capturing resource collectors on missions where you have to destroy them, will consider them as alive and keep giving resources ad infinitum to carriers to magically keep popping fighters or frigates.
<br>
<br>capturing ships sometimes will make them pop out ships from the enemy team (carriers).
<br>
<br>the special ability keys mostly do NOT work with bandbox selection, this includes salvage frigates (and pretty much means its a pain to use them).
<br>
<br>because ships aren&apos;t taking onto account collision paths on the asteroids missions fighters will not evade asteroids and will get massively crushed.
<br>
<br>friendly ships keep attacking ships that are already being hold by enough salvage corvettes meaning they often destroy your prey.
<br>
<br>shift+click for queuing fast 5 on 5 ships does not work.
<br>
<br>there seems to be an arbitrarily low strike craft build limit active?
<br>
<br>The UI ships icons are night impossible to clearly identify what do you have selected.
<br>
<br>the mouse seems to be lagging (is it hardware accelerated?)
<br>
<br>salvage corvettes suddenly seem able to easily capture enemy corvettes (this is because it seems... evasion mechanics were disabled because they do not affect the RNG system) so they fly linearly and just get clamped easily.
<br>
<br>salvage corvettes are not showing their capture beam animation.
<br>
<br>the camera zooming out seems to be limited so much you cannot have a good view of the battles unless you go into tactical view which...
<br>
<br>tactical view Is broken.
<br>
<br>the game randomly crashes on missions 4/5
<br>
<br>missing select unused harvesters button.
<br>
<br>gearbox did it on purpose but why research needs to cost resources at all? it could have been left to work just like hw1, this seems to be an unnecessary change.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5045075">Expand</a></span>

This remastered Version has great graphics, but even on Version 2.1 there are bugs: pathfinding is very bad, often my ships dont attack anything, although there are enemies and they are on attack status. The biggest problem is the lack of good overview and I dont mean this sensor view. Then why do we have such good graphics engine?</span>

Ships get stuck with funny jitery movements. Broken path finding. AI seems erattic and with inconsistent rules. At one time research for ion cannons is stated to be available but nothing apears in the research list so you must reload from earlier levels. Many other mechanics have been removed or destroyed like fuel or being able to heal a fleet automatically rather than baby manage each unit. Over all a horibily broken game. Frustrating to say the least. In no way is it the gem the original was. You can tell no love went into this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5051695">Expand</a></span>

I come from the original series as well and they were awesome. They are still better than any RTS today. The remastered versions however only got a slightly better look and to work on modern PC&apos;s. The issues mentioned by those scoring the remastered version low is the issues i see as well, and so i dont understand when people score the RM versions highly. Too many issues and changes from the original games that shouldnt been done because it made the RM versions worse. They look better, sure, but the IMPORTANT stuff was made worse. Graphics seems to be what people rate games for today which is a shame. Back in the day when we &quot;didnt have&quot; gaphics - gameplay and mechanics mattered.
<br>
<br>I hope Gearbox can patch and fix these issues because this should really be bought by every RTS gamer out there, and you can clearly see that even though the game is old, its so good and better than most RTS&apos;es today that it will keep selling for years to come. Patch the issues, and get cracking on expanding on Homeworld and release HW3 in a couple of years. I will buy HW3 if the issues are fixed, new campaign, upgraded graphics engine (not really needed, but would be epic to see the REAL mechanics from the original in a modern engine).
<br>
<br>I give it 4/10 for fixing the original games to work on todays PC&apos;s, and for at least trying to get the best RTS ever made remastered to a new audience, and to us veterans. So 6 points missing for a perfect score because Gearbox changed or broke some vital and great working mechanics from the original versions. Also i think i crashed only once and the performance was decent on max graphics (slight stutter on a rather good PC). Please try again Gearbox. Patch what the community is asking you to patch, and then get busy making HW3. It will take the RTS crown and bring in a lot of money. Just do it right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5055339">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I had heard there would be a select few changes to the original game, and that they would all be for the better.But largely, that is not what we got. the Homeworld &apos;1&apos; remastered is not the game we were lead to believe it was going to be. while the visuals are great as one would expect them to be, the mechanics fall woefully short of the original game. here is a list of the biggest problems in my opinion. in no particular order:
<br>1 ) support frigates no longer repair units from a distance, and instead take a long time maneuvering around a ship in desperate need of repair, before finding a good spot to fix it from.
<br>2 ) the same for resource collectors who now circle forever to find a good spot to harvest from.
<br>3 ) the difficulty scales with your own fleet power, before there were a set number of enemys in an area, but now there are more or less depending how your campaign progresses.
<br>4 ) the original end credits is not featured in the remastered(which from what I understand is more greedy record label than the fault of gearbox, but its still a problem)
<br>5 ) instead of the awesome tactics and beautiful formations with physics based hit detection, it was substituted for the random number generation of HW2.
<br>
<br>Any of the changes listed above would be upsetting for long time fans of homeworld, but number 5 is the biggest deviation from the gameplay of HW1Classic. and in it of itself ruins the game, because without this the only thing the remastered has in common with the classic is the title and story. Whatever reason Geabox told themselves to convince themselves that the changes(butchering) to the classic game was okay, was dead wrong.
<br>
<br>I was expecting two remastered games, not one game with two campaigns. ! award 2 points because it does contain the original unmolested games and otherwise a pretty game to look at, but not play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5058145">Expand</a></span>

Beyond that though we quickly get in to trouble:
<br>
<br>1) Fuel has been taken out - this on its own is alright but it causes strike craft to never bother to return to support frigates for repair and rearm.  As a consequence of removing fuel they inadvertently made fighters far less survivable.
<br>
<br>2) The original game had support for telling your ships to keep a stance of aggressive or evasive for extra damage or extra survivability... this is just gone.
<br>
<br>3) Formations of ships completely break up as soon as they encounter the enemy.... they may as well be set to &apos;fly randomly&apos;
<br>
<br>4) Bugs, bugs, bugs....  I am dumbfounded how they managed to introduce so many of them.
<br>-The game wouldn&apos;t run on day 1 until I did some settings arcana.  I&apos;m not running a weird build, win7_64, yet these problems happened... unacceptable.
<br>
<br>-The game frequently misses mission triggers, e.g. in the asteroid mission I&apos;ve completed it yet the Bentusi never show up... the mission just never ends.
<br>
<br>-In the previous mission I captured an enemy carrier.  When it came out of the mothership as a friendly carrier it started to disgorge ~20 enemy interceptors....
<br>
<br>-Resource harvesters keep getting stuck due to incompetent pathing
<br>
<br>Really this feels like a beta... I am so tired of companies selling unfinished crap as final product and planning to patch it later.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5042522">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game was beautiful back in the day for its time but now its been updated to modern day graphics, it aint only a good multiplayer game, the story and single player are excellent, the music and sounds are pure quality, the game pretty much has everything, it isnt overly complex as a game but it isnt totally newb friendly either and the single player missions do not like you win without using your brain, like in my opinion every single game out there should do.
<br>
<br>Thank you gearbox for releasing this amazing franchise i got the collectors edition today and cant wait to play. I am a really only a pure multiplayer gamer but i will 100% do the single player for this game and i will WHORE the multiplayer, i cannot wait to see the HW1 and HW2 armies mix together in multiplayer, i really hope for HW3 after remastered, please!!!!! make it so! keep it true homeworld for the fans!

<br>This is an update that makes the game look gorgeous, even if your computer isn&apos;t the most up-to-date. My computer is like 7 years old and yet these uodate graphics play really well. There are also a lot of graphical options that you can go through if you are in a similar situation.
<br>
<br>The game does change a number of things compared to Homeworld 1. However, it also features a classic edition of Homeworld 1 if that is all you want to play as well.
<br>
<br>Finally, anyone who gives this re-release anything less than a 7 is a fanatic. Yes, there are changes made to the game as it was converted into the HW2 engine. However the gameplay is still extremely enjoyable and the only people who will notice many of these differences are hardcore Homeworld players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5040359">Expand</a></span>

<br>It has delivered in many ways. The graphics are just beautiful and do the original justice. Space has never before looked so strikingly good.
<br>
<br>It has some flaws however. I&apos;ll only be talking about Homeworld remastered, not Homeworld 2 remastered.
<br>First of all. There was the chance to get rid of the tedious resource collecting at the end of levels. they have not done it. Why not is beyond me, since in Homeworld 2, it was already implemented that resources are collected automatically at the end of the levels. To add to that flaw, the resource collectors seem to have gotten the dumb makeover. Maybe it is just my memory, but they really seem to behave quite stupid when collecting resources. On several occasions, they were sitting idle when given the harvest command after they consumed a cloud or a rock, not harvesting any further. Also, they seem to move even slower than in the original HW. In some levels, it took several hours! to collect all the remaining resources. That&apos;s not good.
<br>
<br>They killed the formations which worked perfectly in the original. Most of them just don&apos;t do what they&apos;re supposed to. This is especially bad in the sphere formation. In the original, you could let your smaller ships enter a sphere formation and with an additional guard command on bigger ships, they would move in position to form a protective sphere around the ship, firing on all threats while moving along with the guarded ship in a perfect sphere. This doesn&apos;t work anymore, they just form a small blob flying alongside the protected ship, which renders the sphere formation completely useless.
<br>
<br>There are also pathfinding bugs. This is especially annoying, when in battle and you order your support frigates to repair your capitals. Very often they get stuck in front of another big ship, waiting for the big ship to move instead of going around, hence, no repairs done. ship lost. I hopw they fix it with a patch soon.
<br>
<br>Finally, there&apos;s the UI. WTF? Is all I have to say about this. It&apos;s sad :(
<br>
<br>To sum it all up: I&apos;m back in the Homeworld Universe, It looks better than ever, but it feels off. Some former key elements are missing, bugs distort the gaming experience, and the UI is terrible.
<br>The worst part however is, that it feels slower than ever before.
<br>To bring this game to a younger generation who didn&apos;t know the original, would have meant to adapt a faster pace. Most of them are not familiar with this kind of slow gaming and it could mean a huge blow to sales if the game doesn&apos;t appeal to them.
<br>If Gearbox is able to fix these issues, we might have a classic again.
<br>7/10 for now</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5042477">Expand</a></span>

The ships, the combat, the cinematic sequences, the atmosphere, everything as good as the original and a lot more HD. The only nitpick I have is that they could have ported the mechanics of the original HW1 more loosely. The salvage tactics was silly back then and is still silly now.</span>

<br>As much as I love Homeworld the initial release is kind of disappointing to say the least. Many features are broken or just don&apos;t exist and even though I&apos;m glad it&apos;s not just a fancy copy of the original I can&apos;t help the feeling some changes were just wrong.
<br>
<br>Some of the stuff that doesn&apos;t work:
<br>- Formations and behavior don&apos;t work at all.
<br>- Some selection behaviors HW players got used to (ie. selecting all ships of one type in formation with the mothership by clicking only one ship) don&apos;t exist
<br>- Some &apos;box commands&apos; don&apos;t work/are missing (most notably salvaging)
<br>- Ship AI is really lacking so you can&apos;t depend on them to make reasonable tactical decisions themselves anymore (ie ships keep attacking a salvaged ship; selecting a sub-optimal target)
<br>- &quot;Keep docked&quot; in the launch window does nothing
<br>- tactical map refuses to open under certain circumstances
<br>
<br>the actual list goes on but I&apos;ll save that for a forum post
<br>
<br>Once you know how to deal with all these problems the gameplay isn&apos;t too bad. Having played the original not long before I appreciate at least some of the changes made but overall it&apos;s some kind of a mixed bag situation. Salvaging for example isn&apos;t as broken as it was in HW1 but that&apos;s only because the ships are simply not worth it = salvaging not worth it (especially if you basically have to babysit your entire fleet)
<br>The introduction of the dynamic difficulty (basically determining the enemy&apos;s fleet&apos;s strength based on your&apos;s at the end of the previous mission) should not have happened. Not only was HW1 well balanced in difficulty (if you didn&apos;t use &apos;exploits&apos;) but the high amount of resources also means players will muster up their fleet before starting the next mission in preparation and be outnumbered anyways. I&apos;m not through yet but I&apos;m anticipating problems in later missions.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is kind of strange. Combining the HW1 and HW2 races sounded nice but they didn&apos;t figure out how to handle the differences between the two games. Fighters will build individually or in squads, tech trees, Taiidan und Hiigaran fleets still almost the same, differently working building mechanics.... It&apos;s just not ONE game but two somehow mashed together. How about a game mode option for HW1 or HW2 style and build around that?
<br>
<br>*sigh* .. at least it happened but there is so much not working I hope they pull themselves together, fix all the problems and continue making good HW games like the franchise deserves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5153616">Expand</a></span>

<br>Add to that the flight and healing mechanics and a pile of other stuff no longer work like they did makes this not so much a remasterering rather a clunky remake.

<br>The fact non of the so called critic&apos;s even seemed to notice that one of the two playable factions in the first game has been completely removed tells you all you need to know about how much effort they put into their reviews.

You can really tell this was a game made with lots of care by a team with a lot of respect for the source material. I recommend it, nostalgic and awesome. Clear your schedule.</span>

<br>
<br>While Homeworld 1 has not aged all that well visually, Homeworld 2 holds up to 2015 standards ( and that is vanilla Homeworld 2 original )
<br>
<br>Herein lays the problem - maybe. The remastered package is amazing in terms of improvements for Homeworld 1 - but feels rather insignificant for Homeworld 2. - But how much does it matter? - Actually not that much.
<br>
<br>While Homeworld 1 benefits greatly visually, - its sound remains similar ( i think the weaponsounds and explosions feel a little bigger - but i might be mistaken - its been a while since i played the original Homeworld 1 ) - and its gameplay benefits from a revised UI.... - Homeworld 2 gains a few effects that had been available in various ways via mods. The visual improvement of Homeworld 2 is barely noticable on the ships and models, more noticable on the backgrounds.
<br>
<br>Cutscenes have been revised and look great - but they did look great to begin with - and the black and white &quot;kind-of-flash-style&quot; was more or less ageless anyway.
<br>
<br>For me - the biggest improvement is the compatibility and ease of access ( like a GoG title ). Even Homeworld 2 original lacked widescreen support and had some serious trouble with todays resolutions. Homeworld 1 wouldn t start at all sometimes.
<br>
<br>So a general statement about the remastered versions:
<br>
<br>It is greatly beneficial for Homeworld 1, and appreciated for Homeworld 2. That means that it is WORTH it. However - someone that knows his way around modding and already has certain mods for Homeworld 1&amp;2 ( like UI, HD skinning, shaders, resolution support etc. ) won t find much that amazes him.
<br>
<br>In terms of performance - both titles run smoothly on low end computers ( todays low end computers )
<br>
<br>To sum it all up - Players that do like RTS should get the remastered version. Players that possess the originals can still buy it without regret. Players that do not like spaceships and RTS .... i guess those should not get it.... dahh.
<br>Off of the many &quot;remastered&quot; or &quot;HD&quot; versions that come out lately - this is most certainly one that did a LOT more than just slap HD on an old title. Meshes, textures, balancing, optimization and gameplay has been adjusted to get a product greater than the original.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5042317">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s unoptimized, the game crashes often, HW1 port to HW2 engine was done bad and broke half of HW1 mechanics. I hope Gearbox will take this eriously and patch it soon so it can be enjoyable experience as originals were.</span>

<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t gotten very far into it yet but I&apos;m already seeing a lot of bugs (playing HW2 first as I expected that to have less issues as its more native for the engine). So far I&apos;ve already seen ships go flipping rapidly, missing explosion effects and damage decals. I also find a lot of the sound effects annoying and the new voice isn&apos;t nearly as good as the old one, and they removed the ability to recolor your ships. The classic version of the game has been fixed up so it doesn&apos;t flicker anymore; however, it only has openGl support now, and still doesn&apos;t have wide screen support.
<br>
<br>The game does look excellent, but its also showing far more bugs than what the originals had (and beings its just a remaster it should have been... better, than the original).
<br>
<br>Thus I&apos;m giving it a 4, 10/10 for the good graphics (and some superb title screens), not only does it not bring anything new to the game, but it removes things like recoloring your team and playing as the Tidiian.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5039522">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I like the AI.  I play solo skirmish only so that&apos;s most important to me.  Ships don&apos;t get hung up on each other anymore, they move when you tell them to provided they can, etc.  That said, this is still Homeworld.  It doesn&apos;t feel like a new game;  it feels like the old game.  There&apos;s a new interface but it&apos;s nothing you&apos;d have to relearn or anything.  It&apos;s pretty intuitive and you fall right back into the groove.
<br>
<br>Side note:  My build isn&apos;t normal, either.  Windows 7 x64, Xeon E3-1230, Z77, GTX 760, 32GB.  And I&apos;m not having all these problems with ships flipping out, bad pathing, etc.  Not in skirmish, anyway.
<br>
<br>I gave the game an 8 because Homeworld is still classic, groundbreaking, and still holds up after all this time but this isn&apos;t an original game.  I welcome Gearbox&apos;s updated interface - that&apos;s awesome.  But in the end it&apos;s still HW.  Which, I suppose is why I got it.  It deserved this remaster and I&apos;m glad to see it in widescreen, HD and all that.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t bothered with the original versions yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5043601">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dissapointing.
<br>
<br>Most of the comments giving a high score are from fans that really don&apos;t played this version. I&apos;m sorry, but it is true.</span>

This is a serious contender for greatest strategy game of all time. Challenging, beautiful and wonderfully narrated, Homeworld 1 and 2 has stood the test of time and remains as entertaining as the days when I first played each game. Highly recommended. Can&apos;t wait for Shipbreakers/part 3!!</span>

<br>That said, there are a few negatives. Cataclysm is nowhere to be found (for understandable reasons), but that&apos;s a real shame because its campaign was phenomenal. Homeworld 1 retains its infuriatingly schizophrenic difficulty curve and is ready to teach a whole new generation of players the &quot;abuse salvage corvettes while reloading 10 times in a row or get curbstomped&quot; mantra. The replayability-killing Asteroid Belt Mission Of Doom (tm) is also still there. Lots of players will give up on its campaign before it ends, as was the case back in the day. Homeworld 2 is less insane and more fair, so it&apos;s always a joy to play.
<br>
<br>Overall, a passionate facelift that still wears its gameplay warts on its sleeve. If that&apos;s what you wanted, you got it. Prepare your backsides.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5039314">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Gearbox have done a fantastic job of remastering the legendary Homeworld games.
<br>The graphics are excellent, the updated sound and visuals bring the game into the modern day and
<br>you soon forget that it&apos;s based of such an old, yet ground-breaking game.
<br>
<br>So far i have had no bugs, no crashes, nothing after 4 hours in.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer works extremely well to boot.
<br>
<br>A must buy for any RTS fan</span>

I didn&apos;t played the original one so this is not a nostalgic side of me that attracted me to this game. I just didn&apos;t seen any 3D RTS and i wanted to experiment it.

<br>I&apos;m so glad I was able to play the first homeworld and actually get to beat it this time. My only complaint is that after a few levels, Capturing the enemy fleet becomes a priority especially with capital ships. I would literally capture every enemy capital ship and just annihilate the next map. One mission, you have the ghost ship that steals your frigates and higher lvl, I just made a **** ton of bomber fighters and corvettes and bum rushed the ghost ship while leaving the 40+ frigate ships alone and bam.. my Cap of 24 Frigates just turned into 60+ frigates and a few destroyers. Just kept stealing more capital ships on and on and won the game without any effort.
<br>
<br>Then Homeworld 2 comes along and bam.. punches me in the face and then kicks me while on the ground. I dont get to build my fleet after beating objectives, computer constantly sends waves after waves of enemies while trying to build a fleet. It&apos;s a lot more micro managing than the first, but the story is pretty awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-remastered-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5160370">Expand</a></span>

The campaign itself does not work without survival-horror elements like the needleships ramming your destroyers or the asteroids being untargetable in diamond shoals. In remastered, the enemy just lets you win because the scripts do not function in Remastered, only classic.

HW2 feels just as good as it did in 2004 when I first felt love for the Vagyr.   The only thing missing is Homeworld: Cataclysm, which will hopefully be a DLC in the future.</span>

<br>This space strategy game is a wonder and a joy for the eye
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>+ The remastered graphics
<br>+ The space adventure
<br>+ The multiplayer (even though it&apos;s deserted!)
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>- There are a few bugs there and there</span>
