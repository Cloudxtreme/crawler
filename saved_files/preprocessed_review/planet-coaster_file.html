<br>
<br>I&apos;ve actually thought about shelving the game until the Spring, and then coming back to see what improves over the next few months. I played RCT3 off and on like that until Soaked! was released. Once Soaked hit, I went RCT crazy! I went even crazier with Wild! because at that point you could start building underground. Ehhhhhh... we&apos;ll see... I&apos;m hoping my interest doesn&apos;t wane too much right now, because I currently don&apos;t have any other games that I&apos;m looking forward to in the near future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6904030">Expand</a></span>

<br>Guests balancing needs a lot of work. Think about real parks. People will wait HOURS for the best coasters. This does not happen here where people will refuse to queue up or not pending on ridiculous queue requirements. I would also like to see more depth in general added. Weather and the introduction of Umbrellas from Information booths again. Ride accidents and guests fearful of getting on the ride which should effect Park Reputation. More balancing around shops too. At the moment you can have a shop open and not one person visit it. Yet other shops can be so overrun, that rides are abandoned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6896155">Expand</a></span>

<br>At least the game was somewhat fun for your first few hours before the latest patch, but then Frontier went and gave us this &quot;FREE WINTER UPDATE&quot; which introduced a very poorly implemented ride reputation mechanic that makes the game incredibly not fun. If they&apos;d spent half the time testing out their new feature as they did giving themselves butt-pats for giving it to us &quot;FOR FREE&quot;, maybe it would&apos;ve been actually a good thing instead of the terrible mess it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6902601">Expand</a></span>

If all you enjoy doing is spending lots of time placing walls and roofs over and around shops and bathrooms or building coasters then this game you will like.  But, if you want to build and manage a theme park, you should go back to RCT3 from over ten years ago.
<br>
<br>This game is pretty to look at, but simply falls short in every other category.  If&apos;s quite boring and bland.  It has lots of different coaster styles but little of anything else.  The parks are very small.  Scenery around a coaster seems to be more important than if the coaster is actually exciting.
<br>
<br>Each consecutive update breaks the game a little bit more.  I have a PC that exceeds recommended specifications, the game ran quite smooth until they began patching it.  Now, not so much.  It glitches and the graphics flicker, and more issues have come up with each patch as far as game play are concerned.  I have around 21 hours in the game, and most of that was building structures, there is not much else to do.  I have since quit playing and while hoping for some decent promised winter update with new content, sadly missed the deadline for a refund from steam.
<br>
<br>It has pretty good reviews overall, but I suspect that a lot of that has to do with how poor of a game RCTW turned out to be.  People who wanted a modern version of RCT3 so much they could almost taste it are somehow able to look past how weak this game really is.
<br>
<br>The following will tell you everything you need to know about this game.  I began a challenge park.  There is no scenario editor.  Plopped down 3 flat rides.  1 coaster.  A drink stall.  A food stall. A bathroom.  Trained my janitors and maintenance employees two levels and had $30,000 in profits in about an hour and a half with nearly a thousand guests in the park.  There is no challenge, and there is no need to worry about management because it is nonexistent.  It is merely a decent coaster builder and a boring one at that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6890593">Expand</a></span>

<br>-The game launched</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Planet Coaster as a whole feels incomplete and/or rushed. I feel like we&apos;re still beta testing the game and that it launched far too early and is missing far too many quality of life features.  The game is rich and full of content and gorgeous and ambitious, but a lot of things just feel a bit lacking, and it seems that most reviewers lean towards agreement with that.
<br>
<br>-The game launched without things like shop stock management, syncing shops, mass management of rides/guests/staff, no guest list, no scenario editor, and a few other basics from the genre including RCT3 which was entirely developed by Frontier
<br>
<br>-They added a new aspect of management just a week ago, which must have been planned well in advance. It also doesn&apos;t work very well on top of that and is the victim of a lot of criticism (ride reputation)
<br>
<br>-The game&apos;s management tools and gameplay are being regarded in essentially every review of the game as incomplete or lacking
<br>
<br>-Major tools that had been criticized through the game&apos;s entire development launched without being changed (like the path tool which had additions but is still a mess to deal with, and also noted in many reviews as being a chore)
<br>
<br>-Content was cut (Go-karts, security, picnic tables, guests getting lost, the scenario editor was planned at one point in some capacity, and I&apos;m sure there&apos;s others I&apos;m forgetting)
<br>
<br>-The game&apos;s ride count is less than half that of RCT3&apos;s base game, and also the shop count
<br>
<br>-Even new content feels incomplete, such as the shops we just got not having proper signage included. The arctic biome map was also 50% the size it should have been, which is a fair mistake to amke and was fixed within 24 hours, but it is still one of those &quot;Nobody noticed?&quot; situations where the player has to wonder how they could find something in 2 minutes that nobody on the dev team noticed at all :P Which isa problem in game development in general, not specific to PC. Almost every developer misses obvious things the players find in minutes, not Frontier&apos;s fault I suppose.
<br>
<br>-The water rides launched incomplete, log flume was updated in the winter patch with more controls and options
<br>
<br>-Game balance in pretty much every way is not balanced. Guests massively over-prefer water rides, guests hate queues that are 3 minutes long, guests storm certain kinds of shops, you&apos;re rolling in cash at all times, there&apos;s little in the way of &quot;conflict&quot;, staff training is hardly ever necessary and the benefits are not very noticable, so on
<br>
<br>-The build and scenery systems are disjointed and follow different confusing rules, and AndyC has confirmed that they were developed as separate systems when the build mode wasn&apos;t entirely figured out yet, and they simply were never unified, which I would consider incomplete implementation
<br>
<br>-There are a number of bugs with building that make it harder than it was in alphas (pieces don&apos;t attempt to auto-stack anymore, pieces drop to ground level when duplicated sometimes, pieces just in general move around in unexpected ways, stuff like that)
<br>
<br>-Many build objects are missing between different build sets (Not every set has all the same pieces to make all the same things)
<br>
<br>-Many build objects and even some rides can&apos;t be recolored when it seems like they should be recolorable
<br>
<br>-At least two building pieces (castle minaret) are apparently placeholder models
<br>
<br>-The game&apos;s scenarios were made before the map size was finalized and are thus forever stuck in small maps
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t think enough of the game&apos;s features are complete enough to count as a complete game. I do feel like I&apos;m playing an early access game. A really good one, but early access all the same.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m hoping it stops feeling like that soon enough, but for now, that&apos;s how it seems. The career mode/challenge mode are unplayable to me because the management just isn&apos;t there and what is there just isn&apos;t balanced.  Every time I go to play the game I have to fight against balance issues and tools to do what I want to do. The game is absolutely complete in terms of art assets and whatnot (except for missing building pieces) but when it comes to game mechanics, it&apos;s not quite there yet. We did just get an entire new biome and scenery set/building set, which are beautiful (the gingerbread set is my favorite in the game), but art assets are a dime a dozen and arguably the easiest thing to add to and improve. What we really need serious improvements on are core game mechanics, which feel like they&apos;re still in a sort of testing and balancing phase.
<br>
<br>Hopefully it continues to improve quickly in that regard. But I feel like we&apos;d be having a better time of it if the game was still in beta, and not considered final release, or if the beta had been an appropriate length to gather feedback on all these aspects of play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6904009">Expand</a></span>

Theme park from 1994 has more going on under the hood in regards to management and how your decisions effect visitors. No matter what you bulld your park will be full and have the exact same ratios of visitors 1:1:1, kids, teens and adults. But none of that matters because this game has..... super fan boys. People who lie about the game and down vote any one with opposing opinion, they are so loud in their praise that it is very hard to find anything out about the game. If you are looking to put scenery on a map with no consequence or care this is the game for you. If you want to play an actual tycoon game this is basically fraud.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6824858">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t get me wrong, there&apos;s a lot of stuff in this game but it feels like it&apos;s mostly scenery. I would have liked to have seen more rides. The game also fails to incororate basic ride functions such as reverse chain lift and dualing coaster operations.
<br>I&apos;m a bit shocked that weather was not included in the base game. All along, since the Alpha, I&apos;ve seen the sunshine in the bottom right corner and just assumed weather would naturally be part of the base game, but that&apos;s not so. Our information kiosks are missing umbellas from the old franchise, as a matter of fact they don&apos;t even have park maps, which seems like would be easy to add.
<br>I was pleasantly surprised in the amount of bugs that were fixed between the very last beta update yesterday until todays launch today, however some bugs do still exist, even bugs that were made aware to Frontier during the beta.
<br>Guests are too picky about queue lengths in my opinion, it&apos;s understandable that 60-70% of guests may not want to wait in a very long line but once a line gets so long, nobody will queue for the ride, regardless of how much scenery that you have in the queue. Speaking of scenery in the queue, I believe that the requirements are a bit high.
<br>The graphics in Planet Coaster are absolutely stunning to say the least. I&apos;m truly still amazed to this day of how beautiful the game looks.
<br>A lot of folks were really upset about the size of the parks and PC made them 2.5x larger but I fail to see how all of this land is going to be used considering the lack of content available in the game.
<br>The biggest issue that I have is that the game has very few management options for people like me who really want to get into the grind of running a theme park, not just building one.
<br>We really need more content, for free, in the base game. With nearly 40 hours on record with this game, including Beta, I&apos;m already bored.
<br>That button that you&apos;re about to push says was my review helpful? It doesn&apos;t say &quot;does this review agree with your feelings towards the game&quot;, so stop pushing that it&apos;s not helpful just because you like the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6815396">Expand</a></span>

Excellent graphics? Sure, but virtually every player runs into performance issues sooner or later. Simulation Involved and the infamous Guest Brain? Excellent on paper, but guests are dumb as bricks in practice. Building tools? So much potential here thanks the Advanced Movement Gizmo, Undo system and Duplicate features. But the unflexible Grid throws you straight back to the limitation of 2002&apos;s RCT2. Let alone the mentioned incomplete sets, weird glitches in the Building mechanism, finicky an inconsistent Flexicolor tools. The Signs were so promising in the first concepts but what we got today is ugly and hardly usable in many cases.
<br>
<br>I just hope Frontier really finishes up the existing half-baked aspects and systems before starting groundwork on entirely new features like waterparks, safari stuff, content packs or whatever surprises they have in mind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6905956">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There&apos;s also still a lack of signs for all the rides and shops. We are missing themed food/drink and gift shops and what happened to the unique shaped food stalls? Did those get nixed because of time constraints? I love that you guys give us these shops that go well with scenery but if you&apos;re just changing an interior give us more choices!
<br>
<br>We can&apos;t even change hats or have unique hat stalls for different themes. I also think 5 flat maps total for challenge/sandbox is very weak, there should have been more diversity in the maps for each biome. There&apos;s a reason why &quot;starter maps&quot; are popular on the workshop but you shouldn&apos;t have to rely on the workshop to get more than just a flat starter map.
<br>
<br>There are elements that are definitely lacking and feel half-baked.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6906052">Expand</a></span>

Seriously, there had been a major drought in the Tycoon series and that awful game Atari put out recently was just an embarrassment to the series. This game is great because you can access user creations through the Steam Workshop. The customization is vast. Very happy with this game.</span>

<br>However, with each update, Frontier somehow makes this game worse, introducing new bugs and poorly implemented features. And because it is a steam game there is no way to play without the updates you don&apos;t like.
<br>
<br>Biggest problems with the game:
<br>
<br>-Updates introducing bugs: Frontier put a lot of effort into patting their own asses about giving us a &quot;free update&quot; as a &quot;Christmas present&quot;. This update included some holiday decorations and rides that should have really been in the game to begin with. Oh boy, you gave us bumper cars! Maybe you should&apos;ve spent more than a week in Beta and given something that basic to use to begin with? But in addition to these &quot;free features&quot;, they also added an incredibly poorly balanced ride aging mechanic that makes your ride only new for 3 in-game months, then aging and old for 15 in-game years (1 year passes about every hour and 15 minutes of the game passing) before hitting &quot;classic&quot;. Peeps basically will not ride on &quot;old&quot; rides. So basically you either have to keep deleting and replacing the same ride every 15 minutes, or leave your ride abandoned for nearly a real-life day before people suddenly like it again. I get what they were going for, but the balance on that, like many other things in game, is total garbage.
<br>-Lack of content: There is a small handful of flat rides, and even small amount of shops, and there are many basic coasters you cannot build. No reverse chainlifts. No mixing of a launcher and a chain lift in the same coaster. No launchers and inversions on the same coaster. You can&apos;t build Boomerang or Montezuma&apos;s Revenge or California Screaming with the game&apos;s current coaster building system, because it is so inflexible.
<br>-Disconnected systems: The different systems in the game were developed by different groups that weren&apos;t talking to each other, and it shows. The scenery system is completely different from the building system, and they do not play nice together at all.
<br>-One type of terrain per map: Did you want to have a park like Disneyland with an Alpine mountain in one part and a small desert in another part? Yeah? Tough. You get desert, or you get snow, or you get grass. No mixing and matching.
<br>
<br>The game is very pretty, I will give it that. But the actual game part of the game is nearly non-existent. If I just wanted to build pretty stuff without worrying about gameplay, I&apos;d just fire up my copy of 3DS Max.
<br>
<br>I was really hoping for more. This game has so much potential, but Frontier really just doesn&apos;t seem to be giving it much effort.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6896140">Expand</a></span>

There are some problems here and there but for a Theme Park game it feels very clean. Sadly the management side of the game feels dry, boring and pretty easy which is why sandbox is the best mode because to acknowledge the greatness of the game you need to have free reign. Building is a real strength in this game and this game hands down has the best modular building out of any theme park game yet.  The terrain tool is amazing you have so much freedom with it. Building mountains, caves, and lakes has never been so simple. And finally the coasters and rides. The coasters are simple and fun you can really do anything you want with the track even though it&apos;s piece by piece. The rides are greatly designed but sadly there are not enough but I can deal with the smaller selection for now since they are adding new rides very often. Overall this game has a cartoony and realistic which brings a smile to my face since games always need a little heart but they also need a real feeling as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=7131055">Expand</a></span>

The developer has vowed to continuously support the game with updates of content for the foreseeable future.
<br>
<br>Theme park creation a core feature supported by ground breaking tools, literally. Voxel based terrain editing, intuitive and flexible editing of objects from giant rides down to individual planks of wood; flexi-paint colouring of objects just to name a few. The existing community creations have been mind blowing even at the beta stage
<br>
<br>Management of the park is in-depth from the overall work rosters of staff down to the amount of ketchup on the burgers. Balancing the books is actually an interesting challenge in the scenario mode. I look forward to the challenges of the release scenarios.
<br>
<br>Sharing via the workshop is simply fantastic and the community already has already created an awesome collection of objects, rides and parks to let you easily jump right in and make a great park of your own in minutes; or edit to your liking if you wish.
<br>
<br>The true next generation game of the theme park simulation genre. Every aspect of this game has been meticulously crafted by a passionate development team who has repeatedly shown respect to the community by listening to and acting on feedback.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6814622">Expand</a></span>

I was instantly obsessed with the idea of creating this magical place of fun and enjoyment and virtual escapism.  I then got to experience Rollercoaster Tycoon in 1999 and found out very quickly what obsession / addiction looks like.  I spent hours, nights, mornings, days, weekends playing this game. Then the sequel and eventually Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.  RCT3 was the first time that series went 3D and of course by todays standards it looks a little rough and obviously dated in the graphics department but it was still highly enjoyable and very fun to play.
<br>
<br>15ish years have passed and we have had a few attemps to revisit the genre. Thrillville, theme park world and a few others.... all failed to capture the magic that Rollercoaster Tycoon had.  It was missing a special sauce and special ingredient.
<br>
<br>This brings us to Planet Coaster.  I first heard about this game while searching Frontier&apos;s corporate website and mentioning it in a paragraph for their earnings statement on the success of their other self published game Elite Dangerous.  I instantly was intrigued and not soon after I read that there was a trailer, a pre-rendered trailer with a really catchy song and dripping with charm. I felt those feelings that RCT gave me, I felt my face get flushed with excitement but I know better because pre-rendered trailers are typically not what we get in the &quot;final game&quot;.  This might very well be the first time, ever that the final game looks BETTER than the pre-rendered CG trailer.
<br>
<br>Planet coaster makes it very easy (once you learn the controls) to create anything you want. Using a wide array of props and building objects. I must say I am terrible at games like Minecraft or other games where I have to build stuff. It just always looks... bad.  In Planet coaster that is almost impossible. Every piece/prop/item you use can be used in so many different and unique ways (look at the steam workshop for examples).
<br>
<br>The rides feel real, they exist they have physics and weight and aren&apos;t just &quot;animated&quot;. They feel like machines, big huge machines that I fell in love with as a kid dreaming of one day being able to design a theme park where it felt real and also far from reality.
<br>
<br>I often compare this game to that of a PIXAR movie... the character like Chief Beef and Coaster King and many others within the game all have charm, personality and are very very lovable and very &quot;cartoon&quot; based. But in that magical PIXAR way. Like Woody and Buzzlightyear.  But those characters exist in a real world with machines, and physics and trees and water and light...oh the lighting in this game is breath taking.
<br>
<br>I can ramble and go on for days about this game but I must tell you... this is hands down the best game I have ever played and easily the best game of the year and of the decade.  I hope you love it as much as I do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6814708">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The bad
<br>
<br>Some bugs and optimization issues at launch.
<br>
<br>No proper in-game tutorial affects the NPE (new player experience).
<br>
<br>The games&apos; systems need some time for the casual player to get used to them. From the camera to the path system to the building tools.
<br>
<br>The management simulation (especially its micro options) has not moved as far as the other aspects of the game, when comparing it to past games in the genre.
<br>
<br>More campaign scenarios needed (as well as a custom scenario editor).
<br>
<br>More content in general would be welcome.
<br>
<br>No proper modding support at this point in time. Also, the inclusion of Denuvo to the game may thwart modding.
<br>
<br>Some weird building and customization restrictions are in.
<br>
<br>The ugly
<br>
<br>The game is giving me a serious inferiority complex each time I browse the workshop.
<br>
<br>Time is passing by too fast when I play this, and at the end of each playing session I&apos;ve made...jack ****

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been playing the beta since it was made available in november 2016 its a terrific game made by a terrific company after a few hours of launched me and many other players suffered issues this was promptly sorted with two updates pushed out the same night with continuing improvements and features added throughout the week
<br>
<br>Sandbox Mode
<br>I mainly use sandbox mode to create my parks this is a great way for people who know exactly what they want as they have unlimited funds to build the craziest theme parks known to man it is also a great way to test the game and push its boundaries whether thats mastering the build and coaster controls or creating death coasters which send crowds soaring for miles like a huge set of bowling pins it really is the best way for the creative mind to play the game
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t looked to greatly in to the other modes but if your the more planning kinda of builder a do recommend the challenge mode this is a great mode as you have a small amount of money to build your park in  doing this you have to plan every plant path shop or ride to ensure you don&apos;t go bankrupt
<br>And if you are to lazy or simply don&apos;t feel like building a park i recommend the career mode this comes with prebuilt parks where you will be given set tasks to achieve each park you can choose a easy to hard task mode which you complete in three stages
<br>
<br>All in all this is a great game for any creative or planning mind and i highly recommend it if you play any sort of simulation game whether it be the rct series parkitect cites skylines or even minecraft
<br>
<br>I Wish frontier well in the future post release development and i am very excited at the possibility of coming dlc and updates which will be filled to the brim with accurate rides and hundreds of goodies</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6814620">Expand</a></span>

I very patiently followed this game from the start, it has been an incredible development to watch, they listened to the fans and gave us almost everything we cried out for, and holy cosmic cow they have nailed it! Beautiful visuals, incredibly detail, customisable rides, scenery and shops and an inspiring soundtrack. No regrets!</span>

Some nitpicks here and there regarding certain ways of constructing (e.g. struggling sometimes to build the exact path I want), but as the developers seemed to be very dedicated to addressing community concerns, I suspect most of these will be ironed out in due time.</span>

<br>
<br>So... Planet Coaster, fulfills that visual gap, and allows you to make truly stunning parks, down to every bolt and detail. You get lost in the detail for hours on hours. People talk of civ being &quot;just one more turn&quot;. Planet coaster, manages to pull the same feeling, &quot;just one more tweak&quot; and the day quickly fades away.  While some of the content is currently light on, it is all of the HIGHEST quality, there is more than enough to be creative with out feeling limited. In fact it is really endless, and the way the lighting captures my creations just fills me with smiles.
<br>
<br>Frontier have done an AMAZING job producing a game that ticks almost all boxes. I have never been so hyped for a PC game as this in the last 10 years! I&apos;m excited for the possibilities of ongoing add-ons and releases.
<br>
<br>Buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6815394">Expand</a></span>

They stole hundreds of hours of my life, especially RCT3. And then the long wait began for something that would capture that magic again, as everything else just seemed inferior.
<br>
<br>Over a decade later, you can imagine my excitement when this pops up out of the blue. Although having low expectations (you&apos;d understand that if you&apos;ve tried pretty much any theme park sim since RCT3!), it was an instant purchase.
<br>
<br>Am I disappointed again? In a word, no, but not without caveats.
<br>
<br>Planet Coaster features fantastic visuals and almost every sandbox option imaginable for a budding theme park designer. However, it falls down a bit on the theme park management side of things, but I&apos;ll come to that later.
<br>
<br>The core gameplay is fantastic, but not innovative. This is a modern take on Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, almost to a fault. That&apos;s not exactly a bad thing, as that title pretty much set the gold standard, but it is slightly disappointing to not see anything really expanded beyond that, even though the game itself benefits from the tight mechanics that the RCT series established years earlier.
<br>
<br>Graphically, it&apos;s sublime - cartoon style graphics which aid the fun factor of the whole title, and it never falls into the trap of taking itself too seriously and devolving into Football Manager for Theme Parks.
<br>
<br>That said, the title does have very obvious flaws. The biggest one is the difficulty curve - as in it doesn&apos;t exist. This is an incredibly easy title right now, and I&apos;m hoping that patches give a bit more of a challenge, as it really lets down the management aspect of the game when you are on auto-pilot 15 minutes in without any reasonable chance of failure in most scenarios.
<br>
<br>The other glaring flaw is the lack of ride variety. Sure, there&apos;s quite a bit here, but you&apos;d have hoped for a truly breathtaking array of options. It&apos;s just so-so right now. Furthermore, the menus are a bit cumbersome - not bad by any means, but could be improved.
<br>
<br>But these are nitpicks. As said, I&apos;m hoping that the game is patched and these issues are addressed, so for now I can &quot;only&quot; score it a 8, but this really doesn&apos;t need much to be a 9 or even a 10, because it could very easily be the standard bearer for the whole genre with just a few tweaks.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s worth a buy right now. This title has completely caught me by surprise, and it&apos;s a pleasure to play a title that is so clearly a labour of love from a very talented team of devs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6815848">Expand</a></span>

<br>-I had been out of the loop for a while and when I saw RCT World, I thought that was the follow up to the classic RCT games and was so disappointed with the reviews and videos of that game.  Then I found this game (not easy to find since its not in the normal stores) took the plunge buying directly from Frontier (not a bad price) and am blown away by it, especially right after launch, very few issues.
<br>-the UI is 100X better than the previous games and love that they let you upscale the text (when using a 3440x1440 monitor this is very helpful), my 7 year old would go so lost in the RCT3 menus and picked this one up pretty quickly (as did I).
<br>-Build options and ease of steam workshop to download stuff is amazing, can make your park into whatever you want (more on that in negatives though).
<br>-Biggest positive is that it feels very familiar to old games but with every little detail improved and/or expanded.
<br>-Game is beautiful at 3440X1440, can see so much of the park at once, using a 980 Ti there have been very few issues.
<br>
<br>As is this game is actually probably a 7, but I gave it a 9 because its better than I expected and I think with a few &quot;updates&quot; it will easily be a 9.
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>-from what I can tell so far you have to build coater or paths and then build ground around it to make a tunnel, vs being able to go underground in the old games pretty easily.
<br>-terrain tool doesn&apos;t always work like you would think it would, water included, could use some improvements.
<br>-there are lots of roller coaster options but the thrill/kids rides are a little limited compared to old games.  To go along with this there are no animal options or water park options, but I am guessing those will be &quot;expansions&quot; in the future (which I am okay with), just wish they had more non roller coaster ride options.
<br>-lack of scenery options, the ones they have are really cool and work great, but get repetitive if building the entire park with the same theme.  Again maybe more will come with expansions in the future.
<br>-I wish you could walk around with your Avatar, they have you create one but I think its just for the &quot;community&quot; part of the game, it would be great if you could activate your avatar to walk around the park (look around, go on rides).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6823401">Expand</a></span>

<br>Building is easy and even something simple can looks great. Sure you need to get used with the shortcuts, but these games are made to sink some time in. Plopping down stuff can be realised with blueprints from the Steam Workshop. Audio (sound effects and soundtrack) are 10/10 and you can play your own custom music on a speaker or ride.
<br>Hopefully this game does well enough and can get expanded in the near future. There are a little bit less rides compared to older games (not counting expansions), but the animation and looks of these rides got a lot more attention. In older games there were at least 5 rides that were horrible. With these you find yourself just watching it over and over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6814966">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have to admit, I was skeptic about this game in the beginning. All the animations and graphics would be too much for a PC to handle and they would focus too little on the actual gameplay and scenario&apos;s. However after seeing the first Alpha I just had to buy and try it. When the second Alpha was released I was sold, this game would be great and would be the proper sequel to the RCT franchise. Then Alpha 3 rolled around and we got even more stuff. Now they just announced the number one requested feature: water rides. This shows frontier does listen to the community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6814889">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>That being said, while it is a fantastic theme park builder, it lacks a bit in being a theme park manager simulator. I&apos;m not saying its management aspects are bad. I just really wished a little more depth was added in that aspect of the game. I personally found the campaigns very straightforward. There may be a degree of difficulty, but nonetheless the solutions are very straightforward. And with a lack of failure scenarios, there is little to no incentive in actually paying attention to all aspects of managing your own park.
<br>
<br>Then again, this is all my personal preference. And I hope - and believe - that these features might be added in future updates/DLCs.
<br>
<br>After all is said and done, Planet Coaster is hands down the current best theme park simulator of the last decade, if not of all of history.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6815090">Expand</a></span>

I cannot wait to see what insane creations will be made in the years to come.  You can really  see the care that has gone into this game and the devs have listened to community feedback every step of the way.  Well done Frontier!  Best theme park sim hands down.</span>

Planet Coaster is one of those games. I&apos;ve played lots of tycoon and simulation games over the years, ranging from Zoo Tycoon the the original Roller Coaster Tycoon. Planet Coaster is the evolution in the franchise and definitely the best game of its kind. The amount of customization in this game is mind-blowing. Pretty much anything you can think of, you can make. The terrain and coaster editors are very powerful but fairly simple to use. However, there is still a learning curve to the editors...it will take you a little bit of time before you get the hang of it. This is a brief review, because I&apos;m not going to regurgitate information on the game that you can find out on your own on just about any major review site. But, I will say...if you enjoy simulation games like Roller Coaster Tycoon at all, you should definitely get this game. I only give it a 9/10 because the management side of the game feels too easy and trivial. However, this can easily be tweaked adjusting costs and tuning some numbers-- I&apos;m sure they will address this in a future update.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6816208">Expand</a></span>

<br>The week Planet Coaster released I gave the game a 10/10 on Metacritic. I thought this was gonna be the next RollerCoaster Tycoon. The developers were close, but I&apos;m annoyed by a few things:
<br>
<br>First of all the performance. When I started my first park the game performed very well on my PC. But the more I started building the lower the frames per second got. Cities Skylines has the same problem, but it&apos;s not nearly as bad as Planet Coaster.
<br>
<br>Besides the performance problems the mechanics aren&apos;t ideal either.
<br>- Placing simple objects like benches or lampposts cost more time than it should be.
<br>- Building is unnecessary difficult.
<br>- Water isn&apos;t real in Planet Coaster. It doesn&apos;t do anything and placing it is also unnecessary difficult.
<br>
<br>Also, the simulation part of the game doesn&apos;t come close to RCT. It&apos;s all way too simple.
<br>
<br>In the end I have to admit that (Open)RCT is still more addictive and fun than Planet Coaster.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6826327">Expand</a></span>

I am a gamer since pong, and this is the best game ever made, no joking! Even if you are not into theme parks, don&#xB4;t miss this one out!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6815617">Expand</a></span>

While Planet Coaster doesn&apos;t quite reach their level of realism, the tools and controls are a little easier to learn and take less time. This game requires patience for the detail oriented people, and if you are creative, this game has limitless potential. I love the integration to steam workshop. Importing custom buildings and scenery is easy. Building something from scratch takes time but is fairly easy. You can make dark rides like those at Universal or Disney. Go on Youtube and see what people have created. Its incredible. This game has left the grid. You can make curved baths and bend the track to your will. You can also make the queue size skinny like its supposed to be. My only gripes is that you have to make a new coaster to make a transfer track adjacent to the coaster. Is it necessary? No but its all in the details. I also wish you could use launches on more coasters. RMC has a launched coaster. I should get the option to do LSM lift hills. Back to the good, the game has great management simulation. You even have fast pass options. The level of detail is above and beyond RCT3. They seriously did an excellent job. This was worth the wait.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6823194">Expand</a></span>

This is without a doubt the true successor to the Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise. The update track building system is next to flawless as is the piece-by-piece builder.
<br>
<br>However, I cannot give this full marks at the time of release because of how much the developers sacrificed in content. In comparison to how many flat rides and variations of coasters there were in previous games, PC is severely lacking. Most of these are not serious issues (drop towers and tower swings are a fixed height that you cannot change), while others are more noticeable (there is no &quot;splash boats&quot; equivalent at this time). What is more glaringly obvious, are the trade-offs in what you can no longer do with tracked rides: as far as i can tell coasters must be continuous circuit-no &quot;boomerangs&quot; or &quot;vertical velocity&quot;s here. Trains can also no longer go back and forth through the station, a la Premiere Rides &quot;Sky Rocket II&quot; model. In addition, the log flume is very limited.
<br>
<br>It sounds like I&apos;m nitpicking (because, to be fair, I am), but in my mind these are important things that have been overlooked and which greatly affect the variability of the parks you can create. My hope is that Frontier will keep developing these things to eventually add as updates or extensions. Without them, PC is still an extremely fun and intricate game that gives you incredibly creative freedom, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys building and simulation games. I just feel some things could have been further developed instead of settled.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6816865">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was very skeptical in buying Planet Coaster since I wasn&apos;t really excited by Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.... But just went for it and bought it.
<br>
<br>I have never been so sucked into a game with so much flexibility and creativity, it&apos;s crazy! And I&apos;ve only played about 5 hours so far...
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>+ So far the game feels and runs smoothly with my machine (even when there are over 1000 people in my park)
<br>+ Graphics look awesome!
<br>+ Overwhelming amount of creative tools to create whatever you want
<br>+ Rollercoaster designer is really fun (takes a bit to get used to the controls but once you figure them out its not hard to create a coaster)
<br>+ Streamlined Management and Additions that made Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 great!
<br>+ When loading a previous save game, it is really really fast loading it up (I have it on the highest settings too)
<br>+.... there&apos;s probably alot more I havent seen yet
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>- None (so far)
<br>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Amazing visual effects and art direction
<br>- Good sound music and sound effects
<br>- UI is powerful and intuitive; building a coller coaster is a joy and the only limit is your imagination
<br>- Lots of doodads for creating custom scenery and buildings
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Park management is a bit shallow and needs some quality of life tweaks
<br>- Currently a somewhat limited selection of rides compared to some RCT entries
<br>- Missing some coaster options like reverse launch and powered launch that hopefully will get added later
<br>
<br>Overall, if you have EVER played a Roller Coaster Tycoon game and loved it, buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6817581">Expand</a></span>

<br>Why this gets a 10 and not an 11, is because you need a pretty hefty GPU in order to play this game at decent settings at WQHD or UWQHD.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6815000">Expand</a></span>

The smart AI and overall animations of characters &amp; rides makes this simulation game one of the best in it&apos;s genre.

My computer is pretty solid and has never has given me trouble on any games (i5, 16GB RAM 750Ti) Once my park got to a medium size I couldn&apos;t get over 5 FPS on the LOWEST settings. If you don&apos;t have a $1,000+ rig then dont bother with this game. Hope they can find a way to optimize it better.</span>

Now, &quot;only&quot; 12 Years later they try to compete with said Franchise - and Fail. While the Game looks good , no doubt, its game-play is bland and uninspired. It seems like Frontier was more concerned, with the graphics than the actual game.</span>

I&apos;ve got about 40 hours in so far and feel like I&apos;m just getting started with it -- and loving every minute. There are at least four ways to enjoy this game. The more of these that appeal to you, the more you&apos;re likely to get from it.
<br>
<br>1. Creating. Just building an original, beautiful and fun amusement park can be very rewarding and enjoyable. Your only limit is your imagination. It&apos;s like Minecraft in this way and has really fantastic tools. The level of customization that&apos;s possible provides near limitless options. And you can share your creations with others if you wish. Building custom coasters takes the creation process even further, and the game doesn&apos;t prevent you from making something insane. This all provides a very similar satisfaction that RCT did, but the modern graphics and polish reinvent it to feel very fresh.
<br>
<br>2. Visiting your creation. Building a beautiful park is one thing, but taking a stroll around it through the eyes of any of your guests can be enjoyable in its own way. The stunning graphics and attention to detail certainly help make this feel so good. It&apos;s a near-VR experience to look all around from a first-person perspective. It brings the feeling of being at an actual amusement park -- but one you invented and feel proud of. It&apos;s also fun to walk around some of the brilliant parks that others have shared. There are parks that are more amazing than any in reality.
<br>
<br>3. Riding! From the motion to the sounds, it&apos;s very realistic feeling and a just a blast to ride any of the build-tin rides, or ones you&apos;ve created, or some of the many inventive coasters built by others in the Steam Workshop. Even if you don&apos;t care about building a park, you can enjoy just this aspect of the game. And it&apos;s not just the coasters. Sitting atop the Screaminator -- looking down on the rooftops far below really does give the anticipation of that eventual drop. And you can feel it when it does! Getting plowed into by someone in the bumper cars almost jostles your from your seat.
<br>
<br>4. Managing your park. This is completely optional. You can play entirely in sandbox mode and just enjoy the previous aspects of the game.  But if you choose, you can take on the challenge of balancing all the business requirements of running an amusement park. This has a very similar feel to the original Roller Coaster Tycoon but with even more detail and even better presentation. And you can enjoy this aspect even if you don&apos;t care about walking around your park or riding anything.
<br>
<br>To me, these four elements blend perfectly together. I enjoy them all and find myself experiencing a bit of each with each play of the game.
<br>
<br>On top of all that, Planet Coaster is extremely stable and just very solidly and beautifully made. When you consider how many hours of entertainment it can provide, you can really get your money&apos;s worth from this one. Planet Coaster is a very well-earned 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6944868">Expand</a></span>

There are surprisingly similar concepts between the two.
<br>
<br>PC is pleasant looking. I haven&apos;t figured out yet what the point is in creating my own avatar if I can&apos;t walk him around the park, but there&apos;s that initial element to the game. From there, you get to plunge right into objectives or take your time in sandbox modes. Links to tutorial videos are available, but no actual in-game tutorials, where they are sorely needed. There&apos;s some intuitiveness to the interface thanks to my Roblox experience, but  there are a lot of moving parts to the game that would greatly benefit from some early hand-holding.
<br>
<br>There are a ton of rides and pre-made coasters to choose from, and they&apos;re all well designed and animated. You can ride them virtually through camera changes. Watch from afar or up close. Even choose your seat. It&apos;s fun to watch the coaster riders from in front of the coaster looking back, as they throw their hands up on drops and scream. Passively observing bumper cars isn&apos;t quite as thrilling, but We&apos;ll overlook that. :)
<br>
<br>Once you get past the rides though, the game begins to suffer from a lack of materials to build from and populate your park with. Maybe they&apos;re expected users to supplement collections through Steam Workbench, but there is a disappointingly limited vision that boxes designs into one of only several categories: sci-fi, pirate, planet coaster, western, and fairytale. And none of the themes is very well fleshed up. You might find on choice in style of any given item at best. At worst, you&apos;ll be find your chosen them has squat in many categories. Sci-Fi in particular. The game does better with nature, but for a $45 game, I expect so many more landscaping options, path styles, not being tied down to a theme, etc. Still, there&apos;s satisfaction in laying it all out - what is available - and seeing the people coming and going. Even in sandbox mode, rides break down though (unless I&apos;m missing a setting that requires another absent tutorial) even in sandbox mode, so don&apos;t think you&apos;re going to kick back and take her easy with an infinite wallet.
<br>
<br>Lastly, the navigation suffers from two different camera modes that are both awkward. Here&apos;s where being able to physically walk your avatar through the park to inspect it and test rides would have been a much better option. Instead, you can flightsim a camera through the park at ground-ish level. Once you figure out that you can switch between modes, that&apos;s half the battle. The default setting is a strange polevault-like arcing movement that has a bit of a learning curve. The game interface is also a learning curve and incredibly tiny. Quickly finding menus and buttons is out of the question until muscle memory kicks in.
<br>
<br>TLDR: Decent graphics and excellent rides and coasters are overshadowed by lack of other content and variety, and are presented in a tiny interface with awkward camera movement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planet-coaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6934048">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is the real, good successor to the Rollercoaster Tycoon series. As much as RCTW is a fail, is this game a masterpiece. 10/10 for artwork, sound and visuals. But with some fps-issues, a small lack of rides, themes and management. But this game is definitely worth a try if you like simulation/tycoon games. Good job, Frontier!</span>
