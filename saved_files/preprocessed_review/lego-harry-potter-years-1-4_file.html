Certainly it&apos;s not as fun as Lego Star Wars, but it still holds its own.  Magic is just as fun as The Force and you get a lot of different spells to use.  Splitscreen is also a very welcome addition to the series if you co-op play; previously, you had to have both player characters in the same screen, but now you can wander off and it creates two separate views.  There&apos;s a lot of things to collect, especially in Hogwarts, and there&apos;s a detector for almost all of them so it doesn&apos;t get to be too hard.  There are tons of different puzzles and almost none of them will require an FAQ because you get stuck.  Good fun all around, and (according to Steam) at least 32 hours of gameplay.  There are a few bugs, but nothing that kills the game.  It 100% crashes for me whenever you exit the game, but that doesn&apos;t really matter.  It also occasionally crashes randomly during play, but it doesn&apos;t set you back much unless you&apos;re in a level.  I also encountered a few oddities and glitches, but again nothing that kills then game or prevents 100% completion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lego-harry-potter-years-1-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=1457965">Expand</a></span>

<br>I bought Lego Harry Potter a few years ago on Steam.  It had good reviews and sounded casual and fun (it&apos;s for kids).  I had a crappy laptop at the time, so when I encountered serious crashes every half hour or so, I figured it was my crappy laptop up to its old tricks.
<br>
<br>Last week, equipped with my modern, custom built PC, I played through the first level with no issues.  Upon loading up the second level and walking around for a few minutes, it crashed with no error message.  After several more tries I&apos;ve had to face the truth:  I will not be playing this children&apos;s game.
<br>
<br>On the plus side, if you don&apos;t experience constant crashes, its a fun and easy game, as I experienced in the first level.  Very cute and funny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lego-harry-potter-years-1-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5785888">Expand</a></span>
