<br>
<br>In terms of the story I was really impressed. It&apos;s twists and turns and you never really know where it&apos;s going. It&apos;s got this nice flash-back story thing going as well so you don&apos;t get bored in the same place/time too long.
<br>
<br>There are a few quirks on the way the cut scenes are delivered. Sometimes you get audio spats in between scenes (probably loading / unloading sounds?) and some minor other bugs. Sometimes the characters have a bit of moon-walking action going on, in the close up scenes. Also some lip syncing is completely off in some cut scenes but that could be my computer... And I&apos;m being picky. It doesn&apos;t take you out of the action which is the main thing... The puzzles between scenes can be a big gimmicky at times but I think that&apos;s just the nature of any adventure games. I did enjoy the skip button availability for complex puzzles. You get to the point where &quot;ok I see where this is going but I&apos;ve had enough of this&quot; and you can skip. Cool stuff. I really dig the story, so it always gave me the incentive to see what&apos;s next and push through puzzles.
<br>
<br>Overall very happy with this title and I&apos;m not finished with it yet. So thumbs up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-new-beginning-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=2826233">Expand</a></span>

This point and click adventure has an interesting story, and the visual aesthetic of delivering it is well executed. The puzzles are pretty entertaining and of casual difficulty most of the time, with a few exceptions of totally illogical sequences. Where this game fails itself is the sound. The voice acting is the worst I&apos;ve encountred in a really long time- all characters have colourless, almost robotic voices that instantly kill any latent character development. The rest of the audio is also very weak- no memorable musical theme, zero ambience, no effort to create any atmosphere whatsoever. Last but not least, there&apos;s an annoying amount of bugs to be found, from delayed sounds to repeating cutscenes and events.
<br>All in all, A New Beginning is a game that an adventure fan will surely enjoy, at least with a bit of patience. It does however do surprisingly well at overemphasizing its&apos; own weak points than promoting the good ones, thus failing to be noticeable near the genre&apos;s good games that tend to get ever rarer nowadays.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-new-beginning-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=3270812">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The voice acting is mediocre, but I could care less about that.  If this game had no voice acting, and consisted of text subtitles only, you would find that the dialogue and conversations are great anyway, and provoke the same human emotions and reactions from you, the player, nonetheless.  So, I can&apos;t rightfully take any strikes against this game for the voice acting--it&apos;s just so superficial.
<br>
<br>Bottom line, great story, great comic-art graphics, nice music, and absolutely worth playing!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-new-beginning-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=3888749">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, upon starting the game and playing through the very first puzzle, the chump that designed it decided it would be hilarious if they hid one of the items that you needed to solve the puzzle inside of the most illogical and horrifically stupid places possible. The methodology in which the first puzzle was completed was pretty much the way that a human being would have solved it after drinking a gallon of bleach while boiling their head in a vat of prune juice. First puzzle aside, the second puzzle was more enjoyable and the storyline progressed interestingly. However, it was at this point that my sound suddenly stopped working. I checked to see if I had accidentally hit my mute button, I triple checked the in-game sound volume, and I restarted my game about six times to try to get it to work. Alas, the sound did not return and the game decided to add further insult to injury by somehow eradicating my autosave and all of the progress that I had made so far. So yeah. I really wanted to play this game. Unfortunately, I could not play it in the end and I would rather watch someone else play it on YouTube so I don&apos;t have to experience the frustration of not only solving irrational and illogical puzzles but solving technical issues as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-new-beginning-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=3082617">Expand</a></span>

<br>One of the most important points of an adventure game, besides the puzzles, is the dialogue. So if the dialogue is difficult to follow, illogical, or plainly incomprehensible, no matter how well put together the puzzles and how interesting the art style, the game will not be enjoyable. This is what A New Beginning suffers from, an incomprehensible dialogue that tries to tell what could have been an interesting story, while providing contradictory insight into how to solve puzzles (telling you to do one thing but you actually having to do the complete opposite), and developing unlikable characters, leaving you to wonder how such a game won the German game of the year award in 2011 (...lost in translation?).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-new-beginning-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=3107163">Expand</a></span>

Immersive, memorable stories for those with the patience for good storytelling. Unfortunately, A New Beginning  Final Cut failed to live up to my expectations. With dull characters and a poor story line, I had to drag myself along and convince myself the game would be over soon. It&apos;s a shame, there was the potential for so much more.
<br>
<br>I will first cover some points that I liked about the game. I enjoyed the soundtrack. From time to time an impressive score drives the mood. I found myself just listening. Another thing I appreciate is the honest portrayal of the main character. The male protagonist shows us a life that is boring, but honest. I found it interesting to see a retiree  who could barely find the motivation to do his own dishes  come to life as he is reunited with his work. Perhaps I would have appreciated the story more if it merely revolved around a washed up, retired, old man finding his way back into a meaningful life. But, yeah.. that&apos;s not what A New Beginning stands for.
<br>
<br>I will try to keep the bad points short, but there are some issues I&apos;d like out there.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s begin with gameplay. It is linear. To be expected with adventure titles you could say. However, conversation options mean nothing because you (1) cannot fail and (2) cannot advance until you make the choice laid out for you. Sometimes you can&apos;t proceed until you pick that one infuriatingly dumb option. This illusion of freedom kills flow and immersion, but it is not the only thing to do so in this game.
<br>
<br>The story is what drives an adventure title. Titles like Broken Sword and The Longest Journey have burned their mark in my brain with epic, awesome memorable stories. They are great. The story of A New Beginning  Final Cut had me face palm in as soon as the first few minutes of playing. Time travel.. I&apos;m not going explain why it&apos;s a bad idea to revolve a budget title story around time travel. Just know that I quickly braced myself for a bad story line because of it. Next: quick disposal of non-essential characters. Basically, the characters that don&apos;t die soon after their first few lines will make it through everything and face the end. It kind of reminds me of Mike Newell&apos;s take on The Sands of Time, in which all characters die the second they are no longer pivotal to the story. It&apos;s poor writing. And characters are disposed like this as quickly as the beginning of chapter one. As the story advances it becomes a race against the clock and a fight against all odds. Yes, we are still talking about a retired scientist. Too depressed to do his dishes moments earlier, now diffusing bombs on an isolated research facility. The good-vs-evil and we-are-the-only-ones-that-can-safe-the-world-but-!-can-your-friends-really-be-trusted ending to this tale left me with a smile to know that it would soon be over and I wouldn&apos;t have to play this game anymore.. It could have been so much more..
<br>
<br>Characters. I really liked Barney, good voice actor, awesome personality. The interactions with Barney were awesome. The strong synergy between him and the main character really should have received more attention. Unfortunately, he is rather irrelevant to the story and makes only a short appearance. Apart from Barney, characters are not memorable, mostly because they are generic, predictable and horribly stupid. I don&apos;t know how a lead scientist can keep up acting like an egotistical teenager throughout the whole story, but apparently he can. Or how a freelance journalist with a private helicopter accepts a time travel story without argument..
<br>
<br>Voice acting is a mixed bag, there are some painful, cringe-worthy moments here and there. Performances for the main characters are mediocre at best. And then there are some surprisingly good talents for some of the NPCs. I expected more but for an adventure title I don&apos;t find it as important as characters or story line.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m also somewhat neutral about the detective/puzzling elements. Progress felt relatively easy. Most uses of your items are straight forward. I did find myself stuck at times, but then I simply missed an item hidden in the details of the environment. Taking a small break and later revisiting the area always helped. The puzzle mini-games can be skipped although I never needed to.
<br>
<br>To me, this game missed it&apos;s chance to be memorable. If its writing were better, characters more intelligent and the voice acting more immersive it would have become so much more. As it is, I would advice gamers to stay away from this title. If you like eco-thrillers, get it on discount.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-new-beginning-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=3478975">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game tells a story of a team of people from the future where climate change did destroy the earth as we know it and the upcoming sun storm is about to destroy the rest of humanity. To prevent that they go back in time to prevent the climate change that destroyed the world we know. In the game you play either as Fay a radio operator from the future - or an older retired scientist from the present - Bent Svenson. They team up in order to show an alternative to the nuclear power - which is supposed to be green algae. The story takes them through quite a few locations around the world.
<br>
<br>The story is interesting, a bit educational probably but that did not bother me at all and I had quite fun following it through. Most importantly it makes sense and keeps you wondering what will happen next. Well told.
<br>
<br>The levels are varied and well designed. Very well painted as well. The animation of characters is also quite nice, although scaling them to smaller sizes at times shows some problems. Cut scenes are presented through a comic like panels - they fit well within the whole aesthetic and look just good. Every sentence said by any character is spoken which is nice. For the most part the voice acting is descent - they do have some trouble with more expressive emotions but that&apos;s not that big of a deal.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed the puzzle design very much. Most of them are pretty well designed, make sense and they&apos;re well contained. You have to solve them before you&apos;ll be able to move forward. There&apos;s no jumping between multiple locations looking what to do next. And they make sense - the amount of random clicking everything on everything is quite rare.
<br>
<br>Apart from few bugs - a text displayed in wrong language or missing required item (fixable once googled) - the game has no other bigger problems. The are nitpicks that I&apos;ve had with it. The first being a rare but frustrating plot holes, when something just happens and you&apos;re not sure how it came to it. The second being the plot twist at the end - totally didn&apos;t see it coming which is good - but the more I think about it things don&apos;t add up. It brakes a bit a great story in the end and is hard to let go - more so that the story held up pretty well till the very end.
<br>
<br>Overall a very recommendable point and click adventure game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-new-beginning-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=6952329">Expand</a></span>

The game really feels german with the style of dialogs and the eco thematics. Though personally I found the cyanobacteria as alternative energy to nuclear power as a  slob indoctrination, and wondered if the story isn&apos;t some sort of ad to this (knowing that Germany already plans to shut off all nuclear power by 2036).  But the ending is pretty well polished, giving a sense to it. The moral of the story remembers me on the book of Rachel Carson&apos;s silent spring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-new-beginning-final-cut/user-reviews?user_review_id=6865937">Expand</a></span>
