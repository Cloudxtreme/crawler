The original Team Fortress was a free mod for Quake 1 that came out in 1996, and it forever changed FPS games. TF was the first game that really focused on class based team play. So many games follow that model now. Team Fortress 2 is not quite the same game as its 1996 incarnation. The game no longer has grenades, it has a slower pace, and at a competitive level, it actually requires teamwork to win. Team Fortress 2 has been out for over 3 years now and it is only growing in popularity. The competitive community is getting bigger, and it shows no signs of slowing down. If you are looking for a fun FPS with lasting appeal, Team Fortress 2 is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1536142">Expand</a></span>

TF2 however impresses me, yes it doesn&apos;t have the skill level of the original TF but the removal of grenades has definitely benefitted the gameplay. It put a huge smile on my face the first time I played, which is still there. Superb!</span>

The hit box lag is awful and the sniper even though ur on the head and u take the shot it wont count. yes the game is exciting but only when u do well. And the game seems to demanding on computers when u play it. it shows u the recomended but yet its still very chopy u could have made the game easier to run and make it more balanced so that every person who plays it gets a far chance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=22686">Expand</a></span>

What makes TF2 so unique, is that every class is very fun, while still extremely balanced. There&apos;s no classes that nobody likes to be, or are useless to the game.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also very fun, because you can play the game as seriously as you want to. It can be a game to just kick back, have some fun, or it can be a game played seriously with lots of  teamwork and strategy. I love the humor in the game too. The taunts are all funny, but my favorite is the Demoman&apos;s taunts.
<br>
<br>The graphics, sound, and gameplay are all unique and top notch, and the game itself is very polished, and frequently updated using Steam which makes updating a breeze. Overall, this game is just great, and you will not be disappointed by it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=18277">Expand</a></span>

The class-based gameplay makes it for a lot of variety and teamwork - it&apos;s almost 9 games in one. The game, for example, completely changes from a typical FPS experience with the Soldier to a stealth game with the spy to a strategy game with the Engineer. Fantastic.</span>

Valve saw this as an opportunity and released Team Fortress 2. There are nine different classes you can choose from, from the stealthy spy, who sneaks up using disguises and invisibility and delivers devastating blows from behind, to the subtle-as-a-brick heavy, who, with his miniguns and sandvich in hand can deliver a world of pain and delicious-ness on the field. The classes are all perfectly balanced and have strengths and weaknesses that make sure that your class reflects only your playstyle. There are also dozens of weapons and even more hats to further customize your individual classes. Major updates give out free items to players, players can buy them from an in-game store for real-world money, or they can trade other players for items. They can also get items for earning Steam achievements, or from &quot;crafting&quot; items together to make a better item.<br>The gameplay is great, and it never feels frustrating like some other games do. You can get into the console if you&apos;re an admin and do all sorts of crazy stuff in your game, at the price of not being able to get achievements and stats tracked. All updates are free, and you never have to pay for &quot;map packs&quot; or &quot;expansions&quot;. It&apos;s also loads of fun to be part of the TF2 community. Every event has a cool new hat or accessory for your character to show that you were there. Some games on Steam offer hats and weapons with pre-order, like Portal&apos;s companion cube pin.<br>I could talk about Team Fortress 2 for hours, but Metacritic will only give me 5,000 characters and I&apos;m lazy, so I&apos;ll just say that Team Fortress 2 is one of the best values out there (at $10 on PC as of this review), and an even better value when bought as part of the Orange Box. There&apos;s just so much you get besides the already amazing gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1663680">Expand</a></span>

Playing basically the same thing over and over again won&apos;t make sure you stay playing for that long.

It keeps making me want to come back to play it! I don&apos;t see it as a serious game at all, just a game where I can have fun, which is what made the updates so effective to me. People complain about the fact that the updates ruined the game, but I disagree. At least they CARE about the community and add items which you DON&apos;T have to buy. Another point is that the game is VERY balanced and Valve try to make each weapon have its unique disadvantages that can be countered by another weapon. Because of each class being balanced and having it&apos;s unique weakness I feel as is TF2 is a very skillful game that makes you focus on what class to choose with what weapon in order to counter the opposing team and win. There are a couple of bad points to the game however. One is that Valve made specific items buy-able only, and seeing as the prices of nearly EVERY item in the shop are outrageous (I mean &#xA3;3.50 to change the name of a weapon?!? and &#xA3;2 to change its colour?!?). One of the reasons for the outrageous prices may be the fact that the game is now free to play, so it may be a little difficult to make profits. Another little flaw to the game is its critical hit system, as it takes A lot of skill out of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2489839">Expand</a></span>

My true review score is 7/10) when I tell you that this is my favorite game in the entire world. I read through at least a few dozen negative reviews and realized that a lot of them brought up very good points. I got this game back in 2009, only shortly before it went F2P. At first, I was kicking myself for not waiting another few months to get it. I still feel that way to this day. But after reading so many reviews complaining about &quot;whiny little kids&quot;.........I realized that they we right. The **** that people will buy on the steam store turns them invincible. Amd when they die, they always, and I mean ALWAYS, scream their **** lungs off. Now I&apos;m GLAD I got a few months free of whining and being destroyed by a demo night. It ruins the game. And while I still love it more than any other game, I admit it has been hurt DRASTICALLY by becoming F2P. I&apos;m almost pleading valve to either make you pay for it again, nerf the weapons, or both. I hope you guys take what I said into consideration. Nonetheless, I highly recommend the game if you&apos;re looking for a wild good time, where you can get decapitated with a golf club and not question how. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2524936">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s really fun to play casually, I relax with TF2 when I&apos;m stressed. It&apos;s fun to play more seriously because it&apos;s surprisingly deep. The classes are well balanced and distinct from each other. The graphical style is fantastic. It&apos;s not just pretty it&apos;s well designed from a utility perspective. For example every class has a unique sillouete that&apos;s instantly recognizable. This makes understanding what&apos;s going on in frantic firefights, and they&apos;re always frantic, very easy. Every facet of the game has that kind of polish and thought put into it.
<br>
<br>Unlike some online games *cough* L4D2 *cough* the community is mostly friendly and tolerant. It&apos;s rare to see players kicked for no good reason and people aren&apos;t prone to rage every time something goes wrong. If the teams are seriously unbalanced more often then not the team with the advantage will vote in favor of a team scramble to even things out. I realize that isn&apos;t part of the literal game but I think it&apos;s important to mention about a title that&apos;s completely multiplayer based. TF2 is made more fun to play by the fact that the average TF2 player is not a total jerk.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2850054">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve spent about 1000 hours on this game and it still feels fresh. Some users can be very annoying though, but this game it&apos;s one of my all-time favourites. The classes are balanced, and teamwork is essential. A game that you must play, overall, because it&apos;s completely free.</span>

A wide variety of weapons is always a good thing. The classes and weapons are very balanced  which is quite impressive considering the amount of available weapons and he 9 vastly different classes. Kills are not that important, instead the game tries to guide you to help your team and what is remarkable is that in TF you can have a good life without killing a single person. You can&apos;t be MVP without being credit to team.

Nine characters - the scout, the soldier, the pyro, the demoman, the engineer, the heavy, the medic, the sniper, and my favorite, the spy. Anyone who does not have this game needs to get it right away, it&apos;s free. It&apos;s the best game I&apos;ve ever played on steam, get it, play it, love it.</span>

Honestly, i think that this game is among the best of the FPS genre. The classes are very well balanced, but medic can be overpowered at times. The trading system in this game is very unique, and i found myself bargaining for hats several hours past bedtime.
<br>Team Fortress 2 caters for both newbies and FPS veterans, in the sense that although TF2 is generally a casual game, it has a great competitive scene and a very high skill ceiling.
<br>The major flaw i found while playing this game was the lack of &quot;progression&quot;. Although there are achievements, the game generally does not reward you for having spectacular aim, or getting 50 headshots in a row. Sometimes, i really feel ripped off when i get nothing when i completely own the opposing team, except some points on the scoreboard. Another flaw in the game is how the scoreboard works. The scoreboard should reset on every new game, because the current scores really only measure how long you&apos;ve been on the server.
<br>Overall, TF2 is a great game that is certainly worth your time. It&apos;s definitely superior to Call of Duty, and many other FPS&apos;s out there
<br>9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2931925">Expand</a></span>

Each class is a really funny, cool and interesting character with an unique and awesome personality. Youre not running around with an AK47 or M16, but with Syringe Guns and Sticky Bombs, its quite hilarious.
<br>
<br>Sure, the game changed but its core is still the same. I played TF2 the very first time in 2008 and its basically still the same. Its not about Hats are whatever, its still about working as a team in order to beat the other one.
<br>
<br>Whats wrong with the Hat-hating anyway? Youre not forced to buy anything and besides that its a fair system with mostly cosmetic items for sale. Weapons drop and are pretty much accessible for anyone.
<br>
<br>Other than that, TF2 has an amazing fanbase and community. I also love all the fun gamemodes like Baloon Race, Prop Hunt or VS Saxton Hale. There is so much to see, this game usually never gets boring. When i look back, i had such a great time in this game until now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3380892">Expand</a></span>

An awesome team-based First Person Shooter with an interesting art style which is uniuqe to other games. TF2 has 9 balanced classes with many different weapons and gameplay. Each class has their job to do to contribute to their team to reach their objective. Which could be capturing the point or capturing the enemy&apos;s intel. Each class has their own way to helping their team may it be building defenses or keeping team mates alive or disrupting the enemy team. They all have thier advantages and disadvantages, no class is overpowerd or even considered &quot;god like&quot;. The 9 classes all have different personalities, looks and nationalities. Other games you&apos;ll just play as a souless generic soldier, mercenary that just say &quot;Capture the point!&quot; or &quot;Ugh&quot;. Where as TF2 you&apos;ll play as CHARACTERS with different personalties. The scout may say &quot;BONK!&quot; or the heavy may say &quot;Entire team is babies!&quot;. Also   Recieves updates weekly with mini updates and then huge updates which occur around in 4 months. TF2 has a large and friendly community, adding mods, items, maps, etc.
<br>Hats
<br>well I don&apos;t see in anyway that adding hats has made the game worse. Though it may be added to make Valve have cash  so what? Other companies such as EA and Activision do differenet maybe similar marketing strategies. MMOs such as Maplestory and others make money via cosmetics. Besides you DON&apos;T have to pay at all. No one forces you to pay for a hat. Valve may persuade you as Premium as you get more backpack slots. BUT Valve still does not force you to! It&apos;s not as if Valve will delete your account if you don&apos;t pay under 1 week if you&apos;re a free-to-pay. It&apos;s your choice and my choice whether you or I want to add money for hats. You and I could play Team Fortress 2 completely free paying $0.00 forever. But I decided to pay since I just felt like paying Valve for such a great game. You could think that each transaction for a hat is instead of paying Valve for a virtual hat instead for giving valve free money for a great game and getting a thank you in a shape of a cosmetic item.
<br>Now about Team Fortress going free-to-pay
<br>I don&apos;t see what&apos;s wrong with it, I mean isn&apos;t stuff thats free usually good? It might of brought alot of new players but whats wrong with that? Whats wrong with playing unexperienced players that want to try something new? Everyone used to be bad at a certain game and the only way to get good is to keep on playing. I mean the Team Fortress 2 community is still strong and healthy for 6 years! Thanks to the free-to-play update the community is bigger than ever! What if there was free-to-play. There wouldn&apos;t be as much players as there are if it wasn&apos;t f2p and TF2 would of slowly died. TF2&apos;s community is built up of 5-12 year olds after the f2p update? That ain&apos;t true and if it was so what? Sure they may be annoying but eh deal with it. Call of Duty and Battlefield also has the same problem. Players are bad? Everyone starts off bad. I myself  started off free-to-play and was bad. Now that I have played the game for some time, I wouldn&apos;t consider myself bad or horrible, just in the higher middle (6/10). Everyone just gets better by playing the game and it can&apos;t hurt to have more players.
<br>Now about the &quot;Unbalanced Weapons and Classes&quot;
<br>Let&apos;s see. That laser weapon people keep complaining? The Cow-Mangler 5000? It&apos;s a pretty underwhelming weapon now that it&apos;s received it&apos;s nerf sometime ago. Even so in it&apos;s un-nerfed state you&apos;re not a god at all. Sure you may be able to kill a couple people but there is always a way to be killed. Such as a Pyro reflecting the projectiles, Heavy Medic couple, Team Work? TF2 certainly is not pay to win as anyone can craft the weapon or find it. The new weapons may seem overpowerd but there is always a way to beat it and if it&apos;s really ridiculous it&apos;ll prob receive a nerf pretty soon. Laser weapons not following the 60&apos;s art style? Yeah it is it&apos;s what you call retro futuristic, look it up. No class is overpowerd.. It may seem so at times but thats just the player being really good as they may be playing competitive. Spy is overpowered? He could insta-kill you and you&apos;re team mates but thats up to your team. The point of the game is to work together as a team and if you do the spy probably could die before he could go on killing spree. The unlockables sometimes are, somtimes aren&apos;t direct updates to the defaults. Sometimes the best weapons are the defaults.There may be some weapons better than the default or others but still theres always a way to beat the person wielding the &quot;god gun.&quot;
<br>I am going on a HUGE rant but that is all I see people giving such a great game a low score. People may say this game is repetitive but I find Call of Duty and others far more reptitive. Call of Duty, Battlefield, Halo are all great FPS in their own way but I always find my way back to playing TF2. In the end TF2 is my favourite FPS out of many others since it is creative, unique and overall FUN.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3119181">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s a great game that was worth the price tag back when it actually had one, so now that it is completely free there are no excuses to not give this game a go. Sure there are still aspects of the game that cost money, buying new weapons ,or more importantly Hats, but if you decide to not put a penny into this game you won&apos;t feel underpowered, almost all weapons and hats can be unlocked or crafted and even then they all have there pros and cons in order to balance them out with the default starter kit, completely avoiding becoming a &quot;Pay to win&quot; game as many Free to Plays are nowadays.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t go into this game thinking you&apos;re going to do well first go, you will only find yourself getting annoyed and wind up hating this game. Sometimes it&apos;s just down to luck if you join a server filled with Pro players with weeks of game time logged or you get stuck playing against a bunch of noobs. The healthy middle ground of auto balancing should keep your games competitive and interesting.
<br>
<br>What makes this game different to any other FPS game out there you ask? Well this one actually requires teamwork to win. No, I don&apos;t mean everyone on your team has to be in Skype together plotting tactics and manoeuvres, I simply mean that if all of your team decide to play as scouts, then your defences are going to be very lacking, alternatively if you all role Engineer then offence is going to be hellish. The class system keeps games interesting in that you don&apos;t know what will come round that corner next; A scout with his little shotgun, or an Ubercharged heavy with his Minigun blazing.
<br>
<br>Serious gamer or mess around with friends this game gives you everything you&apos;d want from an FPS game, and don&apos;t forget... it&apos;s free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3173136">Expand</a></span>

Originally planned for realism, over the years it turned to a more cartoon-style look, creating the now well-known characters of the Heavy and Spy. Currently holding a 92 from critics on Metascore after its 2007 release, ensuing years in Beta, TF2&#x200B; has become one of the most recognizable games by Valve. However, does it deserve its rating and popularity? Is it another Skyrim (hate it)? Or is it a The Walking Dead (love it)&#x200B;? Well, let&apos;s look at the Pros and Cons.
<br>
<br>PROS: Fun gameplay, memorable characters, funny lines of dialogue, multiple fun gamemodes, and the creation of multiple internet memes.
<br>
<br>CONS: Gameplay can get boring after much play (as with any shooter), the F2Ps are usually bad players and generally hated for it, hat simulation, griefing, and, as always, annoying kids with microphones.
<br>
<br>So, is it worth it? Most definitely. Although it has some problems, it is, overall, one of the best first-person shooters on the market. Plus, currently (and likely forever), the game is Free-2-Play on Steam. I highly suggest it.
<br>FINAL SCORE: &#xFEFF;10  Amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3128549">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re having problems, switch classes, switch game modes, there are plenty of things to do to keep the fun going. The best part is, all of the game-play is available for the relatively low cost of a half-day download. And If you so desire, a simple dollar will allow you to trade items in the community metal-based economy. Do you feel like wearing a pink hat with bunny ears while tearing through your foes with your mini-gun? Go right ahead. Overall, Team Fortress 2 stands out among other shooters with its extreme versatility and unique versatility.

Team Fortress 2 falls right in that category. It&apos;s not as fast as Quake Arena but it&apos;s not as slow as Call of Duty. TF2 is a unique class based and team focused game that makes these ideas work better than in any other game with these same characteristics. Unlike other class based games (Brink, Battlefield...), the classes in TF2 are all very dependent on each other and are all important for the success of the team. They are also very different from each other while in other games they all look and play the same. Different classes also require different sets of skills, so, you need to know the advantages, disadvantages, and abilities that all the classes have if you want be able to play with all of them. TF2 has an average number of modes and a nice amount of maps, but, in the end, it&apos;s all about the items. TF2 is known has being all about hats. The game really has lots of hats, but it also has a nice number of weapons, items that give you buffs and other stuff you can equip your character with. After this game went free to play, you would expect a cash shop to show up or something, but instead, Valve implemented a random drop system that gives random items to players on a regular basis while they are playing. Free players don&apos;t have access to all the items but they can get all of the main items (which is really all you need). And then there is this...By the time you get tired of getting the same items over and over again, you can trade them for other items at certain websites, you can craft them into other items or you can consider the fact that this game is so popular that most items you get in the game are worth real money  so you can trade them for other games or even sell them at the Steam Marketplace (yes, you can make money by simply playing a free game). With that said, the gameplay is smooth and enjoyable (as usual in source games) and the graphics are very nice looking and are doing a good job of aging slowly (as usual in source games). This is the best you can get on the Free 2 Play market, so, it gets a 9 out of 10 because there is no such thing as a 10 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3149260">Expand</a></span>

Interesting classes and fun game modes, but can get a bit boring if you play on the same server all the time. If you are thinking about getting it then I recommend that you do as it is free and great fun for a while!</span>

I&apos;ve been playing this game for a long time and the constants updates kept me playing. Although the game feels a bit unnatural at times I believe it is a normal feeling because of the graphic style it is very unique and it is one of it&apos;s great features. The crafting, the collectible hat and many variety of guns make the game feel more vast the many maps and game mods are a nice feature too.

It&apos;s actually even a good point.
<br>TF2 is really fun, and lots of people already spent hundreds and thousands of hours on it. There is a reason. It just put the basis of class-based FPS games and never went down. It keeps evolving, without forgetting its basis. Even if a lot of content is added, it&apos;s only cosmetics, new maps or new weapons that offer new ways to play a class. It&apos;s all about keeping the game strong.
<br>And not only is the official content more than enough, there is plenty of fun mods that will entertain you when you get a bit bored of the game. Only to let you come back to the normal game again.
<br>There is nothing not to like about TF2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3520109">Expand</a></span>

It has nine classes that are well balanced, even with the addition of new weapons, and have different abilities, such as the Spy who can cloak and get behind enemy lines or the Heavy who can clear a room full of enemies with the help of the trusty Medic. Hats have been added to the game to showcase the players preference in style, today in TF2, it is becoming more difficult to find two players in the same match wearing the same hat and misc items because hundreds of hats and miscs have been added to the game, allowing a wide range of customization. TF2&apos;s innovative game mode &quot;Payload&quot; gets my vote for best multiplayer game mode ever! It is a blast to play on any of the official maps (especially Goldrush and Thunder Mountain) and very rarely will get old. There is also CTF, CP, Attack/ defend CP and KOTH to choose from among other modes. This truly IS the most fun you can have on any game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3372536">Expand</a></span>

This game is content packed, as Valve keeps updating this game (which is awesome), lots of maps, items, and hats to find. I very well enjoy this game, and since it is F2P i recommend anybody to go get this game now!</span>

The game is FREE to play. It has at least 500 hours of gameplay. It has slick smart graphics that birthed the art design of dishounred and other games. Its replay value is awesome as you will be going on for 20 hours every day getting hats  costumes and weapons. There are about 200 hats to buy and 100 costumes to buy and about 150 weapons to buy(also you can craft and you can unlock them insted of buying) but there are secret weapons ,costumes and hats and once you feel you have got them all  which you probley have not  there are strange  very strange  glendary and much more versions of an item at first this may seem stupid but since these are very rare this encourges trade another imploment to this game or you could just show off  With quite literally 1000&apos;s of servers you&apos;ll wont be bored. There are unique gamemodes like capture the flag  king of the hill and payload or the normal attack/defence. Payload is a fun gamemode where one team is trying to push the cart while others are trying to stop you and there is a payload race where both teams race  to the end.TF2 consits of 9 classes 1. The Scout has low heath but is very fast and offencive and has a shotgun pistol and baseball bat  2. The soldier is slow but has a rocket launcher and can rocket jump he has a lot of heath and a shotgun and shovel 3.  My favourite the Pyro this nifity guy has a good amount of health (just under the soldier) but is not slow yet not fast he has a flamethrower to check for spies when they are cloacked a comprossion blast to throw foes back and a fire axe  Quickly so I just mention every charcter and class is voiced over and has there own jokes and tricks and taunts. 4. The Demoman is a heavy scottish drinker and has  a grenade launcher a sticky grenade launcher  bascially how this works is that this type of grenade sticks on to everything when you right click it blows up  he also has a bottle of whisky  5. The Heavy he has a large Minigun a shot gun and boxing gloves he is very slow and has the most health in the game. 6. The engineer can make sentry and upgrade them he also can make dispencers that give health and upgrade that and he can upgrade and place teleporters he has a shotgun a pistol and a wrench  7.The Medic has a needle gun and can heal people by using the healing gun he also has a saw .8.The sniper has a very small amount amount of health but has a very powerful sniper rifle when he gets a headshot he kills instantley he also has an SMG and a machete  9. The spy can cloak and go invisble and when he back stabs he kills instantley he also has a revolver and he can look like to the other team like hes one of them but then he brings out the sapper a device that breaks any thing the engineer builds  TF2 (Team Fortress 2  is the ultimate game and does nothing wrong every game should  espically fps games) should want to be like TF2</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/team-fortress-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3382947">Expand</a></span>
