For one, it&apos;s not particularly original since the essence of time loops and teenagers are as familiar as vanilla. However, it is the way this short title achieves is its achievement. The use of dialogue and visual/audio appeal lend to at times unsettling atmosphere, that is until you figure out where the story is headed towards the end.
<br>
<br>The characters in Oxenfree won&apos;t be stuck in my mind for years to come, but they are fleshed out and serve the story very well and the fact that you can alter their outcome in the end is more than welcome. For a small title, there is a shocking amount of detail put into the game from the amount of dialogue to the literal detail in the environment you explore. Edwards Island has very discernible locations and the music that accompanies you is of superb quality.
<br>
<br>Despite this, Oxenfree does shockingly little out of the ordinary in terms of storytelling. As I mentioned before, the time loop caveat is quite predictable but the well rounded cast makes you want to see it through to the end. It&apos;s replayable but more so in the sense of what different choices you make rather than actual game mechanics, which is fine. It is important to note that Oxenfree is a pure story based adventure game; it isn&apos;t fun but it is engrossing at times. When Oxenfree isn&apos;t hitting it&apos;s high notes, it&apos;s run of the mill and almost yawn inducing, but when it hits its high notes its oddly poignant and touching and the music alone makes me want to purchase the soundtrack, so that&apos;s a definitely plus for a story that relies on Groundhog Day (the film) mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oxenfree/user-reviews?user_review_id=6881148">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I liked the visuals, especially the world which was very detailed and almost lifelike, which made the character models look out of place as a result, though. The audio was OK as a package, I liked the voice acting but I really disliked the music and it never looped well, you could always hear where it was stopping and starting again, there was no flow to it. Gameplay wise it&apos;s as basic as it gets, directional movement, use, radio, map, that&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>The story is always the most important part and it was good and more importantly your choices matter! And it&apos;s not just the last few choices ala Telltale games, all your choices matter and will shape your ending of which there are many which gives this game good replay value. Overall a charming little game that got a little slow and boring at times but ultimately was enjoyable enough to recommend to fans of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oxenfree/user-reviews?user_review_id=7327961">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ The soundtrack is pretty spectacular for setting the atmosphere, I only wish there were more of it
<br>+ The characters are very well-acted and have some very good dialog, and the options given lead to notably different conversational paths
<br>? The dialog system was unique and interesting, but has some issues with the &quot;interruption&quot; mechanic, which feels a little stilted and often makes it feel like I&apos;m blocking myself from hearing the other characters if I want my own character to be involved in the conversation or to interact with the environment
<br>? Generally good collectibles/exploration system, but finding the hidden signal stones frustrated me as they blend into the background art sometimes; finding the letters with the radio is a lot easier, though they&apos;re scattered pretty far and wide when there&apos;s not any other reason to explore left, which is annoying
<br>- I really like the mythology and ideas behind the story, but I really wish they had done more with it; it felt like it had a lot more potential than what was explored
<br>- It wasn&apos;t entirely clear what ultimate consequences some major choices could have throughout the game or by the end; I liked the choices overall, but compared to other adventure games, the results of my actions were sometimes fairly surprising (both a pro and a con)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oxenfree/user-reviews?user_review_id=6015664">Expand</a></span>

The 1980&apos;s teen Goonies-esque vibe works really well and sets up a legitimately creepy atmosphere. The conversations flow incredibly well and the dialog is clever and well-written. I found myself genuinely interested in these five teenagers and their stories. It reminded me of Life is Strange in some parts, and I think that&apos;s a very good thing. The visual style is absolutely gorgeous and the soundtrack is phenomenal, and both help establish the excellent atmosphere that hooked me into this game. The story intrigued me from start to finish and even if it doesn&apos;t all completely make sense in the end, I thought it did a great job of keeping me guessing throughout. It takes some really interesting turns, and there&apos;s a insanely cool mechanic integrated into the game that&apos;s revealed towards the end that I obviously won&apos;t spoil, but enhanced my experience that much more.  However, I can recognize that the game does have flaws. The pacing is inconsistent, especially towards the end. Some parts dragged and other important moments felt a little glossed over. I did notice an unusual framerate issue a few times and the game crashed on me once, during an important moment. Still, these flaws didn&apos;t hurt my experience with the game. Oxenfree is one of the most surprising and intriguing games I&apos;ve played in quite some time, and I really hope it gets the attention it deserves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oxenfree/user-reviews?user_review_id=6020977">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>SOUND: Sound is well developed to serviceable.
<br>
<br>SOUNDTRACK: It is workable but not memorable.
<br>
<br>VOICE: Excellent voice acting.
<br>
<br>STORY: A good story but hard to follow at times, mostly because you will most likely need to play through multiple times to get all of the story to unfold.  Its interesting but frankly was not engaging enough to get me to play it more than once.
<br>
<br>GAME PLAY: Aside from dialogue choices you &quot;tune in&quot; to various objects to unveil events and stories.  This game is not a powerhouse of game play but it works well enough to progress the story.
<br>
<br>OVERALL:  If you like adventure games and/or narrative driven pieces this would be a decent purchase on a substantial sale.  Otherwise I would pass on this game.  If you are really into narrative pieces and think you can stand back tracking and having multiple play throughs then I would consider buying it since it is decent and has a low price point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oxenfree/user-reviews?user_review_id=6527625">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you get to play this game, don&apos;t play it once and then stop. Play it again right away. The supernatural stuff you saw during your first playthrough &quot;bleed through&quot; to your second &quot;timeline&quot; and the story goes deeper still. Not to mention that you can get multiple endings based on your play style. ;) Those hidden trophies are there for a reason.
<br>
<br>I just love this game so much despite the massive bugs I got, but I&apos;m a full time video game tester, and I attribute most of these bugs to my mac just being too slow. I don&apos;t generally game on my mac so it&apos;s forgiven.

The plot and themes are solid, but the meaningful character interactions and fantastic dialogue system help push the game to a new level&#x2026; Minor flaws aside. After my 5 hour journey was complete, It felt like everything had been a real adventure, and one that I&#x2019;m happy I was able to have.</span>

<br>I absolutely loved it. The game has a great story about young teenagers going to an island for a party. They bring a radio with them that&apos;s able to pick up strange transmissions throughout the island. And just by mistake with the radio they&apos;re opening a rift to the ghost realm. And now they have until dawn to figure out what&apos;s going on.
<br>
<br>First thing to note about this game is amazing soundtrack and superb voice acting. The visuals are pretty decent but it&apos;s the audio layer that makes this game.
<br>
<br>The main mechanic of Oxenfree is the dialogs. As the game revolves around the characters interacting with each other you get limited time to select a dialog option - if you don&apos;t decide the characters continue talking as if you decided not to talk. The writing is pretty clever and feel natural and your choices do matter in the end. Depending on them a game can end up one way or another - and that does not mean necessarily difference between good and bad - just different.
<br>
<br>Apart from that although you control directly the main character you have little choice. You know basically where you need to go - and though you can take different paths - it does not really matter. So your only job is to get from one place to another and trigger another dialog sequence. It&apos;s cool that you can still move while in dialog but it doesn&apos;t do anything. The other in game puzzles are so simple it&apos;s hard to call them puzzles. It&apos;s just a matter of tuning the radio in the right spot. Everything other is pretty obvious.
<br>
<br>I feel there are some hidden stuff in the game - things I didn&apos;t really bother to look for but the whole story is quite interesting and details placed here and there make it feel even better.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s just an interactive story with dialogs choices that make a difference but do not matter in the grand scheme of the story. With a great atmosphere - that reminded me for some reason of the &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. Loved the experience and the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oxenfree/user-reviews?user_review_id=7361916">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphically, it&apos;s a simple enough game, but there really is charm to those washed out 2D backgrounds, as well as to the characters.

It was fantastic as most characters had purpose the only thing is Nona felt like she didn&apos;t need to be there as the story wouldn&apos;t of changed much. The music throughout the whole game is amazing and really makes the game a completely different experience as one time you could feel happy and not worried and then complete tone switch also the ending is very good as it does rap up with things also with a kinda telltale ending showing the choices you made. The only thing is the *continue timeline* at the end could have more reason to play as it is very repetitive as not enough changes are made to keep the player playing. But overall fantastic game and is worth buying even the price is a little high for the time span it offers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oxenfree/user-reviews?user_review_id=7143314">Expand</a></span>

You play as Alex, one of five young people who are going out to Edwards Island to drink towards the end of their senior school year. You are hanging out with your friend Ren, and you have drug along your new step-brother, Jonas, because you didn&#x2019;t want him feeling left out. The other two characters are Clarissa &#x2013; a character who strongly dislikes Alex for reasons we discover through the story &#x2013; and Nona, Clarissa&#x2019;s best friend, who Ren has a crush on.
<br>
<br>The game is in some ways not very removed from a walking simulator &#x2013; there is precious little actual gameplay here in terms of action. You wander around, pushing a few buttons, and on occasion use a radio to tune into a broadcast signal, but all of this can be accomplished via trial and error. The game is pretty linear, without much variation beyond choosing which of two characters you want to try to save first.
<br>
<br>But the game is not really about what you do in terms of physical actions, but conversation. Throughout the game, there is fully voice-acted dialogue which happens more or less continuously as you walk around through the environment, with one or more of your companions on the island chatting with you, as well as the spirits haunting the island. You can choose from up to three (and it is almost always three) dialogue options, or you can choose to remain silent and allow the conversation to continue on without you. Time to interrupt or chime in is limited, and the conversations feel pretty natural in terms of the actual dialogue, with all of the characters being believably written. The only real flaw is that sometimes, when you chime in, your character will wait for an appropriate moment, and at others, they will simply cut things off mid-sentence.
<br>
<br>Still, this conversation system is interesting, and it works well in practice. It is a good way of establishing character, as well as, in effect, roleplaying &#x2013; how does Alex want to interact with others? Is she willing to sell one of her friends up the creek to save her own skin, or is she determined to help everyone, no matter how angry she is at the moment? Does she like her new step-brother, or is she pushing him away? Does she help her friend Ren with his crush, or tease him about it?
<br>
<br>Moreover, the fact that there&#x2019;s so much dialogue helps to keep the game feeling full &#x2013; you are usually interacting with your companions, which keeps things from getting dull, as fundamentally all you are actually doing is wandering around a spooky island at night with stylized but not very detailed graphics. The game lasts about five hours, which is just about as long as it wants to be &#x2013; it has just enough time to cover all that it wants to cover, but if it was any longer, it would probably be boring.
<br>
<br>This is more of an interactive story than a game, but I got reasonably into it &#x2013; while the spookiness wanes a bit as you get further into the game, there&#x2019;s some sequences which pull off the creepiness pretty well, and the game actually gets you to want to save your friends, which is always a good sign &#x2013; caring about the characters in the game means that the game has generated a sense of emotional investment, which is definitely a plus.
<br>
<br>However, in the end, this is not something which is going to completely blow your mind. Rather, this is a mid-tier thing &#x2013; the story is actually really well executed, but there isn&#x2019;t much gameplay backing it up, and the ending is only okay, not amazing. If you are someone who enjoys story and well-written (and well-acted) dialogue, this might be up your alley. If, however, you want actual gameplay in your game, you&#x2019;re going to be left wanting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oxenfree/user-reviews?user_review_id=7580967">Expand</a></span>

<br>The characters are a chore though.. they are a bunch of dumb teenagers.. just wanted to slap all of them most times. Maybe just cuz I&apos;m not 16 anymore, but I would have liked something a bit more mature.

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Deep, well realized characters (mostly, one is just passable)
<br>- Excellent voice acting, really bringing the story and characters to life. I was constantly reluctant to interrupt other&apos;s dialogue with my own
<br>- Intriguing and thought provoking story, perfectly paced and woven masterfully
<br>- Choices and their resulting impacts feel organic and honest
<br>- Eye catching 2d art style and backgrounds
<br>- Interesting collectables that add to the story; I was perfectly happy to spend an extra hour trekking about the world, looking for the ones I&apos;d missed.
<br>- The John Carpenter inspired melodies perfectly compliment the tone and feel of the game, great music
<br>- The ending leaves you wanting more, with the definite draw of multiple playthroughs
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Choosing an option often cuts off NPCs dialogue (which I wanted to hear), but waiting too long leaves the protagonist silent (also unwanted). By the end I had timing down where I could catch my option at the last moment, so I could have the best of both worlds. Just wish it didn&apos;t have to be that hard
<br>- Characters move so slowly that exploration can be a slog
<br>
<br>This is a well paced, masterful story bound to the player&apos;s hand that flows organically and with impact. Any player looking for a gameplay-light, story-heavy experience will find more than their money&apos;s worth here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oxenfree/user-reviews?user_review_id=6923037">Expand</a></span>
