Not only Dracula is resurrected but also the Stoker&apos;s story, to which this game is a sequel. Back in its time, the unique graphical style of Dracula:Resurrection was critically acclaimed and it still translates to now as not very much games can compare. The most important aspect of the game is how minimalistic it is. Everything in it is there for a reason, there are no distractions, side stories, or unnecessary eye candy. The user interface is also very basic: you have one context-sensitive cursor, a no-text inventory and that&apos;s it. No reminders from the protagonist, no quest log, no hint system. It prods you to pay attention to the story and not to over-think the tasks at hand. You still might get stuck but most puzzles are quite intuitive. On the other hand, the game overall is quite short and some dialogues, animations, and cut scenes are a little silly. Nevertheless, if you like good old games, Dracula:Resurrection is a classic well worth its price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dracula-the-resurrection/user-reviews?user_review_id=3883382">Expand</a></span>
