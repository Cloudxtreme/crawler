I am so often disappointed by these hybrids, since they tend to do one of those two elements well and render the other element useless or boring. Orcs Must Die not only breaks away from that trend, it pretty much puts all past attempts at this kind of hybrid to shame. The controls/gameplay/UI are all simple and intuitive. The tower defense elements are fun for all the reasons tower defense games are fun. The action elements are both fun and extremely useful. Orcs Must Die successfully makes you enjoy using both of these aspects of the gameplay and balancing the level design and difficulty so that it would be difficult to win without making use of both. I could not recommend OMD more. FINALLY, someone has done this hybrid well!

While there&apos;s lots of toys (with new ones being thrown at you every level), some get left in the dust/unused (boom barrel, steam trap), while others get progressively more broken as the game goes on (archers, paladins, decoys). My biggest complaint is it&apos;s missing the stat tracking most tower defenses have to help you maximize your gold usage, leaving you to guesswork if your traps are laid out properly. The maps are uniquely constructed, often requiring specific tactics to clear effectively, making each map tense and engaging. About a third of your arsenal are weapons for your character which keeps you in the action most of the time, unlike most games in this genre. With 24 maps you&apos;re looking at a sizable tower defense game with plenty of crossbow-twitching, fireball-slinging, ice-shattering orc carnage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822741">Expand</a></span>

They&apos;ve combined FPS with tower-defense. The traps are fun to place and watch, and being in on the action takes away a lot of the tedium that eventually sets in with most TD games. There are quite a few mechanics at work, but I really wish they would have created alternative currencies or role-playing persistent upgrades (beyond the skull system where you can get just one upgrade per trap). The coin currency is essentially the only currency you use throughout the game, and thus everything depends on it. This tends to make the first couple waves quite difficult to not let an enemy get through, and later waves too easy. In normal difficulty, the game doesn&apos;t feel particularly challenging, but once you unlock the nitemare mode (for which you unfortunately must complete every level on the normal difficulty), getting beyond the second level&apos;s pretty tough. The nitemare difficulty would have been a welcomed addition to the game, but it unfortunately is the same levels, dialogue, and cutscenes with much more difficult monsters. With many low-budget games, a good chunk of time has gone in to making the game look great without much processing power required, and Orcs Must Die! is a particularly good example of how good aesthetics will beat good graphics any day.<br><br>Modding tools really would have turned this good, fun game into a massive and fantastic time sink. Unfortunately, you&apos;re stuck with DLC from the devs, and that&apos;s it. It seems a bit odd they&apos;d do that, too, considering the TD genre became popular only by Blizz having their RTS games effectively be a platform, with very powerful modding &amp; map-making tools allowing Starcraft/Warcraft to be a simulator, RPG, RTS, FPS, MMO, and just about anything else you can think of. It&apos;s certainly a game which could have been much better (and that&apos;s absolutely not to say it&apos;s at all a bad or unenjoyable game) with more dev time focused on giving consumers more choices. I suspect there&apos;ll be a sequel, and hopefully they&apos;ll add it in then. I look forward to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=1797339">Expand</a></span>

What I discovered was a incredibly fun that is surprisingly tactical in nature. I found myself replaying level after level trying to improve my strategy to get a better score.<br>In a nutshell this game has you laying down different types of traps in hallways that orcs will be coming down. Your job is stop all of them using the arsenal of traps and special weapons. Watching orcs by the dozens get smashed, grinded, flung, burnt, pierced, and diced is pretty fun.<br>So why did I give it a &apos;7&apos;, because it&apos;s also not the type of game that you&apos;ll be playing for weeks on end. It will hold your attention for maybe a week before you move on.

The possibilities may not be endless, but there sure are an awful LOT of them to work with.<br><br>On the downside of things, I feel that the depressing lack of multiplayer and co-op in Orcs Must Die! was a missed opportunity on behalf of Robot Entertainment to make this already great game even better. The Apprentice has a variety of magical items in his arsenal to choose from, but sadly only the Bladestaff as an option for melee combat (the crossbow is non-negotiable as a ranged weapon).<br><br>All in all, Orcs Must Die! is a great game worth every penny and more.

Orcs Must Die! perfectly blends the two genres in a way that requires you to take advantage of both the traps AND your weapons. You can&apos;t just shoot the orcs, nor can you can&apos;t just sit back and let your traps do the work. The difficulty curve is perfect, it never gets too hard or too easy. The game also has a lot of replay value, in the sense that you can go back to earlier levels with your new-found arsenal of traps and try and beat them in different ways. Basically every single little thing about this game is perfect. The only issue with this game is that there is no mid-level save, but most levels only last 10 minutes or so, so you won&apos;t lose much if you absolutely have to quit. All in all, Orcs Must Die! is a gem I highly recommend you buy. Oh, and both the DLCs are worth it too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=1946164">Expand</a></span>

Maybe co-op or multiplayer would change it?  ... Ok, but why so serious? Game is fun, lots of orcs to kill, lots of traps, achievements, upgrades.  10 euros is a steal so you should probably buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=1805540">Expand</a></span>

Umm you should play the game don&apos;t want to ruin it.
<br>
<br>The graphics are cartoon-ish Kind of like WoW, but really does work well in this game, the controls are extremely good.
<br>
<br>There are several levels of difficulty, so even the most skilled players can find a challenge here. The fact that you can upgrade your traps is very handy especially as you move through the levels and there are  several DLC for this game as well expanding this game even more. This is a  need to have solo game, while it may not take long to beat the game on easy mode  it will drive you crazy in the nightmare mode of the game.
<br>
<br>Also i thought it was quite funny that periodically the hero spouts of random things, making a fun game even more interesting. A couple things that was disappointment was there is no multi-player or vs mode, or even a map creation option though I do Know in the sequel they do have multi player, it would been nice to see it in this one as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2811200">Expand</a></span>

Before the stage begin you have some weapons and traps to arrange trough the stage. New items are unlocked as you progress and your old arsenal can be upgraded. It is not an easy game, it ricquires some strategy skills, once the game is focused on defending. It is not about the action, it is about kill Orcs! In all aspects this game is awesome, BUT your aim is huge, and its drawing is blocking your vision all the time.

As others have pointed out, its major flaw is that once you beat the story mode there&apos;s little else to do but try it on Nightmare mode or replay old levels with your newer toys. I would definitely recommend this if you can find it for $10 or less.

Each map probably takes 10 minutes to play. You run around setting up traps (kind of tower defense-like) to kill the orcs, kobolds and ogres as they try to make their way through the map from the gate to your rift. You have weapons as spells for direct combat. It&apos;s fun to see if you can build the best configuration of traps to stop all the monsters. Single player only. Very stable, I only noticed one very minor bug with a monster getting stuck in lava and not dying, but I was able to work around it. The character you play is very humorous in the things he says and does, as are the orcs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2959910">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is fantastic- it has all the benefits of a tower defense game (except that there is only one upgrade for tower, and the upgrade isn&apos;t necessarily a damage boost). However, the game mixes in the third-person action (my favorite part because now you don&apos;t just sit back and watch your traps destroy everything) and some RPG elements (the weavers are fantastic because they help you hone your strategy from the start, but yet they&apos;re a completely optional choice). The game presents a great challenge- while it is a short game, trying to get 5 skulls on each level will more than repay your investment in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2758580">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately the gameplay does not support the good writing. Much of the game is spent levelling in order to unlock additional traps to make more fool proof kill systems, but surprisingly re-playability is ZERO. I anticipated being able to go back and improve upon my old scores using higher tier/alternative traps, but this is impossible as the lower level dungeons do not support the higher tier traps.
<br>
<br>The foundations of a really great game are here, but the levels weren&apos;t built with any kind of hindsight to completion. This could have been redeemed by a level editor feature, even if the levels were tile based like the original Timesplitter&apos;s. With community support the game could have lived up to its hype, but it did not.
<br>
<br>The balance is also a little off, the magic items reward less for kills and are harder to tech and mana heavy making it more of a liability; and the unlocks you can purchase through steam are clear &quot;pay to win&quot; elements as they are more powerful/useful than the base items.
<br>
<br>I really wanted to like this game, the narrative was great and the traps and levels started off fun, but i had hoped to keep playing this game after completion, only to find you can&apos;t mix and utilise the new traps in old dungeons in any meaningful way. You can place them because there&apos;s enough room, but not in any areas where they&apos;ll actually kill anything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2621478">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Is the game simple and fun (if you enjoy repetition), absolutely. No story really, or maybe I was too busy falling asleep, pacing is best described as the sound or phrase &quot;Meh.&quot; which isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing but I was never motivated to continue on killing these Orcs who I rather felt sorry for after a while. The sound/music was one good thing it had going for it and so was the UI, but other than that I&apos;m thoroughly disappointed.
<br>
<br>So pick it up, but its not worth the full retail price. Hell from my understanding Orcs Must Die 2 is the equivalent of Borderlands 2 (that being an excellent sequel in every way, for example story, sound/music score, graphics, pacing, UI, expansion, presentation, accessibility, etc.), but I&apos;m not taking that risk when I know i could have a better experience with a different game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=3733301">Expand</a></span>

I get stuck on some levels for hours simply because there is no way to deal with the waves of different enemies. There is no defense that is &quot;guaranteed&quot; or more likely to deal with a certain type of enemy. I&apos;m stuck on the last 3-4 levels, having tried dozens upon dozens of setups, and nothing is working. Basically most of this game is &quot;put down some traps to see the orcs get hurt, laugh a little and then spray them with a crossbow and pray they don&apos;t get through&quot;. I really liked this game when I started it, but now it just plain disgusts me.

How about if YOU get to kill things too?&quot; And I was like &quot;Okay OMD, I&apos;m listening.&quot; And what fun I had. Orcs Must Die strikes an amazing blend of frantic third-person combat with the strategy of Tower Defense, creating a game that forces you to think and react with equal speed. It is challenging, occasionally frustrating but ultimately very rewarding, not every game leaves me feeling so satisfied when the credits finally roll. It&apos;s damn funny too, with its idiotic but endearingly determined protagonist and an Ork horde that&apos;s quite disenchanted with the whole marauding business and would rather not die horrible deaths in the service of their whiny sorceress.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507998">Expand</a></span>

However if you want a real challenge then you may want to pass on this game. my advise is to just try the demo first. if you end up replaying it multiple times (like i did)then you will probably enjoy this game a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=1830312">Expand</a></span>

I first thought OMD! was a low-quality indie game, but it is actually a fantastically made, very well-presented title! The graphics and art style are gorgeous, the animations are flowing, the controls are super smooth, and the traps and sound effects are very impactful (pun intended). Basically, the art, sound, and controls outdo many AAA titles! Plus the humor, wow, this game is truly hilarious. I laughed so many times at the quirky humor. Although the defense aspect isn&apos;t super strategic and does rely on trial and error, it is very fun nevertheless. Plus, I love that I can employ my quick reflexes and twitch gaming skills to headshot Orcs left and right. Unlike other defense games where you often indirectly fight, there&apos;s always something to set up, shoot, or blow up. Overall, OMD! is nonstop carnage, mayhem, and hilarity! A true gem for fans of defense games, third-person action, and quality humor! A score of 8.5, between Great and Awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2026272">Expand</a></span>

It takes about 6 hours to complete the single player campaign at the Apprentice difficulty level - the only level available to you until you complete all the levels.  Completing the Apprentice levels unlocks Mage, and from there, every level you pass unlocks a corresponding Warlock difficulty for that level.  I like how the game is easy to pick up and fun to play.  Some levels are very challenging as well.  What I dislike is the low re-playability of the single player campaign, the lack of multiplayer, and the repetitive soundtrack (the same music is played for every level).  For $10 on Steam this is a pretty good value, and many of the gameplay aspects I complain of here, have been fixed for Orcs Must Die! 2.  You might want to go straight to the sequel, but this one is worth playing too.  7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2553779">Expand</a></span>

The only game that is remotely like this is probably sanctum (also a good game).  The game has a nice learning curve to it and if you get through the whole game thinking, &quot;that could of been harder&quot;, think again when you try out nightmare mode.  Incredibly enjoyable gameplay combine with dozens of traps and levels with a small price tag makes it an especially good buy.  I can forgive the game for not having multiplayer because of how fun it is and its low price tag, so it does not need it really.

I am not sure whether it is the somewhat limited number of levels and traps or what, but it feels a bit shallow. I almost always end out using the same array of spells and traps and it gets kind of repetitive. Anyways, it&apos;s great when just passing time with something you don&apos;t have to commit to and you can play it through multiple times with higher difficulty settings, why I give it 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=1942351">Expand</a></span>

Orcs Must Die is one of those games. From the moment you start playing, its slick presentation becomes very apparent, ranging from a charming artstyle, to nice fast-paced music, and a comedic tone.
<br>
<br>But presentation is not the only thing where the game shines. As a tower defence game it has some pretty ingenious trap ideas, such as trapdoors that release scorching flames, spring pads that launch orcs into the air, as well as acid bombs and even knights and archers. The level designs are also very well made, at times providing very obvious spots for where traps are ideal. And in addition to traps, you also unlock weavers, which are sorceresses that provide you with passive skills for the duration of the level. Upgrading these skills makes either your abilities or your traps/guardians more effective at what they do.
<br>
<br>At the end of each level, you get a score (which is shown against scores of people on your friends list) and a rating out of 5 skulls. You can then use the skulls to upgrade some of your traps.
<br>
<br>Overall the game was loads of fun. I&apos;ve had a blast. Perhaps the only minor criticism I have is that when starting a new level that has more than 1 enemy entrances, it&apos;s often impossible to tell where the enemy is going to come through first. But it&apos;s a very small nitpick. The game is fun. If you like tower defence genre, get it now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=5506379">Expand</a></span>

Although is a little short, the campaign is about 8 hours long (which is still more than most triple A titles). But it has a huge replayability factor and stuff to unlock, so thats not an issue. For this price, its worth every cent. You Must Buy!</span>

Shutup I say!  OMD (not the 80&apos;s synthpop group) is another excellent Tower Defense game that combines third person action with the wit and humor of the Evil Dead films (oddly enough, there is an actual Evil Dead tower defense game for iOS).  The weapons are varied and clever with some fantastic level designed for creativity and action.  The music is brilliant and the voice over work is some of the funniest and talented I&apos;ve ever heard in a game.  The only weaknesses I have to point out are that you can&apos;t upgrade the weapons more than once and that you can&apos;t use certain traps in areas that clearly can be used.  The game is tense, hilarious and imaginative and leaves you wanting more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2090740">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>A pretty good game, but there are still critical bugs in the game that haven&apos;t been patched. There is no reason for that. If you are angled a certain way, your crosshair does not line up with your shots. This means that on certain parts of certain maps, you are screwed if you shoot from there, which would usually provide the best place to shoot. Other than that, it is a solid FPS TD hybrid.</span>

But on the other hand it feels a little bit bugged, some Orcs survive in lava or water and you need to wait until the antibug counter runs our and kills them. In addition it becomes boring after time, because there are not that many maps and you play them twice already because of the two difficultys. I needed 49h to get all 5 skulls on every map, and now the game is boring. I hope there will be an update with more maps or items, otherwise its a finished game. But its worth the prize!

                                        <span>it is rare to find a game that I really enjoy nowadays and this definitely one of them!! for some reason its very satisfying to see dozens of orcs being slaughtered by traps while you pick off the ones that managed to survive it. its fun, there are enough levels and it has a very reasonable price</span>

The traps are really cool and fun to watch, except i only found a handful that worked the best. the reason i give this game an 8 is because its kinda short (if you know how to play) it still took me 10 hours to beat the game with the DLC content levels, also i found you could only play a few levels before it got boring. Dont get me wrong the game isnt boring at all, its just not a game where you have a day to kill and are emersed like in an rpg for hours and feel like its only been 30 mins, its more like u play for an hour and feel like its been 3, which is good i guess :) anyways great game and id reccomend it to anyone who likes fps/tower defence.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2429355">Expand</a></span>

This game is not groundbreaking in any way, but it is extremely fun (and diabolical) to observe your carefully placed traps on some of the harder missions (they do get harder!) just DEMOLISH a horde of orcs. Some of the traps have actually made me burst out laughing, especially with commentary from the Orcs (try the spring trap + acid or lava, :P). The main protagonist can be a bit annoying sometimes however, and he often comes across as an arrogant douchebag, but then again sometimes his facial expressions and poses at the end of a mission have made me laugh. All in all this game is very fun and I definitely recommend it for the price tag, especially if you&apos;re looking for something to dip into every now and then.

Yet as the game continues to elevate in laugh out humorous remarks, so does the difficulty. In most levels it was a breeze, a few did give me hiccups and made me think quite strategically on each placement of defense. In all, the game is quite short, it can easily be finished in 2 to 4 hours. The difficulty is fair and stubborn. A few glitches in the walking system, the animations are fair, but jaggy in some aspects. The voice over acting is excellent and made me laugh. For $5 this game is an absolute steal. 8.2 out of 11 is the final score..... review by CD0</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2853104">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are nice and not very demanding for your PC. It was also very cool that a new item was given to you after every level, giving you new ways to slay those orcs and laugh maniacally. I got this game on a Steam sale but at the full price, it may not be completely worth, as it may repetitive and some may not have the incentive to replay levels to improve their score. That sais, I found the gameplay to be satisfying and addictive.

Only two things really keep me from giving this a 10 out of 10. Some of the later levels can be a bit frustrating to build traps on, as they really spread the enemy spawns out. The other is the lack of replay value/length. I beat the game after sinking about 8 hours into it, and I loved every minute of it, but after beating the main campaign, I felt like there was little else to do (the only higher difficulty is nightmare, and it really is a nightmare, jeeze). Overall, I would definitely say its worth the price on steam, and if it comes on sale, pick it up, no questions asked.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2010306">Expand</a></span>

Worth the few bucks on Steam I paid for it. Still playing through the levels, but definitely worth it. The &quot;Bruce Campbell&quot; humor and Orc dialog are rather amusing as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!/user-reviews?user_review_id=2087914">Expand</a></span>

<br>Even in normal it can be challenging if u target 5/5 skull (perfect). Then u have hardcore mode , for 10 euros its really worth it.</span>

In general, though, I felt that I was playing something solid but unspectacular.  This game just doesn&apos;t have the depth, longevity, or high end &quot;awesome&quot; factor for it to compare well with the best games that I&apos;ve played.</span>
