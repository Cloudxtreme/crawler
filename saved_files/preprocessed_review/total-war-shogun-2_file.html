The AI has gone from ridiculously stupid to surprisingly clever. They&apos;ll lure you into traps and they know when to push and when to retreat. Naval battles are much more straightforward than in Empire/Napoleon, and so are significantly more action-packed. This is helped by land masses and coasts, which provide a much more dynamic battlefield. The campaign is much more focused and has a pseudo-RPG feel, immersing you even more than before. The scale is smaller than Empire, but that much more detail has been packed into a smaller region. It&apos;s also worth mentioning that siege battles are much less straightforward and therefore much more fun than in traditional European-esque fights. Multiplayer was a great surprise. You can easily create a clan with your friends and find fights, moving over different regions and gaining new skills. As you progress, you can customize your general and his attributes with a rather large skill tree, you can add various perks to certain units (as well as damaging perks against your enemies), and ultimately you really do feel like you&apos;re leading a conquest against real people. The game isn&apos;t perfect, and most of its failings fall to the technical department. There are a few connection issues, but those are to be expected this early on. More disappointing  are the visual settings. In its best, Shogun is easily the most beautiful TW, with amazing detail on each unit, great backdrops, and more detail all around, especially in the trees of the environment. Unfortunately, we won&apos;t get to see Shogun at its best for a while. Anti-Aliasing, higher Shader models, and DX11 features are completely absent from the release product; CA tells us that these will be added in a patch scheduled to arrive in 2-4 weeks. That&apos;s not really acceptable, and it feels like they were trying to meet a deadline. That aside, there are many optimization issues, especially with Phenom processors and AMD cards. Hopefully these will be addressed as well, if not by CA then by AMD and Nvidia.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a must-own for strategy fans, or fans of historical warfare in general. Easily the best Total War game in a long while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1530928">Expand</a></span>

The company has been making this games for 10 years and yet level of innovation is insignificant. Exactly same unwieldy interface in pre-battle and battle sequences. If you select more than a single unit it will have completely random effects on movement. Ordering entire army to move without binding them to a single group will be interpreted by a computer as a decision to randomly send them all over the place. Which bring me to AI.<br><br>AI has not being improved at all since Empire regardless of what they say. You&apos;ll discover that Siege defender AI will get bugged and only defend one level of the castle without moving, so it&apos;s possible to outflank it, climb the walls and capture the castle with 0 casualties. AI in naval battles at best horrendous and worst, completely random. Units do not obey commands, movement is sluggish and while it is a leap from Empire naval battles, you will still be frustrated. Finally, your own units will perform random actions and will be really hard to control unless you are paying very close attention to each one. The subtleties of combat are gone, it&apos;s just as easy to pile everyone in, as to weave a complex plan and attempt to surround the enemies. Additionally, the largest disappointment will be in lack of polish, same as in Empire game. Assassination movies are present, but only for ninjas and geishas. Monks and metsuke don&apos;t get any movies. Bugs are still present in the game, everything from memory leaks to infinite load times, which are already significant. There is no way to load the game out of the battle and a lot of interface is so simplified, you will never look at it more than absolutely necessary.  The much discussed generals and loyalty is a gimmick as there is nothing to do on that screen and with a minimum care, general will meet and exceed 6 stars of loyalty which makes him impossible to convert.<br><br>The land management is simplified, there is no development of any kind, what you see in your province is what you will see for the rest of the game. Sure it&apos;s pretty, but completely lacking any function. After a while you will stop looking at it altogether and provinces away from the action serve no purpose. Strategic game play is lacking too. AI will not make an aggressive grab for trading routes, and at some point the income is so large that you simply upgrade everything making minimal choices of what to build and there is never any wrong choice or even a hard choice. All you need to do is simple math: food in and food out has to equal 0 for best performance. Farms produce food, castles and markets remove it. Finally, it will get old way before you will reach the end. You&apos;ll be going through the motions of capturing one province after another with little improvement in game play. Overall, it was an exciting game to start playing but disappointing in how much potential was wasted and not implemented. Granted, you can&apos;t make the perfect game, as there is always lack of time, money or team skill that will prevent designer from archiving his vision. But come on... the team is not lacking money or time, and skill... well, perhaps they fired everyone good and kept people who will follow simple directions. This is not the culmination of 10 years of experience and hard work, this is a quick and easy remake without any thought or inspiration. Well, let&apos;s wait until the next one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1546510">Expand</a></span>

Its been 11 years, starting with Shogun and after spending another wasted 50 on Shogun 2, I hope it ends on the sequel to this classic series.  Total War has dozens of wonderful and amazing design features.  It will always be a fun game.  Its idiosyncratic habits.. are fun.  Its campaign is both a fantastic time sink and a great source of entertainment.  I&apos;m not a fan of multiplayer in these games so I&apos;ll leave that to another reviewer.  I&apos;ve extolled how adequate I think the game is so far now for my actual review and opinion.<br><br>It can (and after 1-2 years will) crawl under the porch to die, unremembered and unloved.  I Just PLAYED this game!  They called it Napo.. wait Empire:TW!  The units are different (Not so different considering my avid fandom to Medieval II:TW and Rome:TW.  The strategies are still the same.  The buildings logical conclusions are still the same.  The only new feature compared to its predessesors is the addition of food management, a crucial resource that limits the amount of castle and market upgrades you can ultimately have.  One new thing.  Lots of old.<br><br>Archer vs Melee vs Cav vs Archer with two differerent melee types to counter each other.  The same unit stat points- new textures and more of a load for my video card.  And a poorer preforming product.  I can get the same unit set and the same buildings in Medieval 2, except ultra fast battle speed works as fast as intended.<br><br>A definite downgrade is the replayability of the Grand campaign.  Before you had very unique races and an extremely large map.  Now its devolved into Clan A gets better bows, Clan E gets better seige and don&apos;t ever pick clan F because they&apos;re specialty, ship upgrades, is worthless once a super powered European Galleon appears and you capture it, literally winning every naval engagement without any upgrades.  Look, I appreciate the game looks even better than it did before (although I&apos;d expect such a low incremental upgrade to visuals from an expansion pack, not a year or two of work).  This though, this is got to stop.  The AI is still rotten at making decisions, trade alliances and vassals are still bugged and the final stretch is, as with Empire, autoattack win next turn autoattack.  Maybe I&apos;m just hung up on that one time in Medieval 2 when the Mongols invaded and attacked me at Damascus.  I had a 2000 strong army in a fortress against 8000 bloodthirsty Asians.  I remember being so proud of myself, turning away their massively larger army after an amazing battle, filled with both tactics and strategy.  And I remember the very next turn, with my brave remaining 400 soldiers that just defeated a full stack of Mongols.. Another 8000 stepped up and laid siege.  This is what Empire and Shogun 2 lack.  There are no game changing occurences and aside from the appearance of the Black Ship the whole thing could take place in 1200 or 2100, no historical events actually occur.<br><br><br>Yes the graphics are pretty.<br>Yeah its still TW.<br><br>But you&apos;ve played it before.  Pick it up for $30 if you must but please, for my revenge against Creative Assemblys latest uncreative venture- don&apos;t pick this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1552557">Expand</a></span>

The voiceover accents, while authentic, are unintentionally comical. Which brings me back to the combat, personally I felt like every engagement became a huge clusterfark and those with the most numbers would win and there didn&apos;t seem to be much strategy to it beyond &quot;melee up front, archers stand back and shoot&quot;. Perhaps I am oversimplifying it, but even the castle sieges which look like they&apos;ll be epic - just turn into complete clusterfarks where greater number of troops win and skill be damned. With all that said, it seems like the developers put a lot of work into the game and i&apos;m sure fans of the franchise can see it as being a step forward but from my roughly 25 hours of play I can&apos;t say i&apos;ve become a fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606103">Expand</a></span>

The updates coming to the game are also great with a DX 11 patch on the way and more bug fixes for mostly multiplayer as we go along.

I&apos;m afraid to say it&apos;s just boring. I&apos;ve sleep walked into victory, hardly having to engage my brain.

Match making was very unfair to new players on multiplier. a new player with nothing but Ashiguri low morale units forced to fight artillery of a high leveled veteran player defending up a hill. a couple of recent patch and upgrades has killed solo player alot. the fact relations between two &quot;alliances&quot; don&apos;t even matter. a very friendly unit with over 400 points with, declared war on me for no reason. good relations with the entire map.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3203094">Expand</a></span>

It offers great experience with limited content. Casual and fast paced battles, simple rock-paper-scissors strategy and small map may be good for next generation players but at the same time these are the weak points for hardcore fans. Feudal japan concept is successfully created with beautiful graphics and sound effects. Game has less technical problems compared to first Rome and its followers.(except famous SEGA splash screen bug). Land battles are shorter than older games so can&apos;t be watched decently but they are very excited and brutal. Naval battles are playable and entertaining after Empire TW and Napoleon TW sea battle failures. There are too many good DLC&apos;s to increase unit and faction diversity by adding new clans and clan specific units. Like the other TW games, this game has a poor AI too. Thankfully, CA has an epic modding community and there are too many good mods to improve AI&apos;s ability. As a result Shogun Total War 2 is a good game with new casual gameplay elements for new players and price is reasonable for a AAA strategy game. But if you&apos;re hardcore TW fan and love samurai concept, I recommend to you Total War Shogun 2: Fall of Samurai.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4916057">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are beautiful, the individual units are lovingly detailed and the campaign is really enjoyable. I have so far got 162 hours of playtime out of this game according to my steam profile which is by far more than you&apos;ll get from playing most other games. In terms of things the game has done really well I would cite the AI as being very good, especially on the harder difficulties. The historical research that has gone into the game is also impressive and so is the gameplay as a whole. For me, this game would easily get a 10/10 but there are a few things which let it down. The multiplayer and co-op campaigns are hopelessly broken and months later Creative Assembly has still not fixed this problem which is shocking in itself. Similarly the AI has a tendency to spam archer units (which seems to b a problem with every total war game so far actually), which results in some very annoying battles especially as archers seem to be rather over-powered in the game. However, despite that issue the AI, as I previously mentioned, is on the whole very good. If CA were to fix these problems then for me this would be a perfect game. However, part of the reason I&apos;m writing this review is due to glancing at the &quot;Negative&quot; reviews below. While some raise valid points others are just plainly ridiculous. For example one person has given it a 2 after playing it for over 350 hours and cites his reason for this as &quot;lack of replay value&quot;. This begs the question, &quot;what was he doing for those 350 hours?&quot;! Staring at the title screen? I have played the game for less than half that amount of time and have finished and replayed it over 8 times which is hardly a negligible amount and more than almost any other game. Other criticisms include the lack of unit types, this I find strange. While in most total war games the concept is nation against nation, with all the differences in military development, equipment and strategy that would entail. However, Shogun 2 is a country in the grip of civil war. There would not be dramatically different units for each clan as their military development would generally be along the same lines as their neighbouring provinces. It would be like expecting Sussex and Kent to have dramatically different units in a theoretical England Total War or expecting Rhode Island and Connecticut to be dramatically different in a hypothetical America Total War. The small unit varieties of Shogun 2 are part of what makes it realistic. Similarly, having said that, it&apos;s not that there is a lack of unit variety in the game anyway. There are less unit types than previous Total War games certainly but that is not the same as there not being any variety at all, there is just the right amount of variety and for those who disagree there is DLC which offers more units at a cheap price. Similarly, a lot of the complaints are from people who simply can&apos;t figure out how to play the game properly. For example, with diplomacy I was also slightly frustrated with it when I began playing but as I played the game more I figured out how to use it properly and I no longer have any problems with it. I feel it&apos;s unfair to blame the game for your own lack of ability when playing it. In summary, the game is great but not without flaws. Ignore a lot of the moaning you hear about the game, some is valid and some is not. Engage your brain to realise the difference. However, do NOT buy this game if a large part of your motivation behind purchasing it is the multiplayer, you will be very disappointed. DO buy this game if you have enjoyed the single player campaign of the other Total War games and don&apos;t mind a little bit of extra strategy involved in the gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1730471">Expand</a></span>

After Empire and Napoleon, I especially liked that Total War picked a less firearms focused theme this time. And the mechanics and overall gameplay are well done. If there&apos;s anything I could criticise, it&apos;s probably the lack of different loading screens.</span>

This Total war game does not have the best campaign to date but I can&apos;t explain why. The map has stunning visuals and a large variety of factions, maybe Im not as interested in Japan&apos;s history as I am in Napoleonic history. The actual battles are the what make the game. Shogun 2 has removed all of the problems of all the other total war games. The game rewards attacking over defending(Crippling noob campers in multiplayer) by adding Keypoints in the centre of the map which give bonuses to the player that captures them. If a player captures all of the keypoints a counter begins which stops campers completely. This encourages players to rush for the centre, pretty much throwing all idea&apos;s of corner camping into the garbage. The sieges are just epic. Seiges have been limited to 20 minutes and attackers have been given more money to spend allowing the defenders to attack quickly instead of bombarding castles for an hour. Graphics are 5/5, Campaign 2.5/5 and gameplay is 4.5/5.<br><br>Also get Fall of the Samurai.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2335365">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer is fun too, but really just for playing with friends because the balancing in online match play doesn&apos;t really work.<br><br>Would be worthy of a 10, but it&apos;s got a few annoying bugs.</span>

Admittedly, the unit variety isn&apos;t awe inspiring. Neither is the replay ability, as every clan is almost identical. Also, loading times are HUUUUUUGGEEEE and the ai is a bit shoddy. It&apos;s really incredibly annoying when your guys refuse to turn and fight or fire until they&apos;re all in nicely arranged lines......then they&apos;re ridden down by cavalry while they&apos;re faffing around. In spite of those problems however, this really is a first rate game. The battles are very fun, particularly with the blood dlc, and can be pretty brutal. The gameplay improvements are good, with the exception of navies which are still a bit rubbish. Campaign map gameplay is challenging and tactical and definately fun. Overall, a good game worth buying, though definately not the best Total war. Or the second best. Buy it, but make sure to pick up Fall of the Samurai because that&apos;s excellent. Avoid rise of the samurai, that&apos;s just pointless</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2548037">Expand</a></span>

The combat doesn&apos;t exactly feel very tactical. A lot of times, even with the Darth Mod, the AI just charges across the map and slams into you. The AI hasn&apos;t got the first clue how to put together a naval fleet or command it in battle. The only thing you have to worry about is a glitch that causes them to scatter to the edges of the map making you spend the next several minutes cruising around the map&apos;s edge picking them off. As far as unit balance, the sea units are better off and all have clear roles, though the AI is so stupid at sea that this doesn&apos;t really matter. Wining a sea battle in Shogun 2 is like tying your shoes, anybody can do it,so all that matters getting it over with as quickly as possible. On land, cavalry is superfluous. The value of ranged infantry is questionable. I kind of feel like I could make a big swarm of no-dichi samurai and they&apos;d pretty much beat anything. Katana and spear infantry are all that really matters because more often than not the AI will charge in and it will just turn into a big melee fight. On the grand strategy map, the AI is just stupidly aggressive. They flood the sea with fleets of cheap boats that you have to engage in long stupid battle with. Unless you outnumber the enemy by about 4 to 1, the auto-resolve almost always causes you to take ridiculous losses, especially at sea. Enemies wage war constantly and for no reason. Creating vassals is just stupid as they always turn on you. Then there is the Realm Divide event which happens as you&apos;rr about halfway to beating the game and causes everyone to wage war on you with no hope of peace, essentially making diplomacy entirely pointless for about half of every game&apos;s duration. I have yet to build most of the buildings or research all of the techs because every game ends so quickly as everyone insists on waging war and being killed. The graphics look nice up close, but once you zoom out it actually looks a lot worse than Empire. Probably intended to improve performance. The soundtrack is forgettable. I would say the game is a little better than Civilization 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3263971">Expand</a></span>

I am an avid Total War fan all the way to the first Shogun game, so I was giddy when I heard they were making a modern sequel. As I expected, it is much similar to the first game but with massive improvements in graphics, AI, game elements, and gameplay. The AI is still not the best, but it still does a good job and generally makes smart moves. Sometimes the AI definitely gets to be in a pain in the neck when they make a move that I unfortunately failed to see coming and they begin razing my towns  ugh! But that&apos;s part of the fun of this game.
<br>
<br>The best part, other than the actual strategic elements on the campaign map, are of course the real-time battles that you can dive into. My gaming rig thankfully can handle maxed out graphics, and this baby is GORGEOUS! I wish there was blood and gore though; I honestly haven&apos;t checked if there&apos;s a mod or DLC for that yet.
<br>
<br>I wish the mini-cut scenes for agents were more varied, but as always I am intrigued to watch and see whether they succeed or fail. Speaking of cut scenes, the generals&apos; speeches before every battle are always fun to listen to and watch. Yes, they if you think about it they are kinda funny and cheesy, but if you set your mind to it you do appreciate that they try to make it inspirational and immersive that way.
<br>
<br>While some reviews here complain that all it really comes down to is who has the bigger army, particularly in caste sieges, I beg to differ. I have won countless battles now in my dozens of hours of gameplay where I was outnumbered, sometimes even 2:1. What truly matters is unit experience, unit type, and how you deploy them in the battlefield.
<br>
<br>One grip I do have about the sieges is that the fortress/city or whatever aren&apos;t realistic or as expansive/detailed as you would expect one to be. It&apos;s mostly a huge empty space where your army is deployed, guard towers (if you have any), maybe a building or two and a shrine, and then the walls. That&apos;s about it, which is unrealistic. That said, it is nice to see there are buildings beyond the walls, like small villages around the main city, but again even those aren&apos;t as big as they should be.
<br>
<br>One of the best RTS games you can play, with samurais and ninjas! How awesome is that?? Very.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3229565">Expand</a></span>

I will say that shogun 2 brought some improvements to the real time fighting that I could only dream of in medieval total war.  The game is beautiful and most all aspects of the game provide a satisfying challenge.  If you play online you will later find yourself capable of taking on any enemy AI army outnumbered 5 to 1 but that makes you feel good as well.  I personally find the siege battles to be less engaging than other total war titles due to the fact that in 1500 Japan a castle was actually just a giant dirt mound with some small walls built around it.  Thus siege equipment is almost completely irrelevant.  The tech tree is quite well done in this title which is definitly a plus.  However there are two things in my opinion that make the game not so fun to play at times.  One of them is the drawn out load times.  When you launch the game it takes 60 -180 seconds to get past the initial load screen.  Not only that but the load screens in between battles and the campaign map last 20-60 seconds.  That is way too long to be left as acceptable.  The 2nd problem is that although no longer prominent at the time I write this, the game was released in a state that contained a million and one things that could cause it to crash, desync, or black out on you for no apparent reason.  Multiplayer in particular was prone to crashes and corruption every few turns.  It took the devs about a year and a half to properly iron out of all these bugs.  These may only be 2 problems that I have listed but they were so major I tear up at the memory of how many times my game would crash, force me to load for 2 minutes, and then crash again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2836886">Expand</a></span>

They add quite a lot of diversity and make the game more interesting, creating new strategic options and giving you some extra challenge when adapting to certain enemy advantages. The cost of those add-ons, from which most we shouldn&apos;t have to pay for IMO, are the main reason I won&apos;t give it 10. The game mechanics, graphics and pure joy battles will give you are incredible and it&apos;s worth every dime you spend on it, but still unlocking some of it&apos;s content is clearly overpriced and it&apos;s hard not to be at least a little disgusted with how Sega manages those.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3125490">Expand</a></span>

Everything in it lived up to my expectations for it. The only drawbacks in the game is a lack of variety when it comes to units, the new focus on DLCs and the fact that easier AI opponents tend to be easier because they are stupid and exhibit typical &apos;stupid AI&apos;-behavior. However, missing unit variety does not take away any of the wonderful fun in commanding large armies in your quest for the title of Shogun in single player, and even the new DLC focus can be forgiven with the release of great DLCs like The Rise- and The Fall of the Samurai. The &apos;stupid AI&apos;-problem can be fixed by upping the difficulty of the game or by playing the multiplayer segment. Even this multiplayer segment is very well done and can present a true challenge to everyone.
<br>All in all the game is great and should be recommended to anyone who likes commanding armies in a mix between real time and turn based strategy.
<br>I look forward to see what is next for the Total War Series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3125766">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Good game, but the game has some downsides, like the Realm divide. Still a very good game. The massive battles are fun as hell! I recommend this game to any Total War game. If you are not sure, play the demo or wait for Rome 2!</span>

<br>Multiplayer quick battle matchmaking: Its very punishing on new players because of veteran units gaining more stats however if you keep at it you&apos;ll eventually have those veteran units. I&apos;ve played this part of the game the most as its very fun. Only thing I wouldn&apos;t recommend is having a normal Shogun 2 army fighting a Fall of the Samurai army.
<br>
<br>Single player campaign: Takes quite a few hours to complete a single campaign. Realm divide is just plain annoying and wasn&apos;t expected the first time I ran into it and sadly the higher difficulties aren&apos;t as enjoyable because you&apos;re stuck defending the whole game. If you don&apos;t mind preparing for realm divide it can be fun.
<br>
<br>Co-op Campaign: I&apos;ve only completed maybe three of these. You can share units with your friend in battles so they have something to do other than watch the fight which is nice.
<br>
<br>Only real complaint about this game is the loading times. (An example of this is the start up load screen takes about 2 minutes every time.) Other than that its an amazing game and I recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3486242">Expand</a></span>

The campaign is stellar and reeks of creativity. Many features from previous Total War games really lacked in comparison to this game. It literally kept me up for a 36 hour period of non stop campaign fun. Multiplayer is the most hilarious fun I&apos;ve had in years. The players are fair and challenging, not to mention friendly which is a surprise from most of my RTS experiences over the years. The games mechanics and innovation from previous Total War games are awesome to say the least, the Concept of Bushido, the ability to convert to Christianity, and the whole concept of massive warfare, I loved this game, I highly recommend it to anyone who&apos;s ever enjoyed an RTS or a TBS game. The game play is fun and challenging. The one flaw I&apos;m sure they will correct is the sort of uselessness the Bow Calvary have, otherwise this is simply a great game. It&apos;s the best game I&apos;ve played in two years.<br><br>Get this game as quickly as humanly possible, If you don&apos;t believe me, check other reviewers on this site.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1537160">Expand</a></span>

But thats not really a bad thing, the Total War franchise has been a dominant player in the Turn based strategy gaming world ever since Rome: Total War. This game has no real story, the only objective is very simple....take over Japan. There are a couple of problems with this though, the developers pushed hard to emphasize that you play &quot;however you want&quot; through diplomacy, espionage, or through total military action, but the only way you will EVER win is with total military action. Another lingering problem that has haunted the Total War series is the incapable auto-managing AI, which will constantly raise taxes to the maximum level whenever it is engaged. This lack of any support from the AI to help manage your towns and cities is stressful at times, and doesn&apos;t add any real fun to game play, only frustration as you sit their trying to prevent rebellions and not going bankrupt. Another problem is the lack of any diversity between factions, as is, their isnt any...at all, they are virtually the same faction with different coloured armour and a few special bonuses to a select few major factions, unlike other total war games in recent memory, you will get extremely bored with each faction, and sometimes, even forget what faction your actually playing at times, although the developers cannot be specifically blamed for this since, well, it takes place on Japan, and diversity on a secluded island doesn&apos;t really exist.<br><br>Other than those little nagging issues, this game is almost identical to other games in the series, with nothing really new added onto it, but it&apos;s still a damn good game, and will take up hours of your day at a time once you get really into it. And with better looking graphics and a simplified interface, this game should go on any Total War fans &quot;To buy&quot; list.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1694672">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve seen people critically acclaim game after game when there is actually no improvement from Rome Total War to this day. I don&apos;t understand what merit the new Total War games can have when they only shuffle around a few features, lose some of the most important aspects of the first Total War game - Shogun and add new annoying things that lower overall quality. In this review I am going to systematically point out the flaws that Shogun 2 has in comparison the older games in the series, so please bear with me, I&apos;m not just here to whine and go all nostalgia about the first Shogun, there are actually important distinctions to be observed.
<br>
<br>Anyways, let&apos;s get into the thick of things.
<br>
<br>One thing that the entire total war series lost from the first Shogun game up till now is the IMPORTANCE OF TERRAIN. You occasionally see a few hills in Rome, fight 80% of the time on plains in Medieval 2 and in Shogun 2 there is a return of frequent elevation but its effect is very reduced. Hills and mountains no longer offer the gigantic advantage they offered in the first Shogun, where a single archer unit could defeat a yari ashigaru unit before they even reached the archer unit. In some cases, it could even defeat two, but only if it had elevation on its side. This is no longer so in Shogun 2, where elevation does confer some bonuses but altogether not game changing. Furthermore forests no longer offer protection from arrows which, again, reduces the importance of terrain. What does this mean in the grand scheme of things? That you lessen the importance of a strategic factor and thus reduce overall amount of strategy that you can use. Literally now the only thing that matters is countering their units a rock-paper-scissors (except some units count as both rock and paper) fashion and surrounding their army. While there is still a hefty amount of strategy involved in fights, I can&apos;t help but weep while I witness the diminishing of terrain importance while almost nobody even notices it.
<br>
<br>On towards the campaign map. The problem with how economy is implemented in Shogun 2 is how it forces you to move slowly and build up your economy. Why is this a bad thing? Because it&apos;s boring. Literally the only thing you do is click on a farm, market, sake den or mine to be build, then you WAIT a few turns so that you actually have the necessary income to support your army. You cannot individually tax cities so you cannot gain additional income from happy cities who will not rebel when high taxes are imposed. This is in contrast to Rome where building your economy was a much quicker deal and taxes could be set individually. The other problem that impedes rapid conquest is that almost every city you conquer will be very aggressive towards you which effectively means that you have to keep your army there and WAIT. I&apos;m not really that impatient, but this is an unnecessary wait time imposed on the player out of a bad game design choice. What did Shogun 2 again lose in comparison to Rome? The capacity to pacify the population by slaughtering a large portion of it. This was an effective gameplay mechanism to allow players who want to go for fast conquest to be able to do it while still imposing a punishment on it. Your cities would have very reduced income after the slaughter but they would not rebel for a long while. This was an excellent trade-off that no longer exists. Another part where you have to WAAAAIT is an upcoming realm divide. At a certain point the shogun will order all existing clans to destroy you and all of them will obey even if some are at war with the shogun and actually hate him. This is simply how the thing is programmed. If you attract the ire of the shogun by expanding too early and becoming famous enough before being able to take on the entirety of Japan, you WILL die. What is the problem with this mechanic? The problem is that it forces you, again, to WAIT until you have sufficient forces and economy. So you clicking on buildings and units and pressing the next turn. I hope you can see a pattern here so that I can stop putting wait in caps lock like an **** Overall trend with the Shogun 2 campaign map is having a lot less options than you had in Rome.
<br>
<br>The A.I. on the campaign map is also worse than in Shogun 1, if you believe me. It&apos;s not that it&apos;s in any way dumber, it isn&apos;t. The problem is that many times the A.I. plays as if its only purpose is to be a roadblock for the player. They will often attack your faction even though they have zero chance of winning the war and zero chance of escaping your faction&apos;s wrath. But they will still do it if they can hurt you in anyway even it results in the total destruction of their clan. This ends up as a very frustrating experience for the player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2609213">Expand</a></span>

Here it is now 8am and i just stopped playing because my eyes are square and my nose is bleeding a little (Joking about the nose bleed! Thought it might give the review a more of a hard core gamer believability, LoL). Anyway, Enjoy this game its worth every dollar.

They have listened to users of previous Total War games and created a beautiful mix between historical fact and in-game balance. The game AI is now more intelligent than ever both in the campaign and in the beautiful battles, which it surely lacked in battles in previous games. The difficulty settings are a lot more accurate now, making very hard - very hard!<br><br>My sole complain about the game is the different types of armies. The armies of the different clans are almost similar (containing the same units and skins) except the stats of the individual units, which creates a somewhat boring game in length. These units are however so fantastically made in both animation and model and the individual fights between the units look so real and unique.<br>I do however suspect the release of DLC containing both new units and individual units for each faction.<br><br>One other problem with the game is that it needs patching and they should have waited a few weeks more before releasing. There are problems for people with starting up the game, errors in the game and the multiplayer is not working very well at the moment. It also lacks Direct X11 at the moment (along with AA).<br><br>This is a great game with the best gameplay and most beautiful battles made so far in the Total War series. If you have played one of the previous Total War games or loves strategy games either real time or turn-based (or both), then you should definitely try this one out.<br><br>Rating at the release of the game it should only receive 9/10, but as I expect it will be patched thoroughly, I rate it max.<br><br>I find that the game needs Steam to run is the best solution to anti-piracy and I do not think it is a problem as most people use Steam now a days.<br>Also, to all you people who comment (and therefore rate the game) before trying it out - could you please wait until you have tried the game, otherwise you CANNOT rate the game and also you look like idiots!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1535118">Expand</a></span>

Have played most of the previous total war games, however Empire and Napoleon where not to liking game mechanics wise - this game is more a kin to the earlier total war installments. Particular highlight of this game would include the multiplayer experience as this is pretty well thought out. I honestly can&apos;t fault much, if anything, with this game.</span>

Maybe the game is not so much for everything, and nearly to the story (although I may be wrong), but once you get addicted to the game you forget about it, this game is a very good way to get acquainted with the culture of Japan, part of which remained in modern Japan I have always respected them for their spirit, and I am sure that out of this tragedy they leave as soon as possible with minimal losses.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1528503">Expand</a></span>

While in Napoleon and Empire most players think that those who fire first will have the advantage, especially in multiplayer, where both players maybe thinking the same thing and this could cause boredome to the entire game. I especially love the new feature where the agent Ninja and some other could enter the battlefield and provide support, but also more siege battles and the idea of using bamboos as the raw materials for the boats.

There are some graphical problems, which seems to be mostly centered around the latest video cards. Slightly older top line cards provide a rock steady platform.<br><br>Played the Takeda at Normal, it provided a very very satisfying experience and most of all very fun.

to improve your generals and special units and traits are no more random (even if specific events may trigger modificators to traits or even brand new traits that you cannot choose directly).<br>At start you choose a faction with specific traits that are fixed, but during the turns you will have points to spend into 2 different trees to improve combat and economic side of your empire.<br>A single game ends before reaching all the upgrades available so you have to carefully plan where you wanna excel or what to priorise using those points.<br>The rts battles are very tactical and very involving, you need to choose carefully how to approach the enemy, and adapt to the units you are countering to be victorious, also the terrain can and shoul be used to gain advantage like hiding troops in the vegetation, charging from a hill etc.<br>The AI even at easy level is not stupid on the battlefield and tends usually to have an &quot;intelligent&quot; approach, also the different factions may react in a proper manner related to their aggressivness, which you can see in the detailed in the &quot;trade panel&quot;, so some may prefer a frontal charge while other factions may prefer to defend etc, also every faction tend to prefer specific units over others, so the battles can last long and can be quite different which is a must for a game like this.<br>Talking about the audio, music and effects are are defo hi standard, not so various, but sure they dont lack in quality.<br>The game is very stable, the engine moves very smooth on my pc that is sure not new (intel dual duo 3.2 + ATI 5770), i had a couple of crashes on 80 hours playtime wich is defo good, expecially compared to the old total war wich sure did not excel in game stability.<br>Luckily it never happened so far the &quot;last turn bug&quot; that afflicted all the previous releases , and was the worst issue of all the Total war franchise imho.<br>At the end this game is one of the best mixed tactical turn based/rts game around, so anyone interested in the genre will be pleased sure with this game.<br>There are some minor issues that dont affect much the game but still they should be fixed, like units retreating from the battlefiled are no more &quot;flagged&quot; so to intercept them you need to manually find them on the field wich is quite annoying, and a non perfect pathfinding when moving into castles, even if 100 times better then previous total war titles.<br>Also when defending into castles you need to babysit a lot units, especially archers to be sure they are looking where is logic and expected to.<br>What i personally consider a great miss in a game like this is the total lack in customization, cant get why the total war franchise always forget / dont consider it a must.<br>You can start a campaign with only premade factions, starting always in the same zone with fixed traits and background, and the victory conditions can be only 3 and the difference is only the number of zones to conquer.<br>I can understand the historical work on this but from a title like this i expect more and various victory conditions, randomizable starting zones/traits, customizable factions, and maybe a map editor.<br>Also the game difficulty cant be applied to specific factions and you cant choose a different number of opponents then the preset.<br>Also another minor issue in my opinion is the fact if you choose the long campaign, when you are half way with around 30/60 zones conquered, going on is too easy and near the end the game really lack of interest, so basically going for the 45 zones condition or to the 60 changes nothing in terms of gameplay.<br>So i give an 8, great game, best in the serie, but still lacks in customization that should be a  must for a geek of those tactical/strategic games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1544794">Expand</a></span>

I wont go into detail, but if you are a hardcore TW gamer you know the annoyances I refer to.

After playing the demo for Napoelon, i wasnt convinced. When the first videos of Shogun 2 were shown I was very interested. I was born in Japan and always enjoyed it&apos;s history and culture so the location was a plus. Then the demo came out, and because of the demo I bought the game. The graphics, combat, scenery, environment, music, voices, everything is just perfect for this game. Unlike other RTS games that are purely based on hotkey memorization and clicking faster than your enemy, this game requires THINKING faster and smarter and clicking faster doesn&apos;t mean anywhere near as much. The co-op campaign is also great fun if you have someone that will take the time to play with you. The only problem I&apos;ve had with the game is purely my own, the enemy is too smart for me at my current skill level-and that&apos;s a good thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1535965">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I&apos;ve been following the Total War series since TW: Rome. I have to say Shogun 2 is probably the best TW series of the bunch. Playing on Normal, individual battles are generally not a challenge for the experienced player (most battles end with a heroic victory) but still, you can tell that the battlefield AI is much improved over previous releases. The campaign AI is a lot better too.</span>

To everyone complaining about the bugs, I&apos;m sure The Creative Assembly won&apos;t pull a Treyarch on this one, every game has bugs, don&apos;t give it a 0/10 because of something that can easily be fixed.

The release day Shogun 2 is in better shape than Empire was left in. I have only seen minor, non-game breaking bugs after about 40 hrs of play.  The Creative Assembly have released a fairly polished game, that should only get better in time.</span>

Call me crazy if you will, but there&apos;s something about games like this that are addicting to me.<br><br>Now I just wish they&apos;d start up the Warhammer Dark Omen series again (completely different setting, but the feel of the combat is somewhat similar). Total War Fantasy game, that would rock.</span>

Also you have to wait good 15-20s every turn till AI opponents finish their moves. All of this adds up and game becomes a huge waste of time that is unless you bring a book and read it while game is loading something. I know, Empire was slow on this too, but not as much. I know that this problem could be solved by adding extra 4gbs of RAM but I can&apos;t afford system like that atm. Other than long loading times, game runs smooth, way better than Empire. Steady fps on the campaign and battle maps and all of this with improved graphics. So yeah its not 10/10 from me but it deserves strong 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1557634">Expand</a></span>

Cavalry, infantry, siege weapons, swords, shields etc.. This game is as good as Rome or M2TW but like all Total War titles it has lots of game breaker bugs in it and no antialising, no DX11 whatsoever. I hope CA releases good patches and addresses all the bugs.</span>

The worst problem of the previous games, the AI, has been improved substantially. On the battle map, you will sometimes find yourself surprised by the tactics used by the opposition. When defending, the AI will go for the most favourable ground (most of the time) and wait for your forces to attack. If you inflict too many casualties on them using arrows, the AI will choose to charge your position instead of being slowly slaughtered. However, the AI is still not perfect, especially in sieges. There was one battle where the AI meandered around my walls and was slaughtered by arrows instead of actually trying to assault my fortress. However, this kind of occurrence does not happen often. On the larger scale campaign map, the AI has also been improved. In previous Total War games, the enemy factions would often send armies of a few units at you instead of consolidating their forces. This increased the number of battles, but the AI was always outnumbered and easily defeated. This problem has been eliminated. This time around, the AI will gather more forces before attacking. This means fewer, but more decisive battles that are more exciting due to the high number of units involved. The AI is also more likely to land invasion forces on islands. I did encounter some problems though. Through most of my second campaign, most of the factions would not trade with me even though my clan was in good standing with them. New players to the series may have a hard time, as this game is much more difficult than previous instalments. This is especially true once you reach the middle of a campaign. Once your clan has conquered a large amount of provinces and reaches &quot;Legendary&quot; status, Realm Divide is triggered. This game mechanic basically unites every indifferent, unfriendly, or hostile clan against you within a few turns. This would be ok if your allies stuck by your side, but they will eventually turn against you too if victory is not obtained quickly. I recommend that a new player should start off on easy, while a veteran should begin on medium difficulty.<br><br>As for the graphics, they are absolutely gorgeous. The landscapes have more variety, more detailed textures, and are more believable. There was one battle where I encountered a few deer that quickly scattered once my army approached them. The animations have also been improved substantially. I find myself watching replays of battles simply so I can watch duels between individual Samurai. One thing that I should mention is that the game currently does not support anti aliasing or DirectX 11. The lack of DirectX 11 isn&apos;t too big of a deal to me, but I think that launching the game without a basic feature such as AA is ridiculous.  In a game that takes place on such a grand scale where you see armies of thousands confronting each other, it takes away from the experience when your soldiers are made up of jagged pixels when viewing them from far away. Creative Assembly has promised that a patch should be released within the next two weeks or so that addresses this issue, so hopefully this will not be an issue for much longer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1560620">Expand</a></span>

It really is the refinement of the total war series. Everything makes a lot more sense than Empire and the map is way more manageable. The battles require a lot more strategy than ever before because of the units ant the terrain. The units are completely the same across all factions, except for units in which the faction has an advantage with, meaning all armies have access to the same units you do but, for example, the Shimazu have better Katana Samurai and the Chosokabe have better Bow Samurai. And don&apos;t worry there are enough units to keep the game from getting stale. Everything from economics to the arts your faction can develop down the path of bushido or chi or both make a lot of sense. It is far less overwhelming and way more manageable so much so I would say any newcomer to the series could easily pick up, although mastering it will take longer. One of the new features I think is great is that you have to be much more specific in which buildings you make in you cities and even better is how each region has something different to add when you take it over. Some have horses, some ninja, others lumber or quarries, each of which are necessary for making new things like bigger fortresses, cheaper boats or stronger cavalry. The game just feels like everything they&apos;ve done up to this has been perfected. Except multiplayer apparently. I don&apos;t really play multiplayer so it doesn&apos;t affect me but if that&apos;s what you&apos;re interested in then you may want to make your own research into that. Anyway for me this game is a 10/10.

Shogun 2 is an attempt to bring the series back to its routes by making it simpler and suppoedly requiring more tactics. The graphics and atmosphere are the best in the series. They have done their research well when it comes to Feudal Japan. The game cannot be faulted for its artwork or the 3d models. But my high praise for the game ends there. Its just too simple. Every faction has exactly the same units and so once you have played as one faction, its hard to find a reason to play another, the only difference is one of your units being slightly stronger or you gain food quicker. There arent enough territorries and due to the natural shape of Japan, you almost always have few enemies attacking from only a couple of fronts. The research tree is nice but doesnt really revolutionise the way you grow your nation. All in all its better than the previous two games, but its still not anywhere near as good as the games before that. A nice try, but not quite there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1632266">Expand</a></span>

Amazing, amazing game, and the best time for people who aren&apos;t fans of the series to give it another look. Graphics = top notch, the best in any RTS/Turn based strategy. Gameplay = A very addictive experience. Really makes me feel like I&apos;m commanding my troops in battle or leading my clan to victory on the campaign map. Sounds = Hey, if you like Japanese themed sound and music then this game has the best. If not, then one of the beauties if this game might be truly lost on you. Multiplayer = I can honestly say I haven&apos;t even tried it out. For a $50 release, I am happy with it not having any multiplayer what so over. This game has everything, as far as multiplayer goes it&apos;s just an added bonus. I heard mixed things about it anyway, so my only advice is that you check it out for everything else first and then see if you&apos;d really like to get trounced in multiplayer before you go that route ;) All that being said, amazing amazing game... one of my favorites, and I&apos;m going to be hooked on this for a long time I think. Awesome job CA!

It manages to achieve what everyone loved so much in Rome and Medieval, while still bringing in the new features that Empire and Napoleon brought without making them into a complete pile of crap. Having been one of the many disappointed and disillusioned CA fans after those last two games it came as a massively pleasant surprise. What I will say is from first day experience, is that finding a game using the current multi player interface can be quite hard and slow, this will no doubt change though.  One last thing if your really obsessed with playing in DX 10 and 11, and it must be said with the anti aliasing that these features allow, then i would wait till the first patch to get this, as their currently unavailable in game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-shogun-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1532303">Expand</a></span>
