Most VR games are more like demo&apos;s of what can be done this is a proper game, with progression and a good plot line to it.  It is refreshing to have an actual game that engrosses you and the spell casting is pretty cool.  It is not full movement like other games yet as there is a step movement type that allows you to slightly step forward or use the standard VR movement system of the past where you morph to new spots instantly.  This is a good step forward for VR gaming as it truly immerses you into the game and it finally gives us a total story to be involved within and the game play is fun and involving.  Still a little linear not open world but that is a ways off it seems for VR gaming, but this is a fine start.  A must have title if you do any real VR gaming as it is worth every penny of its price of admission.  One of the best VR games I have played so far and I have played a lot of them to be honest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mages-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=7383097">Expand</a></span>
