<br>
<br>Game play is repetitive in the worst way, the combat is unreasonably hard in some places, and the story can be guessed very easily! Another huge disappointment is the open world; I thought it&apos;d be awesome but I found it very tedious to have to walk back and forth across the map 30 or so times just for the main missions.Fast travel would be fantastic!
<br>
<br>Overall I cannot recommend this game at this price, period. Wait for a sale for like $20 or so. It&apos;s a shame, really it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6480960">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You have to unlock skills like knowing how to roll.
<br>
<br>You run around collecting floating letters like you would in a tony hawk game.
<br>
<br>All delivery quests have a time limit of around a minute, while the package has probably been there for a long time, whats the hurry?
<br>
<br>You can do &quot;dashes&quot; which have you run a course in as fast a way as possible, and at the end you can see how well you did compared to others. This is fun except that you&apos;re not running against people with the same amounts of upgrades as you, why?
<br>
<br>Why is Faith bulletproof? Why is Faith so superhumanly strong? Why is faith?
<br>
<br>Please let me be on the ground.
<br>
<br>There are soooo many &quot;side quests&quot; which are just things like running a course, destroying a pillar then running away and so on. These things are enjoyable but only in the way that junk food is enjoyable, while junk food is bad for your health these side quests are just plain bad, They only prolong the gaming experience. You could argue that they force you to explore more of the world they have created, but in reality you aren&apos;t going to see very much you haven&apos;t seen after two hours of running on rooftops. The places that are cool looking are either in the main quest or places you cant get to (the ground).
<br>
<br>For the most part I didn&apos;t like anything besides the main story, so why don&apos;t I just skip the 50% of the game I dislike and just play what I do like? Well there&apos;s a problem that some players experience with the cinematic cutscenes, where the sound is desynced and you&apos;re lucky if you can watch them with even 2fps. I myself have this problem so at this point there isn&apos;t very much for me to enjoy.
<br>
<br>The game might be enjoyable in its finished state but right now it&apos;s not, definitely not worth 59.99&#x20AC;, just download it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6492682">Expand</a></span>

The game has lost its fast paced nature, too much time going from point A to point B, there is too much down time.  Way to go DICE/EA, another franchise has been ruined, well done guys.</span>

<br>Like said before, the open world thing is bull*hit, you have to take the same paths back and forth all over again, boring -_-
<br>Add repetitive useless combat, not so good visuals, boring story...
<br>I didn&apos;t even finish it and watched the ending on youtube just for the sake of it.</span>

<br>
<br>Negative:
<br>-The story was better in 2008 it was hardly predictable, unlike this, and a bad romance thing here and there
<br>-MAGRope was uninteresting and ugly, why a runner need this!? I have no clue its not feel I play as a real runner
<br>-the cameras around the city and the BAGS(secret ones) have a really irritating sounds
<br>-no more 2d cg-s
<br>-Badly optimized frostbite is a p.o.s engine, it would be better with UE4
<br>-Irrational high pc demand even in ultra or hyper with 390 oc you cant get 60fps stable
<br>-Most cutscene is pre rendered if you play 30fps/30hz then its lock 15 choppy fps if you play 60fps/60hz then the cutscenes go 30fps bravo EA/DICE! why make a game to be standard 60fps experience? so you think everybody can play the game stable 60fps? you know there are more people around the world who have need only 30fps and not need 60fps.
<br>-ugly characters Icarus (irritating useless guy who always around faith, and talking in radio and he&apos;s in faith ass)..,noah (Antonio banderas and retired Nathan drake mixed bad merc copy-cat) nomad ( a lover boy who wants love faith and make ugly graffities) :( no characters was even come close to jackknife or merc,or hell any runners, faith from 2008.
<br>-Most voice acting/actors is so bad especially faith voice is so bad like she didn&apos;t even care the act, jules de jongh was perfect in 2008.
<br>-no tattoo signal =emblem on runners artistic (concept) is **** up in characters too, now most of the runner use sunglass, and everyday natural cloth and hairstyle and no woman important runner only faith..
<br>**** up artistically the whole game, (city,characters) drones,drones everywhere, everywhere i look I see drones welcome to the stupid futuristic drones world.
<br>-Well most but not all Music is SO UGLY! what happens with solar field? they make a awesome work back on 2008!
<br>-fighting system is irritating! its way worse in every aspect than 2008 was, cmon i kick the enemy once and he is DEAD!? plus the gamebugs every enemy is stuck in the wall!
<br>-Graphics is so bad, every character except the important ones is washed out! the level textures is washed out!, i swear mirrors edge 2008 have a better graphics!
<br>-Rhianna Pratchett did a great job on 2008 unlike the new writer
<br>-Icarus most of time he is there you are, the game would be better with faith alone doing the game missions.
<br>-wow they did it they gived faith a bigger ass.... That was really important right EA/DICE!? ehhh
<br>catalyst is nothing more just a artistically **** up and downgraded version of 2008. Congrats EA/DICE you know how to ruin something good, and special, you really good with that.
<br>-If you are a real mirrors edge fan you not buy this game, at least not full price.
<br>so we waited for this ugliness 8 year!? bravo EA/DICE! BRAVO
<br>
<br>Positive:
<br>-Reboot, but at least this nothing to do with 2008 so 2008 was not ruined by this.
<br>-DOGAN! he was interesting (WHAT ELSE IS THERE!)
<br>-some side mission, open world.
<br>-isabelle kruger was interesting as well
<br>-Gabriel kruger
<br>-some music but not all its not a great job like in 2008 was.
<br>- the story wasn&apos;t bad but still like I said up there 2008 was better.
<br>-The game have some memorable moments with faith and dogan, faith and isabelle kruger, Gabriel.
<br>-faith was bad just bad, they she looks, and she is talking, attitude, she have too many friends lol.. she talking too much in gameplay</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6485901">Expand</a></span>

The problem with all of the other negative reviews is that they didn&apos;t have their expectations set right. I&apos;m not saying they shouldn&apos;t&apos;ve expected it to be good, they were just expecting it to be more of the first game. This is not a continuation of Mirror&apos;s Edge 1, this is a separate game with different mechanics and a different story. The story may be cheesy, but it&apos;s not terrible.
<br>
<br>The extremely light RPG elements helped ease new players into the game by not throwing too much at them at once. Other reviews complain that you don&apos;t unlock moves until you grind for them. That&apos;s not what it is at all. The game gives you the right amount of experience points at the right pace so that you unlock the moves when you need to (and you can get them all pretty early in the game). The game doesn&apos;t ever give you obstacles that you can&apos;t get passed without a certain move until after you&apos;ve already unlocked that move (assuming you unlock things in a reasonable order and don&apos;t spend all of your points into combat right at the start).
<br>
<br>The graphics are great and the game was well optimized. I can this game at 1080p with a graphics card that was listed as below the minimum required (a Radeon HD 7870) and, with the right graphics settings, I could get a pretty consistent 60 FPS with the game still looking really good. It has a minimalistic art style, so it doesn&apos;t take much to make it look great.
<br>
<br>The combat isn&apos;t too great at first, but once you start unlocking some of the upgrades, it gets really satisfying and I actually usually enjoyed getting into fight sequences.
<br>
<br>The sound design is fantastic. The sound effects are super immersive and the music by Solar Fields is fantastic, as usual.
<br>
<br>A lot of other reviews complain about having to constantly backtrack, but if you&apos;re not stupid, you don&apos;t if you don&apos;t want to. I found the free running quite entertaining so I would often backtrack just for fun, but the game has a fast travel system that works really well and will keep you from having to constantly run in the same areas.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a great game and a great companion to the original. It is very different in many ways, but that&apos;s good. We already have Mirror&apos;s Edge 1, and while more of the same would have still been very fun, I think they did a great job at making a new, different experience in Mirror&apos;s Edge Catalyst.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6481028">Expand</a></span>

DO NOT listen to ANYONE that gives this game a rating below 6/10. They are lying. The game is not that bad. Mirror&apos;s Edge Catalyst doesn&apos;t deserve a 6, let alone a 1.
<br>
<br>Catalyst is basically the first game but better. Actual movement is A LOT smoother and isn&apos;t nearly as clunky, its no longer linear (open world) which gives it even MORE replay value than the first game had, user-created time trials so you have an infinite number of them, better characters, arguably better story (although the story is still iffy.)
<br>
<br>The movement is definitely the games best point. Again, its like the first game but smoother. Faith doesn&apos;t randomly lose her momentum anymore. She doesn&apos;t fail to grab stuff anymore. She doesn&apos;t perform wrong moves anymore. She doesn&apos;t vault over stuff you want to climb up on anymore.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s fantastic. You get a sense of smoothness you don&apos;t get much in the original game. Combine the almost perfect movement with the open world, and you get a giant playground. People seem to be missing the point of the open world. It&apos;s for parkour. Even if the open world doesn&apos;t have a ton of fleshed out content, there&apos;s still PARKOUR to do. And that&apos;s all I really wanted. More parkour. More areas to perfect, places to explore using parkour. And this game gave it to me.
<br>
<br>The social features are also great and go hand in hand with the open world.
<br>It&apos;s so easy to make your own Time Trial&apos;s, and thanks to the open world, there&apos;s a lot of places to do it. Time Trial&apos;s you make show up in other player&apos;s worlds.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s markers (Beat L.E&apos;s) that you can place to mark locations and show up in other player&apos;s world&apos;s. Maybe put one in a hard to reach place, maybe mark an easter egg, maybe put one on top of a high up spot (because I love jump puzzles.) You can look at how many players have touched a marker.
<br>
<br>There are &quot;hackable&quot; billboards, where when you hack them, your runner tag shows up on that same billboard in a friends world. You usually need to do a jump puzzle to get to billboards, and again, I love jump puzzles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6476964">Expand</a></span>

<br>There is few things i want you to tell:
<br>1) RPG system. Yes, i hate new games with RPG system which exists only because it&apos;s trendy and all new games have it. Roll from start? Forget about it, farm EXP and u will unlock the roll. It&apos;s so lame.
<br>2) Story as a basis. I love original game because of stupid story which was so invisible.  But in this game story is a whole game. Not for gamers, but developers. They put so much time to make a story which consists of only clich&#xE9;, but this game never needs a good story. The whole original game rested on simplicity. Simple movement, simple gameplay (but very entertaining), simple story and clean design.
<br>3) Optimization. I have never expected my GTX970 and i5 4690 can&apos;t handle ME:C in 1080p. Freezes, texture glitches and uploading textures pissed me off.
<br>4) Movement. I thought it was impossible to spoil Faith&apos;s movement. But they did it. At half it depends on new RPG system, and at other half it depends on &quot;auto-clinging&quot; to all ledges.
<br>
<br>In conclusion i want to say that EA should rethink their own approach to their games. SW:BF was a big bad boring mess. And ME:C didn&apos;t go so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6479148">Expand</a></span>

The art style, while appealing to cyber-punk fans, has absolutely no place in a Mirror&apos;s Edge title. The lack of proper world exploration as well as the elimination of the optional gunplay of the first is a horrible cop-out. The forced tutorials, impossible-to-disable marking of obvious paths and general hand-holding throughout is an insult to the player&apos;s intelligence. The charm of the original is absent in almost every regard, though superior melee combat is satisfying.
<br>
<br>Art Direction:
<br>Mirror&apos;s Edge took place in a realistically foreseeable future from our own.
<br>Catalyst, despite being a prequel, would be what life was like if we had already perfected living on Earth and were moving on to colonizing other planets.
<br>The game is littered with animated billboards which killed any possible chance of a minimalist art style the first game had. I understand why, but it&apos;s still far-too heavy-handed an approach to get an idea across.
<br>The art style is far more Ghost in the Shell than Mirror&apos;s Edge. I&apos;m a massive cyberpunk fan, yet I understand this style has absolutely no place in a Mirror&apos;s Edge game. I would go so far as to say that given what we were to expect from the first game, it&apos;s simply ugly.
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>The first Mirror&apos;s Edge game had a simple story. The story didn&apos;t break any boundaries but didn&apos;t fall unforgivably short, either.
<br>Catalyst begins with heavy-handedly telling you why you should dislike the &quot;bad guys.&quot;
<br>Every character you meet is a cliche and has their personality written on their face.
<br>Cutscenes come off as being poorly written, despite having flawless animation and voice work.
<br>
<br>Difficulty:
<br>There are no difficulty settings. Thankfully, you can turn Runner Vision off for a slightly harder experience, however, more than half of every parkour-able surface has these atrociously ugly skid marks on them to constantly remind the player that they can run along them. Part of the charm of the hardest difficulty on Mirror&apos;s Edge was not being told where it was possible to go next. It was incredibly satisfying to flawlessly execute a successful run using your own wits and quick thinking.
<br>
<br>Much of the beginning of Catalyst has it teaching you what you can do without a way to skip. The game will continue to drill you on combat techniques past the tutorial. If you decide you&apos;d like to engage an enemy in a different way, or skip the enemy altogether, the game will simply reset you to the last checkpoint so it can make you play it the way that it wants you to.
<br>
<br>Combat:
<br>Easily the redeeming feature of the game, albeit a bit repetitive and forced at times (combat in ME should almost always be optional.) The combat in the first game was fun, and the combat in Catalyst has been improved ten-thousand fold. It&apos;s incredibly satisfying to defeat enemies in melee combat, and feels just as unforgiving as the first if you make a mistake, which is a good thing.
<br>
<br>Progression:
<br>A horribly executed idea. For starters, the game has 9/14 skills already learned for you - why?
<br>This is unnecessary filler, given that the player will never have these skills taken away from them later in the game. They&apos;re as superfluous as adding &quot;running&quot; &quot;breathing&quot; &quot;jumping&quot; as learned abilities.
<br>All the learnable skills should have been given to the player at start; It should be the player&apos;s responsibility to grow and learn how to effectively use these techniques, not locked behind some arbitrary numerical EXP system.
<br>
<br>The world, and other cop-outs:
<br>The open world is neat, but disappointing. It has a lot of potential, but given you can never travel to the lower altitudes (such as streets) seems like developer laziness. Their explanation is that the streets are too dangerous for Faith, which seems absurd given the amount of patrolling done on the rooftops by Kruger security.
<br>Additionally, as another cop-out worth mentioning: weapons being DNA-locked to their owners is a terrible excuse to exclude gunplay from this game. Pardoning the fact this technology didn&apos;t exist in the first game, the gunplay being a choice was incredibly empowering in the first game. There are numerous scenarios where using weapons against PK security would have been easy, yet the game allowed the player to choose not to use them, either to prove that they were superior fighters that didn&apos;t need such an advantage to win, or because they believed that killing others wasn&apos;t something that their incarnation of Faith would do. It also allowed such players to have the experience of becoming frustrated or otherwise emotionally affected by their hostility to the point of using their weapons against them, thereby stooping to their enemy&apos;s level and having to reflect on this fact.
<br>
<br>These potential experiences are gone simply because the developers decided not to implement gunplay into Catalyst.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6479760">Expand</a></span>

The graphics look much better with hyper graphics, just turn off the runner vision and this game is way better than what most people played on the beta. The only bad points is the AI, and the drug adict arquitecture style of the city has.</span>

But oh boy I was wrong I wish I bought it the day it got released. This game is so good in every way. Fighting mechanics, running mechanics, story and graphics are so much better in this game and playtime is so much longer. I get that people don&apos;t like this kind of game but don&apos;t come and say the first mirror&apos;s edge is better than this game (I would even go that far and say that the people who say that didn&apos;t even play the first game) because they have improved everything in such an awesome way and the previous mirrors edge doesnt offer anything that this game doesn&apos;t offer, not even missions..  If you loved the first title, you sure won&apos;t be disapointed in any way. But if you compare mirror&apos;s edge open world  to GTA V&apos;s open world then sure you will be disapointed.
<br>
<br>(I played the entire game without runner vision and max FOV). This game is by far my new favorite game (besides competitive games and just over the last mirror&apos;s edge). Worth any penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6715272">Expand</a></span>

However, as is naturally the case with games nowadays, and given DICE&apos;s involvement in developing Battlefield games, I was skeptical about whether this game can possibly deliver without being a huge flop, despite the 8 year gap since the original&apos;s release.
<br>
<br>I am pleased to report that this game is by no means a lazy rush-job in an appeal to nostalgia.
<br>
<br>The first thing that strikes me is the visuals. It is by far the best looking game I&apos;ve ever played. This is perhaps a perfect example of a game where both the graphical quality and technology of the underlying game engine (Frostbite 3) and the art style go perfectly hand-in-hand. The game stays true to the original&apos;s art style, but takes a step further. Whereas in the first game there was heavy re-use of assets to the point where most of the environment was a copy-paste job, Catalyst has much more variety in its visual assets, colours and architecture of buildings. It is truly a breathtaking sight on PC. I still to this day think the original&apos;s graphics on max settings hold up thanks to the art style, but Catalyst is on another level both because of the game engine and the visual style being taken further to add more variety by the artists.
<br>
<br>Catalyst is an open-world game; which is a blessing for some and an annoyance for others. On the one hand, the huge map allows for the variety of architecture which was absent from the original; which aids in enhancing the game&apos;s visuals. From a gameplay aspect, it means that you are no longer constrained to a (mostly) linear path as you were in the original. Of course, no open-world game would be complete without a plethora of side-quests and collectibles, and Catalyst has PLENTY of them. There must be thousands of collectibles and side missions combined; though of course these are completely optional. Doing these grants your &quot;scrip&quot; (XP) which can be used to purchase upgrades, such as improving your combat capabilities or even unlocking new moves. However, this is not a particularly strong motive since the total XP required to get all 17 upgrades is far less than what you&apos;ll get from doing even a fifth of all objectives and the main story. These are there for the true completionists and those that want a motive for exploring the gorgeous city of Glass.
<br>
<br>Although the map is huge, the number of ways to get from any part of the map to another is actually very limited; at least on the surface. The open-world nature of the game means that it&apos;s not easy to navigate. Thankfully however, the signature Runner&apos;s Vision is there to help. Not only will it highlight objects for your to indicate the path, but can also show you a moving trail to follow in case you get lost. Even after doing A LOT of collectibles and side missions and finishing the story, I find myself needing to rely on this for most side missions and navigation. It certainly feels like there&apos;s less room for creativity. Consequently, the side quests are actually quite difficult for time; requiring a near-perfect run when following the suggested route (which is often the only route!).
<br>
<br>Of course, all of this content is useless if the core gameplay isn&apos;t up to scratch. Thankfully the designers have stayed true to the concept of the original; perhaps even more so by not allowing Faith to use guns. The hand-to-hand combat is very simple both mechanically and in terms of controls, yet feels satisfying despite the extremely predictable AI who make it very easy. Combat is not optional for many parts of the game, but the mechanics are just about good enough to excuse this. Regarding the parkour, it&apos;s similar to the original but with a few additions. You can now press a button to get up to speed after slowing down, and the major change is that you can springboard off pretty much anything. There&apos;s also a grappling hook you unlock later for traversing extreme heights and distances; though it can only be used at specific points. Overall the controls and mechanics are more &quot;clean&quot;, fluid and intuitive, with no kick-glitching or side-stepping. It feels much more fundamental and easier to master; which is ultimately a good thing; though not as involved and technical as the original.
<br>
<br>The story has received quite a lot of negative press, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s warranted. Sure, character development isn&apos;t as deep as it should be and the overall plot is wishy-washy, but it gets the job done. Certainly I wouldn&apos;t buy the game for the story, but the production value is a step up from the original&apos;s animated style.
<br>
<br>Overall I would highly recommend this game. It&apos;s a visual treat and is sufficiently optimized. The open-world really suits the game and is well-executed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6808828">Expand</a></span>

Greatly improved graphics - steady 60fps 1080p on my PC - and beautiful artwork. Free-flowing parkour is rewarded. Any goofs and your &quot;Focus&quot; meter drops. Combat is fun if you weave it into the flow (e.g. leap into a slide attack then Shift out and keep running). Main campaign had an OK story line with mostly forgettable characters, but I wasn&apos;t there for the story. I was there for the city and oh-boy did it deliver. Huge map to explore and every surface is parkour-friendly.
<br>
<br>Campaign is short (~10 hours including side quests) but there are heaps of dashes, deliveries, random events and hidden secrets. Redoing the same runs is like a racing game - try and beat your previous lap - and always room for improvement. Get the perfect slide, the perfect leap, the perfect wall run, and shave 0.5 seconds off a run. When you get stuck, watch a youtube and slap your head &quot;why didn&apos;t I think of that&quot;, there are clever ways of making any run faster.
<br>
<br>This is sort-of but not-really an open world. There are gridpoints and metagrids to expand the map - they were heaps of fun btw, like mini-puzzles within the game - but the events are statically located on the map. Also you don&apos;t really decide how the world unfurls and the campaign is definitely linear. So it is really a linear-game with free-roaming and out-of-order side-quests. It&apos;s not what I&apos;d call open-world.
<br>
<br>Did not like the bionic-commando rope they added. DICE should leave that **** out of the next game. Also they added an ability tree, but it&apos;s not RPG-like where you can choose strength over speed for example. You will get all the abilities. It&apos;s pointless. Take that **** out too.
<br>
<br>Sound effects and theme music is still top-notch. However the breakout song from the first game was the &quot;Still Alive&quot; track by Lisa Miskovsky. They brought in CHVRCHES this time and their song is forgettable. Nothing as good as the original.
<br>
<br>I loved this and looking forward to the third-installment. But looking at the negative scores here I think maybe a third-installment might not happen :-(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6733045">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1 - it looks very good &gt; graphic are clean and sharp.
<br>
<br>2 - run very good &gt; got a few minor bugs but which games hasn&apos;t any bugs anyway..nothing important really. I was actually surprised everything run perfectly well let say 97%, believe me.
<br>
<br>3 - gameplay is a runner game : first surprised when I found out I couldn&apos;t grab weapon, but finally found out it&apos;s all part of the new features from the fresh gameplay. without weapons fight are more intense and crazy believe me! loved it.
<br>
<br>4 - open world : everything clearly show on the map, also a realtime GPS with path finding showing you the direction front of you. then you just have to run, jump, slide, etc.... super dynamic gameplay.
<br>
<br>5- height are crazy, very good sensation.
<br>
<br>6- Never lost time in menus or setting up the character,.everything is straight, the game focus on gameplay.
<br>
<br>Well I loved it.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for complicated games with thousand of items and hundred hours of storyline, etc..  just pass.
<br>
<br>Mirror&apos;s Edge is first a &quot;simple&quot; game, and the entire fun is focusing on the runners.
<br>It has to keep as simple and straight as it is right now, perfect balance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6796033">Expand</a></span>

Mirror&apos;s Edge Catalyst boasts a big and interesting map with multiple different areas and impressive level design. The map is filled with activities and side missions as well as different objectives, such as hackable billboards and user created races.
<br>The gameplay is well made and easy to learn and difficult to master. It gives a big sense of freedom as you free run your way through the city. You get almost complete controll over your movements and you can unlock new abilities and tricks with points you earn by playing the game. With these abilities it feels great coming back to older areas of the game to explore places you previously could not reach. The fighting mechanic is just a huge, meh. It works, its fun when its going fast, but when your stuck and have to fight four, five guys without running anywhere it gets frustrating and boring.
<br>Alas the story is ablotutely useless. It did not intrigue me whatsoever and was merely a backround to the fun gameplay and free running in the missions. The story was also short. The story left me feeling nothing, and there was absolutely nothing to reflect on (no pun intended). I couldn&apos;t invest myself in the story, I did not care. I mostly just skipped the dialoge and cutscenes, which is something I rarely do, at least not in singleplayer story missions.
<br>On a technical level the game would have blown it out of the ballpark were it not for frequent lag spikes and framedrops. Although the game ran in 60fps on hyper setting on my machine (i5 6600k, EVGA gtx980, 16gb RAM). The graphics also look great, and the minimalist style works really well with the style of game DICE has created, although they did prove that in the last game back in 2008/9.
<br>To conclude I&apos;m afraid DICE could not deliver on the huge hype and expectations of players who loved the previous game. The sales figures are unknown at this time (18.06.2016) but different sources are saying that the numbers are lackluster. I still believe EA will support another game in the series, and I definitely think DICE would like to make another.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6500462">Expand</a></span>

<br>Oh, This game is bad&#x2026;
<br>I haven&#x2019;t played the original so either I&#x2019;m in the minority , or they messed it up
<br>Mirrors Edge Catalyst is a prequel to the original game,
<br>This tells the origins story of  faith and her sister
<br>It starts out with faith being released from imprisonment and getting back to her runner ways&#x2026;
<br>This is a bit of an open world game&#x2026;which after a few hours you&#x2019;ll realize this was a huge mistake&#x2026;
<br>In this open world there are collectibles and side missions to do&#x2026;
<br>But for the most part this open world is just a parkour time waster in between your missions&#x2026;
<br>Every mission for the most part feels the same&#x2026;
<br>Climb through vents, run past bad guys..
<br>rinse repeat&#x2026;
<br>Because this is an open world.. every obstacle and path on the way to every mission is the same turning this into a repetitive grind to the credits&#x2026;
<br>There are fast travels points, but they can only be unlocked after you hack certain points in the city.. and even before then you have to earn enough xp to unlock a skill or be far enough in the story to have the skill to reach these hackable spots&#x2026;
<br>making me believe that the developers actually wanted you to grind through the same sections over and over&#x2026;
<br>And the parkour is just not fun&#x2026;
<br>it feels way too slow, like faith is a jogger rather than a runner&#x2026;
<br>And none of the wall climbs or jump every feel satisfying and will sometimes feel like they aren&#x2019;t working properly&#x2026;
<br>Which leads to many deaths in this game&#x2026;
<br>I rarely ever felt like dying was my fault&#x2026;
<br>And unfortunately the checkpoints in this game are some of the worst I&#x2019;ve ever seen
<br>The worst of all though is this games combat...
<br>speaking of worst ive ever seen
<br>The combat in this game is the most garbage and cheap feeling system I can remember suffering through&#x2026;
<br>you have a light attack and heavy attack..
<br>Meanwhile enemies have batons, guns, and tasers&#x2026;
<br>The batons and gun enemies aren&#x2019;t too bad to deal with&#x2026; but the taser guys block every light attack even when you could have clearly got a strike, leading you to have to spam the triangle button to defeat them,
<br>having to resort to spam attacks in combat is never a good sign&#x2026;
<br>And there are a handful of sections where you have to defeat waves upon waves of enemies&#x2026;
<br>And these taser guys are bullet sponges so if you focus on them you&#x2019;re going to get shot or if you focus on the gun guys you&#x2019;re going to get shocked&#x2026;
<br>and once you do finally luck your way to the final waive&#x2026; if one hidden enemy decides to start shooting while you take on who you think is last and they kill you,
<br>you have to start all the way from the beginning of the encounter&#x2026;
<br>I really wanted to like this game..
<br>But I&#x2019;m not even sure if its developers liked this game
<br>because ultimately it feels like it was built as a job and not as a passion...
<br>I give Mirrors Edge Catalyst

People say it&apos;s open world when in reality it&apos;s more of a &quot;more open world&quot; than the first game.

<br>If you&apos;re tired of slogging through dark and dank dungeons or settings, tired of making 100&apos;s of false choices to determine the fate of civilization and your mates (choices that they just ignore in a sequel anyway), and what you want is an upbeat, clean breath of fresh air plus the freedom to run, jump, roll, fly, etc. around, then this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6515788">Expand</a></span>

<br>I am a fan of the big one,the first mirror&apos;s edge game is so awesome back in the days,bring an unique first person parkour experience back in the days.
<br>My biggest problem with this game is you can&apos;t go everywhere you want.See other games with parkour elements,like AC,dying light or Titanfall,you can go almost everywhere,from rooftops to the streets.That gives you the true feeling of an &quot;open world game&quot;,which is letting player to choose where to go.There is a lot of part in this game makes me feel that this is a linear game,not an open world game,because there is only one route to you target.Imagine how awesome this game will be if you can running on the streets and  climb buildings to reach the rooftops. The enemy AI is bad,you can learn their movement and crushed them easily.I really hope that they didn&apos;t remove the gun fight,it will be very awesome to have both melee combat and gun fight in this game.And the boss fight is just a long cutscene,not to mention the ending of this game is just a set up for the sequel.The story is ok,nothing really memorable,some characters like Faith,Noah and Icarus is cool,but the writers just can&apos;t make a great story.Overall,I think it&apos;s a 6.5,it is sad to see that Dice **** up another game after star wars battlefront.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6474960">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Wow... was I ever wrong. This is the worst game I have played in a long, long time.
<br>
<br>The running gameplay is almost the same as the first Mirror&apos;s Edge. They added the grapple (or mag hook, or whatever it&apos;s called - it&apos;s a grapple), and that was kind of cool, but now half of the things you could do in the first game, like the combat roll, you can&apos;t do until you unlock it hours in. When you eventually have gotten about half way through the campaign and unlocked the basics, you basically are playing the game from almost 10 years ago as far as running goes.
<br>
<br>The new combat system though... pure trash. Now, don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s not like the first game was better, but I would rather have my guns back than this. Being able to punch somebody out while running is nice, and the traversal shield is a great idea, but the whole system falls apart the second you have to stop and fight a group. If you are standing beside the guy you have to kill, it&apos;s unbearable; you&apos;re best off running away from him then running back so you can get him off a wallrun or something.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t think I need to go into the story here; even the good reviews say that it&apos;s crap.
<br>
<br>The last thing that made this game barely playable for me was the fact that it is open world. I MEAN COME ON! Whoever had this idea should be fired and have to do their walk of atonement through King&apos;s Landing. This is a game where running is the gameplay. Just think about that and open world for a second. An NPC gives you a mission, you run away from NPC to complete mission, you run back to NPC to turn in mission, you run away, you run back, you run away... SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING?!! You literally parkour the same environment over and over again. I will never comprehend this decision. The best part is, one of the biggest benefits of open world games is they usually end up taking over 30 hours when you immerse yourself in them. You will be done this game in 10 hours (I was done in 7). All they did was add a couple pointless side missions - some of which shouldn&apos;t count as missions at all - and litter the map with stupid collectibles and pointless objectives.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6560078">Expand</a></span>

Secondly, Faith&apos;s parkour movement is far more fluid and forgiving. I remember wall runs being somewhat iffy in the original, even after weeks of practice. Not so this time!
<br>
<br>Catalyst falls into many of the same action game traps as the original, particularly combat. A few missions misstep by forcing Faith into mandatory fights. That said, Catalyst replaced the original&apos;s reaction time and tricky disarm mechanics with a shift maneuver that I found quite satisfying once mastered. (The opponents&apos; AI, however, has not improved.)
<br>
<br>Another similarity: The story and character development have not improved much over the original. However, the cut scene production value has significantly improved.
<br>
<br>Given the franchise&apos;s history, this game should not exist. I find myself hoping Catalyst sells so EA DICE will give us more Faith and less Battlefield in the future. The world has enough AAA first person shooter games with male protagonists.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6570302">Expand</a></span>

The story itself was really good with the right amount of characters and a simple structure that was effective and kept you going. Great scenarios and beautiful graphics. There where some minor bugs and the story ended quite abruptly. Accessing the different game areas was sometimes hard due to a unique point of access, but there was fast travel implemented so it didn&apos;t really matter. The game is endless due to the new creation of runs by the community, which you can access at any time during gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6483593">Expand</a></span>

<br>Solid game with very good graphics, with nice parkour, with a wonderful ingame soundtrack.
<br>The only bad points are the stupid AI, and a very strange arquitecture style of the city.</span>

It may have its share of flaws but there is no denying that the game excels in many areas like game play, exploration, and controls. When you sit back and ponder, you will realize that there is nothing out there that&apos;s quite like Mirror&apos;s Edge Catalyst. It&apos;s a fresh take on the true and tired open world genre. You get to explore an immersive science fictional city of glass with clean and futuristic facade. There is plenty of side content and it&apos;s all built around parkour. The story missions are well designed and some of them truly make you think outside the box in order to progress. I&apos;ve easily put in around 20 hours into this game and had fun for majority of the time. I say get this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6504598">Expand</a></span>

Once I finally find that perfect route, and run it flawlessly, it&apos;s such a rush! I&apos;m only halfway through the story and don&apos;t have any complaints, it&apos;s not bad so far, though I have yet to get to the much-maligned mandatory boss fight(s). Anyway, people giving this zeros and ones are definitely just haters. Even if I weren&apos;t having a ton of fun with it, it&apos;s still a beautiful world and one of the best sandboxes ever created. I don&apos;t regret my purchase at all add I know this is a game I&apos;ll keep coming back to again and again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6485335">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is incredibly satisfying to play, because it is quite unforgiving if you make a mistake.

<br>This game is incredibly satisfying to play, because it is quite unforgiving if you make a mistake.
<br>
<br>The running system that we know and love from the first game has been refined, traversing the environment now feels a lot smoother and I feel like you have a lot more flexibility in how to you get from point A to point B. It is now open world, which makes the game feel a lot less linear.
<br>
<br>They have also added a mag rope which is a very fresh feature to the game.
<br>
<br>Runners vision is more expanded, it&apos;s really helpful in telling you where to go, but by choosing your own routes you can get to your destination faster.
<br>
<br>The combat system is really unique, you are supposed to constantly be on the move to keep your focus shield up and use traversals to easily dispatch your enemies one by one. It&apos;s really fast paced and extremely satisfying if you do it correctly.
<br>
<br>From grabbing onto a enemy drone to traversing a building that is crumbling to pieces, there are many moments in this game that are so thrilling.
<br>
<br>The dashes are a very nice addition which adds a competitive element to the game and you can spend a lot of time trying to improve your times.
<br>
<br>Visuals- 9/10
<br>The graphics in this game are absolutely breathtaking. You can see that the developers have really put a lot of effort into creating the environment and it has a incredibly unique artstyle which you won&apos;t see in any other game. The game does a wonderful job of truly immersing you in it&apos;s world.
<br>I will mention that a lot of the textures on the billboards will look really pixelly if you don&apos;t have the texture quality turned up, which you will require a high end graphics card.
<br>
<br>Story- 3/10
<br>I feel like the narrative massively drags the game down. It felt rushed, it was very simple and predictable, there were no plot twists and it had an anticlimactic ending.  Also, the characters were really unlikable, uninteresting, and there were no depth to their personalities.  Generally, this is okay if the character develops as the narrative progresses, but they didn&apos;t change at all.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s such a shame because it had huge potential, watching the story trailer gave me goosebumps. The basis of the story was really strong and they spread it thin.
<br>
<br>Music-
<br>I wished they had more of the music from the trailers in the gameplay, but it seemed to be non-existent.
<br>At the ending credits it played some, but that&apos;s about it :(
<br>
<br>Overall- 8/10
<br>Despite its flaws, I had a lot of fun playing this game as the weak storyline doesn&apos;t ruin the gameplay.
<br>I guarantee you that it&apos;s a very unique experience that you won&apos;t get from any other game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6492483">Expand</a></span>

I was lucky enough to get a beta key in late April, so I can appreciate the effort they put into it in the final pushback to June 7th. It&apos;s really telling just how much care and effort went into making this game as good as it could be.
<br>
<br>As the beta was closing up, I spent as much time as I could just running from one end of the map to the other, just setting waypoints and following the red. By the end, I was smoothly chaining together moves and getting a real feel for how the city flowed. When it was all said and done, I immediately loaded up the PC version of the original Mirror&apos;s Edge so I could just keep running that little bit more. It was an itch that couldn&apos;t be fully scratched.
<br>
<br>What I was sad to discover, however, was that NONE of the timing I had gotten down in Catalyst translated to the first game. I was missing ledges, jumping far too early, hitting corners, and dying a WHOLE flipping lot.
<br>
<br>It was then that I realized just what an improvement Catalyst was. The timings were looser, meaning it was actually far easier to get Faith to do what I wanted her to do. The field of view was wider, and I could turn corners without having to wait until they had passed me completely. There was a slight &quot;pull&quot; towards ledges I might have just barely missed without it, eliminating a lot of the frustration from the strict platforming sections. This game plays like DICE took everything that was good about the first game, polished it up, and gave us new toys to play with and a decent sandbox to do it in.
<br>
<br>Now that&apos;s not to say Catalyst is perfect. It isn&apos;t. Some would (and do) say it&apos;s VERY far from it. But during the 12 hours that I put into it, skipping most of the deliveries and non-story quests, I didn&apos;t really have many issues. I encountered a total of 3 graphical errors, 2 of which were very small textures failing to load, the other being a strange moment while I was on the verge of escaping K-SEC where 4 guards suddenly popped in, then out, then in and out again.
<br>
<br>The framerate does suffer at times, especially at the beginning of some of the pre-rendered (but created in-engine) cutscenes. It&apos;s a little jarring at first, with about 2-3 seconds of lag before the video catches up to the audio. There were also issues when a new K-SEC guard would show up, and the textures would gradually pop-in. I did see videos of YouTubers having framerate issues during high-action sequences, but I didn&apos;t notice any.
<br>
<br>The enemy AI is pretty unsophisticated, save for the highest class of K-SEC guards, the Sentinels. Some enemy classes would always be up front, while others would stay behind, guns ready but not firing. The story is lackluster, and the characters aren&apos;t given very much depth. NPCs that weren&apos;t integral to the storyline had lower resolution texturing, but when you only encounter them once, it&apos;s not really that big of a problem if you&apos;re just here for the main mission.
<br>
<br>But that&apos;s not why I wanted to play this game. I wasn&apos;t here for the story, or the characters, or whatever &quot;Big Brother&quot; bullspit was going on. I was here to run, jump, climb, vault, wallrun, slide, and roll my way through a non-linear series of rooftops. And that&apos;s where Catalyst shines. Again, I&apos;m not claiming perfection, as I did have about 5 instances where clipping or collision detection messed with my run. But they weren&apos;t enough for me to say &quot;this isn&apos;t fun anymore,&quot; as they did frequently in the 2008 game. If I missed a jump or failed to perform a wallrun properly, it was mostly MY fault. I never got frustrated with the game, not once.
<br>
<br>As I said before, DICE gave us some new toys to play with in their pretty new sandbox. One of them is the MAG rope, a multi-function device that allows Faith to swing across chasms, pull up to higher platforms, and pull down environmental obstacles. It&apos;s secondary function, the pulse, can be used to interfere with K-SEC comms units (which stuns the guards by emitting a high-pitched whine in their helmets), as well as security drones and cameras.
<br>
<br>We&apos;re also given new traversal moves, such as the double and triple wallrun, which make platforming even more fluid. We&apos;re also given a &quot;stamina&quot; bar (effectively a health bar), which doesn&apos;t refill until you fully escape combat. This does lead into a controversial mechanic, however, the XP system. Don&apos;t worry, kids. Give the game roughly an hour and a half of story missions and you&apos;ll be back to where you were in the first game.
<br>
<br>Anyone who knows Mirror&apos;s Edge knows the final mission is The Shard, the tallest building in Glass. And boy, they turned the dial to 11, testing just about all of my skills. I won&apos;t spoil it, but I will say this: wear your brown pants.
<br>
<br>This was well worth my $60. Lots of post-game here as well, I&apos;ll be playing this just as often as the original, if not more. I would recommend this game to buy, especially fans that know what Mirror&apos;s Edge truly should be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6492307">Expand</a></span>

Story is ok, not worse than ME but not much better.

Gameplay is nearly the same, but got updated and some new gadgets which are working nice without changing too much.

Performance is good on my GTX 970 in 2560x1080 (yes it&apos;s very 21:9 friendly!).</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Played 12h now with 50% story and 20% world complete.

<br>Gameplay is nearly the same, but got updated and some new gadgets which are working nice without changing too much.
<br>
<br>Performance is good on my GTX 970 in 2560x1080 (yes it&apos;s very 21:9 friendly!).
<br>I got around 50-75 FPS on Hyper Graphics (which is max), with memory barrier active, which seems to reduce the textures.
<br>Still looks very good and nice performance for release day.
<br>
<br>Encountered some problems with my external sound card and some crashes (every 2-3h), which is not too bad, because the game auto saves very often (several times per minute I think).
<br>
<br>There are many collectibles which I don&apos;t really like, but nearly every action game has it these days...
<br>
<br>I think it&apos;s a solid sequel which is worth buying, if you liked Mirror&apos;s Edge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6482676">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I just made a marathon playing both games, first Mirror&apos;s Edge, than Catalys. And one of the things that I noticed was how they improved the mechanics of the game.
<br>In Mirror&apos;s Edge, running and climbing on stuff was weird and sometimes broken. When you were hanging on an edge, you weren&apos;t able to look anywhere. Picking up guns was always the last resort to fight enemies ( and I had to pick them up a few times, since combat was a real mess back then). The characters of Mirror&apos;s Edge aren&apos;t &quot;likable&quot;. They aren&apos;t even rememberable as some reviews claim something&apos;s missing. Faith was never the awesome character people are trying so hard to remember. She was as blend an serious as she is now. The only character I can actually say was remarkable from the first game was Merc, and even than his death in the game never drove me to seek vengeance. The only thing that kept me going was the linear story mode.
<br>Now in Mirror&apos;s Edge Catalyst, the open world ( sometimes disappointing for not taking us to the streets and making us climb all the way back up) let you do your thing. I can forever and never feel that the messy  mechanincs of movement will kill me like in the first one. Here there is no doubt that you can make it that far, because it actually feels like you know your parkour. And it&apos;s cool, &apos;cause confidence killed me a few times in this game, and that&apos;s okay. At least I didn&apos;t die as many times like in the first one when my character got stuck or didn&apos;t respond to the controls as it should&apos;ve.
<br>Graphics are beautiful ( running on PC all maxed) and there&apos;s nothing &quot;blurry&quot; as people have been complaining.
<br>If you actually liked the first game, this one is a real step up for the series. My only complaint is to let players take it down to the streets as well. Maybe the enemy AI could be a little better, but as far as it goes, Mirror&apos;s Edge Catalyst is a solid game with a lot of improvement from the first one. The price tag may be a little salty, but if you&apos;re a fan and can afford it, there&apos;s nothing stoping you to play this awesome prequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6494690">Expand</a></span>

<br>I played through first game 2 times the week before launch, and several dozen times the years before, and Catalyst blew me away. Its an improvement of every single aspect. One of the best games in years and years.
<br>If you are worried because of the negative reception, dont be. Most flaws the game has don&apos;t effect the gameplay (e.g. slightly lonely on the rooftops, which I like) or are just personal grievances, for example the fundamental purists being appalled by Faith using a sort of grappling hook now. The free-running is better then it has ever been. The negative outrage comes from the kind of person who thinks an unlock system as a guiding help for new players is a personal insult, even though it takes just one hour to get all the skills from the first. The kind of person who thinks that the cutscenes in the first were great and the extremely well done ingame cutscenes (and a few prerendered) are blasphemous. Another thing to laugh about are the people raising a ruckus because bugs from the first game are no longer in the game. Yep, I also cant even... Unfortunately, most of the things said are flat out wrong, for example Catalyst can be far harder then the first, contrary to opinion of some. It has as much forced combat as the first, just this times around its a lot of fun instead of extremely badly implemented. One can run from nearly every combat encounter, few exceptions, or can fight, as one pleases. I fought a lot, because its a very fun combat system once one gets to grip with it, which can take a while. The level design is so superior to the first it is not even funny. There were very few well designed areas in the first, and tons of bad. In this game there are just a few sections I don&apos;t adore. Catalyst has the consistently best level design I have seen since Banjoo-Kazooie.
<br>Catalyst has infinite replayability with an insane amount of missions and &quot;dashs&quot; and infinite user generated content. Also lots of other content, the only one thats not well implemented is grabbing one kind of collectable, because it makes you stop. A **** of movement riddles that are consistently great top of the offering.
<br>The story is superior to most games, with good performances and interesting characters. A fun and fast paced, though overly simple, plot. What it lacks in depth, it makes up with style.
<br>Just like the first this game will be a classic for years to come. Just like the first this has come out to mixed critical reception and absolutely vial and ridiculously untrue and flat out stupid internet outrage. Just like the first it gets consistently called ugly, and will still be a example of the astonishing beauty games can achieve ten years from now.
<br>Its a miracle the game has been made, and its even more miraculous how consistently great, well crafted, and simply amazing it has become. It is astonishingly good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6485821">Expand</a></span>

Most negative reviews are about the game not being as they imagined it after 8 years of waiting, but still its a fantastic and fun game. Amazing combat, beautiful graphics (very simple tho) and HOOKS! damn.</span>

They took an amazing concept, streamlined it and littered it with utter garbage in the form of ridiculous and useless fillers (collectibles at every corners, useless sidequests and leveling system, etc...), because they&apos;re so scared and uninspired to come up with actual ideas. Speaking of this, the story and the characterization is easily one of the worst I&apos;ve seen in a long time. It&apos;s no news DiCE can&apos;t really write anything great, but they really outdid themselves this time. It&apos;s so bland, it makes Techland writers look like geniuses. I literally never managed to care about anything I was doing from the very first minute.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I bought this game expecting nothing much and I still managed to be seriously disappointed. It was somewhat alright on day 1, because the novelty to be back into an upgraded Mirror&apos;s Edge world, which definitely looks stunning, but after taking a 3 months break and coming back to it in order to finish it, I just realized how asinine most of this game is. I&apos;ll take any day a remake of the first one over this.
<br>
<br>Well done EA. This was the last entry in this fantastic set of franchises created 10 years ago (along with Dead Space, Mass Effect, Dragon Age) that was left to ruin. That time when I did regain a little faith in you against all odds seems again long gone nowadays. Looking at it, it&apos;s only a matter of time, before DiCE joins legends like Bullfrog, Westwood and Maxis. Luckily for them, there will be other victims of your corporate nonsense before that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6683385">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is fun (I particularly liked the previous M.E., so, naturally, I love this one&apos;s gameplay too!). So, we have : optimization, nice graphics, fun gameplay BUT people are still having something to complain about. That&apos;s the main problem in gaming industry, people always have something to complain about, even if the product is good, they find problems when there are none.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6738948">Expand</a></span>

ME1 was master piece in this... but all in all, this game has excellent graphic, running and parkour is much better than in ME1, open world and side missions and light RPG gameplay are perfect bonuses. Oh and the city is too much futuristic to my taste. ME1 was not such sci-fi as this one. 9/10</span>

Controls are little bit better for PC now, but not responsive, shortly game does not feel as smooth as was ME.
<br>Now gameplay, it&apos;s not a runner anymore, story is standard and boring, banal and not interesting, fighting becomes very linear, you have more combinations in compare to ME 1, but in 99% you will use just one and only useful combo.... Runner elements and parkour become also linear, again there are more possible ways to do things, but almost all that ways are useless, also game world feels limited now, game lost its atmosphere, you have more places to go in compare to ME 1, but as I say before they are mostly useless and very limited and background world looks dead in compare to ME 1...
<br>Not a worst game, but it&apos;s not a Triple A product and not worth to be called Mirror&apos;s Edge, feels like Workshop add-on more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=7419535">Expand</a></span>

<br>Art style is bad with bland and too much glass everywhere and transparent holograms, very reflective surfaces, everything combined overwhelms your vision and makes the game barely playable and hard to orient yourself. It&apos;s not even as pretty as the first one. Storytelling is just atrocious. I couldn&apos;t care a bit for the characters most of the time. There&apos;s no character development at all. Shallow. Sandbox gameplay is a complete disaster. I want good storytelling (with actual character development), linear, challenging experience. I don&apos;t want to run around a maze of a city top running errands that feel like a chore and a waste of time.
<br>
<br>Seriously, don&apos;t waste money and time with this if you played the first one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6670913">Expand</a></span>

<br>I like the story, I like the acting, I like the characters. It is a fine piece of work, and a solid 8.
<br>
<br>The visuals are sharp and crisp, with plenty to ogle while you dash past it. It maintains an incredible sense of speed and fluidity that you will feel challenged by. The combat, while simple, maintains the immersive first person perspective. The sound crew makes the struggle catch your breath for every gasp Faith takes.
<br>
<br>The story. The characters are multi-faceted and interesting, with a depth the first game was unable to achieve (like Portal, I feel it was simply a teaser for this game). There are good guys, there are bad guys, but none so committed or cliche that you ever feel embarrassed by their dialogue or lines. They have reasons. Legitimate reasons.
<br>
<br>This is a game about ideas, and the characters vivid performance captures the crazy, diverse world, perfectly. I laughed with Plastic, and felt Faith&apos;s intensity. I genuinely liked Noah, and even found myself admiring the admittedly bad Dogen (the most solid performance, in my eyes). These people live in a vivid and fluid city that is so interesting it becomes my only complaint.
<br>
<br>Why doesn&apos;t glass do more? I love it, and as you are running, it exists perfectly. Every rooftop has intricate little details, from the couple talking in the yellow room, to the creepy bird guy taking care of his pigeons. When you stop, however, the world stops. In fact, the game makes a point of this.
<br>
<br>The world loses color when you stop for too long. This is a statement, and also a failing in some ways. It is artistic, and perfect as you role-play the Parkour Prodigy that is Faith, but in terms of world building, the game has little to offer if you aren&apos;t running. That&apos;s not all bad, of course. Running is incredible in this game.
<br>
<br>At first, you stumble and fall and don&apos;t time that jump correctly; It is a struggle to maintain speed or pull off that reverse wall grapple. But, every time you get back up and try again the beauty of this complex system starts to reveal itself. When you get going, you can keep going. Sprint, leap, swing, jump, grapple, 180*. Perfection, all the way to the finish line.
<br>
<br>And, that&apos;s the sad thing. In a game with such a beautiful world to explore, there is a finish line. I found little reason (other than the thrill and nostalgia of the old areas) to go back into the world I had just stamped through.
<br>
<br>There is no greater reason to run than the impending crisis the game has you striving to avert. There are no other meaningful ways to pass your time. They speckle the game with time trials, delivery opportunities, and small world building side-jobs, but they pale in comparison to the engaging story-line.
<br>
<br>They set the game up for future content, content we probably won&apos;t get because, for some reason, this game is getting a bad rep.
<br>
<br>It is worth the current price of admission. This is a beautiful release, and a breath of fresh air.

<br>The Majority of negative reviews about this game on metacritic are laughable as the game itself is full of awesomeness with the type of gameplay everyone who are currently a mirrors edge 2008 fan is looking for.
<br>
<br>I have been hooked on the game for days straight completing the game up to 100% and its a utter joke how people hate on this game. Kudos to EA and Dice for developing a terrific new mirrors edge game.
<br>The characters and story line are amazing.
<br>
<br>I could not give this title anymore than an 8 because it is not flawless and contains some bugs and the enemies are easy to kill.
<br>I am really looking forward to mirrors edge 3 in the future.  Please do NOT listen to any of the negative reviews, peoples negative opinions about the game are ridiculous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6638081">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Open World mechanics are good, but not perfect. In fact, it will take a while for you to get accustomed to the Level Layout so you can disable the Runner Vision because of these levels being mostly chaotic and hard to remember. This is because there are not enough landmarks, making the overall map look pretty dull and similar in the areas close to Zephyr (the first, main district of Glass). This leads me to the Level progression.
<br>
<br>DICE, what the hell? The main history should have been a progressive moving to the city, but it feels like you have to backtrack over and over again with each mission ultil you are approaching the 75% of the game. This is something that will bore you most of the times, and even more if you want to complete ALL of the running courses that are scattered around Glass.
<br>
<br>The Runplay is simply awesome. It has all of the first ME moves, plus a new ones. Combat mechanics have changed a lot, allowing you to attack with fast or strong hits that will impact depending on the direction you execute them. You cannot use weapons though, not at all.
<br>
<br>The Art Design is simply beautiful. You will experience various breathtaking moments when getting to the highest buildings of Glass or even inside them. This is something I loved from Catalyst: The interiors. Glass gives you the sensation of being built like a Hive, instead of a normal city. The building layout is very dense, but it has beautiful open spaces even inside the buildings.
<br>
<br>I give this game a 6 because of the Artistic Design, Level Design, Music and Gameplay, but its script is dull at best, with a rebellious, childish Faith and  lifeless, plain secondary characters that could have been awesome, and also the boring backtracking thing on various parts of the main campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6573825">Expand</a></span>

Lacking in any sort of emotion and does not capture the spirit of the first game in any substantial form.
<br>
<br>Game starts off feeling OK but quickly devolves into an utter mess. The last two missions are comically bad as upgrades and gadgets all of a sudden become much more powerful and allow you to do things previously impossible (like magically zooming up 20 flights at a time). The core of the game, while functional and smooth, is so severely lacking in the actual story that it is upsetting, one or two missions make proper use of the free-running while the rest of the game just expects you to know where to move and when to move without any prior indication.
<br>
<br>Half of the game is spent backtracking in visually lack-luster environments and everything outside of the side-missions and main story arc is trash and utterly maddening to complete, you would have to be a lunatic to try and complete even a handful of these optional quests because you would need a level of knowledge of the game that you could never ever achieve if playing it naturally.
<br>
<br>The whole experience was a let down, it will not capture the same feeling you had with the first game and leaves a bad taste in your mouth if you decide to play through the rage and frustration, no big pay off, the game just gets worse as you play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6846566">Expand</a></span>

This game isn&apos;t about the gameplay, or the combat, or the story, or really anything. You seem to be missing the point of an open world game, it&apos;s got amazing replayability value and I see myself playing it every single day just to f*** around in for 30 minutes to hours just because its so fun to do so. Exploring the city never gets old, even through old areas. You find new routes, new tricks, ways to get to a previously thought to be impossible-to-reach spot, it&apos;s amazing.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>&#x2014; Extremely smooth movement system
<br>&#x2014; Huge open world with tons of places to discover and buildings to scale
<br>&#x2014; Really great replayability
<br>&#x2014; Runs very smooth, no frame drops on a GTX 1060
<br>&#x2014; Immersive first person view
<br>&#x2014; Tons of movement tricks to learn
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>&#x2014; Crashes (occasionally my computer) a fair amount due to memory issues (probably just me)
<br>&#x2014; The vault animation when you go from falling to vaulting cannot be stopped or jumped from, so you sometimes just fly off buildings due to it
<br>&#x2014; Annoying kill-barriers and invisible walls going to areas you&apos;d like to explore that you know you could get to
<br>&#x2014; Long loading times break the flow big-time when you fall and die, and in some areas can take up to 15-20 seconds
<br>
<br>Amazing game, definitely should buy it if you&apos;re into just f***ing around in an open-world parkour playground for 30 minutes at a time throughout the day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6950969">Expand</a></span>

It did not receive the care and attention it needed from the developers to make it good. Here&apos;s a breakdown of the game.
<br>
<br>Graphics (8/10)
<br>Whilst the graphics are impressive, the boring white world that Dice created is less so. 8 years on from the original they could have improved the game world so much more, instead they stuck to just updating what already existed. There are a few minor bugs still in the game such as Faith&apos;s hair jumping up and down in her reflection when in a moving lift which just show how little care they gave into finishing the game properly. Another thing which annoyed me all through the game was how many glass doors they decided to put in, ones which aren&apos;t always obvious to see whether they are open or not
<br>
<br>Gameplay (7/10)
<br>I have to admit, most of the time the game flows really well and is genuinely fun however there are a fair few problems with it. Though it flows well there are often things which seam to disrupt this flow unnecessarily, such as fans in tunnels which you have to stand and wait for until they switch off, and the use of ladders when they could just have designed something to climb that didn&apos;t slow you down. Another major problem is the combat, whilst is is hilarious to watch a guard go be knocked unconscious just by falling slowly onto a desk, it gets boring pretty quickly. It has a silly slapstick kind of feel which does not fit in with the rest of the game at all.
<br>
<br>Story (3/10)
<br>There isn&apos;t much to talk about here. The story is boring and I became disinterested very quickly. It is also filled with awkward, unlikable stereotypical characters.
<br>
<br>Content (4/10)
<br>I can&apos;t deny that there are plenty of collectables in this game because there are. My problem with them is that they are lifeless and you are given no motivation to go and get them. Each chip you find gives a meagre 10 experience points, when you need thousands to level up. They just seem to me like a pointless addition to the game.
<br>
<br>Controls (8/10)
<br>I can&apos;t complain about the controls. I have tried on PC with mouse &amp; keyboard and a controller and enjoyed both. However I don&apos;t see why they have not included DualShock4 controller support. I would expect at this point in time for every new release to support both Xbox and DS4 controllers.
<br>
<br>Cinematics (3/10)
<br>Most of the game ran very smoothly for me at the &apos;Very High&apos; settings, however when it came to cutscenes this was a different story. Each time I noticed a severe drop in frame rate, along with the poor voice actin, which did not lead to a good experience.
<br>
<br>Music (2/10)
<br>How can I rate the music of this game when I was playing for hours until I noticed there wasn&apos;t any. The music is so quiet and brings nothing to the game, compared to other games released at the same time, Dice clearly did not spend much time, money or effort into making a decent sdoundtrack</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6957037">Expand</a></span>

The mediocre reviews has made me steered away from this game beacuse many bugs and glitches were reported. Nobody released a completely finished game anymore (certainly not EA), so now it&apos;s either they release patches for it or they leave it altogther. Suprisingly, EA and DICE has not abandoned it (especially that they were working on Battlefield 1 around Catalyst&apos;s release), as I have not encountered any gamebreaking glitch.
<br>
<br>So, is the game good? Yes. Is it better than the original? Yes and no. Gameplay-wise, they fixed everything. The combat is so much better. Remember how awkward it was to use guns from the last game? Well, they removed the use of guns altogether, which is a love-it-or-hate-it point. And while the open-world is at best mildly-interesting, it does give you lots of freedom, unlike the last game, which was all about moving from point A to point B.
<br>
<br>The negatives? Well, the story is longer, but still not very good. It has quite an anti-capitalist stance, which is ironic because the stuff you see here are more likely to happen in a socialist society than a capitalist one. And this is published by EA, which clearly likes to take advantage of capitalism. Also, this was marketed as a prequel, but it&apos;s more of a reboot. Even the storyline was somewhat similar. Also, the sci-fi setting shows that this time period is more technologically advanced than the previous game (which is said to be in a later time period). So how the heck did they get from using unmanned drones and lasers to Blackhawk choppers and MP5s? Is this a prequel or reboot? These problems prevented it from getting a 9 (and even a 10).
<br>
<br>And the theme song is &quot;Warning Call&quot; by CHVRCHES. It fits the game, just as how &quot;Still Alive&quot; (not the Portal one) fits the last game.
<br>
<br>Technical-wise, it plays great on Medium on my GTX 960M.
<br>
<br>If you have left the game or held off buying it, I suggest you play it now. It&apos;s not worth full price (really, is there any game besides MGSV worth $60 nowadays?), but it&apos;s fun, which is what games are all about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrors-edge-catalyst/user-reviews?user_review_id=7488215">Expand</a></span>
