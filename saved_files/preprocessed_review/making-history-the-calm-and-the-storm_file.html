No such luck. This game is inferior to Hearts of Iron 2 on all counts, and the fact that Muzzy Lanes shamelessly advertises it as a history teaching tool is just bad taste. If you don&apos;t believe me, try the 1939 scenario and see how many times you see a war between Germany and Poland (rather than, say, Poland and Denmark). There is a different between plausible alternative history and utter nonsense. I won&apos;t discuss most other features, as they are by and large copied from HoI2 and &quot;streamlined,&quot; somehow ending up with a game that&apos;s MORE opaque than Paradox&apos;s notoriously complicated magnum opus. But I would like to comment on the economy, which for some reasons gets rave reviews - it&apos;s cumbersome, unrealistic and simply detracts from what this game is about - being Risk on a 1936 map of the world. The designer who thought that having players manually direct a billion little production facilities on map is a good idea really should not have a job.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/making-history-the-calm-and-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=425265">Expand</a></span>

In the very early stages you really feel like you&apos;re making your country. It feels unique. However, once a large war breaks out (which WILL happen, they scripted the AI so Germany and Britain will always fight), the game quickly degenerates. When the scale of combat goes up, it becomes a mind-numbingly boring game of &quot;build the bigger army.&quot; It doesn&apos;t seem to matter what units you use, what tactics you have, what tech level each unit is, every battle boils down to one point: Which side has more pointsin strength. However, it appears that the game sometimes randomly decides to change that up, as once I had a 200 point army against an 80 point army, and the 80 point army won without A SINGLE CASUALTY. The game doesn&apos;t give you any reason to work your way up in tech. It also doesn&apos;t seem to care if you run out of resources, you just get a minor production penalty. Although I&apos;m sure people would be likely to do more than slow work down if they were STARVING TO DEATH. As for diplomacy, it&apos;s basically nonexistant. You start with certain countries liking or disliking you or being indifferent. However, you don&apos;t seem to have any way to change that. I tried giving aide, no luck. I tried giving them military access. No luck. Finally, I gave them a province under my control This actually brought the diplomacy level DOWN, as if they disliked me because I gave them land. Units sometimes seem to magically appear, as there is no significant alert towards unguarded areas being captured. This puts larger countries such as the USSR at a large disadvantage. If you are focused on fighting in one area, you may turn around only to realize that half your country has been seized by enemy forces. I would reccomend this game to people who either enjoy clicking the &quot;turn&quot; button repeatedly with no significant reward, or people that enjoy staring at maps for lengthy periods of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/making-history-the-calm-and-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=396740">Expand</a></span>

If you love strategy games, it&apos;s hard to find anything more perfect than this one. Sure, there are imperfections, but there is so much good here that little things like trade really can be overlooked and the title really does bring a lot to the table.<br><br>Like WW2?

It quite definitely DOES work and it&apos;s very enjoyable when you&apos;re able to manipulate your enemies while garnering allies to your cause. This is by NO means meant to be some kind of realistic simulation but rather an exploration of the cause and effect behind National management and diplomacy at the higher-levels during WW2. If you fail to grasp that, you&apos;ll fail to enjoy or understand this game, period. Clearly some of the other posters in here lacked the ability or insight to &apos;get&apos; that aspect of this fun game. Whiny grognards should return to their beloved hex-based wargames and let the rest of us enjoy what is, by most accounts, a very good, very fun game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/making-history-the-calm-and-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=397106">Expand</a></span>

I think the game is quite overpriced for what you get. Those who think that the economy is broken dont get the game, some say that the use of military is wierd since it doesent matter what units you use. But it does! If you just try to read what there is to read about the different units you will know that some are better at different things than others. But the diplomacy is really messed up, often you find that some country&apos;s really need you, they dont wanna ally you (like france is being invaded by germany but they aperntly dont care). And it seems that if you got someone to dont like you its never gonna chance. This game is well thought trough but i think that it has lacked some tester who knew what they were doing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/making-history-the-calm-and-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=63177">Expand</a></span>

This game fits much more into the Axis &amp; Allies board game mold, or the Civilization series mold, than it does to Hearts of Iron or one of hte &quot;hex&quot; games where WWII is replayed the same way every time. This game is the ultimate &quot;what if?&quot; WWII game. One really impressive thing about this game is the quality of the code--most games from newbie developers are filled with crashes and other serious problems. Not so with Calm and the Storm. There are some problems with the game, but nothing that a few patches shouldn&apos;t mostly take care of. Although it probably really deserves a score in the 8&apos;s, I wanted to balance the ridiculously low scores a couple people posted, just to be fair. Bottom line: if you are a fan of turn-based strategy games--buy it.

It&apos;s style is somewhat like Civiliaztion games where you have turns. BUT! Unlike in Civi where your gonna like the END TURN like 100 times just so your guy can get where you want because you have nothing to do was avoided in Making History. I have only played the Demo, in the demo you only can pick the 7 main nations in WW2: UK, US, Italy, Japan, China, Russia(USSR), France. But every other country is there too, for example: Mexico, Hungry, Egypt, Argentinea and MANY MANY more. Now, when your chose to play single player you would have to pick a scenario, for example D-Day. In D-Day you will play starting from D-Day to the end of the war. Playing the game: playing the game requires lots of patience and thinking. The game also really emphasized on the diplomacy and how important it is. The game in the beginning would seem very slow and it is but as soon as you start your nation going in a steady pace it won&apos;t seem as slow. I didn&apos;t buy the whole game but only the demo, and i really rushed through it forcing war and trying to get the full package in the 20 turns i had. I believe that playing as the US is the easyest but most boring. Because personally i like to have some action. US like in the real time in WW2 came at the end, which I does here too. But playing as Germany is very hard. Not only the whole world is against you but you usually have shortages of oil and steel.(Some of the many resources in the game). Recommendations:I recommend this game to any true stragety game player. What i mean as &quot;true&quot; is a true strategy game player not only focuses on the &quot;attack&quot;(Being aggressive in the game is good BUT to very careful who you attack).This game wasn&apos;t built so you can just get a massive army and just assault any country you please. The dimoplacy side of the game is probably where you will win 80% of the battles. Now I won&apos;t reveal anymore of the million things you can do in this game but... I repeat myself, you need patience and thinking of course.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/making-history-the-calm-and-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=396532">Expand</a></span>

Just the right level for me and one of the best turn-based ww2 strategy games Ive played.  On a downside you can only play as one of the 8 major powers of ww2 something the demo lead me to believe otherwise.</span>

Now beating the german power house on hard.... well thats a challenge, Or being Germany in the D-day scenerio. But as much as i like to say good things about it, there are a couple of problems but depending on what kind of gamer you are you might get a sweet deal</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/making-history-the-calm-and-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=397073">Expand</a></span>

The game plays extremely well on the multi-player level especially when 2 players pick the weakest countrys and ally. Also this game offers 3 different variations of which the Idealogical option is the best. I have found that the AI works differently for each option. Finally a company has embraced the turn based genre of games. Muzzy lane and Strategy First will find that the gamers that are 35 + are are tired of nothing but RTS genre games flooding the market. RTS offers speed and reaction while sacrificing Stategic and Tactical planning. However Turn Based games alow for more thinking and greater stategic game play. Kudos to all at Strategy First for Turn Based Game Development!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/making-history-the-calm-and-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=399652">Expand</a></span>

Too little research and your armies will be outclassed, too little industrial improvement and you will be swamped, too little army building and you invite an opportunistic attack. The interface is a little quirky, but after 20-30 mins for the tutorial and your first couple of turns you should be fine for most things you need to find or do. The AI seems fairly good at fighting wars, but the diplomacy seems fairly random - sometimes you can get away with invading loads of countries before anyone steps in, next time start the same way and several major powers declare war after the first invasion starts. The economy is moderately simple with six goods and no price fluctuations based on supply/demand, but you still have quite a challenge to manage it even in this abstract form so it does the job it needs to. Units don&apos;t gain experience, and you have to dig through the in game help to find their exact statistics and abilities rather than being shown them in game. While there are definitely some areas that could be improved (for me) the ultimate test is that I have been playing it every evening since I first installed it. As soon as I won with Germany I wanted to try Russia, then America, etc. All of the 8 powers available have a very different situation facing them even when just playing the same scenario, so you have to significantly adjust your plans to match. Overall a well done game, with just a few limited flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/making-history-the-calm-and-the-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=414612">Expand</a></span>
