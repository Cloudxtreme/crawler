<br>
<br>Is it fun? You bet your arse it is. This top down, squad shooter boasts casual eviscerations, sonic booms of a stratagems entering the field.  bullets, rockets, and lasers flying off in all directions as you mercilessly pound the tech heavy cyborgs, Alien Bugs, and the Illuminate, a race of squid people! A grin of pure glee plastered my face as barrage after barrage tore chunks of viscera off my enemies and teammates alike. Can it match the excitement of riding around in a cocaine fueled truck, travelling at high speeds through the amazon underbrush? Maybe not, but that&#x2019;s not how you live forever, and it gets pretty close at times.
<br>
<br>The game opens up with a cheerful exposition, describing your aim and purpose in the Galaxy spanning adventure. You are a HELLDIVER, an elite soldier made to bring freedom (read: Death) to the already pretty free alien species that you meet. To do so you will have access to powerful firearms and assorted goodies, called Stratagems, courtesy of SUPER EARTH, your home.
<br>
<br>Your mission? To protect the assets of the Galaxy and push back the alien, and human, scum back on three fronts. If you are successful in pushing them all the way back to their home planet, you will confront the supreme leader of the races, where victory means one step closer to annihilating the alien scourge for good, until, that is, the global campaign resets, and the deadly dance begins all over again.
<br>
<br>The missions themselves are a randomly generated affair, which gives the game a nice bit on longevity, although they can start to feel a bit repetitive after awhile. I&#x2019;ve only put about fifteen hours into the game, but I&#x2019;m already starting to feel the grind. I&#x2019;m in no way exhausted by it, but it does start to feel a bit samey. Luckily the combat itself is particularly meaty, with pieces of your targets casually flying off as you aim centre to them, a game mechanic whereby weapon shots can actually bounce of the target, doing no damage. So make sure to keep your weapons laser sights centred  on enemies and away from friendlies, as friendly fire is always on. The ability to call down Walkers, airstrikes, and gun toting APC&#x2019;s, lends the game a tactical approach, with players often bringing down ammo for each other, or bringing in support drones that can either heal players, or kill enemies.
<br>
<br>It has to be said that the sound design is superb, with rifles and lasers all given appropriate weight and bass to them. The machinegun turret and starting assault rifle sound particularly meaty, with all other sounds produced at a wonderful quality that softly soothed my ears as I
<br>
<br>shredded my enemies.
<br>
<br>Graphics wise, there&#x2019;s nothing much to complain about, aside from a bit of lackluster AA that leaves the HELLDIVERS looking a bit ragged at times. All weapons and armours, and there are a huge bunch, ranging from what I think are Fallout homage laser rifles, to large anti tank rocket launchers, and also the occasional cheeky Dreadnought, are wonderfully done is a cartoony style that reminds me of LEGO figures and weapons, only slightly more edgy and polished.
<br>
<br>There are a few complaints, sometimes the game will randomly disconnect, and the host migration often meant that I was kicked out of the game entirely, although the game compensates by saving your XP and progress. However, this is juxtaposed by the absolute rush I got from playing this game. Time after time I was booted from a game, kicked for some less than friendly fire, and just general rage quits, but I always came back and raring to go because of the mix of great squad play and general awesomeness: The weapons, the fighting, the amazing cloth psychics of HELLDIVERS brought me back in.
<br>
<br>So in conclusion I heartily recommend this game. See you all in Hell.
<br>
<br>9/10

It offers 12 diffuculty levels, each one more challenging, 3 enemy races to fight, tons of guns and stratagems (support items you call in game). One of the best co-op games i played. It&apos;s only a shame that developers forgot about this, ton more people would be playing it if devs added more enemies, planets and weapons.</span>

It&apos;s a slower, more methodical shooter. You have a large degree of control over your character in-game, being able to sprint, dive to prone and even pick yourself back up when you are downed. Allies can shoot over you safely while you are prone. Careful management of your resources is necessary: you even lose the ammuntion left in a magazine if you reload before one is empty. This PC version of the game is an excellent port, adding text chat among other nicities not present in the original Playstation versions.
<br>
<br>You are part of the Helldivers, the elite shock troops of the comically imperialistic federation of Super Earth, deployed via drop pods behind the lines of a galactic war to spread &quot;managed democracy&quot; to humanity&apos;s enemies: the Bugs, the Cyborgs, and the Illiuminate (in ascending order of how annoying they are to fight)
<br>
<br>The game lacks a true story mode, instead being based around procedurally-generated levels with a random assortment of simple objectives. While on missions, you can find pickups that add to your &quot;research count&quot;, every ten adds one point that you may use outside missions to purchase permanent upgrades for your weapons and gear. Helldivers has a whopping twelve difficulty levels, though these are grouped roughly into three tiers, with levels within a tier varying only in the number of enemies. You have a considerable arsenal at your disposal thanks to a number of DLCs and unlocks earned by leveling. You can carry a pistol, primary weapon, one perk, and a choice of four &quot;Strategems&quot;, call-ins activated through directional button inputs, almost in the manner of a fighting game move. There are a ton of these call-ins: support weapons that you can pick up and equip, air and orbital strikes, deployable bombs, vehicles, and defenses. There are so many loadout options that each of up to four players in a game can equip a completely different setup.
<br>
<br>Much like Arrowhead&apos;s Magika series, friendly fire is an omnipresent problem and accidental team kills are commonplace. Most of the time it happens so suddenly that it&apos;s more comical then anything else, though there is a report function in case people are doing it deliberately.
<br>
<br>There is also a sort of metagame wherein each mission you complete adds to a total tallied from all players in the game, counted towards control of galactic regions. When the players reach an alien homeworld or when the aliens attack a regional capital planet or Super Earth itself, a special timed event begins where the players can take missions on that world for double experience rewards. If the players earn enough points in the allotted time, the aliens are defeated and their world is taken, or a human world is defended. The war ends when all three alien factions are defeated, or if the aliens conquer Super Earth. It&apos;s not a huge deal of a mechanic, but it&apos;s a nice extra layer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/helldivers/user-reviews?user_review_id=6517143">Expand</a></span>

<br>Its pros are: up to 4 player coop (it even has couch coop ON PC), an abundance of weapons and even more possible loadouts!
<br>The obvious issues are:
<br>-A moderate barrier to entry with a low skill ceiling
<br>-Repetitive gameplay
<br>-A questionable dlc policy</span>
