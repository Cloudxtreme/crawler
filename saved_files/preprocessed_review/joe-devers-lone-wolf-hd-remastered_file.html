For starters, it feels pretty much the same as the paragraphed books that some of us used to get excited about. We&apos;ve got a pretty shoddy story, the hero - of whom we cannot really tell if he&apos;s a real badass, because of his immense Kai powers, or a total wuss, considering that he keeps sneaking most of the time, sometimes afraid even to stand up to a bunch of Giaks, creatures similar to goblins - and lots of lots of text. So, yeah, pretty much the same as the original. But all of this is fun somehow, just as the original, even though it feels a little cheesy (but, hey, the original games were designed in the 80s, there was a lot of cheese back then).
<br>There were two things I didn&apos;t like about the gameplay though - both of them concern combat. First of all it relies too much on our quickness. Sometimes we&apos;ve got a perfect plan created in our mind, but we&apos;re just to slow with clicking. Yeah, I know this is a smartphone/tablet port, and most of those games rely on quick fingers, but for me it had too much of an arcade feeling to it.
<br>Secondly, the game is mostly about fighting. Yeah, you have to read a wall of text every now and then, but many (and I really mean many) times it&apos;s: &quot;Hey, you just reached a point in your adventure where we put in some epic battles, so the monsters ambush you for no good reason, even though you just evaded them using your mighty camouflage skill&quot;. So, yeah, there&apos;s a ton of fighting. Also, be prepared to die quite often. Especially during random encounters that you should win without even breaking sweat. It&apos;s all about quick fingers and luck.
<br>And even though it seems that I should give this game a lower score, I&apos;m giving it an 8. Because all in all this is a very good game. It took me 17 hours to finish the chapters and I had fun all the way (sans maybe those sevral frustrating moments when I had to replay some boss battles over and over again). So if you&apos;re a Lone Wolf fan - don&apos;t hestitate. Otherwise it&apos;s a 50/50. You&apos;ll either like it or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/joe-devers-lone-wolf-hd-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4892891">Expand</a></span>

The fact that you&apos;re way more limited in which abilities you can get, for example either this one or that one, compared to picking freely in the original series actually annoyed me a lot. While I understand why they designed it that way, it still doesn&apos;t make sense why they chose to simplify it so that it was a necessary limitation. I&apos;ve played the whole series with &quot;my character&quot; and evolving him, and this game even prevents me from making something similar, which is making sure that it really isn&apos;t a Lone Wolf novel in my opinion. It&apos;s a fairly cheap knock off and it can really only be considered on par with the first Lone Wolf novel, which is by far the weakest of the original series. It&apos;s still worth playing, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/joe-devers-lone-wolf-hd-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4802793">Expand</a></span>

Failing that, it is &quot;keep still while Helgaast hack you to bits&quot;.
<br>
<br>I would rather settle combat with Tetris blocks. It is not that hard to code Tetris blocks. And the background music is melodious enough not to distract you from clicking at the appropriate moment. Yes, DON&apos;T JUST STAND THERE AND GET HACKED TO PIECES!!!
<br>
<br>At least do variations to the hacking/slashing animations. Do not be lazy. Repeating the same old moves over and over does put me to sleep.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/joe-devers-lone-wolf-hd-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=5269885">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Except, there are 3D bits in the middle of this disappointment. And this is where the bad really begins: turn based combat, which is fine so far, but with a timer and Quick Time Events. Gimme an emote for a face palm. After decades of trying, someone has finally reached the bottom of bad PC game design, but obviously he or she cheated by using a mobile phone. I still can&apos;t believe someone has an IQ low enough to excrete such game mechanics.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s working the way they wanted, so I&apos;ve got to give some score for the correct programming and such. Still, pick up a real book, a good one if you can, and forget about this garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/joe-devers-lone-wolf-hd-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=6728120">Expand</a></span>
