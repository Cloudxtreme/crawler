VR is well implemented and I felt like I was part of Lucky&apos;s World. Game mechanics are mostly what you&apos;d expect of a game of this type, but since I haven&apos;t really played anything else but this game, it was a very fun ride from start to finish. I love the voice acting of Lucky. He felt like a person to me. In general the game is very polished, both graphically and audibly. The music is awesome!
<br>
<br>One thing I noticed is how often I used VR to look around corners and into small gaps to see if any secrets where hiding in there. And indeed more often than not, the peeking helped me find new stuff or made it possible to move Lucky more precisely around. VR really works for this game! I&apos;d say it&apos;s a game changer basically. I had a hard time putting the game down. When I wasn&apos;t playing it, I was looking forward to playing it again.
<br>
<br>Great game! Only criticism I have is that it&apos;s quite short. But then there&apos;s time challenges and &quot;red coin&quot; challenges. Especially the &quot;red coin&quot; challenges makes VR even more important to look back at the world to make sure you didn&apos;t miss any coins. Loved that!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/luckys-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=6302890">Expand</a></span>

<br>As for VR, the underground sections especially feel grippingly plastic, like it would exist right there in front of your eyes. The overworld doesn&apos;t look too shabby either, with everything having an obvious polish about it. The game has a few neat touches as well, such as the character looking right into your direction, or falling onto his back when you get too close and personal with your head. Overall, the game itself is solid, and essentially a free pack-in with the Oculus Rift.
<br>However, with all that said, this suffers from the same problem most of the launch games suffer from. There simply is no validation, no need for VR in it. The game would work without issues on a regular monitor, without losing out on anything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/luckys-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=6227561">Expand</a></span>

Why would Oculus choose this of all things to bundle with the Rift, or to make Rift-exclusive? You could get the same experience using anaglyph 3D glasses. The mind, it boggles.
<br>
<br>As a platformer it&apos;s a decent if forgettable experience. As a launch title, it&apos;s utter garbage.</span>
