<br>
<br>Of course there were some flaws in the PC port,but those can be fixed as easily as running the configuration tool and doing small options tweaks,like showing keyboard buttons for example,something people have complained about.They patched the game for those options to be default now anyways,so there&apos;s no problem anymore.
<br>
<br>Seriously,this is a must-play for anyone with a slight interest in shooters and/or cyberpunk-themed stuff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2477860">Expand</a></span>

As a huge fan of dark, apocalyptic and rather pessimistic visions of the future of mankind (don&apos;t get me wrong, I still believe in humanity, I&apos;d even briefly considered Sarif&apos;s point of view before I dismissed that claim and inclined to Taggart&apos;s opinion in DE: HR, but anyway!) I was quite looking forward to playing this SEGA&apos;s (Nihon-tachi, uh, Japanese, right?) take on a classical western TPS. Moreover, I&apos;ve always been fascinated by the advanced virtual intelligence research (Isaac Asimov, Matrix, Edi...and Geth...oh wait! The Red Explosion Ending...meh, never mind then) and so I was awaiting with much anticipation what SEGA could come up with. And deliver, they did!<br>At the very beginning, we&apos;re presented with a fact that around 2080 there are two world corporations producing robots, one in the US (surprisingly!) and another one in Japan, the latter going later rogue and   producing robots indistinguishable from humans and so the US with the help of several other nations establishes a covert-op group called The Rust Crew (Rusty Galloway, anyone, no? eh...) and dispatches  it to secretly investigate experiments conducted by this (evil!) Japanese corp. The overall story is suprisingly gripping, with several major twists and also the fact that all friendly humans might not be REAL flesh and blood under their skin nor are they even aware of it! (goosebumps!). During this approximately 10-13 hours long ride you can slightly alternate the story with several choices, so yes, some basics of non-linearity can be found there. Throughout the game, you expand your Rust Crew and always run around with two (later even 3!) squadmates, giving them orders, building their trust in you by responding to their various, sometimes even a little bit dumb, questions, nevertheless!, BD still manages to keep you interested in what&apos;s going on, jokes and teasing in cutscenes and even in gameplay are served on daily basis. And by the end, I really cared about the characters, they were incredibly well-written (even if a little bit stereotypical - British, Chinese, French, only Russian is missing, ha!). Of course, Mass Effect is still in the Premier League regarding the squadmates, but BD is a decent opponent! Another thing is that you can upgrade all weapons (those of your squadmates as well) via special shops scattered throughout all chapters and also, through this little micro-management thing, your skills long for improvement too!<br>Anyway, long story short - It&apos;s a very good game worth buying and trying. Even though the soundtrack is far beyond memorable, graphics have seen better days and the main motifs of some characters flirt with being double, even triple-agents, the engaging story, light RPG elements and the idea of a well-coordinated team (+killing hundreds of robots IS extremely satisfying, definitely! And then there are BOSS FIGHTS! Real, Japanese boss fights!!! Fascinating!) can more than make up for the aforementioned cons.<br>As for me (and by the time you read this, you&apos;ve probably guessed it), I had a great time playing Binary Domain and therefore, I would gladly recommend it to anyone, who isn&apos;t afraid of a little challenge (and who likes robots, &quot;scrap-heads!&quot; and BOSS FIGHTS!) and doesn&apos;t mind certain light-heartiness of this surprisingly well working Nihon-West hybrid. (and BTW, the problems with controls can be solved quite easily via the Config option after clicking on Play, just making sure!)

The gameplay is like Gears of War, the cover system and the movement, but the shootouts are with robots. Robots that not only react dinamically to your strategies but you can actually &quot;handicap&quot; them if you aim at certain spots, for example : if you take out the head, their aiming system goes nuts, if you aim for the legs, they crawl, if you aim for the arm... well they won&apos;t hold a weapon anymore. The shooting with petty robots is fun, and so are the big robot boss fights, kind of reminds me of Monster Hunter in the slightest. Finally, the great part is the RPG part, you build trust levels with your comrades, talk to them, get to know them, you split up, choose your team, you respond to them, I really like that, it reminds me of Mass Effect (althought the system is not THAT deep, but still pretty nice). The only fault with this game is it&apos;s Voice Recognition system, turned off immediately. I&apos;ve played the whole experience with a controller, but there is nothing wrong with the keyboard controls that you can modify in the configuration. Definitely underrated, love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2564825">Expand</a></span>

Its a game that is just fun to play. True its just the same as on the consoles which is a shame but graphics  does not make a game more fun. Story is ok and the dialog between you and you&apos;re squad can be funny at times. Story build up a bit slow tho. You can buy upgrades for you or a squad mates weapon with credits earned by killing enemy&apos;s and buy perks at a store which has a little lottery at the end :). if you are lucky you will get an random item. When you &apos;die&apos; you can heal yourself with a med kit or let a teammate do it for you...but they have a limited supply of them. The real fun is in killing the robots, they splatter all over you&apos;re screen.... robots part going every where. when you shot of there legs the crawl towards you or pick up a gun and continue firing ....very well done imo.    I do recommend using a controller for this one and the voice recognition does not work for me at all, not that you need it :p. Its a solid 8 from me . Very happy that the game made its way to PC.<br>If you like third person shooters you should check this game out  or if you hate robots this game is for you! Shooting robots in this game never gets old!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2393139">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A suprisingly good game. The reviews made it out to be a turd, but this game was great. It had a really good story with very well done characters, some pretty heavy choices, a great variety of enemies, over a dozen unique boss fights, and great all be it a somewhat generic gunplay. The only thing I found wrong with the game was the voice recognition if you physically wanted to talk to your teammates it doesnt work very well, but can be disabled and completely ignored thanks to ingame command options that pop up during conversations. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of futuristic/scifi stories and doesnt mind plenty of run and gun action. On a final note I was suprised to see that I had a total of 9.1 hours gameplay which is amazing seeing as more and more games are cutting SP short in exchange for more MP content. P.S. Dont skip the credits there is a special treat at the end.
<br>
<br>I pray this game gets a sequel and I hope everyone else enjoys it as much as i did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2536963">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s cool that your performance affects the trust of your teammates, and that the confidence they have in you directly impacts the outcome of the story. The enemies are just awesome, the fact that you can shot their legs, arms, heads off, and that what you with them alters their behavior in such a natural way  that&apos;s just unseen anywhere else (at least I haven&apos;t heard of any other title with such a feature).
<br>
<br>It&apos;s just so entertaining and the difficulty level just perfectly balanced: there is a challenge but at the same time you can relax and enjoy the action. Sure, there were moments I died a lot trying to kill some boss, but it was fun all the time, because I would eventually I manage to finish it before I started getting bored.
<br>
<br>I tried to think of some flaws, maybe a reason no to give this game 10 out of 10, but frankly, I couldn&apos;t find any.

<br>To put it in a nutshell  the game is a masterpiece for me, I wasn&apos;t so happy and eager to play any game for last year after &quot;Alan Wake&quot;. The plot is tasty and not  trite  heroes are all unique and humorous, graphic is top-notch (especially for game that needs less than 7Gb of HDdrive space  some games take over 10 and are real trash  devs of BD are magicians)  the game looks adequate both on standard screen and HD, I really love the HUD style like in &quot;the 3rd birthday&quot; psp game.
<br>Not much games this days are this cool and worthwhile, and not much games this day get 10 out of 10, but this one should and would  Thx devs for such a great game.
<br>PS. It&apos;s awful, but I could never find out about the game if no queue in supermarket and no trailer of the game on screen, this is all because of  well-publicized titles of other games that now are usually is a waste, and such great games like BD stays in shadow for lots of ppl. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3016473">Expand</a></span>

<br>After I found the work-around to make my wired 3rd party xbox controller to work I found this to be an amazing game. It is so immersive with a robust well conceived story that seemed custom-tailored to me (nice to have a story at all these days). I don&apos;t get too excited about games, but I would have paid full price for this game. I feel dirty and shameful for only having paid $5 for this title.

If you land headshots the robot will attack enemies for a time. Shoot their legs off and they crawl around. There are a few different types of robots, the little guys have problems navigating but the rest are a good variation and well designed. Boss battles are great and they are not stupidly hard as in many games of similar structure. At most they took me 2 attempts and I barely was forced into cover on normal. There was only one boss battle with an attack that caused an instant down state. They have weak points but I got a lot of fun from just about every boss. Characters are varied, fairly well voiced and compliment each other. The acting and story is very hammy but I also found great interest in the Hollow Children (robots who don&apos;t know they are robots). The protagonist is a fairly likeable character too. The visuals are well above average with some impressive vistas and good character models. Ran very well for me, controls are good with option to reconfigure. The cut scenes are excellent with great motion capture and action (they are skippable). The Voice recognition system is not perfect but it worked most of the time. Yell out &quot;charge&quot; to finish off the last few enemies or &quot;regroup&quot; when you need to get on an elevator to move to the next area. It&apos;s a good length game at around 9 hours. I didn&apos;t find that it repeated sequences or became a chore at any point. There are well placed breaks in the action that might have you zipping around on a jet ski or chatting to your squad in the slums beneath the city.  One of the best shooters of 2012.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2883266">Expand</a></span>

Most of the titles are very good, particularly the Gears of War franchise.  Binary Domain is the latest in the franchise that is very similar to the GoW games but just not as good.  The best things about BD is the gameplay.  It&apos;s clean, efficient and free of glitches unlike Max Payne 3 which uses the same type of system but not as well oddly enough.  The weapon and skill upgrades are simple with purchases made from kills.  Weapon wheel is a bit clunky with no help from the mouse wheel (can&apos;t be mapped).  Reticule is clear and direct which gives easy aim for all weapons (again, unlike MP3).  The cover function works perfectly.  It&apos;s realistic in terms of exposure from incoming fire and movement between cover is quick and direct.  Character movement is fast but suffers from some difficulty by having the same key mapped for &apos;run&apos; as well as &apos;cover&apos; actions.  The designs of the buildings, robots and costumes are excellent.  They are very detailed and creative, particularly the bosses.  The FMV is very well rendered with vibrant definition in the human faces and their movement.  There is only ONE glitch that I found in the entire game and it&apos;s a small one: the character&apos;s belt vibrates erratically as he moves.  It looks like a crazed fanny pack.  The difficulty is adequate and not very challenging when fighting the usual drone bots.  The bosses are the opposite as they are very hard to defeat at times.  The character goes from different battle scenarios that are very exciting and packed with bullet-spewing fun. The team commands work well but don&apos;t really affect the situations enough to warrant consistent use.  The biggest fault in BD is the story.  It&apos;s almost the same as the story from the last Battlestar Galactica series.  The story is unoriginal and  corny and the dialogue is absolutely horrendous.  It was so painful to wade through (no way to forward it either) the stupid and insipid script between Bo and Dan.  Bo&apos;s stereotypical &quot;homeboy&quot; dialogue is so not needed in this time period and sounds totally ridiculous.  The music is terrible with it&apos;s silly techno that takes away from the tone of the game.  If the game removed most of the dialogue and streamlined the game more away from the redundant fire fights it would&apos;ve been perfect.   As it is now - it&apos;s a hell of an action game with stunning visuals and gameplay.  Just play it without the sound if possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2867833">Expand</a></span>

The game is pretty dynamic, you won&apos;t get bored, though there are some annoying moments like jet ski (which reminded me of Battletoads in a bad way) or boss battles like destroy all legs/motors/arms or whatever. The crew members are all great and memorable, though the relationships with them suffer from a lack of depth. There are some RPG elements like weapon upgrades and nanomachines (skills). The graphics are decent, the cut scenes are really awesome. I&apos;d say that this game has all AAA-class project attributes. And I don&apos;t understand why it doesn&apos;t become a hit. Probably there were no budget for big advertisement/marketing to make hype around the game. P.S. I&apos;ve played with mouse/keyboard. Everything was OK, I had no problems at all. I didn&apos;t try the microphone voice command system,  but had no problems with giving orders from my keyboard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2876787">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics :-

<br>Art direction is very good though, some great robot designs and the way robots come apart has been well thought through.  The levels look good , you know where you are visually . nice contrast between the murkier depths to the clean upper part of town.
<br>
<br>Story :-
<br>Stereotypes and cliches abound and the pacing is awful. The lead character acts like a spoilt hormonal teenager. Writers forgot this is a visual medium with all the infodumps. Might work for a cheap soap but hey you didn&apos;t buy the game for story.
<br>
<br>Audio :- Nothing to right home about. Music is generic,  guns go bang to a satisfactory level.
<br>
<br>Gameplay :-
<br>
<br>The voice chat thing sounds ok on paper but execution is awful. I turned it off. you will still get asked repeatedly inane things by the team. You can ignore these but it will slow down the game as they will repeat and hold the game up. Don&apos;t worry about the relationship rating which should make your guys more effective if good. It doesn&apos;t , your ai buddies are pretty useless and remain useless even if you spend money upgrading weapon and skills for them.Spend all your credits on you.
<br>The pacing of the gameplay needs it&apos;s on mention as it&apos;s bad. Lots of cut scenes all over the place , the lead starts a monologue with an infodump after the the first chapter  just at a point when you  start really getting into the action and want to be killing robots. At least the cut scenes can be skipped. You cannot do this when you ai buddies start having a ramble and slow you down to a snails pace . The same snails pace is used in &apos;rest&apos; areas which would be fine if much to do in them but there is not and it just serves to drag it out more than necessary
<br>The level design is ok  , most of it is fairly generic corridor shooter stuff with some arena areas for bosses , a good mix of assault , escape ,chases, defend the point  etc. Some levels could do with more checkpoints as the chance of insta gib is very high in some while other are a breeze. Also the use of qte&apos;s is very meh and adds nothing.
<br>The thing that will keep you going is the killing of robots.  It doesn&apos;t get boring ,you can just blast at them which does work but will eat your ammo. Aiming for heads will cause them to malfunction and go after their buddies, certain bots have weak spots which will kill them quicker. The variety of them is pretty good and often come in large waves so you are kept busy during the fighting sections.
<br>
<br>Controls :-
<br>This gets it&apos;s own section as it&apos;s a port. A port that has had little thought gone into it re controls.
<br>
<br>If you intend to use m&amp;b you will suffer.  Mouse aim is bound like a button 1 for 1. You cannot do swift movement of mouse to get precise aim as you would in a normal pc game as it only translates to one or two moves . You will need to do small controlled moves to get best aim.
<br>
<br>Using a controller is fine but the layout of binds is odd regardless of input choice and having one bind doing multiple things means you end up sticking to cover when trying to run past it  quite often unless you take a wide berth which you cannot always do due to design and camera angles which at times is very poor.
<br>
<br>Overall the robots make the game without them it would just be another sub par cover shooter</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=4392563">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I played the demo with a keyboard and mouse and hated it (it&apos;s a terrible console port), but later after I bought a 360 controller I found the game and sale and gave it a second shot. The first thing that will strike you is the destruction physics of the robot--there&apos;s nothing like it in any other game I&apos;ve played. There is an incredibly visceral feel to every shot you take that either dismembers, decapitates or otherwise cripples a robot. Every weapon feels really good and every baddie feels really good shooting. Boss fights are particularly satisfying as they often evolve and change tactics as you decimate them piece by piece.
<br>
<br>Second, the near-future setting and story taking place in a closed-border Japan is really really cool. The environments give an epic feeling making you feel like as small as a fly. And the story, although not terribly deep, keeps things moving at a nice pace alongside the constant action. As mentioned previously, the dialog is really, really, cheesy; but somehow it works. I don&apos;t know whether it was done on purpose but you feel like you&apos;re in a B-rated sci-fi film except that it&apos;s actually quite entertaining. Finally, the game is the perfect length for me--it&apos;s always better to want to stay in the game&apos;s universe a bit longer than getting bored and having too much. Binary Domain does the former. Overall, A fun sci-fi action-romp that surprisingly became one of my favorite underrated games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=4541935">Expand</a></span>

Beim zocken musste ich immer an Ghost in the Shell und Isaac Asimov denken. Die Technische Seite ist auch vollkommen in Ordnung (mal was anderes als dauernd mit Unrealengines und Co zugeballert zu werden), da sehr detailreiche Gegner und passendes Leveldesign. Das Coversystem von GoW funzt auch einwandfrei, nur das vollquatschen des Teams ist leider noch nicht so ausgereift (fehlerquote ist zu hoch), kann man aber auch ganz gut so zocken &#xFC;ber die selektierbaren Befehle. Naja schade - da Tiefgreifende Storys mittlerweile Out sind, man lieber nur &#xF6;den austauschbaren Shootereinerlei gut bewertet, werden wir hier kaum eine Fortsetzung erwarten k&#xF6;nnen (was aber nicht verkehrt ist, da das Game in sich abgeschlossen ist und als solches ohne Fortsetzung stehen bleiben kann).

Graphics, sound and fighting are ok. The enemies and boss are generics but do their job well. Got to love how the basic robot grunts are dimembered, but still want to fight...... Now here&apos;s the trouble part: controls. It was designed for the PS3 and probably play well with that controller, but it&apos;s a real mess with a mouse/keyboard. Clunky mouse movement... The button you have to push and hold to focus on who talks to you should have been a on/off button. Right now, you have to WASD with that button pressed... Press the &apos;answer&apos; button to have a list of answers to someone, and try to select one. Arrows, WASD, mouse, etc... No way I could select the proper answer. And peoples are supposed to like you less if you shoot them or if you don&apos;t answer them!...  All control changes must be done outside the game, with another setup program... OH!... while in control setup, don&apos;t forget to choose Keyboard instead of controller, cuz the program is not smart enough to tell if you&apos;re using a mouse or a controller. Else you&apos;ll see controller button when a hint appears......... Less than stellar game with an abysimal lack of effort to make it PC friendly...... Don&apos;t bother unless a serious patch is released and when serious price drop happens...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2325970">Expand</a></span>

Despite the unplayable part, the game playing is fine, consolidate frame rate and graphic, I give 1 mark for that. Also it&apos;ll give a 9 marks for Xbox 360 version of this game although it&apos;s not running @1080p.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2317792">Expand</a></span>

As soon as you installed it, it is obvious that Binary Domain is console game and in my opinion it should had stayed console game. Reason are many, graphic is old style, sound is mediocre, theme or story is very very boring, but the main reasons why i think that Binary Domain should stayed on consoles is fact that it is unusable without a PC controller. It is frustrating to play it on keyboard ( just for you to know i tried to play it on  controller ). You have to ask yourself is something wrong with my hardware ( keyboard or controller ) or with my intelligence. I spent some 45 minutes just to configure game and start playing. Gameplay is similar to Resident Evil Operation Recon City. Very low gameplay. I question myself  why the game developers, such as these, think that this mess could be interesting or playable. Rarely I said that  some game is disaster, and a verdict; Binary Domain for PC is a ripoff !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2328804">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll make it easy and just list the problems with it. Configuration tool doesn&apos;t work, it only works with the resolution but not your AA settings...or anything else for that matter. I had to manually tweak my graphics settings via Nvidia control panel, sad times. Then there&apos;s the awful controls. I mean, who do they hire to lay out the controls? A monkey could do a better job. And whats the deal with the voice input? Why was that such a huge deal with this game? Every time a cutscene would end I&apos;d have to see flashing words on the screen saying that my voice input has been disabled; yes I get it, I did that because I&apos;m not one for yelling into my computer, if I wanted to do that I would just play a filthy console. Graphics: In and out. Some parts look nice while others are horrid. There&apos;s a problem with checker boarding all through the game. I tried this on a single GTX 580, GTX 580 with SLI enabled and a GTX 560ti, so it&apos;s obviously the game. But again, what do you expect from a console port?<br><br>The movement isn&apos;t solid, it&apos;s obviously meant to be played with a controller that takes you 4 minutes to turn 360 degrees, no pun intended. You get this weird graphics glitch with your characters gear when you turn around all the way and it&apos;s just annoying. The whole cover system is awful and there&apos;s at least 10 functions for the space key so when you&apos;re trying to do one thing it does another. I can&apos;t think of a single thing that is good about this game except the ability upgrade your guns. They really should&apos;ve just stuck with consoles only and if anything, stuck this on steam for $5.00. I understand PC is used for a second release for games after the rest of the developers come back from their month-long vacations but this isn&apos;t right. This is a complete rip-off of the consumer and THIS is why people pirate games. If you can&apos;t develop games correctly for PC than don&apos;t do it at all, don&apos;t waste time, money, and resources. In the end, these Metacritics will hurt you SEGA, I hope you learn a valuable lesson in this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2318910">Expand</a></span>

The voice acting is godawful, the controls are stiff and unresponsive, the graphics are completely unconfigurable, changing the settings in-game is disabled - you can only change your binds or mouse sensitivity in the game configurator which has to be run separately. The gameplay is generic and bland, however demolishing enemy robots does feel satisfying. The story is interesting but I couldn&apos;t play the game more than after the first 3 levels or so - I had so many graphical glitches and the controls made me go insane. The voice recognition software is a total mess - my 100$ microphone that I use in teamspeak and skype fails to cooperate with this game. I have to repeat certain words at least three times to get a response from the game and configuring the recognition to work is a pain in the ass. I shut off voice recognition after the part where I am told to shout charge - I sat there for about 20 minutes, saying the word charge in what different tones I could find with no effect.
<br>What seems to be a great game piled under all these problems could be fixed, but never will be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2555336">Expand</a></span>

There are some terrible vehicle sections, the voice acting of some minor characters are laughable bad, the checkpoint system is annoying, the story can be a little to melodramatic at times, the voice recognition simply do not work , the conversation choices can sometimes be quite vague and the game is overall quite rough around the edges. The game do however have charm. The story is actually quite good and really interesting and i became really quite attached to the characters. Sure the story is cheesy and sometimes quite predictable but it got charm just like a good B-movie. The campaign is around 10 hours long and have a decent area-variety. There isn&apos;t a whole lot of different weapons but the enemy variety is extremely good and you get to fight a huge amount of different cool robots that actually act like robots. There is also plenty of boss battles which is nice even though most of them is you dodging and shooting the highlighted area. The conversation-system is enjoyable even though it lacks any major impact and the &quot;rpg&quot; elements works alright. The game is in no way perfect but if you have an interest in shooters or is a fan of the setting i would definitely recommend giving this game a shot since the game is quite different from other games in the same genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=2871220">Expand</a></span>

I am a third and first person shooter junkie of many years and for me, this is my second all-time favourite game after Halo Anniversary. BD almost slipped under my radar due to a lackluster advertising campaign in the West which reduced sales and pretty-much killed the chance of a sequel.
<br>
<br>For me, Binary Domain ticks all the right boxes: engaging story and characters, smooth gameplay, crisp graphics, attention to detail, powerful weapons, interesting enemy AI and great music. Some have criticised the story and characters for being sterotypical and cliche-ridden. Although these elements might seem generic on the surface, there is a surprising amount of emotional depth attached to them and even a generic story can be enjoyable if it is intelligent, stylish and well-written, which this is. Personally, I think the writers and developers deserve multiple awards  the game just stands that far above its shallow Western counterparts such as the Gears of War franchise.
<br>
<br>The only real flaws are the ineffective voice recognition (which can easily be bypassed), the dead multiplayer and the meagre Invasion/Horde mode that is too difficult to play solo. Aside fom these aspects, I have no hesitation in recommending Binary Domain to all shooter fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3185034">Expand</a></span>

Dialog is also well written, especially the humorous parts  made me smile multiple times. The plot is rather simple but the presentation is good. If this game had bigger budget, it would be a hit. It lacks in level design (corridors, hangars, all similar, sterile and empty) and graphic effects (sparks, electric discharges, oil leaking out of robots, some particles flying in the air  I miss such eye candy in this title). All in all, this is a good game and worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3290272">Expand</a></span>

<br>I know what the config utility is, and I know how to usually fix these things in games. I went as far as downloading a registry fix that universally disables all mouse acceleration, but nothing works to fix this festering pustule of a &quot;PC&quot; game. DO NOT waste one cent of your money on this unless you&apos;re fine with using a controller. A PC shooter should absolutely work with a mouse though (and if it doesn&apos;t it should feature a warning sticker half the size of the box), so I can&apos;t reward this absolute  bull**** with a score any higher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3408524">Expand</a></span>

<br>Beside the campaign you get also a co-op mode (horde mode) which has a survival, team-play, resource management aspect in it. A surprising good game mode with rare connection issues. There is also a versus mode but better stay away from it. All the crashes and connection issues. It isn&apos;t worth the money (The connection issues are by far heavier than in the co-op mode).

Binary Domain has pretty much all the standard features of aTPS, basic story layout  shooting  cutscene  shooting and so on. I`m not saying this alone is bad, no. It can always be enriched to enhance the whole title., although here we have none of that. There are many varied levels, though it ends up always the same  takig cover and shooting. The AI is good and varies depending on the type of enemy  though again, not too many of those. There are few weapons, few skills, few upgrades, few items such as grenades. The controls take some time to get used to but generally are alright. I was bored within half of the story time (summed is approx. 10 hours from which 9 is gameplay) but I wanted to know what happens next. I just had to sit through all the blablablah bad dialogues to see it. Not to mention this game covered probably every action movie cliche ever made. The repetitive gameplay was sometimes interrupted by the level bosses which is a nice touch. All in all I can`t say I will remember Binary Domain, although I did wal through the whole thing so I guess I did enjoy it. A full 7 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=3662269">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But after searching the internet for more than an hour I found out which button to press.
<br>And the game proved to be playable and quite enjoyable for a shooter anyway. I don&apos;t like shooters that much, since it&apos;s usually just mindless shooting. But while this is a real shooter, there is a bit of a story. The story, though not much, is enough to give the game an extra dimension while not slowing the action down.
<br>
<br>If you like fighting lots of different robots, and action packed bosses you&apos;ll probably like this game. While I enjoyed myself, I prefer RPG&apos;s, so I won&apos;t rate this higher than a 7,5, it&apos;s more for fps fans than for me.
<br>
<br>-Visuals are very pretty and sci-fi Japan 2080
<br>-Sound is good, no annoying music scores that plague some shooters
<br>-gameplay is great, buddy system works great and is easy
<br>-fast action

<br>
<br>Graphics are excellent.
<br>Gampeplay is amazing
<br>Controls are good enough
<br>Story is quite good.
<br>And the partners/alternate stories/liking system is unique.
<br>
<br>I even played 2 times in order to get the best ending!. The only thing missing is a continuation of the story, perhaps a sequel is needed?.</span>

                                        <span>The gameplay gets repetitive at times, even though I have to say it&apos;s very satisfying to see masses of scrap-head bofyparts come off :) Still, I&apos;d reccommend to play it for the story only, sure it has it&apos;s clichees but on PC you don&apos;t get much nearer to a Gears of War. Maybe Bulletstorm is the only other one I know of. Play it, you won&apos;t regret it :)</span>

<br>This game was recently given away free on Steam. I can only say I&apos;m kinda glad I didn&apos;t pay for this.
<br>It&apos;s a third person shooter, with some elements of RPG in it, and seriously minimal interaction during combat play. The story is good, the plot is actually the only well thought out thing about the game in general.
<br>The cover system is half decent, but what knackers it is the shoddy AI, clearly not moving and firing but moving, in your way, so you shoot them by accident, then they insult you whilst firing at the people you&apos;re firing at whilst moving to a safe location probably already occupied by your character.
<br>
<br>It lacks polish and refinement, which is a great shame because with a bit more effort and a bit more determination to see it through to completion, this is one project Sega could have been really proud of.
<br>Instead, a three quarter finished product, with not the sloppiest console port going but still bad enough, with only the plot and the story worth following, this makes it a fairly reasonable giveaway if you ever get given it.
<br>It has it&apos;s merits, but it certainly needed  a bit more work doing to it to make it brilliant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=6133525">Expand</a></span>

<br>Binary Domain feels like a budget game. The visuals are nice, but they had to take some shortcuts in the gameplay. The game presents itself as a third party squad based shooter and it isn&apos;t strange to compare it with Mass Effect and Spec Ops: The Line.  The game offers three things to the player:  battles with a squad of  maximum three soldiers, the ability to upgrade and improve your characters and the story, which we talk about first.
<br>
<br>The tale is set in the future. The earth has had its share of natural disasters and large parts of the world have been flooded. Humanity has dwindled and this caused the development of robots. Over time these got better and better until they would become indiscernible from humans or even improve on them(more human than human:P) Therefore an agreement was made which forbade the creation of human like robots, also known as hollow children. To give the agreement a bite special teams called Rust Teams were created to hunt down hollow children and those who planned on making them . You are in control of a Rust Team member,  Dan Marshall, and after an attack by a hollow child on the head of the Bergen Company you are ordered to apprehend the head of the Amada Corporation who is suspected of being the creator of the hollow child(eren).
<br>
<br>This theme is also explored in the movie Blade Runner and the book on which it is based(Do androids dream of electric sheep?). And movies like Terminator added to in their own way. One can quibble for ever about the good or the bad of it, let me just call it unoriginal. This is a bit ironic because when one has a small budget, one could add to a game by writing. It is the hardest thing to master, but by far the cheapest way to give extra value to a game.
<br>
<br>The battles are pretty standard fare and alter between fighting your way through waves of rank and file enemies, with an occasional bigger enemy thrown into the mix and of course: the boss battles, the meat of the game. There are also some quick time event  sequences which are hugely annoying as they always are, especially because the key combinations are often incomprehensible and not explained and have to be looked up on the internet or figured out by trial and error. The boss battles alter between great and frustrating. The frustration being usually caused by the lack of proper explanation of what is expected of you. Since there is often just one way to destroy a big boss the frustration is all the greater.
<br>
<br>The squad based tactics are the most underdeveloped. You only have a few basic commands to order your comrades about. But then you won&apos;t have to depend on them as the gap between your character Dan and the rest gets larger and larger. In the end Dan can win most battles alone. Some characters are downright useless, like Rachael who has a shotgun and a rocket thrower which she never ever uses. The shotgun is the worst weapon in the game, as it lacks range, rate of fire and punch. Sniper rifles are more useful, but given their odd way of aiming,  their weak firepower and the fact that the enemy charges at you and your companions run in front of you, they aren&apos;t  that useful.  This is also the reason why Faye, the sniper in the game, is pretty useless. You as Dan will actually score more and better hits with your automatic rifle that she does. Probably the best character in the game is Dan&apos;s sidekick Bo. He can take a lot of hits and handles a machine gun. Overall your team members are as much of a  hindrance as an asset.  There is also a kind of approval/disapproval thing in the game. It seems to have no effect whatsoever.
<br>Upgrading weapons is also limited. Each character has one prime weapon which is fixed, and only that can be upgraded.
<br>
<br>You will often be subjected by moments that break the flow of the game. There are the chats that are forced upon you, which causes your character to slow down to crawling speed. There are moments when you have to to run which are broken up by cut scenes. There are far too many of these awkward moments that impact the flow of the game.
<br>
<br>The game is decent, but nothing spectacular. Personally I liked the interaction between the characters, which is probably the strongest part of the story telling. Some of the boss battles are fun. Overall it feels like a game that could have been more epic if they just had improved the squad combat and the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=6279565">Expand</a></span>

Ever wondered if they could make something else, other than the Yakuza (Ry&#x16B; ga Gotoku) series? Well, here&apos;s our first taste at that - and its tone is very different from the games that they usually make.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re expecting innovation, then this isn&apos;t the game for you. The gameplay is the same as every other cover shooter in the last decade. The only thing going for it is that every enemy is a robot, and that their covering flies away into bits and pieces when you&apos;re shooting them. There&apos;s also the trust system which affects your team&apos;s view about you, and their performance in battle. Other than that, you&apos;ll just plow through enemies like you did in Gears of War&apos;s casual mode. Mini games? Not here. Cooky and weird moments? You&apos;ll have to play Yakuza for that.
<br>
<br>This game is all about story - and it&apos;s one heck of a wild ride; a lot different from Kazuma Kiryu&apos;s adventures in the Japanese underground. The game doesn&apos;t throw a lot of exposition around, and the player is treated as a foreigner to this world that the dev team created. Binary Domain is mature, emotional, and adrenaline-fueled; somehow balanced by smart comedic timing. Though it dashes through the themes and philosophical questions that it asks itself, it&apos;s great to see a game try and tread topics like the evolution of AI, and climate change.
<br>
<br>And there you have it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/binary-domain/user-reviews?user_review_id=6945356">Expand</a></span>
