<br>
<br>The different game modes offer a very enticing and exciting game play that sets it apart from games such as Call of Duty. The game has a very good sense of realism in that there are no hit indicators to tell you where you&apos;ve been shot from, it doesn&apos;t take many shots to kill - fewer from the neck up - and the only feature that breaks the realism is the small indicators to show you that the person next to you is a teammate, and also where the objectives are. That&apos;s it! No radar either, which makes the game even more involving.
<br>
<br>This is by far the most realistic shooter I have ever experienced, and the four pack I bought for my friends and I was a damned good buy. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=3983693">Expand</a></span>

I loved the mod, even since 2005(2 years before the release of the mod) i kept looking on it how  Insurgency grows, and i&apos;m happy that Insurgency became a successful indie game. Hope to see more great large maps, though!</span>

Let me first start with the Developers. YOU CANT FIND a more dedicated and reliable group of guys to make a awesome game. With such a small group its mind blowing how kickass this game is. The team work is essential in this game and so is a microphone. Communication, awareness and patience are what will keep you alive and helping your team in this game. This isn&apos;t some AAA company (which we all know the few i&apos;m pointing out) claiming to be something it isn&apos;t. They took a risk of mixing DOD 1.3 , COD1, CSS and Red Orchestra into one. They couldn&apos;t have done it more fluid. The game is constantly being updated and patched. New guns are to come soon, along with maps. To sum this all up you honestly owe it yourself to give this game a try. for 15$ and a active Dev team. YOU CANT GO WRONG!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=3958724">Expand</a></span>

<br>I would recommend this game to people from any FPS background if you have seen footage and know what the game entales.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4101279">Expand</a></span>

This game actually makes you think quiet seriously how to slice the pie of doors and windows, forces you to consider the tunnel of death, and silhouette, and finnaly, Teamwork makes the Dream work, when you enter a scene on CS, there are 2/3 points of entry and exit and up to around 5-6 for visual spots, ARMA, you have a full 360 degree to maintain, while RO/RS amount of windows and doors, see spots, and entry exit spots are around the same in Insurgency. You really need a mic and headphones or you are in for trouble. Teammates need to cover your weak sides, and you should really communicate with your team on attacking known enemy locations, I am on the right side of the door I am looking left your on left looking right I am going to run in, you watch my back. But be careful 3D audio makes it where lintel can be taken but false lintel can confuse the enemy, plus I love shouting into the mic Allah Akbar as terrorist in a gunfight where the enemy can hear me and perchance miss his few key shots. It is so pleasurable to duck into cover have thenm blow 15/20ish shots and then slide out to the other side crouch lean out and fire 2-3 to end it, it gives me so much enjoyment, my heart races like going 100 MPH or being on a roller coaster. I have been in so many close calls, I have been utterly destroyed countless times, and I have destroyed the enemy quiet regularly with 9 KD or 7 KD I love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4125588">Expand</a></span>

Despite the bugs (mostly to do with the gun graphics interacting with the environment) its a great game with unlimited re playability (probably more than even CSS/GO if more maps are developed). The maps themselves are fairly well thought out, although repetitive elements do arise and areas within the maps can sometimes seem or be identical. The combat is refreshing and really my only qualm is that the game doesn&apos;t take into account trajectories the same way BF4 would (middle crosshair will always hit the target, despite the range). Hopefully this would be an update later one since they have already promised many updates in the future (they actually recently released one which has vastly improved the game). I think given another year, this game will be increasingly popular and refined.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4133864">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s an unforgiving realistic game that&apos;s actually fun to play (unlike the arma series in my opinion). The objectives are clear and games can go from a minute or two (if you are lucky/unlucky) to 20+ minutes. For $15 this game is well worth it.</span>

                                        <span>Insurgency is great game that doesn&apos;t follow current FPS trend. It pretty much like highly realistic Counter Strike or modern era Red Orchestra game. It is fast pace(compare to other realistic shooter).  It has great balance between realism and fun. It realistic to some minor which most of shooter in market ignored. And it reward teamwork very well. It also yell &quot;F*** COD and BF!&quot;.</span>

It&apos;s not easy at the start but, when you learn the game mechanics and get used to weapons it becomes a pure fun.  If you looking for combination of Cod: MW maps, realism of Red orchestra  and mechanics of Counter Strike this game is for you. It&apos;s a good mix of simulation and action.</span>

<br>The fear of going around corner is scary and the fun of taking a room etc as a team is OMG additive.
<br>
<br>Working with a team is a must!  Team work, while taking a room is not like other FPS, you have to do it with skill, you can&apos;t just run in and shoot everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=3974769">Expand</a></span>

<br>Maybe the thing I like the most from this game is the fact that there are no vehicles-rush (BF); nor akimbos (CoD); nor kill-streaks,  nor battlepacks, nor ranking up or anything like so. Even when you are n00b you have the same weps that the most hardcore players, which means fun for everyone.

<br>
<br>Yes! Fun, I know that in other shooters fun means instant respawn and doing a session of sprinting around the whole map, but the game is so well designed that you are afraid of taking the bomb when you are at the next room, you are carefull of every sound, to every movement, because if you don`t you will be death soon. This game is incredible. It realy takes you inside.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4017064">Expand</a></span>

The way it plays is completely original with the fun and intense game modes that just don&apos;t exist in any other games. If you find a good squad (and team) the game gets really fun and intense. The voice chat is also awesome since everyone, including the enemy, can hear you from a realistic distance, and then when you get out of voice range your squad members can talk to you over the radio. Overall, this game is worth way more than 60 bucks, and you can get it for 15 (or less on sale). So get it. Now.

<br>I&apos;m over 400 hours into this game. Buying it  for such a low price is like robbing the developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4101334">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s basically CS:GO intergraded with Battlefield ADS and COD&apos;s Regen health system.It is a 1 shot head shot every weapon, and a 2-3 shot body and 4 shot Limbs e.g arm legs.Adding the realism there is 3D Voip voice surround thing .Basically means that unlike csgo where everyone in your team can hear you, in insurgency everyone can hear you depending on where you are behind a wall or car or out in the open.BUT theres a thing in insurgency called squads.If you talk regardless where they are they can hear  you.

It feels very realistic and doesn&apos;t get old.  The devs are doing a great job of adding content and refining the game.  I almost didn&apos;t buy this game but I&apos;m glad I did as it is my favorite fps.  I didn&apos;t even bother buying COD for the first time in years.  If I could I would give it an 11.</span>

Insurgency missions are tactical, realistic, but not overly complicated or requiring a million unlock achievements. There are lots of servers and players, and it all works fast and smooth as silk. The feel of game play is something close to perfect and I just love playing it.</span>

I beg to differ, it brings a modern FPS game into modern day without all the fluff. Bringing something new seems to mean make it more ridiculous in the current market. With Insurgency - No unlocks, short on stats, realistic gameplay. No ridiculous gadgets, no killstreaks, no headshot bonus. Gaming pure and simple.Some of the most intense gaming I have had since MOH:AA/BF:Desert Combat mod COD/CODUO/COD 2 when I competed. It brings good gameplay, something that is regularly left out and replaced with shock and awe graphics (blue tinted environments... Yeah DICE I mean you!).

<br>
<br>Basically - Insurgency is the game to play if you want something a lot more serious than COD, less chaotic than Battlefield, and not as skill-based as Counter Strike.
<br>
<br>For me, Insurgency isn&apos;t the type of game I sink hours into every day. It&apos;s the type of game I play every few days, knowing I&apos;ll still have fun when I do. Sometimes I go a few months without playing, and when I come back, there&apos;s always new content.
<br>
<br>This game caters towards semi-casual to hyper-hardcore gamers. Insurgency in my opinion, has a bit of morbid humor to it. I can get super sweaty when trying to hold a capture point when I&apos;m the only person left alive, or I can laugh my ass off when my teammate yelps as he&apos;s shot in the face. Best of both worlds!
<br>
<br>Insurgency is a game with a small community, which I love. You can hop into a random match, and recognize half of your teammates since you played with them last week. There is a little mic spam, and people yelling &quot;ALLAHU AKBAR&quot; before each match, but it only makes it a bit more immersive.
<br>
<br>The dev&apos;s are active. Recently, they added another free DLC which contains a proper nightmode.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving it a 10. Not just because I enjoy this game, but because anyone else can as well.
<br>
<br>I paid $15 for the game in January, it was worth it then. As of right now, it&apos;s still $15.
<br>Also, it&apos;s made on the Source engine, meaning it&apos;ll run on a TI-84 (not really, but almost)
<br>
<br>If you like FPS&apos;s at all, then skip going to Subway for lunch tomorrow, and get this game instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4644512">Expand</a></span>

The strategy happens real-time between players over the in-game VOIP system. You die and you&apos;re out. Your only chance at a respawn is your team mates making it to the next objective, else you all start at the beginning of the mission again. This forces one to play as a team, extremely carefully and strategically.
<br>
<br>The maps are well designed and very immersive with numerous routes to objectives.
<br>
<br>The AI is incredible! During my first game, I thought I was playing against players who were online. I also love the way the AI increases in number and difficulty as more players join your squad.
<br>
<br>The graphics are good enough and give a great all-round, authentic experience. Night missions are fantastic and very challenging.
<br>
<br>The surround sound with a gaming headset is awesome. One is able to spatially place sounds around one&apos;s self while playing, particularly moving enemies.
<br>
<br>This game is a must buy for FPS fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4650917">Expand</a></span>

Not only it has all the mandatory game modes, but each is cleverly tweaked to suit the overall game style. Coming from CS:GO, and having a AA 2.x experience a long time ago, I feel this game strikes the balance between tactics, realism and fun.
<br>Squad roles from which you get your selection of guns, limited supplies that you have to tackle to form your kit, and affect your stats, like speed and armor. Realistic radio, where when you use your mic you also make noise ingame. No health bar, no medic, no revive, one, two shots and you are gone. The game doesn&apos;t give you any help like, crosshair, deathcam, kill message, no minimap on the corner (although you still have a full map available with your team positions), you have to figure out if you killed him, or from were you shot, and relay the info to your team. If you want to survive you really have to work with the rest of your team.
<br>Details like these, matter and make a better overall game experience, if what you are looking is something that feels more real and unforgiving.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4723007">Expand</a></span>

This is a merciless experience for players who are careless and ignore the importance of teamwork. In my first hour experience I felt like a war reporter
<br>on the most dangerous front of Iraq. Bullets flew over my head, my teammates died while I was hiding behind covers, tried to stay alive between strong explosions, heard unending gunfire, used every piece of cover to save my life and died a lot. After two hours I was able to lurk dark corners of the map, leaned behind covers to shot my enemy before he shot me and tricked the enemy in anyway I can. But it&apos;s very hard to master this game. You need your teammates to succeed on your missions. Moving together, using formations correctly, and maintaining 360 degree security for the team are vital parts of success. Getting familiar with game maps is another important factor for success. You have to know where your weak points are while you&apos;re attacking or defending objective zones. Experienced lone wolves infiltrate behind enemy lines to hunt their targets one by one. So if you want to be successful explore maps as quickly as possible. Shooting mechanics feels good and realistic. Maps designs are very good and well optimized to balance tension between teams. Graphics can&apos;t compete with its counterparts but they are decent. Sound effects are great. If developers continue like this, this can be the best FPS game of all the time in the coming years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4886989">Expand</a></span>

Modern shooters offer lots of glitz and glamour, but all that comes at a price. Popular shooters are plagued by issues that are just darn frustrating, such as overpowered score streaks, quick scoping, C4 kills, unbalanced weapons, and spawn killing. Those design flaws have existed far too long. Unfortunately, there are worst problems in the fps genre. Poor hit detection is my biggest gripe. Battlefield 4 is the best example of this. Unfortunately, AAA titles are where most gamers flock. I just don&#x2019;t find many of them to be that good.
<br>Insurgency is different.  Foremost, it doesn&#x2019;t suffer from these problems. New World Interactive developed the game as a Source engine mod that has slowly evolved over several years. Several incarnations of the game exist since even before NWI&#x2019;s founding. The game revolves around patience, teamwork, tactics, and patience (yes, patience is important). One of the original developers of the mod served in the US military overseas, so the game naturally takes place in Iraq and Afghanistan. The maps are varied, and several paths lead to any one point. By holding down strategic routes, a well coordinated team could control a match. But the design of the game makes that difficult. First, death is permanent until the next round. So the run and gun play style won&#x2019;t work. If a player dies, their team can be flanked and gutted as a result.  Some game modes have wave respawning. In those modes, fallen teammates will respawn only after certain objectives are completed.
<br>Second, classes are limited. For example, there can only be 1 or 2 snipers per team. Once a sniper is out of play, he&#x2019;s gone until the next wave or round.  This could be 30 seconds or several minutes. Class limitations are a welcome relief since it prevents domination by sniping, C4 spam, and noob tubing. Things too prevalent in the COD series.
<br>Third, Insurgency is lean and designed for competitive play. So servers support high tickrates. I&#x2019;ve been in servers with 128tick and region lock. OMG!! (Battlefield 4 is a pathetic 10tick). Insurgency&#x2019;s hit detection is easily in the top 5 games I&#x2019;ve played. Plus, the guns handle well. LMG&#x2019;s kick violently but can kill with a few bullets.  Assault rifles are accurate, but lack the LMG&#x2019;s suppression.  Shotguns are devastating in close quarters, but lose their bite in ranged battles. Guns take several seconds to sight in. So players ADS a lot. This adds realism. Soldiers don&#x2019;t burst into rooms with guns at their sides.
<br>Class customization is similar to the marvelous Take 10 in Blops 2. Unlike Blops, there are no cheesy perks like dead silence or engineer. Players can choose ordinances, weapon types and attachments, pistols, armor, and ammo capacity. And players do not rank up in Insurgency. Within each class, players have access to the same items and upgrades. But capacity is limited. If a player carries too much, he moves slower and loses stamina. So forgoing items, such as pistols, and switching to lighter armor will increase speed while and freeing up space for more powerful ordinances. The customization system is streamlined, not sparse like Titanfall or superfluous like BF.
<br>Next, showboating is not rewarded. Players do not run around with knives scoring one hit kills. Instead, they move cautiously thru rooms and alleys listening and watching for the enemy. Oh the tension!! Unfortunately, not everyone appreciates this. One player complained he couldn&#x2019;t get one hit shotgun kills. He didn&#x2019;t realize that the heavy armor of his opponents mitigated a significant amount of his weapon&#x2019;s damage. Additionally, he tried to run and gun instead of remaining in areas suitable for shotgun combat. He left the game. For players who want to run around with shotguns, play something else. Here the focus is balance.
<br>And the best thing about Insurgency? IT SUPPORTS MODDING!! This will keep the game alive for years to come much like Counter Strike. But the developers are very active as well and have already released several patches and added new content&#x2014;for free.
<br>What&#x2019;s the bad? Insurgency&#x2019;s graphics are dated. The game is designed to run on older machines, so textures will look muddled up close. Smoke effects are terrible. Character animations aren&#x2019;t consistent. Throwing grenades and crawling around with LMG&#x2019;s looks awkward, but certainly not game breaking. However, the maps are vibrant and lighting effects are impressive. Guns look and sound realistic.
<br>Insurgency has a steep learning curve. Gameplay is nuanced, and patience is required. If a player dies early, he must spectate until the next team respawn. This lends an opportunity to watch others and learn. Some will find this boring.
<br>Insurgency is a must own. It&#x2019;s the perfect hybrid between Counter Strike and Ghost Recon. At $15, this is the best fps money can buy this year. Period. Compare this to another Source engine game released this year: Titanfall. Titanfall is a critically acclaimed AAA title and it lacks the customization, depth, and balance of Insurgency. And it costs $60. Don&#x2019;t overpay for hype, download Insurgency today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4097979">Expand</a></span>

To be honest I was expecting something new and fresh, but I wasn&apos;t expecting to be blown away and totally impressed like I have been.  I hope that people keep playing this game and that it will really catch on because these developers have stumbled onto something special.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4297556">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is very fluid and works well for most situations, you also have the ability to peak around corners that also gives you more ways to play tactically. The only down side to the gameplay is that sometimes you will get stuck on the environment  or your bullets end up hitting object masks instead of the enemy.
<br>
<br>Character Models in the game are also not polished but are still being worked on and you can see a great difference between when the game was realised and to this point in time.  One thing that sets this game apart from other first person shooters like Battlefield and Call Of Duty is the teamwork and strategy that goes with it, a lot of people in the Insurgency community right now are pretty friendly and play like the game is men&apos;t to be played which in a result make this 10x better to play, you still have the odd people who end up shooting you out of spawn just because they &quot;felt like it&quot; but we have them players everywhere these days... The recent addition from the developers was the modding capability which allows users in the community to create and share there own content for the game allowing for the lifespan of the game to keep going.
<br>
<br>Content in the game so far if actually really good, When you enter a server you have two squads to pick from out of your team. From there you pick a position e.g Sniper or Rifleman, Then you get to choose your weapons that are only selectable for that class. There is also a variety of attachments available for the guns ranging from Sights to even what type of bullet rounds you are using. The kit set-up works on a point system so the more attachments you put on your gun the less points you will have to carry more ammo or have more protective armour. This system really works for the games environment and makes it so you don&apos;t have people running around a huge arsenal of equipment just destroying the battlefield.
<br>
<br>For only $14.99 (AUD) you get so much content delivered to you in one package and with the developers of the game New World Interactive constantly releasing free updates to the game which include new content like maps, weapons and more. I really recommend playing this game with a couple of friends over a Skype call or Teamspeak because it give you a much better feel playing more strategic and having fun, but if your mates aren&apos;t up for it just talk through in-game chat and get to know some of the players on your team. But at the end of the day there is no reason to pick this up if you are into tactical FPS&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4636182">Expand</a></span>

When was the last time you bought a game without overpriced DLC or Micro-transactions? Well, Insurgency even takes the next step and offers a lot of DLC for free (including the newest DLC: Nightfall [15.11.2014]).
<br>The basic controls in the game are pretty easy to learn (You can also try the tutorial), but as soon as you enter the world of multiplayer the game begins to shine. The first steps into this game are brutal and hard to climb - thanks to the 2 bullet kill and the most minimalistic HUD I have ever seen in any First Person Shooter - , but as soon as you learn how to move, how to shoot (single-shot mode usually) and how to play with your team to win the objective Insurgency starts to shine with its intense firefights.
<br>If you are tired of using the same gun over and over just to unlock fancy scopes, silencers or camos, then go play Insurgency. The game gives you the full arsenal of guns directly at the start of the game - They are bound to different classes. Teamplay is guaranteed by the 2-Squad system consisting of multiple different classes - Every class feels unique.
<br>Insurgency is a game for casual and experienced players. Get to know a wide variety of guns, maps and game-modes, including multiple Coop mode versus Bots.
<br>Go get Insurgency if you like tactical and hard shooters with easier controls than Arma and Red Orchestra!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4699720">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One of the best things about Insurgency is the fact that you die quick, very quick, If the enemy spots you, you are dead, period. The same happens if you won&#x2019;t cooperate with your teammates or wander too far across the map. Teamwork is key in this game, so you better find a bunch of friends that you can play it with, or at least get a mic and a solid pair of headphones because without them, you are in huge trouble. At first, you probably won&#x2019;t notice who killed you because this is a very tactical game, everyone is hiding and waiting for the perfect moment to approach.  Insurgency will appeal to the kind of players who love tactical shooters with steep learning curve, sort of like in Counter Strike 1.6.
<br>
<br>Insurgency started off as one of the most popular Half-Life 2 mods, but you probably already know that, because most people that I know already played Insurgency before, as in the HF2 mod.  It was downloaded over a million times ,and received the Player&#x2019;s Choice 2007 Mod of the Year award from ModDB which is a huge honor and I&#x2019;m happy that this game got released. Even though the game runs on Valve&#x2019;s Source Engine, it still looks and feels like a fully fledged release. Personally, I was expecting much less from this game, but I was pleased to see that the developer(New World Interactive) actually took the time and made it worth a while.
<br>
<br>The best way to describe Insgurgency&#x2019;s gameplay is quite difficult, it&#x2019;s a mix between Counter Strike and Red Orchestra, the reason why I&#x2019;m saying that is because throughout my time with this game I felt like I&#x2019;m playing a solid tactical-shooter, it reminded me of the time when everyone played CS 1.6 which is a good thing, you have access to everything, you don&#x2019;t need to unlock weapons or perks, this is an old school tactical-shooter and I love it.. For those uninitiated with the world of tactical shooters, the gameplay is highly dependent upon you sticking close to your teammates, and taking control of the objectives. Most of the game&#x2019;s maps are perfect for this kind of gameplay style, small maps with many vantage points for long-range shooting and much more, you&#x2019;ll really appreciate the work that the developers put into the maps. The fact that the game supports up to 32 players, I have never encountered a camper during an online match, which is surprising because at first I thought everyone is just going to hide behind the cover but no, majority of players cooperate with each other, I have also noticed that the community is very supportive, this makes the online experience very enjoyable.
<br>
<br>The feel of weapons in Insurgency is spot on. Each gun in the game, has its own advantages and disadvantages, and they all handle differently. This is how you supposed to program guns in an online multiplayer game, I&#x2019;m talking to you Call Of Duty. You can also add different attachments to your weapons, for ex. penetrating ammo, scope and many more. The Supplies system gives you a limited number of points which prevents the player from adding all of the attachments to their weapons, for ex. adding a penetrating ammo will cost you 3 points and you have 10 in total(I&#x2019;m not sure about the precise number).
<br>
<br>What I love the most about this game is how difficult it is, and how it focuses upon tactical play and cooperation with your teammates, I haven&#x2019;t seen a game like Insurgency for a long time(except for CS:GO), We need more games like Insurgency, and less of the COD, modern-military bulls**t that we are overwhelmed with nowadays.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4816679">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Insurgency doesn&apos;t BS you by making you level up guns to unlock attachments. Everyone gets an allocated amount of supply points to modify their loadouts freely, at spawn. Want a optic site? You got one. Want to carry a molotov instead of grenade? You got it. Want heavy armor? Sure. You pick your own loadouts based on your preferences. This adds a tremendous amount of variation in the loadouts that you can create.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is one of the better realism FPS shooters. The learning curve for new users can be considered steep, but this makes it all the more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of things. Well worth the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4843183">Expand</a></span>

The maps are well layed out and don&apos;t give one team an advantage over the other. Your loadout is fully customizable; from what type of vest you want, all the way down to what gun you want and what attachments you want for that specific gun. Yes, you get to customize your weapon attachments.
<br>The game has a good amount of content to offer. There are plenty of gamemodes (including co-op if you don&apos;t like PvP,) plenty of maps, and plenty of classes/loadouts. They&apos;re still adding stuff, by the way.
<br>The sound design is FLAWLESS. I mean like wow, this is Battlefield-esque sound design. The graphics, while looking pretty outdated at times, are some of the best I&apos;ve seen on the Source engine.

We&apos;ll probably end up seeing this game in the competitive scene after some patches, and a little bit of scrubbing. I&apos;ll get right to the point with the bad.
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>Graphics: Let&apos;s be fair. This really shouldn&apos;t matter too much. Look a CS Source. Those graphics aren&apos;t nearly as good as Insurgency&apos;s, and it&apos;s still a decent game. These graphics are thin and make it seem cheep. So doe CS Source (judge lightly). The weapons look decent, and could use a little polishing. Thankfully, they don&apos;t take up too much of the screen while aiming down iron sights. Optics are a different animal. Depending on the optic, your FOV is (duh). Overall, 6/10
<br>
<br>Class Setup: Somedays, you just wanna run around with an LMG and blow the heads off all your enemies. While I sympathise with this, there&apos;s only one slow available. So you can&apos;t just assume that you will get to play your prefered style the whole time. This does have its positives though. Not getting the same class every time forces teams to work as a team, and for everyone to follow their respective rolls. Word of warning: The sniper / Marksmen classes always seem to fill the fastest (baised on my very limited gameplay.) However I do think that overall it&apos;s for the better. I&apos;m just bitter because I miss my LMG some times. Overall, 7/10.
<br>
<br>Goddamn lag: This is a harsh reality. And it affects every gamer who plays online. Please for the love of god, play this game with at least 10MB upload &amp; download. You know who you are. 5/10
<br>
<br>Positives:
<br>Incredibly realistic. None of this BS that you find in COD (or BF) where you get shot, and might be able to escape. 99/100 times in this game, if you get shot, you&apos;re going down. Personally, I&apos;d rather see a game where if you get shot in the leg, you move slower/drop to a knee rather than getting completely downed. But that&apos;s the word of one fat gamer. 9/10.
<br>
<br>Mechanics: I had a hard time getting used to the mechanics at first. This game has the &quot;lean&quot; feature that COD Ghosts and BF4 both flaunt. I believe it&apos;s far superior to COD, due to the speed of the snap or the &quot;lean&quot;. Anyone who has been in any sort of firefight (paintball, airsoft, legitimate warfare...) you know how much it matters to get your head back in after firing. This delivers that in spades. This game also includes a sliding feature that fan-boys should really love. Could use a little tweaking. I don&apos;t think you should be able to slide as far as you do, but it still serves a legitimate purpose. Overall, 8/10
<br>
<br>Rendering: Let me explain. When looking down a sight (Iron, Holographic, ACOG), the entire screen around you doesn&apos;t go black. A better way to put it: Remember when Infinity Ward was stroking our cocks with the &quot;Dual Render&quot; feature in Ghosts? And how this was especially effective with sniper rifles? Yea. This ones got it. I just had to throw this portion in my already lengthy review. **** COD. Overall: 8/10
<br>
<br>Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork: If you have one run-and-gun-I-don&apos;t-need-no-stinkin-teammates player, then consider him dead, and work around fighting with a body down. If you don&apos;t work as a team and play the objective, then you&apos;re not going to win. Winning&apos;s everything right? Communicate. I don&apos;t wanna say that having a headset is absolutely paramount to win... but it sure as hell helps. Overall: 9/10
<br>
<br>The Fellow Gamers: This surprised the hell out of me. After 5 matches, 4 of them had at least 5 players, who were actively communicating. This was a very serious environment. Everyone was communicating and working to capture the goal. And we were going against AI! I was amazed how... dedicated to the objective these people were. Overall: 9/10
<br>
<br>Overall, this game has earned my respect. I recommend this game who wants something different from a first person shooter. 7.6(8)/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=3960564">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The few issues holding it back from a 9 or 10 score seem mostly tied to various bugs and glitches, which only require some light polishing. Also, there is no leveling / unlock system. This may be why some critics were disappointed when comparing Insurgency to CoD or BF. However, at its low price, I feel that I still got more than what I paid for.
<br>
<br>The elements which I believe most set Insurgency apart from its FPS competitors:
<br>
<br>- The &apos;weight system&apos;. You customize your own load-out, with options such as guns, pistols, explosives, armor, and extra ammunition chest rigs. You are only able to carry a certain amount of equipment at once. This is surprisingly well-balanced and enjoyable. Both firepower and armor enhancements are costly, so one must choose wisely. At the same time, you can&apos;t really choose wrong!
<br>
<br>- The sound effects are intense. You will hear bullets whiz past your head. You will hear them crack upon hitting hard surfaces near you. These suppression effects are pulse-pounding! Soldier dialogue is also impressive. You will hear nearby teammates screaming and calling for help when they&apos;re being &apos;lit up&apos;.
<br>
<br>- Well-built mid-range maps. They feel smaller than Battlefield&apos;s maps, but larger than CoD&apos;s. A wonderful middle-ground which makes SMGs just as effective as sniper rifles if you choose your cover wisely.
<br>
<br>- Great multiplayer game modes, and unique uses for explosives. Skirmish is probably my favorite game mode. Both teams have a weapons cache which is outside of their respective spawns. If you&apos;re bold enough to sneak in, you can use grenades, C4 or rocket launchers to destroy them. This stops the other team from gaining more reinforcement waves. Too often FPS games utilize rockets and explosives only as anti-personnel weapons. I thought Insurgency put a great spin on an old weapon.
<br>
<br>All-in-all, it&apos;s worth your money. There is a heavy learning curve, so prepare your anus. Once you have a basic grasp though, you will not want to put this game down! It&apos;s refreshing to see the Source engine still kicking and able to create such an impressive atmosphere. Good work New World Interactive. I&apos;m excited to see what the future holds for you, and therefore the gaming community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4009401">Expand</a></span>

I do well enough to have a good time every other round, but for the most part I suck. That being said this game makes me feel good. I&apos;m not saying that because I&apos;m better at this game than most other FPS, no. I&apos;m just saying, with the &quot;realistic&quot; damage and the amount of recoil, it&apos;s easier to actually get a kill: in a one-on-one confrontation. Put 2+ enemies in front of you and you&apos;ll more than likely die, if not shortly after while you reload. But, nevertheless, it&apos;s a good time with friends or even random people,most people play the objective and if they don&apos;t, they usually die and have to watch other people play better. I normally don&apos;t like    the &quot;get killed and then a forced into spectator mode&quot; type thing, but in here it works well and really makes you ant to play better and better. The guns are great and all have their strengths and weaknesses, but most require a bit of skill to use. I strongly recommend to play the tutorial first, and to ignore all these negative comments. I read most of them and I think some are just upset because they died a lot, just my opinion though.  At $15, it&apos;s a steal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4434538">Expand</a></span>

Bullets seem more dangerous than in any other game, with sharp cracks and a very decent suppression system. Your character actually reacts to being shot at and seeing allies going down, which makes the entire fight seem a whole lot more engaging and personal, especially when you hear the fear in your character&apos;s voice as a squad member gets shot right in front of you.
<br>
<br>This game punishes you for using traditional twitch-shooter mechanics: There&apos;s no drop-shotting or quick scoping here. Instead, the game encourages you to work as a team and actually use the response wheel, which can be used to announce a whole lot of useful things such as spotting an enemy or telling your team quickly that you need to suppress an area or to spread out. Not only does this come up in the bottom of the screen but your character actually SPEAKS the line, which is a nice touch. Game play is a lot slower than most shooters; more like Red Orchestra than Battlefield.
<br>
<br>The community mainly consists of older guys, mainly 18+, and although everyone laughs and jokes around in the lobby screen everyone gets very serious and tactical in game. Even when I see a younger person on the game, they all seem to be very tame compared to, say, the CoD community.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is brilliantly made and for a relatively cheap price tag you can pick up hours of fun. See you guys on the battlefield.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=5207530">Expand</a></span>

When you first play, you will die a lot. But when you get the hang of it, it&apos;s quite simple. There is no ammo counter, mini map, and also no crosshair. Hip firing is very unreliable, so you will use iron sights most of the time. And there is no kill feed too, some servers have this, but most don&apos;t, so you won&apos;t know who and from where you&apos;ve been shot. The HUD only displays the objectives, team respawns, and number of magazines. If you aren&apos;t wearing armor, most guns will kill you in a few shots, so you have to be careful. There are roles in Insurgency and all of them has unique weapons. Instead of buying weapons, we can choose weapons and put extensions on them depending on your weapon points and role. Sometimes, when playing in team insurgents, some players will role play a little bit too hard. Most of the people I&apos;ve played with are quite friendly and will work together. Though there is a lack of servers and a minor technical problem with the game. Every time I try to close Insurgency in my computer, I have to use the task manager because when I press quit, the game freezes. But it doesn&apos;t interfere with the gameplay. In summary, Insurgency is a unique tactical shooter that relies on teamwork and tactics. I really recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=5431110">Expand</a></span>

This game can feel boring at times, but when you have the right players with you is heaps of fun. Great to see how far this has come since it was a mod.</span>

NOTE: Do not be afraid to buy this on 2017, the community is still pretty active and will remain so until the sequel, Insurgency: Sandstorm, is released in 2018.</span>

The phrase &quot;Counter-Strike meets ArmA meets Rising Storm&quot; is how I&apos;ve been persuading my friends to play it because I think it takes all the best elements of those games and combines them expertly. The gameplay is tactical, tense and heart-quickening, with sudden vicious fire fights erupting and ending just as abruptly. Teamwork is the key to success and a good community of mic&apos;d players is forming, much like RO2 had when it was first released. Maps range from long to mid-range mountainous areas to close quarter towns and villages and everything is highly detailed and feels realistic without straying too far into ArmA-style geekery. Like all &quot;realism&quot; type FPS games, there is a steep learning curve here, but once you surmount it, Insurgency provides a very rewarding experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=3935387">Expand</a></span>

From my point of view It combines all the best features of Counter Strike, Red Orchestra, SWAT Rainbow Six, AA and Arma. Forget CoD and BF. Insurgency is a game for real man :-) Waiting is over. I would give 10 points, but instead opted for 9, since in my opinion  the game would benefit from better bots though, to facililtate training of newcomers, make coop even more rewarding experience, and have fun with multiplayer game if there is not enough people, or simply play offline. Ten years ago bots were much better and human-like (see Far Cry 1). I would like bots in Insurgency be like those bots in Far Cry 1 and like bots in the Brink game today (modified after intitial problems) - usually hard to tell difference between human and bot. And this is my only complaint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=3936404">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay and gun mechanics are spot on and very satisfying. The sound effects in the game are highly realistic, to the point getting fired at and suppressed can cause a response in YOU. Elevated heart rates can often occur. Pretty cool. When you achieve a frag it feels more like a victory than a simple frag like in most games. Teamwork and thinking are rewarded over Rambo tactics, but the gameplay is not in any way slow. Suspenseful corridors, amazing suppression effects and useful attachments that actually modify/enhance the way you play. Gameplay takes the look of CS:GO, and improves upon it, then adds guns that actually do damage, and incorporates the strategy of MW2 hardcore search and destroy/domination (etc.) with red orchestra 2/rising storm. At 15 bucks, you can&apos;t go wrong! New World Interactive has pure gold with this title and it is my go-to game, often winning out even over Dota 2.

The graphics are nice but nothing special and the game itself runs smoothly. Combat is very skill based, players used to games like call of duty will find it very unforgiving. The current player base is small but quickly growing with mature supportive players.</span>

The game has progressed into the best shooter I have ever played.  It makes me keep coming back for more.  This is a hardcore shooter that has filled the void that other modern shooters haven&apos;t been able to fill.</span>

This is mainly down to a realistic damage model, and the way the guns work. You have to move slowly and methodically, not just sprint around corners then hold down the trigger whilst jumping around.
<br>
<br>This is the only game I know where, if you are good, you can feel like some special forces guy, going on a sneaky flanking mission with a suppressed weapon, just using double taps to the chest to take guys out.
<br>
<br>The gun mechanics are so detailed as well, from the satisfying sounds, the SAW and the mp5 come to mind, to things like if you reload with a bullet in the chamber you won&apos;t need to cock the weapon again. Reloading also takes a reasonable amount of time so you can&apos;t really spray and pray (unless you have a drum or box under the gun).
<br>
<br>The co op is also great, the AI leaves some things to be desired, but its fun nevertheless, if you liked the &quot;terrorist hunt&quot; gamemodes in the Rainbow 6 Vegas games, you will probably love this.
<br>
<br>The only reason I gave this a 9 is that there are currently (13 march 2014) only 6 maps, (2 of which I don&apos;t like). But the devs posted on the forums about a patch coming before April that will add new maps and weapons so I am looking forward to that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/insurgency/user-reviews?user_review_id=4038354">Expand</a></span>
