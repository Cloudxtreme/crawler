I have the original Starcraft and Brood War and those games have nothing compared to Starcraft 2. STORY: Everybody complains about no Protoss and Zerg campaigns in Wings of Liberty but there is no need . 26 missions (plus a bonus mission that I played) makes up for a long single player and really engaging story. The story was awesome. You do get to play some Protoss missions but overall the story is so engaging it is hard to stop playing and go get some sleep! SOUND: Sound is amazing! The original Starcraft nostalgia is there with some of the music being remixed to the newer setting. Even the units pretty much sound the same if not better. Great Sound. Graphics: One of the best for an RTS game. Do expect to play this game on some integrated graphics at decent frame rates with more than a couple of dozen of units. Some level are just plain beautiful and worthy of high praise. Blizzard has done a quality job in the graphics department. GAMEPLAY: A lot of people are saying this game is a rehash of the original but they are so wrong and I don&apos;t even think they played it. Now remember those cliffs that helped create a natural defense that would only be conquered by air units, well now some units like the Terren Reaper can fly up those cliffs with ease. This changes the gameplay up a bit and it is refreshing . But it does have the same Starcraft feel and isn&apos;t hat supposed to be what we all wanted in the first place? Why change the formula up when it has been proven to work? New units replace some of the old units from Starcraft and Brood War and to say I like these better than the old units.Multiplayer is such a blast and even better than the original. Too bad for no LAN support but I won&apos;t miss it. I don&apos;t live in South Korea anymore playing in the PC game rooms that is better with LAN. Most people won&apos;t miss it and the same goes for me. If your a fan of the original Starcraft then you gotta get this one. All others some play and see for yourself. I wouldn&apos;t really judge this game by what other people are saying, especially all the negative ones that give this game a 0 or a 1 because I feel they wanted features they wanted and since it doesn&apos;t include it they bash the game. You can&apos;t review what is not there. Best just to go out there and try it! Find someone who has it and ask if you can get their guest pass that was included with the game and see for yourself. You won&apos;t regret it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356981">Expand</a></span>

This game feels like a rehash of the Starcraft the first, just with updated graphics and interface. Quite frankly, that&apos;s not enough to compel me to buy this when their are other great RTS&apos;s still out there, like Dawn of War and Company of Heroes.</span>

I know originality has never been big for Blizz&apos;s writing staff, but this seems to be a new low. Lowest common denominator anyone? The business model is pure greed. Won&apos;t be too long before MW is integrated into Battlenet and we&apos;ll all have to pay subs for the privilege of using the service. The graphics could pretty much be sprites and viewing angle (especially compared to Total War, SupCom, CoH and the Dawn of War series) only allows for a small amount of the pretty small maps to be seen at once. Online is completely unbalanced (even if the units are fairly well-balanced), seeing as Blizz decided who was going to be good at it months/years ago and gave them alpha + beta access while the rest of us will have to play SC1 or dry as dust skirmish maps against the PC to even learn the names of Zerg or Protoss units. Of course the potential reviewers were included in the beta as well. So glad they all had a good time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1357090">Expand</a></span>

Everything about the original was improved to a great degree, from match making to game balance. The new units add a lot of new strategies as do new mechanics such as destructible rocks, xel&apos;naga watch towers and the addition of a second gas node at every base. As a die hard fan of SC:BW I went into this game with very high expectations and I can tell you that it lived up to every bit of it. The campaign, im sure is fun if youre into that sort of thing, I myself went straight for the multiplayer, which is excellent with the brand new ladder system. Gone are the days where you play against people significantly below or beyond you in terms of skill . My only complaint is the lack of clan support which the original enjoyed. I think it&apos;d be great if people could make clans to make it easier to connect with other skilled people for team matches, such as 3v3s and 4v4s. All in all, if you even sort of enjoyed BW you will love SC2. Stop reading this and buy it now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1357016">Expand</a></span>

While less features are considered such as no LAN, possibly few add-ons, a constant Internet connection and similar Facebook content are something I would NOT like to see in a PC game. Sure 30 missions in a game may be quite convincing for one campaign along with the looks of improved graphics. If this game is released with all three campaigns with at least as much missions and lasted as long as Grand Theft Auto IV and the acquired features I am looking for, I would own this game for $100. Therefore this game isn&apos;t by far unique and worth the price on features from what Relic&apos;s Company of Heroes had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1357075">Expand</a></span>

They took all the points that made SC 1 good, and removed them, and tried to cover for it with some prettied up graphics, and then split the game into three to make an even more obscene profit by releasing the same game engine again and again and call them new games rather then expansion packs. Activision is the devil.</span>

Pretend it&apos;s called Blarghraft and re-assess it. It&apos;s at best a 7 if you&apos;re in to terribly outdated gameplay, graphics, music, story, etc. There is nothing about this game that feels fresh or intriguing. It&apos;s an SC expansion that could&apos;ve been released a decade ago and been decent at the time. Now it&apos;s just an average generic RTS with nothing that stands out from the myriad of RTS clones devoted to its own namesake. Except for a cliched story with middling voice acting there&apos;s nothing to rate SC2 on. It feels like Activision just put an old title through the assembly line to churn out something to put on the store shelves with the only innovation coming in ways to milk money off the title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356999">Expand</a></span>

Zero innovation and your own personal data collection plattform aka B.Net 2.0 are just two let downs with this one. Additionally it fails where it really shouldn&apos;t: MP - various cheats are already in use, very little is done against them. Balancing is a joke at best in every other playmode than 1v1.
<br>
<br>The SP part is OK, but nothing you haven&apos;t seen so far. Story? Eric Cartman would say: lame!
<br>
<br>If I take all of this I can only say I am very dissappointed, a game made for money and not for the gamers - 1 pts for greed and lack of inspiration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1358338">Expand</a></span>

Not only are their games polished to perfection, they make games that everyone can enjoy and to me that is design at its best. Kudos Blizzard, this will keep me busy until diablo and your next MMO.</span>

Still, this game is a must buy if you are a fan of the genre. Single player is fun and the achievements might keep you hooked for a while. Multipayer is great, blizzard made sure to make battle.net work well for it, at least to try and compensate for no LAN support.</span>

It pushes the fun away whereas if you play with a friend or two, the game gets another dimension of fun! Campaign is alright and help you to get into the multiplayer quite quickly. But you can skip it, the game is worth for the multiplayer on its own.</span>

It says alot about the current RTS when this is hailed as one of the best RTS games out there.
<br>
<br>The first place really to start from is the single-play (although no one really buys this game for the single-player). There is no real discussion about this, the single-player is a half-assed tick in a check box to get more players playing the game. It is filled with uninspiring levels and a generic sci-fi &quot;story-line&quot; if it can even be called that. The 2nd expansion also lives up to this low standard.
<br>
<br>The real reason people buy this game is to play with friends, play the arcade or play competitive multi-player. Competitive multiplier is a strange breed of RTS. It is more of a &quot;RT&quot; as there is no real strategy involved in winning. The most important aspects of succeeding in the multi-player is executing build orders and having perfect timing on micro and macro and having the APM (how fast you can do stuff in the game) of a god. Even on the highest level professionals win through micro rather than strategy. Never have I heard a game commentator say &quot;what an amazing strategy&quot; or &quot;player X just can&apos;t compete with this flawless strategy&quot; etc... It is really a de-evolution of the RTS genre to appeal to a wider audience.
<br>
<br>The arcade I do have to admit is fun but here is the good news, Its 100% free!
<br>
<br>To conclude, don&apos;t buy this game; simply get the free trail (that lasts forever) and play arcade the whole time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=5208413">Expand</a></span>

As someone who has been a PC gamer since 1988, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys video games. You will enjoy it immensely and, notwithstanding the whiny criticisms of pale-faced fanboys, you will find that there is very little, if anything, not to love about this game.

The game looks great and the effects are amazing as well. The party, friends and voice chat are great. I love that i could add all my facebook friends in one go (although this is optional. All in all this is the best rts thats come out since wc3 and sc1 before it. Hundreds of hours of gameplay for the best 60 dollars ive ever spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356817">Expand</a></span>

Highly addictive gameplay. Anyone who&apos;s even remotely a RTS fan needs to pick this up. Nice job Blizzard!</span>

The Singleplayer offers very good mission design, great cinematics and a very interesting story mode in between the missions. The graphic design is good (as far as I only play on my netbook, it should not be any better anyway :)) The weakness of the singleplayer mode, is unfortunately, the one thing that Blizzard could best in the past: THE STORY. Starcraft I had a great story with many surprising twists. Warcraft III had very great characters and a very interesting Story. But all the SCII story does is fullfilling clichees with boring and unemotional characters... But still: it is a great game worth its money, and the best RTS you can get at the moment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356909">Expand</a></span>

The story</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded"> Dont listen to the total haters out their its clear that they have something in their bonnet with either Blizzard or SC2 and having played all the single player I would say these people have not really played the game much or at all. What you get with SC2 is a great but shortish single player campaign where you play from the Terran side or miore exactly Jim Raynor&apos;s Rebels. The story line is fun though with a lot of humor and a few bits of cgi thrown in the rest of the story cut scenes are from the games engine. Again people claiming billion of hours of cgi really are miss informing you. The other two races single player stories are going to be covered in the next two expansions so you will have to buy too expansions to complete the whole story line. However SC2 main strength is not the single player campaign its the multiplayer where the true strengh of the game really lies and that side of play is really good fun you get split into different leagues after taking part in 5 placement matches so you will be facing people of your own skill level. The multiplayer is very fast paced with all the races being fairly well balanced yet playing in totally different fasions, matches can range from 1v1 roo teams of 4v4 or even Free for all matches and with the quick find functions of B.net you will be quicky to find a match most the time. You have too remember that SC1 is concidered a national sport in Korea and SC2 looks like it will replace its aging brother so expect a very high level of play in the top leagues. With players being able to earn upto a six figure sallary this game really can be concidered Pro Gaming. The down side of all this is that SC2 requires you to have internet access in order to play even the single player which can be a real downer if Battle.net is down for whatever reason because you will not be able to play the game at all. Also you can not lan this game at all. Still all in all this is as good as an RTS gets at the moment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1357069">Expand</a></span>

The average of my votes is 9, as you can see.<br>StarCraft II delivers a great gaming experience, with some minor flaws (and I&apos;m talking about the lack of LAN play and some online features) but great content anyway. Graphics are really notable, even if the system requirements are way too high right now: I would really like to see a new low-rez version of the client, because if you don&apos;t have a fairly decent (at least Intel Core Duo or AMD equivalent) processor and 4 gigs of DDR2 RAM, well, it&apos;s unplayable.<br>Music is another really good point: the band performing the Terran soundtrack features Tony Levin and Jerry Marotta, two fairly known and very good musicians.<br>As for the gameplay side, this games really is influenced by the eSports system, making it least complex and slow, and much more fast-paced, quick-thinking (HUGE battles take 10 secs at maximum), which may be either really good or really bad, but what I think is that this is good indeed!<br>An absolute must-buy, but try to avoid paying 60 &#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1468471">Expand</a></span>

I had to play through the story mode the first day I got it becuase I had to know what happened.  I love how they worked in the unit customization so I was not forced to just use whatever new unit they gave me, and I could use a consistent strategy throughout the maps.  I also like how they worked in doing protoss missions, and the last protoss mission was an epic level, probably one of the best in the history of any RTS ever.  This game has everything going for it, but I give it a 9 for being a bit choppy still online.  I was in the beta testing, and it worked fine, but when the full version came out, it was not working as well anymore, so they have to add more servers or something to compensate for the amount of players on B-net.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=2004431">Expand</a></span>

You can develop in different directions, between missions, and have to live with the choices you make. It has different difficulties, which makes it fun no matter the level your on. (my friend has to play it casual to enjoy the game, i need more challenge and go hard, and if hard is to hard, then i can take this one mission easier, and go back to hard on the next mission again). The game also has 3 alternate challenges within each mission, which you don`t have to take to succeed, but which makes it fun to play the same mission again several times to reach this goal as well.. And of course, the graphics is up to date  Excellent game, MANY hours of fun, even after single player campaign is through, you can play it again, or enjoy the best multiplayer strategy game of all time </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=3285889">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Modability! This is a great plus for me. You can make basically everything in the GalaxyEditor. One can make entire new games within Sc2. Awesome!
<br>- active Community: be it Forums or the constant flow of new custom maps. With a community that big that has access to advanced moding tools such as the fabulous editor this game won&apos;t get boring too fast :)
<br>- the campaign missions are designed fun and diverse
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>- Music. Except for the Terran music I consider the soundtrack of part 1 to be the superior one. The great terran music in Sc2 is en par with the terran music in Sc1. They even captured the whole &apos;space cowboy&apos; theme a little better this time around.
<br>- Story: The campaign didn&apos;t touch me or anything. The whole atmosphere wasn&apos;t as unforgiving, cold and gruesome as in Sc1. In Starcraft 1 the cold depth of space was present. The terrans were rugged, slightly degenerate nihilist basterds in Sc1 and it suited them. They were space dark, weird space humans. In the multiplayer of Sc2 everything feels alright about the terrans but in the campaign they&apos;re all too shiny and perfect at times. The dark awesome feel of part one is absent during Sc2&apos;s campaign. Still, the missions were fun and diverse (see above)
<br>- Protoss: when have the protoss become singing moral elves? Really they once were awesome radical superbeings who felt superior to everyone because they were. They had awesome big ships and erased entire planets with their radical advanced technolgy if it served their interest. Besides they had other faces and looked way more awesome. Now they just look... I don&apos;t know. Their faces are to edged, the eyes to little. I preferred the design in Sc1. It was simpler but it looked way more natural. The way an intelligent alien race should look. Besides, in Sc1 Protoss didn&apos;t wear shiny cute crystals everywhere. What happened to the Protoss? They were cool once...
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>This is a multiplayer game so the minus of the story is a relatively unimportant one. The protoss problem is a question of personal preference of course. Don&apos;t like them? Play another faction. Overall they fit in with the other 2 (way more badass) factions well enough. So this minus is rendered rather meaningless, too. The music, while not as good as in part one at some points (again the Protoss music is my least favorite...) overall is still a solid piece of work and the terran theme is awesome. Zerg is cool, too, sounding very organic and aggressive which suits this race perfectly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=3299875">Expand</a></span>

As for people complaining about LAN, do not buy the game if you want LAN play, Blizzard announced months ago LAN was gone. If you complain about the game running poorly on your machine, just like with any other PC game, check the system requirements before you buy it. The online play is amazing, I love the new Battle.net. One thing I have yet to see from any reviews is comments on the new custom maps, The game has been out for not even 2 days and there&apos;s already some incredible maps out there, when WC3 first came out the custom maps were quite lame, but in SC2 they are already beating what&apos;s available in WC3. People also complain that &quot;you have to pay another $120 for the full campaign&quot; which is not true, this game includes a much more in depth, much longer, campaign focusing on one race, they could have shortened it and made it comparable to the others but they put in a lot more effort to make this campaign be the best of any RTS, which I think it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356816">Expand</a></span>

This is a game that suits a whole range of players with difficulties that truly challenge each to their own. Engaging, FUN, constantly refreshing, the single player has taken RTS to a new level. Its not even that cheesy - there&apos;s a lot of heart and soul in this game. Anyone giving this release a 0 rating is giving the cream and pinnacle of gaming the finger - and they are doing so because of one niggly thing that affects them and most likely something that can be fixed. There are MANY customisable video/sound/gameplay options to tweak and fix so why complain when the programming is superb?! What else could you hope for? :) The multiplayer is going to take the already incredible online community to the next level. I predict it will hit hard not dissimilar (but different in its own way) to what WOW did for online gaming. Its incredibly competitive, incredibly diverse and just oozes polish. You are in good hands with this one, I know I&apos;m enjoying every moment of it. Dont let immature idiots who rate it low because it doesnt do everything you ever imagined sour your appetite - this is the best RTS ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356822">Expand</a></span>

Rather than attempting some kind of high-concept, new style of RTS, Blizzard has stuck to their roots and changed virtually nil from the original Starcraft. Just added a few new units, a much improved campaign, and one extra dimension. The third one, that is. As in 3D. I don&apos;t mean we get to visit another dimension. Don&apos;t let me give you that impression. Because we don&apos;t. And talk about beautiful! It&apos;s gorgeous and gritty. I was afraid, and I&apos;m sure many of you have shared the same apprehension, that the Blizfags in all their stupid wisdom would adopt Warcraft&apos;s cartoony visuals for the Starcraft sequel. But let me assure you: not really. I mean, it&apos;s sort of cartoony. Like, the medics have these huge medic shields that don&apos;t really make any sense, but for the most part it&apos;s perfectly fine and adult-looking. If your girlfriend looks over your shoulder, you won&apos;t be embarrassed. That is, if you have a girlfriend. Which you don&apos;t. Anyways. Great game! What happened to the Sunken Colonies and Lurkers? I mean seriously. . . WTF happened to the Sunken Colonies and the Lurkers? Instead of the Sunken Colonies, the Zerg get some kind of huge, giant, flapping dildo-tentacle that snaps ground units in the face. You heard correctly. Ground units. . . get bludgeoned in the face. . . with a giant peeney-weeney. I guess that is kind of an incentive to stay away from their base, though, isn&apos;t it? Who wants to rush the Zerg base only to get cock-slapped? Fuck that dildo-slapping tentacle bitch. Great game, though! Dark Templars have Darth Maul scythes. There&apos;s a unit called the Omegalisk which is basically four-and a half Ultrulisks in one. You can&apos;t make it. There&apos;s a Jamaican Witch Doct. . . I mean, Ghost. Raynor shoots a huge, beautiful plasma TV that probably cost a few grand with his revolver like a dumbass. The Xel-Naga are a playable race. Just kidding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356939">Expand</a></span>

The interactive menues (aka The Hyperion) add a great element to the story. You can skip the non essentials completely or explore them to be rewarded with a deeper look atthe characters. There is SO much good in this game. To rate it low because it doesn&apos;t support your favored play style (LAN) or because it has a story instead of empty fighting for the sake of fighting is simply petulant. Also so say this game is &quot;supposed&quot; to be a tournament game is just shortsighted. It&apos;s an RTS with a deep history and massive following, the fact that it&apos;s developed into a mass passtime doesn&apos;t define it. For me this game has been well worth the wait, brilliant</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356923">Expand</a></span>

Great graphics and stellar sound. Although &quot;Wings of Liberty&quot; provides a story-based single player campaign for the Terran faction only, that campaign is rich and deep, with some non-linear elements and considerable replayability. The single player campaign is comprised of 29 story missions, up to 26 of which may be included in each play through (based on the player&apos;s decisions). Mission variety is superb, as each mission offers unique goals and obstacles, including some genuinely original and exciting scenarios. Rounding our the single player options are a series of &quot;Challenge Modes&quot;, 9 stand-alone levels designed to teach advanced RTS tactics and test experienced players&apos; acumen. Multiplayer components are both familiar and engaging. Starcraft 2 debuts Blizzard&apos;s &quot;Battle.net 2.0&quot; online functionality, with built in matchmaking, leagues, statistics, and chat. Smartly, Blizzard has included Facebook integration to allow players to easily add online friends to their in-game friends lists for multiplayer. Gameplay consists of the same 3 classic factions from the original, with many units from the previous game returning with new abilities alongside a host of new units. Balance is excellent, although the early game focus (known online as Blitzing and Rushing) may frustrate newer players. If Starcraft 2 has faults, they are likely to be found deep in the pedigree itself. Starcraft 2 remains an &quot;old-school&quot; RTS, with plenty of base building, resource gathering, and hands-on unit control. The trappings of modern RTS&apos;s are not present, and players accustomed to the features of newer strategy games may find themselves fustrated by the level of micromanagement the game demands. While faction balance is nearly flawless, the multiplayer relies on an elaborate structure of so-called &quot;hard counters&quot;: units which trump specific other units. Slow build times and deep tech trees can mean that, at all but the highest levels of gameplay, even if you see a particular attck coming well in advance you may still be helpless against it. Adding to the frustration, the aforementioned Rush and Blitz strategies predominate competitive multiplayer, forcing both players to go &quot;all-in&quot; within the first minutes of a match. Despite these minor annoyances, Starcraft 2 remains one of the best RTS games available today. This is a must-have for any fan of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1357018">Expand</a></span>

God forbid that Blizzard would like to sell a copy of the game to each person that is going to be playing it. That is really no different than almost every other game on the market. How many hundreds of millions has Blizzard lost due to the LAN feature in Starcraft 1? More people play SC over LAN in Korea than the number of copies of the game actually sold. The price tag is in now way a big surprise. SC is in no way a single player game. SC is a multiplayer game that will give you hundreds or thousands of hours of enjoyment. Anyone scoffing at the $60 price is an idiot. how much did you pay for God of War and its 9 hour campaign? Or how about the other hundreds of single player games that offer no more content after the primary story?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356754">Expand</a></span>

When everyone else was fixated on starcraft, I was playing red alert 2. I only discovered the quality of blizzard games after playing warcraft 3 (my first blizzard RTS). So when starcraft 2 was announced, I was excited, counting down the date to July 27, 2010 (which coincidentally is a day before my b-day). Blizzard never disappoints and this is true for starcraft 2. There single player campaign is simply epic and there is so many side things you can do, such as play an arcade, choose the mission path you are going, or upgrade your army (so there is something for RPG fans out there). Enough about the campaign, multiplayer online, thats where its at. It takes a lot of skills and strategy to master this game but the process of learning is so fun. The matchmaking is such that if you play against others, you&apos;ll be matched with people your own skill level so you don&apos;t have to worry about being pwned by a veteran. The custom games are fun as hell. You&apos;ll see games from every genre. And as long as there is someone creative out there, there will always be new content. Hey, I didn&apos;t stop playing warcraft 3 since its release date in 2002 until starcraft 2 came out, and I was always playing new content. Now this is a review of CONTENT. For some reason people are giving this game 1 star because of DRM, or lack of LAN, or it being 1/3 of a game, or dumb reasons like their game didn&apos;t get shipped on the first day. I&apos;d respect their opinion of the game even if they gave 1 star if it had something to do with the campaign being boring, or the game being unbalanced or something like that. Sure I agree that DRM is stupid, but its not like you have to be online to play single player campaigns. You just need to authorize your game when you first install it. Then the lack of LAN. Yes, blizzard should have included LAN, which was what made their previous games great, but for the most part, this doesn&apos;t affect the majority of people who have internet. Besides, if enough people complained, i&apos;m sure blizzard would give out LAN. They usually listen to their fans. I don&apos;t know where people get off saying this is a 1/3 of a game. Sure they focus only on one race, but with 30 missions, that&apos;s the amount of missions in the first starcraft. And why are people complaining about expansion packs? Blizzard has ALWAYS had expansion packs. Has anyone else complained about blizzard milking the francise with brood war. I&apos;d personally rather play one race straight on in one game with 30 missions than playing only 10 missions having to wait for the next expansion pack to to play the new missions. Blizzard wasn&apos;t going to give out 90 missions in one game, that would be overkill and it would have delayed the game until 2012. I doubt the fans would want that. So the quality of the content is perfect. DRM and LAN are really technical features. They don&apos;t really count as game content so there is no reason to rate down the game (especially to 1 star) because of this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356756">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Best single player RTS ever. I now understand why they broke it out into three separate releases. I can&apos;t wait for the next two! A worthy successor. The game stays very close to the original formula, but tightens it up and enhances. The story telling is well done and riveting. It has by far the most in depth storyline of any RTS i&apos;ve come across.</span>

Putting my excitement aside, i criticly spend a few hours of this game, and it is BRILLIANT. The main reason why this game deserves a 10/10 is because you can just see the amount of time put into this game! from the cutscenes, to different background pictures in every loading screen, to the interactive space between mission, it&apos;s brilliant!. There are some very minor issues: Gameplay isnt 100% &apos;smooth&apos; as i was used to from c&amp;c generals, but 80% with this gameplay is very fine too! I experienced some small bugs: sometimes when i start up for no reason at a random time i cannot click anything, and also: the alt-tab is very slow. These very minor ussues don&apos;t take away that this game has THE pure and perfected Starcraft RTS gameplay, with very good graphics and alot of time put into it. you get my 10/10 Blizzard!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356783">Expand</a></span>

Games have to be fun and this game is that. Everything about how this game is made, is so the player is truly enjoying the experience.

Ignore the couple of people who gave it a 0/10 rating because their PC is too slow to run it, system requirements aren&apos;t even that bad. Keeps everything that was great about SC1 and retains Blizzard&apos;s position as the world&apos;s premier RTS developer.</span>

If you actually played the single player you would have noticed that it is miles ahead what the orginal did. Great graphics, tons of upgrades, tons of stuff to toy around with, incredible attention to detail and a solid sequel to the first storyline. Now I know multiplayer isn&apos;t for everyone. Why? Cause it is over the top competitive. But that is why it&apos;s there. To offer to the people who will plow trough the single player a way to elevate their game and match themselves against other starcraft addicts. Don&apos;t be jealous because you can&apos;t play the game or because you are bad at it.

They are just QQ noobs who lost in 1v1 multi-player and are here to QQ and whine cause they suck at the game. This game is the best game to come out in the past 10 years and a worthy successor of Starcraft Broodwar. Be prepared for a competitive Multi-player however and a epic Single player.</span>

First and foremost this is a multilayer game, it is not for the weak as you will be crushed online. So be prepared to lose. But if you are prepared to learn and practice you will have the time of your life with this one. Multilayer retains all the qualities of the original Starcraft while polishing the interface even more. This is a perfect competitive RTS game. I have two gripes with the game though which is why it doesn&apos;t get the full 10 from me. Lack of LAN support may not be such a big issue except that because of the segregated region launch it is impossible to play the game with people from other continents. This limitation could have been resolved had blizzard included the LAN option (by use of a VPN or Ethernet bridge). For a game that is supposed to be the end all be all competitive RTS game it is a pretty serious omission to exclude LAN play. I understand the decision was motivated by the rampant piracy on PC but not including LAN does more to hurt paying legit customers then it will do to combat piracy. The other issue has to do with the privacy. Once you are on Battle.net there is no way to hide your gaming habits from your friends/family. If you invite someone to your battlenet messenger you can&apos;t go invisible. It is a pretty basic feature Blizzard failed to implement. Because you can only have one character on Battlenet you are pretty much forced to buy another game if you want to play ranked matches anonymously. I think $60 is a fair price for this game as it has a potential of providing countless hours of entertainment. Even the solid single player campaign, challenge system and achievements offer many hours of game play. The game lives up to the hype! For any RTS fan or a hard core gamer this game is a must have, despite it&apos;s issues which I hope will get resolved by Blizzard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1356966">Expand</a></span>

Oh, and terrans get very different equipment in Campaign mode, so when you switch over to multiplayer, you&apos;ve got to rethink all your strategies.

It is simply one of the best PC gaming experiences out there, ever.  With the &quot;selling out&quot; of many games to the more popular console system, there are very few companies left which truly devote the resources which the PC deserves above a console game.  Blizzard, along with a few other developers such as Sid Miers, are the last standing frontier of PC gaming out there.<br><br>The campaign from Wings of Liberty throws thirty-some missions at the player, with several additional mini-games or challenges thrown in the mix.  There are a plethora of achievements.  Although some users might complain that it&apos;s not &quot;complete&quot; since it only features thirty missions, the story and plot come to a climactic close, not just some cliff-hanger to sell the next expansion.<br><br>Graphics are good, but not anything great; Blizzard, for most part, caters to hard core gamers, except here, where they allowed WoL to run on a range of specs.  Music and sound effects are grade A, it doesn&apos;t sound recycled from the past game and the sounds as well as voices are unique to the units and the characters you meet throughout your adventures.<br><br>Multiplayer is what truly caters to the needs of the hard-core.  It&apos;s been intensively balanced, and has a new style of match making as well as a revamped Battle.net 2.0. Leagues and points systems attempt to ensure that players play against those of equal skill level or so, with the chance to play greater skilled opponents in order to promote into another league.  Starcraft 2 has a great community; as of now, much of the DotA company (rude and mean) has not moved over into Starcraft 2.  There are many new players who picked up the game who were dedicated WoW fans, but generally, they are mannered.  The forums, as well as spin-off fan sites, offer a plethora of ways to communicate with the community.  A rising phenomena is the commentary of the Pro-gaming series, as well as novice and amateur commentary of one&apos;s own replays, or replays of friends.  After the release of Starcraft 2, there was an increase in scamming and phishing attempts however.<br><br>As for cons, there is no LAN, but fortunately there is offline play.  You can have guests play on your computer, but only one battle.net account is allowed from a CD-Key.  Zerg is never handled by the player; this leaves many new players playing Terran in multiplayer.  You cannot change the set-up of the default keys (but there are four different sets including the original Broodwar setup) , but this is mainly to ensure an equal gaming environment.<br><br>In the end, if you are a PC gamer, it&apos;s almost unlikely that you&apos;ve never heard of Starcraft.  I suggest any PC gamer play this game, as it truly is the sequel to the best RTS of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1365185">Expand</a></span>

<br>one of the best RTS games I played lately. It is designed for players whp like fast action RTS games. I&apos;m a turtle player but still like the game. The graphics and sound are good. The single player story is good. The missions are fun to play and have divers goals (not every time kil everything on the map). The multiplayer is as good as the original.</span>

PROS:   Excellent game and a worthy successor to Starcraft 1.   It retains enough of the original Starcraft 1 look and feel so as to make you feel comfortable - and yet it is still different enough to be challenging and exciting.    Graphics are bigger, more detailed and sparkle, especially if you have a good video card (I use a 9800GT).    There are 29 missions overall and they are balanced excellent, always challenging, and the achievement system makes for great replay.    Also, many new units added for all races, other units have evolved, lots of new stuff to learn.   And you can rotate the game left and right a bit by pushing Insert &amp; Delete buttons - definitely a much more 3D look to the game.  Loved the plot, loved the cinematics.  A lot of work put into this title - the usual Blizzard level of quality.    CONS:   Why I didn&apos;t give a ten is because of the need to always be online to play this game.    I think maybe Blizzard has gone overboard in its efforts to stop piracy.   Playing this game is like when you play a game thru Steam.   Warning:  If you are playing the game and Battle.net goes down, be aware that you can only get achievements if you are connected to Battle.net.   And I wish they had allowed LAN play, but you can still play with friends or someone else at home thru Battle.net, you just create the game non-public and you each need your own battle.net account.   Hoping the next installments to this title won&apos;t be too expensive, and am sure they will be excellent campaigns also.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1370951">Expand</a></span>

New players may find it a bit daunting, and rts fans may complain that the little change in 12 years is nothing but a rehash, it is still a great multiplayer game. The strategies in 1v1s are very diverse, and the old school system may be hard to learn, but really interesting once you&apos;ve mastered it. The new unit additions add more depth, or revamp some of the lacking choices and opportunities of the factions that occured in Brood War.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1379008">Expand</a></span>

The missions are challenging, some very much so, and the growing stockpile of mercenaries and weapons allow for multiple and variable solutions to each episode.  The story line is compelling and the action is moved along by the A.I. fluidly.  Once play begins you are engrossed in completing the mission(s) and the hours slip by unnoticed.

The campaign is a well-crafted way to get into the story but maybe a little short (although alternative missions and achievements makes it a re-playable game). There is a great diversity of units with unique playing style for each race, so lots of strategy to try in Battlenet: the core of the game.<br>The criticisms I could make:  no out of the box possibility to play LAN so better have a good internet connection and then lots of trouble playing a multiplayer game online without constant lagging. Also I agree with those saying that the music, voice acting etc. could have been better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1994403">Expand</a></span>

The single player is fantastic, i really like how they set it up, so that really saves them for my score, but the multiplayer just doesn&apos;t seem as fun for me as the original...which is the only reason i docked a point.  i&apos;d give 8.5 if i could though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1388606">Expand</a></span>

I mean you all got to remember Starcraft was and still is one of their best works there wasn&apos;t a real need to change much. The graphics alone is what people wanted out of Starcraft and Broodwar. And not to mention Blizzard sets standards to the highest and makes games that don&apos;t need tons and tons of patches. All those that give the game less than a 7 need to realize you put your standards too high. Why recreate the wheel on this beautiful game? ALL RTS&apos;s are just about the same no matter what. Look at all the Diablo games not much changed from Diablo to Diablo 2 or that matter of Diablo 2 LOD. Diablo 3 is going to be just about the same just better graphics, new characters, and maps. Starcraft 2 Wings of Liderty should get at least a 7 but I give it a 9 for the fact its beautifuly made flawless and the few new things it brings to the table for other RTS&apos;s out there need to compete with. Blizzard is the best company out there hands down and I barely play anyother games out there from other companies. In fact I want to work for Blizzard once I get out of collage because I want to set a new bar with RPG&apos;s/MMORPG&apos;s. Blizzard themselves ARE THE BEST!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390200">Expand</a></span>
