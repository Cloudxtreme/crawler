<br>
<br>There are three campaigns that offer a great range of difficulty and good stopping points.
<br>
<br>The story in the first and last campaigns are not very intense, only bare bones enough to provide us with a reason to run and gun.  The second campaign&apos;s story actually offers some food for thought.  At most, the characters might make you giggle or gasp a few times.
<br>
<br>The menus could be considered hard to navigate (keyboard only), and weapon switching takes practice (both of these issues are fixed on the phone version, highly recommended).  Aside from the control scheme, there is no unique take on the run&apos;n&apos;gunner here, which is only an issue if you want it to be.  A desire for upgrades could tempt a person to grind for points, but this is not required to be strong enough at the end of the game. Losing all lives means restarting an area, which means you will get a boost in upgrade points to balance the difficulty.
<br>
<br>The gameplay and art direction will likely be enough to pull most people through the game, and the flaws are so minor that this is only worth skipping if you&apos;ve got a similar game with a meatier story already on your to-play list.  (Then, when you are done with that, it is time to play this).
<br>
<br>Once again, the iOS version of this game is superior (that would get a ten) in every way, even benefiting more from the simple art style on a smaller screen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kero-blaster/user-reviews?user_review_id=6222821">Expand</a></span>
