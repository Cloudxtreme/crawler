You only get to pick the direction of movement and placement of a couple of cards when another card tells you to place them through RNG!!! lol. Worst waste of time I ever spent. Besides being RNG it also cheats in favor of the AI because it has no difficulty levels. While you do get some cards to change the outcome of the RNG the RNG is so set against you that you don&apos;t get very many chances to change to die in your favor. So, you basically lose the die roll before it ever begins.
<br>
<br>Now, if you like wasting time then you might like this game. It has no real since of adventure though since basically the quest cards you should pick should be the ones you can do the fastest. The one who finishes 3 quests the fastest most always wins anyways. So, that the game is over the the one with the most quest points wins hardly ever take effect over the one who finishes 3 quests first.
<br>
<br>Nobody is playing multiplayer and the game is basically dead on Steam. It can&apos;t even mount the 300 players per hour needed to get on Steamstats.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-adventure-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=5956283">Expand</a></span>
