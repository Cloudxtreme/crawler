<br>Slow start but a great finish
<br>Observer is an about 6 and a half hr long cyberpunk styled psychological horror  game where you play as detective Daniel Lazarski investigating an apartment building after he gets a call from his son adam, you spend the rest of the game trying to find out exactly what happened to your son and to the other murdered victims in this building..
<br>This game is developed by the same team that made one of my most favorite horror games of all time layers of fear, so I was extremely excited to try this one out
<br>and admittedly I was very disappointed in the games first half&#x2026;
<br>The first half to me felt like a door to door salesman simulator..
<br>youre just knocking on door after door until someone answers and you interrogate them to help you progress through the game
<br>Youre finding codes and throwing switched to access different areas and youll eventually find yourself investigating a crimescene, there are computers around with mini games within the game as well as documents to get you deeper into these characters, but this is where you do batman style scanning of the items at the crime scene trying to figure out exactly what happened to the victim
<br>but you can take getting information a step further
<br>you play as an observer.. youre able to plug into minds and see a distorted reality of your target to get answers buried deep in their conscious and subsconsious through a chip they have in their head, which is found by scanning them..
<br>these moments arewhere the game becomes great,
<br>a lot of puzzles and mind tricks and survival horror , shifting rooms much like the layers of fear games&#x2026;
<br>and each one offers an intriguing and unique experience, stopping it from feeling repetitive like the investigator part of the game
<br>I didn&#x2019;t necisarily find this game to be scary, but its definitely unsettling..
<br>and once you reach the end of that characters story things are blurry and you have to take a pill&#x2026; this happens as you wander around the building for too long as well..
<br>im not really sure the point of this mechanic.. its just makes the game ugly, choppy, and hard to look at.. but it&#x2019;s a thing and you have to look for these pills around the rooms.. but then youre back to being a door to door salesman..
<br>until finally youre not anymore..
<br>theres one final door to door section underground which is where I ran into the only bug during my play time where the night vision wouldn&#x2019;t click off, thankfully this was fixed by backing out into the menue and coming back into the game&#x2026;
<br>but the 2nd half of the game is very linear and is like one giant chunk of the mind hacking stuff and its great..
<br>shifting rooms, illusions, questions, answers, monsters&#x2026;
<br>I much preferred going through these mind bending moments that made me fall in love with layers of fear so much&#x2026;
<br>I was worried with the initial direction the game was taking, but the brilliant story telling pulled me through to the good stuff
<br>Who knows, maybe you end up liking the door to door stuff and finding codes and investigating areas..
<br>I didn&#x2019;t.. and if you don&#x2019;t I promise you that its definitely worth getting through the slow drag of the games first half and dealing with all of its knocking on doors, puzzles and switches to get to its 2nd half..
<br>Bloober Team delivers again with a great psychological horror experience
<br>I give Observer
<br>a 7.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/observer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7470688">Expand</a></span>

It feels like you&apos;ve entered the sketchiest apartment complex you can imagine. The world that the devs created is bizarre, but surprisingly credible.  You really get the sense that all the advanced tech that you see had been hastily retrofitted on top of the crumbling husk of the modern world. The game also does a great job at exploring the possible (mostly negative) implications of cybernetics and technological advancement in general.
<br>
<br>My favorite parts of the game were simply when you are exploring the apartment complex and talking to the tenants. The conversations were very well done and the voice acting of Rutger Hauer creates an intriguing juxtaposition. I enjoyed the optional side-investigations as well. The neural interrogation sequences and the main storyline, while interesting, were not as engrossing as the other aspects of the game, in my opinion. Perhaps I need to think about those a little more before I can fully appreciate them.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think this is a fantastic game. I&apos;ve never played another game quite like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/observer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7488804">Expand</a></span>

<br>The major issue I had though, is that for such a well developed game with so much devotion, they couldn&apos;t have picked a worse voice actor for the main protagonist. His lines are delivered so lazily and in a monotonous voice that it kills immersion. Also having to stop in every 10 seconds to scan the area with every mode as to not miss anything kinda ruins the atmosphere and slows the flow.

<br>Looking forward to more from Bloober Team.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/observer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7616062">Expand</a></span>

It drags you from one cheap jumpscare to another (especially during the scenes where you rummage through other people&apos;s minds), hoping to somehow impress, but it fails miserably.
<br>
<br>There is no poetry combined with a brilliant soundtrack Blade Runner had, there is not deep theme to ponder about, it&apos;s an incredibly shallow show that in the end will give you only a headache from all the flashing lights.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s pretentious, it drags on without saying anything, it uses dark interiors and visual distortions to cover the fact that the levels and objects are lazily designed, and it has no meaningful gameplay.
<br>
<br>I understand why companies make walking simulators like this - it&apos;s cheaper, easier, there are no complex mechanics that must be debugged and balanced, but let&apos;s hope this style of games won&apos;t become the prevailing trend. It was so bad I did not even finish the game, which does not happen often.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/observer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7468812">Expand</a></span>
