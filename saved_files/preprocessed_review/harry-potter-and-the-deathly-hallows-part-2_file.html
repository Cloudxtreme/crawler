The best Harry Potter game has gone on sale in my opinion, good graphics, but unfortunately can not make the history in the game was longer when if they could.<br>My score is fair, and considering all the good and bad of this game, you think I did with my brain, I did not like those people who are putting a score so low, it is impossible to put less of 6 score.</span>

That is embarrassing short and that is not the worst part. Combat is broken and spells act like modern weapons and game looks like third person Call of Duty with spells like MG and sniper and your companions are slow and for opening the bloody door they need 10 minutes. You cant run trough levels anymore because then you could finish the game in 1 hour. For a full price of 49.99$ you get 2 hours of gameplay and nothing more: This game is another bad movie licence game. DO NOT BUY THIS IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1737374">Expand</a></span>

But I&#xB4;m furious wiith some critics out there, I mean they are in a war, would you expect exploring Hogwarts? If I remember Harry, Ron and Hermione weren&#xB4;t exploring Hogwarts, they were defending it. The game doest that very good, because when I played I felt that I was actually defending Hogwarts. I personally think that the game could have side-missions with common students defending Hogwarts, for example defending the Great Hall. Boss fights could be better (Voldemort is easier than Bellatrix), but they are all extremely easy for a game like this. The graphics are very good, but the voice acting could be better because Snape doesn&#xB4;t sound Snape, Voldemort doesn&#xB4;t sound like Voldemort. etc... I think ALL the actors should have voiced the game. So about the time, do you want a Harry Potter game to last 10 hours? This is not a RPG you know. The game follows the movie order of sequence so I think it would have been natural that the game would last 2 hours and 52 minutes. If this game would last 6 HOURS I wonder how would be the state of Hogwarts when the battle ended. If you want long game&#xB4;s you should play RPG&#xB4;S like Dragon Origins, I think that the developers could make a HP game
<br>with more than 6 hours, in my opinion this is one of the games that I most love, if you give ratings here lower than 3 I wonder wich rating would you give to RIDE TO HELL:RETRIBUTION, one of the worst games I&#xB4;ve ever seen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4396943">Expand</a></span>

This game did not even let you roam around like the previous games. Huge letdown for an ending of this game! Honestly the hp games were great from 1-3 and it just went downhill from there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5365256">Expand</a></span>
