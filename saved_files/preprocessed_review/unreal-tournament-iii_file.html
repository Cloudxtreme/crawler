Personally I like the arcade action and rediculous visuals, vehicles, NEW Titan super modes, as well as good solid gameplay modes that make this title stand out as an excellent game that I would recommend highly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=422396">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The most fast, bloody, scifi, colorful yet realistic first person shooter on the planet! Graphics and audio both never seen bfor in any other game. Im so impressed by the performance of this 3D engine. The maps... the game types. And now with patch v2.0 ad the titan pack... its HUGE! I love the new game types GREED and BETRAYL... its a whole new game!</span>

The rest is awesome !!!</span>

The big vehicles and maps are back with a bang including the classic toran map (my fav).</span>

And if you didnt like that, download custom maps... This game mainly focuses on online Multiplayer for longtime fun... Of course a 5 year old game runs stable on a 5 year old pc... Which you cant say of Unreal tournament 3.. Oh and the best FPS of all time is Half Life 2... Now to my opinion: This is by far one of the best shooters I ever played (well i care more about graphics than gameplay), only Crysis and Call of Juarez can top that... The vehicles are really fun to drive and the map design is really good. There are a lot of custom maps out there and mutators and mods... Even only play can sometimes be really frustrating its still an awesome game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=84433">Expand</a></span>

With the unreals usual habit of semi open-source available, there will no doubt be countless Mods made for this game, creating an even larger community than it will no doubt already have from the basic version will have to offer, and if UT99 online gaming is anything to go by then we can expect this game continuously played online for many years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=405759">Expand</a></span>

I like everything thats here, just wish there was some more. I like that I need health packs in UT3.

Team Fortress 2 lacks these as well though. All in all UT3 is a rich Multiplayer Fragger in the Ut99, some would say Quake 3, vein that does a good job of delivering a good update graphically to that system. Its fun+/- dodge jump and adrenaline.... which i always favored UT99 in the first place so I&apos;m fine with that. In fact I prefer it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=406908">Expand</a></span>

After playing it for some time, then going back to 2k4 without having played that for a while, I realized just how much they massively improved the gameplay. Especially in the Onslaught -&gt; Warfare change, which is arguably the best game mode in my opinion anyways. The Hoverboard makes it much more bearable to be dismounted, and makes it more viable. Vehicles have much better responsiveness, the Manta and Raptor handle more like fast attack craft than they did in 2k4. The nodebuster orb makes it possible to take a heavily defended node, but more importantly, much more easily defend a vital node that might be linked to two or more enemy nodes while your offense takes those down. Nodes are also much more robust (takes significantly less damage to kill them in 2k4), making one guy with a rocket launcher less able to turn the tide of the /entire fight/. There are a few issues where the graphical upgrades detract from gameplay however. I don&apos;t know if anyone else has this issue, but when I have Bloom enabled on a map like Torlan, I cannot see anything in the sky, which makes it impossible to find that f***ing Raptor that&apos;s sniping you. Which is a shame, because the Bloom looks so nice otherwise. It&apos;s a bad comprimise, additional beauty at the cost of gameplay solidarity. All in all, it&apos;s very fast paced, and rarely any time goes by between you and finding some dudes to blast into small meaty chunks -- and the gameplay has been greatly refined from previous titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=422755">Expand</a></span>

They never have breaks and they are saying un relevant or even untruth things. But else this game is so awesome!</span>

With a little something for everyone - from fast and furious DM play, to the more vehicular-based Warfare - it&apos;s a must-have shooter for any fan of the series, and any FPS fan looking for a little more action for his buck.</span>

UT2004 was one of the best frag fests of all time, a perfect blend that I still play to this day, and I never have trouble finding servers, there&apos;s tons of them in fact. UT is one of the greatest game series of all time, show some respect.</span>

Annoying weapons such as spidermines and grenade launcher have been taken out, thank god. This game is definitely worth a look into (if you have a high end computer). It&apos;s a lot like the first UT, but with weapons and better visuals.

It was, to be honest, a same-old, console oriented, flashy pile of crap. I would have still played it, however, if the community didn&apos;t (understandably) die quickly. In a matter of weeks it was uninstalled, and I was back to ut2004, presuming this game dead and gone forever. For all of you who were like me, I&apos;d recommend reinstalling the game again. With the release of 2.0 and the Titan pack, Unreal Tournament 3 Black is now what Unreal Tournament should have been out of the box, and, thanks to Steam picking it up and advertising the hell out of it (and selling it for cheap), it&apos;s got new life in its lungs and a fresh, energized community behind it. The game is still not perfect and will probably never replace the high flying thrill ride ut2004 once was for me. I&apos;d still recommend any First-Person-Shooter fanatic (even ones that were once hurt by this game) to give it (another) chance.You very well may find it growing on you. An excellent recovery in my book, as of so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=422764">Expand</a></span>

But what the over-expecting zealots we have, the stunning quality, the reliable game play, and all the glorious fragging we all have come too love, all become bogged under with the same complaints we have seen over and over again. UT was already great in game play, and had little too be added. So with that all that&apos;s left for the engine is what now? Graphic improvements. So with that they improved them, and continued too do so. They added more little things also. Vehicles, the bored, and minor tweaks that make the game play run smoother. Although it does seem that the game runs slower on lower end computers, it is still playable by far and will still give an enjoyable experience. Although some hard-core fans of the game may be turned off by the lack of new content/game-play, most of them will come back, bringing new comers to the fray, thus extending the life time of UT even more so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=84824">Expand</a></span>

I like the fast pace of this game, its fun, can still be tactical if u want it to be. I love the music score, I crank the music up in this game, its part of the &apos;full on&apos; experience. I&apos;ve been playing COD4, Crysis and this, all good games, I tend to laugh most and get fired up playing UT 2007. I like the fact they&apos;ve done new maps, I do miss facing worlds, however its good to get the old UT die hards out of their comfort zone. Should be some good mods out for it too, and once installed you don&apos;t need the disk, what a brilliant idea, they did it with 2004 as well, why don&apos;t other people do this? This game gets a thumbs up from me, Would be a 10 id it was a little more original, but hey I&apos;m loving playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=406455">Expand</a></span>

Just look at the wide arrange of warfare maps. They all work and play differently, surprising you every time when you first play it in campaign mode. The game got I hoverboard now; I didn&apos;t like it the first time I heard about it, but now I actually play the game, I really liked it. Compared to UT2004, i guess i can say that there isn&apos;t walking huge distances without vehicles anymore, which keeps the game very swift and quick. I was amazed how different the maps are from each other even though they are in the same game mode. Every map needs a total new strategy. This makes it a very original and good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1458080">Expand</a></span>

Its incredible much better than UT2004, UT2003 and UT99. Very nice graphic, hundrets of hidden tricks and specials, idiotic dodge-jump removed, warfare game mode introduced with orb. Seriously: Its the best game you can get for your bucks.</span>

And dont forget: There is a free Addon &quot;black edition&quot; with the Titan-pack and new maps and 2 new game modes, all for free. This makes the game really special.</span>

Part of the brilliance and charm of UT2k4, and UT (and I am sure the rest of the series, though I haven&apos;t played them) is the UNREAL appearance. The vibrant appearance was forsaken for a dark, hazy look that just doesn&apos;t feel like a UT game. The maps are indeed beautiful, but that&apos;s hardly a consolation when the effort to render them dampens performance. Play feels sluggish, the appearance of everything has been drastically altered, and perhaps most egrigious of all- single player has been forced into a wretched and inescapable storyline [which completely defeats the point of the &quot;Tournament&quot; part of the title. To be consistent with the past, the game should simply be &quot;Unreal 3&quot;- for Unreal and Unreal 2 were both story based like this].</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=422384">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve started playing UT3 only recently, some 4 years after the game was released and I&apos;d be lying if I say I don&apos;t have a blast with it. This is just the UT I&apos;ve wanted, UT2004 gameplay/vehicle in UT99 speed (UT2004 is slightly faster paced than UT99); with all upgraded graphic glory and such. Granted that it looks quite dated in 2011, but still a huge improvement compared to UT2004. It runs fantastically on modern hardware (I&apos;m using HD5770 + Phenom II x4 3.4ghz - a mid-range machine at best today), maxed out at 60fps all the time, with all settings cranked to highest. Shame that it doesn&apos;t support AA thou.
<br>
<br>Gone is the vibrant, colorful graphics of UT99/2004. UT3 is dark and gory, it looks a bit too similar to Gears of War, but frankly I don&apos;t have problem with that. It&apos;d be a lot more boring if it looks too UT2004. My only complain with the game is its bot AI. For some reasons, the AI is noticeably worse than UT99/2004. They get stuck frequently; they are silly, sometimes downright clueless in vehicular combat. Vehicular bot AI in UT2004 isn&apos;t stellar, but UT3&apos;s is worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1907218">Expand</a></span>

If you have, I don&apos;t follow your logic, because I can&apos;t find anything much to like about this game. Firstly, the graphics scalability is truly terrible, if that was the only problem, then big deal, sometimes you need an incentive to play a good game, and if UT3 was good, then this would be a relatively minor issue. However, the gameplay is not good. For the single player we have the campaign and instant action. If you&apos;re prepared to fight through the tournament ladder like every previous installment of UT, then I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re going to be disappointed. Instead you&apos;re going to be treated to some kind of war, complete with aliens. &quot;But wait&quot; said someone on the committee who were tasked with designing &quot;how on earth does this make any sense with Unreal Tournament?&quot;. This person was fired, and development continued. Now, I&apos;m not a developer myself, but I do know something about dictionaries. Just to see if I wasn&apos;t mistaking myself, I then looked up tournament on wikipedia. I came up with this definition &quot;A tournament is a competition involving a relatively large number of competitors, all participating in a sport or game.&quot; - does this storyline fit that criteria? No. But hey, what do I know. I digress, the &quot;campaign&quot; is basically an angst-driven kid who hates someone because she tried to kill him, so he goes off on a crusade to kill her, will he have successes? Who Knows? Who Cares? Next time, remove the pre-rendered cutscenes and let&apos;s just have a tournament. I&apos;ve spent a good amount of time ranting about this game, and havn&apos;t got to the gameplay. Most of the weapons are there from previous titles, you won&apos;t find anything new - some have been tweaked a bit, the redeemer and impact hammer are back from UT99, and adrenaline has been removed (a mixed blessing, kill streaks are almost meaningless now, whilst before you were rewarded for doing well). There are more &quot;super powerups&quot; (berserk is now a pickup, for example) and other various things that could probably easily be performed with mutators on 2k4. Nothing feels better, quite a lot feels worse. The bot AI is horrible, on the single player, you often need to get about 4 or 5 times the number of kills than your bot friends to win. Almost certainly - you will be the one pulling the weight, capturing the flag, attacking their base, etc. At launch, UT3 came with 3 gamemodes. There was deathmatch (Including team deathmatch,and duel - which is deathmatch for 2 players at a time), Capture the Flag (most of the maps were vehicle capture the flag, which means hoverboards, which means the worst design choice ever, having a 3rd person view on a first person shooter), and Warfare (a cut down version of onslaught, which is heavily &quot;orb central&quot; - this is not an improvement, apparently it&apos;s meant to incorperate elements from assault, but these aren&apos;t really noticeable in any way, just an occasional side-objective). 2 more were added later, Greed (a toned-up version of a custom gamemode for 2k4), and Betrayal (Instagib death-match with a small twist, you can &quot;betray&quot; allies to claim a &quot;pot&quot; of shared kills, fun - but not much to write home about). That&apos;s it, notice that there&apos;s no Bombing Run, Domination (of either kind), Assault, Invasion or Last man standing. Whilst there are some good new maps, most of the maps that you know and love are gone (there&apos;s no Facing Worlds, the Deck remake doesn&apos;t really feel like any of the other Deck maps, and I actually felt offended when I started to play Torlan, due to what they&apos;d done to it). The AI in this title are horrible, I was hardly able to use the rocket launcher in 2k4, because of the fact that most of the AI dodged the projectiles, and therefore other weapons were more effective. In UT3, the rocket launcher makes it&apos;s triumphant return, as you blow enemies to smithereens who can&apos;t dodge at all. Friendly AI is just as bad, with your teamates dying whilst trying to regroup in TDM, and causing you to lose as a result (when you are forced to lower your difficulty settings even though you&apos;re scoring 5 times as much as any of your team members, we have a problem). Overall, do not buy this game, instead - have a look at the exceptionally good Unreal Tournament 2004. There are plenty of good mods and maps for it, and you&apos;ll have a game that uses a colour palliate that is better than &quot;grey, brown and brown disguised as red&quot;. An unfortunate departure for the series, and I&apos;m truly sorry if this is your first UT game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=742409">Expand</a></span>

Unreal Tournament and Unreal Tournament 2004 had really good single player and multiplayer content.  Epic games dropped the pooch this time around.  The single player campaign was awful.  They tried to put a storyline to a tournament style game and take away the tournament and just make it a war with respawners.  Whoever thought of that should have been axed.  The guns felt difficult to kill with. Their earlier games made it so easy to kill someone, this game took a ton of bullets and the guns just didn&apos;t have the same feel.  The game speed didn&apos;t feel right, you move really fast and you shoot really slow.  The system requirements were too extreme for the time it was released, and the game engine did not scale like their UE2 or the original engine did.<br><br>The game did have some good parts.  I really liked the hoverboards and graphics, once I got everything working right.  Having co-op for the campaign is also a plus, although I never played it through with other peeps.  The Unreal Tournament  series has the coolest vehicles to use.  What I was hoping for was more of the Assault mode, which somehow got scratched.  This game is just not Unreal Tournament worthy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1389834">Expand</a></span>

Good graphics are pretty much its only merit. For everything Epic fixed in regards to UT2004 (ie no shield gun, no adrenaline, more close-quarter maps, etc.), they screwed up or left out 10 other things. The player counts are TERRIBLE! There&apos;s about 300 people playing at peak times on the weekend and only about 100-200 otherwise (in the US). The majority of the available players will be spread across 2-4 servers with player limits too high for proper gameplay, so you can pretty much forget about normal TDM/CTF games. GameSpy integration is the most pointless and stupid thing Epic has done. Oh, and for single-player people, the campaign is an absolute joke with terrible voice acting! VCTF and ONS were made worse with their changes. Warfare is nothing but Orbfare and both gametypes are less fun compared to UT2004&apos;s versions. All focus in the new ONS is on the orbs and it really screws things up. The lack of Assault really annoyed me. The weapons and mouse input system feel off somehow, the sniper and shock especially. As usual Epic&apos;s netcode fails completely in comparison with other companies&apos; and it really makes the game a spamtacular &quot;Where&apos;s the ammo?!?&quot; festival. After being very into past UTs, I uninstalled UT3 and I can&apos;t imagine reinstalling it for any reason. I have never uninstalled a UT game before this one; they have always provided me with fun and enjoyment. UT3 did not. I wish I could get my money back. Don&apos;t waste your time with this one!

Yes, it&apos;s visually stunning, but removing most of the greatest game-play features from 2004 was like putting a bolt in a calf&apos;s brain. Where is Assault, Bombing Run, and Double Domination? Those were staples of the last iteration. Playing this game makes me sad.</span>

CTF continued to be a disaster with the limited trans and missing fundamentals that made UT99 CTF so great. The interface, in game browser, and hundreds of bugs made the play experience of this game a negative memory. The game only sold 33,000 in it&apos;s first month... and there&apos;s a reason for that.

But I could get this game to work all fine in my other PC with an Intel CPU. No leaning left/right, can crouch but no prone. Nothing much new from UT2004 may be? Except the graphics and models looked more nicer. The bots are running very very fast and I hates it when they&apos;re doing it real close up like a fast forward video at play! So without a fast rig you ain&apos;t going to enjoy this game. I don&apos;t like the old familiar weapons, so much alike to the Halo game&apos;s projectiles, well most of them are based from UT2004! No remote bombs or mines like the ones from the other game F.E.A.R. or flashbangs and smoke grenades from Rainbow Six Vegas 2. When they name the difficulty levels, they better name them as difficulty level 1 to 9, please do not utter words such as ExperienceD.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1659034">Expand</a></span>

Need at least a 17 inch monitor or even bigger, as the bots are too small to shoot at from a far fart away distance, but they has no problems shooting at me from that distance without using a sniper scope? Hate to drive those vehicles, so bored of them, look and feel so toy like, yes it&apos;s rated R16+ too perfect for that! Hot fast action shooter, I love it! But there&apos;s nothing more to it, I might go back playing UT2004 instead of getting used to the newer gun models &amp; much more faster running speeds (much harder to kill bots). Buy this game if you want more new maps to play on. Some maps now has the brighter (bloom) and darker shaded spots here and there all in a small area, or almost everywhere with those super bump mappings and post filterings of sun-glowing foggings (I feel sea sick already), I could barely taget the super fast running bots with all those effects on. Some game settings does not stick after quiting the game to Windows&apos; desktop, needed to set and change them on every start of the game (is this a free demo game?). It also nags me to login online on on every start of the game, can&apos;t they just give the option of loading the game into the offline game menu each time? This game told me that my AMD Sempron 3100+ does not met the minimum CPU requirement, why can&apos;t they just shut up and ask me if it&apos;s been overclocked from 1.8Ghz to 2.16Ghz? And it&apos;s performance is at least as good as a 2.8Ghz Pentium IV on all the games released from year 2005 to 2009 even if the CPU isn&apos;t overclocked. How many games installs a CPU driver for you without asking you first? Or not asking you if you&apos;re happy with your CPU clock or not after getting the new driver installed?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1659783">Expand</a></span>

I was totally duped, and despite that my system well-exceeded the minimum specifications, the game was simply unplayable online. Looking out into any open area yielded frame rates in the single digits. Oddly enough, it didn&apos;t matter what resolution or other settings I modified. I spent a couple evenings tweaking settings and looking for answers on the forums, until I realized many, many others were complaining of the exact same thing on Epic&apos;s own forums. Bottom line, don&apos;t bother with this game without a dual core processor and mid to high end graphics card. Yes, as others have stated, the servers are empty and that&apos;s a very big problem. UT lives and dies with the online experience. I think by cutting out the low end and move-up gamers, they killed half their player base from day 1. You simply can&apos;t make an online game that doesn&apos;t include the mid-low end as potential players. And the only chance they had to get away with a move like that would have been to deliver something so groundbreaking that people couldn&apos;t help but upgrade (like oh, Call of Duty 4). Yet as has also been beaten to death, UT 3 feels like a face-lift for the most part. Bottom line, the combination of stiff hardware requirements, a really bad interface (which I didn&apos;t even address since it&apos;s been covered so extensively) and a whole lot of nothing when it comes to online participation and you quickly get to the point of &quot;why bother&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=412890">Expand</a></span>

Be prepared for random freezing and frequent system lockups. Unresolved stability issues plague this game and have become even more unbearable since the 2.0 patch, 2.1 patch, and Titan Map Expansion. Bot AI is far below the standards of the Unreal Tournament 2004 release. The campaign mission briefing screen still has known unresolved sound stuttering and popping issues. Online play is even more unstable hence server populations are incredibly low save for bots. An Epic failure to resolve these issues lingers to this day over 20 months after release. Although the textures and models of this game look stunning the color palate is very bland and dull. Be advised the Unreal Tournament 2004 Editors Choice release is by far the best ever of the Unreal series and a far nicer looking and stable game. UT2004 still holds the title of the best FPS of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=83229">Expand</a></span>

Note that by most of the time the bots would choose to shoot at you first even though you&apos;re more farther away for targeting, as you&apos;re priority target number one, so imagine with all those bots&apos; guns firing at you all at once ... that&apos;s great fun for me (only if you don&apos;t scream in rage because you feel like the bots has cheated and are gang banging you).

Whether you want a large battlefield or small arenas, this game can offer you that. There&apos;s lots of weapons, a few vehicles and fast-paced arena gameplay, with a platoon of game settings you can tweak, including the speed. There&apos;s many difficulties for the bots, and settings you can adjust for them. But really, once you get past all of this there&apos;s nothing that exciting about it. The campaign doesn&apos;t feel like one because of the arena-based gameplay. The gameplay is the most simple you can possibly get. No reloading, no recoil. Just move and shoot. The maps on it aren&apos;t greatly varied either. There&apos;s better shooters out there than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1790937">Expand</a></span>

They&apos;ve succeeded on many fronts. It has fantastic graphics and environments and very nicely thought out levels. The vehicles are surprisingly innovative and very functional while also not totally overpowering those on foot. Each vehicle seems to have one or more special and innovative functions. Vehicle CTF is great fun. Warfare is quite nice. The environmental sounds a very nice, but the weapon and player movement sounds are just OK. The voice taunts I find awful and childish and I turn them off with the volume slider. The game plays reasonably smoothly on a good server, with minimal to no jerky movement of other players as they move around the map. One condition I put on that is something that is intentionally put into the game that I don&apos;t like - the bunny hopping frenzy. I&apos;ve never seen a FPS game with such extreme bunny hopping. It makes hitting your opponent very difficult and makes the game feel very frantic at times. This isn&apos;t the kind of multiplayer FPS that is very relaxing because of the frantic and constant bunny hopping. Yes also the user interface (fixed in patch soon, so we hear) is very clunky and unfriendly. Also what makes UT3 great are the modding tools available and the fantastic tutorials included in the collectors edition. Has there ever been a closed-source FPS game that supports modding more than UT3? To my knowledge, no. I think UT3 got a bad rap from PC gamer fans and thats unfortunate because there&apos;s a really great game in there. Its not perfect either, of course. Oh, the team CTF mode is a nice addition however I don&apos;t like the translocator. You shoot at your opponent and they disappear. It&apos;s a cheezing or outright cheating feature that is put in there for everyone to use. A good translocator user is almost impossible to hit from my limited UT3 CTF gameplay. Give me a Quake1 grapple over that awful translocator please! Overall I find UT3 quite arcadish in feel, but it does not make me laugh hard like Quake1 did (my favorite old-school fps). I skipped UT2004 because the vehicles moved and felt very fake compared to BF1942 but UT3&apos;s vehicles feel much better. There are so many good FPS games out now that I find it hard to say UT3 blows away the competition. It doesn&apos;t. It is however a very good game and surprisingly innovative and different (old school improved and reinvented).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=409171">Expand</a></span>

Naysayers, move aside - UT3 is an absolutely gorgeous representation of its earlier kin. Somehow, the graphics, details, and tweaks make this game seem somehow fresh even after all these years. Do not misunderstand me, however - this is pretty much UT2004 wrapped in a shiny, new package. But, lack of truly fresh content aside, is there really any problem with a new UT2004? Sure, maybe there is a cheesy, half-hearted storyline and a crew of completely forgettable characters, but the formula still works after all these years - and that&apos;s what makes UT3 a worthy purchase. Buy it. Play it.

                                        <span> This is the worst version of UT to date, this game may well sound the death nell for the UT series. Many, Many people are not happy with it. Sure it will sell well, they&apos;ll make there money, but will it get the play time? Any game can sell well, look at the Sims, but sales figures don&apos;t make a good game, like UT2004, this will flop on the servers after a short time. R.I.P UT</span>

UT3 redefines nothing and is basically an expansion pack for the old games with a few tweeks and a graphics upgrade.

For some reason you thought big sales in consoles meant you made a good game so you could do the same on PC. Unfortunately for those more particular in their choice of game this is not enough.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=421890">Expand</a></span>

OK so lets run through the game and see why i&apos;ve come to this conclusion. Good Points: - VERY GOOD graphics (think BIOSHOCK sytle) - Nice new weapon design, and kept the favourites (sniper rifle, flack cannon, etc.) - Cool new vehicles Bad Points: - Rubbish single player campaign, some god awfull story about the killing of your family and a race called the Necris (FTW). - Lost weapons (lightning gun, grenade launcher, spider-mine gun, etc.) - Lost game modes (Assault, bombing run, domination, etc.) - Nothing to do with the &quot;tournament&quot;, your team is actually a rebel army, theres no money, prizes or fans involved. - Theres about 8 charecters in total in the game - Your team is non-negotiable - There is vertualy no customisable elements within the game, aside from your user name - The charecter graphics and world graphics look like theyve been copy&apos;d and paste&apos;d from gears or war (how fu*king cheap) - Online play and stats system is terable - Outslaught has been turned in to a pile of sh*te now known as &quot;warfare&quot; I don&apos;t petend to know it all, however these things lead me to give it this score.

They managed to completely blow ten years of experience. Not only is there a huge disparity between bot performance in warfare mode and deathmatch, but most of the time, the opposing team is just way stronger by default for seemingly no reason at all. I like to be immersed in a battle where I am an important part of the team, but I shouldn&apos;t have to quadruple the highest scoring player on my team other than myself just to win the match. These bots are so stupid that I&apos;ve seen groups of them driving and getting stuck in walls. I&apos;ve watched, sadly, as I nuke the crap out of them in their idiocy (on &quot;Adept&quot; difficulty). Even better, I love when idiots on my team grab the sphere, an all-important power to gaining territory on warfare maps, and then proceed to get stuck, voiding any chances we might have had at winning. Of course, friendly fire is off in the campaign, so I can&apos;t even take care of the situation myself. Fantastic. 2.) The maps are interesting and varied. I like that. But I absolutely HATE the look of the new characters. You can be a fat dwarf chick, a fat dwarf dude, a fat dwarf lizard, or a fat dwarf robot. I found this to be annoying, because I don&apos;t particularly want to be a fat dwarf ANYTHING. X( This form of style inconsistency with other UT games is frustrating to me. The reason many people have been saying this looks a lot like Gears of War is because it almost looks like textures, content, and even character facial appearances have been re-used in this game. They are using the same engine, of course; but the main characters also look strikingly similar. 3.) as a person has already mentioned, hardly anyone is even playing. I think there are more people playing UT classic, as I hopped on that last night and was surprised to see so many people. 4.) I can&apos;t stand the amount of lens blur that is added when turning detail settings any bit above the first setting. I love the HDR and stuff, but I can&apos;t see what is happening a long ways away and I feel like I&apos;m playing it on a PS3 when it is on. 5.) Speaking of which...this game feels like a frickin&apos; port. The menus are clumsy and stupid and less usable than the original UT&apos;s or even UT2k4. I am VERY mad at this. It seems like they made this game for consoles FIRST and it is unacceptable to me. It wouldn&apos;t take long to redesign a menu. Overall, I am still angry with my purchase. I should have looked at reviews. This is the last time I&apos;m getting burned by placing loyalty in a sequel. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=408836">Expand</a></span>
