<br>4x is there but much shallower than games like Galciv or Civilizations. Even Stellaris and Star Ruler offered more 4x content than this game. City building is not its strong point.
<br>
<br>RTS elements are available during combat. Its actually pretty fun but gets old real quick. Its very slow due to how many hit points everything has and how little damage units do especially early in the game. I like the army management but I wish battles would go faster. You can simulate battles but that takes the fun out of the RTS but after about 2 hours of playing I really cringed at fighting battles because they simply take too much time. You also cannot customize races, factions, heroes or anything like that.
<br>
<br>RPG elements exist similar to many 4x games like Fallen Enchantress or Endless Legend. In this game you recruit heroes (and lords) but the problem is there is little variation between them resulting in everyone being a generic carbon copy of each other. Once your army is large, it literally feels like the heroes are all generic and just another unit taking the charm out of the idea of heroes and RPG  advancement. As for story, forget it. The story is super generic and dull and there is practically zero character development. Dont buy this looking for a good story.
<br>
<br>Overall I would say this game is slightly above average and I strongly suggest that they focus on  one element in the future and push it to give the game some character. Otherwise the game is simply too generic and too similar to everything else that has come out the last 15 years. I cant think of a single feature that was unique in this game and after playing 3 campaigns I have zero interest in ever playing it again. Heck I didnt even want to finish the campaigns after 100 turns so I did have to push myself a bit despite boredom.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7643164">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To the game.
<br>Some mechanics feel really odd. Im not going into too much detail, but when you reach the end game - ( lil spoiler? ) enemies can just pay money to spawn an army to tear down your cities involved in the Ritual.
<br>
<br>It is just not interactive.. and the excuse &quot;Well its Magic&quot; does not make it any less frustrating.
<br>
<br>To be honest.. It probably makes the balancing better overall cause at some point in the game you are just going to steamroll the hell out of anyone who get&apos;s in your way.. but i would prefer something like, &quot;If you get to a certain degree of possessed power everyone turns on you&quot;. They could unite against you.. and it would make sense to unite against an overwhelming force that threatens to take over everything.
<br>
<br>But just paying money.. to send an army is not fun.. not for the one that pays neither for the one who may get blown up.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t even make such bad experiences with it.. It made the game closer and harder, which I always enjoy.. but in a way that didn&apos;t make sense to me.
<br>
<br>Maybe it was the fact that I only played on hard.. but the AI was pretty lackluster too.
<br>
<br>Units just getting stuck behind their own troops causing them to not fight till the warriors in front of them die.
<br>
<br>I once won a fight with the prediction of only like 10%-15% winning.. and that causes me to not really feel like being in danger most of the time..
<br>
<br>Maybe I should try an even harder difficulty. But what I experienced is that with harder difficulty the only thing that changes until the break point of becoming an unstoppable force is that I need to wait long times to stabilize economy. Just passing turn for turn to get to the next step and the next step.
<br>Which I personally blame the low amount of buildings to choose from for.
<br>
<br>There is only one building that makes the citizens happier. Often I had to build only this one building in every city I conquered. It just isn&apos;t the diversity that I have been loving in other Total War games.
<br>
<br>To this date I think that shogun was the best one. Though not as big in troop diversity which is obviously easier to achieve for a fantasy game.
<br>
<br>It had a really nice balance in buildings to choose from as far as I can remember.
<br>
<br>The Maelstrom was kind of cool.. and kind of annoying.. again part wise cause you often had to teleport to a fight, just because it was on the other side of the map.. but that caused you to never really being punished.. I wouldve enjoyed it more to maybe having to send a spy or any kind of special unit to the other rituals.. maybe having like 10 round&apos;s to do so..
<br>
<br>and my last point to make is, that I didn&apos;t like having just like 8 characters and only 4 factions to choose from.. pretty disappointed with that as well..
<br>
<br>but I heard that the devs are planning on bringing the map and factions of the first and the second installment of TW Warhammer together as a bigger Campaign option.. looking forward to that.
<br>
<br>Thanks for reading if anyone made it through. :P

I read the people who gave this a zero because the DLC for Blood &amp; Gore isn&apos;t up yet; others for a 5 for saying they auto-resolved everything and didn&apos;t understand the Total War series in general. Look, this is exactly what you want in a Total War game--if you play the series, you know what to expect and Creative Assembly delivers in a significant way.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s Part II of a trilogy and this is a vast improvement over WH1, most notably you can declare war geographically on whomever you&apos;d like, i.e. you are not pinned into warring with certain factions. Also, WH2 made spells feel more cohesive, more powerful. For example you can rotate your wind spells now. The effects and animations are simply gorgeous. Rat Ogres pick up foes and slam them down. Hydras can throw an enemy in the air and completely devour it, the combat animations are great.
<br>
<br>Trade and diplomacy are typical with the Total War series and I&apos;ve heard, &quot;Hey this isn&apos;t total PEACE, it&apos;s total WAR,&quot; I understand that.  I wouldn&apos;t mind a little more opportunity to trade in this one, just to uptick my economy and yes, I don&apos;t want to be a financial accountant in this either, I want to use good tactics and squash my enemies. As such, you&apos;ll be rewarded for using strategy on the field.
<br>
<br>The combat itself -- I don&apos;t understand the complaints about people who &quot;blob up&quot; their units and then complain. You still need to know how combat works -- you get bonuses for flanking, hitting units from the back, and using terrain to your advantage. If you just want to click once, then this game, and the Total War series is not for you.  They have a new command to wheel units around and flank, but you&apos;ll still have to micromanage your army.  But don&apos;t worry if you are overwhelmed, you can hit pause, adjust your units, re-form your lines, and position your spellcasters.
<br>
<br>The even better news is:  the best is yet to come.  More factions, more DLC, and the community workshop mods.  If you&apos;re someone who gave this a zero because you&apos;re DLC is not out yet, then you&apos;re a poster child for birth control.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7593576">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Skaven are very fun to play for me, I really like using their special abilities. Also, what other strategy game lets you command a battlefield of rat-people in real time?!
<br>
<br>Performance was... well not great for my computer. Some of my friends play on 10fps and don&apos;t mind. But if you tweak your graphics settings you can get it above 30 FPS in battles and campaign. They have a slider for resolution scale, and if you&apos;re ok with the blurry effects, you can get your framerate up to 60 running at half resolution. I&apos;m running at 85% resolution scale and the difference isn&apos;t noticeable, but the framerate increase is. It&apos;s really crucial to turn down terrain and unit detail to low if your computer can&apos;t handle the game. Unit count ultra actually isn&apos;t too bad if your unit detail is down.
<br>
<br>One thing that I think could have been done better is the auto-resolve system. As I&apos;ve progressed into late-game, I&apos;ve only fought critical battles. I don&apos;t know what the solution to this would be, maybe you can only auto-resolve one battle per turn or something.
<br>
<br>I think it&apos;s fair to say there&apos;s not a huge amount of new design from the first game, for people who played that. But since I didn&apos;t play the first one, I&apos;ve been having a great experience. I&apos;m not getting that &apos;samey&apos; feeling a lot of the fans might get.
<br>
<br>All in all a fantastic game. It&apos;s not without its flaws, but if you have some patience it delivers an engrossing, enjoyable experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7565648">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Bringing in several more of the iconic races of the Warhammer universe, the game has a more streamlined objective for all the races this time around: Capture certain settlements to generate ritual resource, start ritual once you have enough and defend 3 settlements determined by the ritual (usually your 3 largest). While the campaign&apos;s narrative is much more engaging than in the first one, not having personal victory conditions does hurt the experience a little bit. The initial missions you are given also hurt the experience a little bit for more advanced players, since you are encouraged to take a specific course of action when another course might prove better to you. The Queek campaign and Kroq-gar especially suffer from this.
<br>
<br>In terms of the campaign map, it is massive. It is so large, the mere thought of conquering it all will make your rat-whiskers tingle, your serrated blades restless, your flames roar and your primal instincts take over. Exploring the world is exciting, as one faces new factions, opportunities and enemies at every turn. This is further enhanced by the treasure mechanic at sea, the treasure hunting mechanic and the increased number of unique buildings available in specific regions in the world.
<br>On the other hand, the racing mechanic of the ritual combined with the huge map means you will most likely complete your first campaign without seeing two thirds of the map, which can feel frustrating after having built an empire ready to conquer it all. It will also somewhat limit the opponents you will fight, seeing as the races are primarily divided on the 4 continents. The mortal empires campaign will most likely solve this. Apart from that, it DOES improve replayability.
<br>
<br>The campaign interface has also had a bit of a fixer-upper, adding several quality of life improvements, such as an interface for camera control during other factions&apos; turns. No more having to closely follow neutral factions&apos; movements! Feelsgoodman.
<br>
<br>The battle mechanics have also been slightly improved, with more interesting abilities such as rampage introduced. Perhaps a little overly introduced as 3 out of 4 races now has an ability based on whether they are on 50% max health. Arrow physics have been majorly improved and can now have a more vertical trajectory. A small change, but one you will doubtlessly find compelling, coming from the first game.
<br>
<br>Army abilities have also been introduced and boy are they a blast to use. Summon more ratmen, invoke the power of the ancient plaques, bombard your enemies from above and much more. Players who found their armies inflexible in the first game, will enjoy these global spells that can be used anywhere on the map at any time as they make you feel more in control of a battle where units can be cumbersome to move around.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is okay. Malekith&apos;s voice is as presented in the trailer, Queek headtaker&apos;s voice is a mix of weird and adorable, while the high elves are noble-sounding as it should be. It is not incredible, but it gets the job done.
<br>
<br>The soundtracks are interesting, having most likely taken some pages out of World of Warcrafts book. They are enjoyable for a while, but you will want to have a mix appropriate for your race ready once you really get invested.
<br>
<br>Overall an excellent game and a worthy successor to Warhammer 1, but does not bring in anything revitalizing new mechanics in terms of the gameplay. If you liked the previous one, you will most likely enjoy this one as well.
<br>
<br>Best of luck on the battlefields of the New World!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7565965">Expand</a></span>

<br>Summary:
<br>Solid turn based empire building strategy game with amazing real time battles. Great quality of life improvements over its predecessor. Better UI and better graphics (campaign map and monster animations in particular), more city management thanks to being able to settle all regions and getting more buildings and building slots, bigger more impressive creatures to fight with. Has an objective-based campaign, with a few cutscenes thrown in. Biggest negative are the less-than-stellar siege battles.
<br>
<br>First the positives:
<br>* Nice combination of sandbox and story/objective based gameplay on the campaign
<br>* 4 characterful races, each with their own unique mechanics and 2 different starting positions each
<br>* Expanded building system with more building slots, more building chains and better rewards for having resource buildings
<br>* Lots of region-specific special wonder buildings (temples, wizard-towers, special ports, palaces, etc)
<br>* Capture and build cities anywhere, but with race-specific climate preferences
<br>* Campaign map looks amazing, many different areas of the game, making conquest feel fresh
<br>* Better skill trees with more unique skills for legendary lords
<br>* Very complete army rosters, none of the iconic big monster stuff held back (dragons, phoenixes, hydra, dinos, hellpit, doomwheel)
<br>* Most magic spells feel much more powerful
<br>* More variation in battle maps (river battles, chokepoint battles, slightly more variation in sieges, more terrain features such as cliffs inside the playable area)
<br>* Battles seem to play slightly slower, allowing for more tactics
<br>* Music has improved a lot
<br>* Performance is very good
<br>* Additional free mega campaign map for owners of warhammer 1 to be released soon
<br>* Hopefully lots of free content, like in warhammer 1
<br>
<br>The negatives aren&apos;t too huge an issue, but I&apos;ll list everything that bothered me at some point:
<br>* Siege battle maps are still small and even with more variation, these maps are still rather similar
<br>* Campaign camera perspective has changed for the worse, with camera aimed at the sky and not zooming out very far, battle camera doesn&apos;t zoom out far enough and view is often obstructed by trees
<br>* Still blobbing going on in battles
<br>* Can&apos;t really tell how good units REALLY perform in battle as stats don&apos;t tell everything (like attack speed)
<br>* Having multiple armies increases upkeep of each army, so having 10+ armies like in historical TW games is prohibitively expensive
<br>* All playable factions are non-human and you might not like all the factions&apos; playstyle/theme
<br>* Magic-specialized races High Elves and Dark Elves lack a lord-level wizard and can access fewer spells than the human faction in Warhammer 1
<br>* Treasure hunts seems bugged and mostly gives penalties instead of rewards
<br>* Unit stats are not always in line with what the units have in the warhammer tabletop game and what you&apos;d expect</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7554804">Expand</a></span>

All you get is the vortex mechanic and the beautiful reskins of the old units. I would not recommend this game at $60. You could pick it up after Activision offers a huge discount.

<br>There is still no actual combat or strategy, just send units into other units, keep your chariots moving, cast spells that make no sense and are almost the same as the previous game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7559790">Expand</a></span>

Having over 200 hours logged into the first title, I was very much anticipating the hotly announced sequel &#x2013; announced a year after the first game, and being released less than a week ago. Total War: Warhammer is a fantastic blend of fantasy and large scale war simulating, and its campaign mode had me hooked. Creative Assembly uses their almost neurotic attention to detail to craft an aesthetically gorgeous display of war &#x2013; every single person in their legion is unique and detailed. Even the artwork throughout the game lends a fantasy beauty that feels unique to Warhammer &#x2013; but of course its derivative of Tolkien&#x2019;s legendarium, which becomes obvious to anyone who is familiar with both canons.
<br>
<br>The old industry adage goes that &#x2018;sequels never work&#x2019; &#x2013; but this isn&#x2019;t necessarily true, for example, look at the Godfather II, or the new Mad Max. When sequels succeed, it&#x2019;s usually because they attempt something innovative, but still remain a homage to the original, and this is where Total War: Warhammer II fails horribly. When we examine feature AAA titles critically, critics tear apart IP&#x2019;s like Call of Duty or sports games like Fifa for being derivative of its predecessors; the criticism isn&#x2019;t important though, as, much like superhero films, they chain these releases because they guarantee a safe profit and return on investment, as commercial audiences want these releases based on the quality of the IP. Warhammer II more or less received nothing but critical acclaim, and objectively, it&#x2019;s deserved. Warhammer II is a fantastic title with unique and re-playable gameplay and engaging characters and armies; a.k.a. a total delight for any fans of Total War or Warhammer. Warhammer II introduces new stories and four new races, but it feels like a glorified expansion/DLC.
<br>The user interface is completely the same, and the base image assets for every mechanical choice in the game is the same &#x2013; everything down to the sound assets and loading screens borrow the exact same outline as its predecessor, so why did the game receive critical acclaim? It&#x2019;s an arguably more polished version of the first one, and that makes it better. So why did Creative Assembly feel the need to release this a feature title with an MSRP of $71.99 CAD? Another age old adage is of course &#x2018;if it&#x2019;s not broken, don&#x2019;t fix it&#x2019; and of course that rings true. But Firaxis rolled out patches for Civilization V that drastically changed the game until they felt it was right; and their sequel, Civilization VI not only changed almost every internal mechanic, but the aesthetic style as well. The game industry shouldn&#x2019;t be monotonous and derivative like it is now &#x2013; new and exciting experiences in gaming comes from innovation, so why don&#x2019;t companies risks in their sequels &#x2013; because of money. And hey, I love Warhammer 2, so I guess I&#x2019;m just another sucker.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7562793">Expand</a></span>

Now, my opinion improved as they added more and more content to it but, just comparing initial releases, TW2 is...well it&apos;s incredible! I&apos;ve only played it for 4 hours this morning but it&apos;s got me hooked! Beautiful campaign map! The detail in every inch is amazing! Great new units and diverse races with unique mechanics! Magic also seems to have been given a large buff, but that could be because I&apos;ve been played as the Slann mage. Nothing more satisfying than lining up the perfect comet of cassandora (sp?)!! Also the rituals are an interesting, if sometimes frustrating mechanic. Frustration in this sense is good bc if it was too easy to complete then I&apos;d get bored in a week or two. It&apos;s basically a choice. Do I defend my lands and progress further towards (vortex) victory or do I focus my efforts on conquering and/interfering with everyone else&apos;s rituals? And a note about conquering, this map is huge. Like, what the heck! When I zoomed out and looked around I was stunned! If I conquered Lustria (which I fully intend to do) I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;d have the same, if not more, territories than all the human settlements combined in the TW1 campaign! And Lustria is about 1/3 to 1/4 of the whole campaign area!!!
<br>Anyways, I just wanted to put it out there that if you&apos;re on the fence about this game, don&apos;t be. If you can afford it, this game is a great game with tons of fun content!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7569828">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Note: (I personally have not yet encountered any game breaking bugs etc whatsoever.)
<br>For my short review i can only currently say this:
<br>
<br>The overall graphics to me are looking very bright and beautiful just the way they should be.
<br>Sound wise it&apos;s also really well done and it adds nicely to the TW:W2 concept as a whole.
<br>The campaign has a lengthy tutorial based system which i suspect can get annoying but personally i don&apos;t mind it at all here.
<br>This game will again be really huge with all the additional content being released soon, so i&apos;m already looking forward to that myself.
<br>Hopefully the pricing won&apos;t be the only element to spoil a great deal of fun i&apos;ve been having with this amazing game so far.
<br>I bought/preordered the game a bit cheaper online, and got a nice TW:W1 Norsca dlc in addition to that..
<br>Thus i can&apos;t be anything else but overjoyed by this awesome deal that i made and i already know i won&apos;t even regret it one tiny bit.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a really great game guys trust me on this one,.. Do yourself a real favor and just buy it and have fun!!!
<br>

<br>The lizardmen are rock hard, like fighting with a dinosaur army should feel like. Massive carnosaurs, stegodons and bastilidons brush off damage mangoes being thrown at a bus. Incredible feeling of power.
<br>
<br>Skaven, my god they got the feel of Skaven so right. The voice acting is so nervous, so manic, just like their troops. Feels like rats can overrun anything.

<br>es una secuela de nombre, realmente es el mismo juego con mismo motor grafico, con mismo universo, con mismas mec&#xE1;nicas, &#xBF;es acaso un DLC del primero? que no lo quieren cobrar a precio de juego completo.
<br>Por que raz&#xF3;n lleva el 2 entonces, es parte de una plataforma, que trata de unir tres juegos en uno, las ventajas son de que podr&#xE1;s peleas contra cualquier facci&#xF3;n del mundo existente sin la necesidad de comprar los otros 2 juegos, esto nos da una libertad para poder escoger las razas de nuestro agrado, y as&#xED; conquistar el nuevo mundo. dicho eso comencemos con las partes buenas y malas del juego.
<br>
<br>cosas malas primero:
<br>
<br>si llegas nuevo a esta saga te parecer&#xE1; que te venden una intima parte de lo que la plataforma, pero esto tiene una justificaci&#xF3;n (ojo no quita la sensaci&#xF3;n de producto cortado) divido a los tiempos de desarrollo decidieron entregar 3 partes que funcionaran en conjunto un ejemplo pokemon sol y pokemon luna, misma regi&#xF3;n diferentes pokemon exclusivos, as&#xED; es esto diferentes regiones diferentes facciones que se unen en un mismo mega mapa con cientos de facciones.
<br>
<br>otro punto malo y este no tiene justificaci&#xF3;n, es la estrategia de DLC que tienen, si bien van liberando contenido gratuito de excelente calidad, el contenido de pago en la antigua entrega era mayor al que tra&#xED;a de base, en pocas palabras un juego a la mitad, lo cual hace que me quede con la duda de si repetir&#xE1;n los errores del pasado o esta ves dar&#xE1;n menos DLC y mas FLC
<br>
<br>por ultimo los servidores mas bien la falta de ellos, el multijugador es entretenido y no e tenido problemas de conexi&#xF3;n muy grandes (ojo si ay problemas y pueden llegar a ser muy molestos) esto se debe que la partida toma un anfitri&#xF3;n y si este tiene mal pc o un p&#xE9;simo internet, la partida se va por la coladera, debido al gran esfuerzo que les pide a las maquinas promedio, sumado a las diferencias de regiones, logran una experiencia, de un gameplay excelente, pero un Lag del infierno
<br>
<br>cosas buenas puedo decir que tanto la jugabilidad como la variedad, est&#xE1;n aseguradas, el numero de posibilidades entre una facci&#xF3;n y otra son casi ilimitadas y bien balanceadas.
<br>
<br>los gr&#xE1;ficos son excelentes y bien optimizados, si bien es un juego dif&#xED;cil de mover, los PC que puedan moverlo, lo pondr&#xE1;n mover a mas de 60fps a una resoluci&#xF3;n de 1080p, e juego esta muy bien optimizado y se agradece, entrando a fondo, es fant&#xE1;stico ver las animaciones tan detalladas, los efectos de part&#xED;culas impresionantes, los efectos de f&#xED;sica al destruir edificios, los efectos de iluminaci&#xF3;n, sin duda uno de los mejores gr&#xE1;ficos en juegos de estrategia de los &#xFA;ltimos tiempos
<br>
<br>multijugador es estupendo salvo por unos errores de conexi&#xF3;n antes mencionados, nos presentan facciones bien balanceadas con diferentes estilos de pelea, pero dentro de esos estilos una infinidad de ej&#xE9;rcitos para crear que ir&#xE1;n desde el aire hasta el subsuelo (invocaciones) poniendo en nuestras manos un juego f&#xE1;cil de jugar dif&#xED;cil de dominar, desde una estrategia vertical hasta una horizontal que incluye hechizos habilidades y sinergias que aran que la pelea comience desde antes que entres en el campo de batalla.
<br>
<br>y que mas puedo agregar que no sepan ya de los total war un juego sobresaliente, que se gana la posici&#xF3;n de secuela que es mas del que ofrece cualquier expansi&#xF3;n, con gr&#xE1;ficos geniales jugabilidad muy buena y su propia identidad
<br>
<br>muy recomendable para los amantes del genero</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7555371">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve spent more time playing this game than any other game i&apos;ve owned in recent memory. Elves feel like a traditional TW game. Skaven on the other hand makes this game feel completely different. There is a lot of depth in both the kingdom management and as well as in battle. You fight with soo many different factions that there is more variety than other RTS games. The battle feels epic, especially when trying to siege or defending against an attack on a high tier settlement. Truly feels like something out of a LOTR movie.
<br>
<br>I played Rome, Napoleon, and Shogun 2 in the past. This game blew my mind as to how far the graphics has evolved for a RTS game that involves hundreds of units. Many of the units (especially lords and heroes) have very specific choreographed synchronized battles against each other. Zoom in and watch how they dodge and block each other.
<br>
<br>Haven&apos;t ran into any bugs yet despite putting over 120 hours into the game so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7631509">Expand</a></span>

Nuff said.

LOL no skill required to win either, just spam things the other factions cannot deal with and last minute faction switch to gain the advantage since this game does not hide your faction choices. LOL. CA devs are terrible at multiplayer and clueless about balancing. Be prepared to spend more money for OP dlc units/lords like they did with warhammer 1. Yes im looking at you boris/red duke.
<br>Singleplayer is fine but you are still at disadvantage if you dont have dlc since ai will acess to all the DLC units regardless if you have brought the DLCs</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7692035">Expand</a></span>

<br>The campaign is just great again with actual brains needed to complete
<br>The new races / factions are great but.... 2 elf races while you have only 4 races in the game is dull because they are definitely different but becaue they are both elves they also feel the same
<br>Skaven and lizardmen are absolutely awesome and have so much awesome units ,infact the skaven are now my favourite race off all time in any warhammer game
<br>However this sequel is more a building on what is good then a real changer because there is really not so many changes compared to warhammer 1
<br>But the changes that where made are awesome and needed like more objective to races,rituals
<br>Overall a great sequel and an amazing warhammer game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7692383">Expand</a></span>
