The Reason to that I do not give it a 10 is mainly because of certain hardware errors that occurs with some video/sound cards that causes you crash to desktop with the option to report an error to windows, those most of the time can be walked around still, but you are in need to know in what to do if you receive an error like this.. For those people giving the score of 1, I would say some of the stuff I have read does not explain or anything constructive said other than eg. talking about another game for then simply flaming away in a way that does not provide any proper feedback.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=410547">Expand</a></span>

I just finished the game after buying it (April 2008), and I have to say I really enjoyed it. I am big on storyline as I am tired of hack/slash games. There is a deep story involved if you are willing to seriously roleplay your character. I enjoyed the action and combat. I think people are too obsessed with desiring over the top graphics and special effects. I thought the graphics were great and the effects enjoyable, I played my character true to form and enjoyed a wonderful walk through making tough choices and got to destroy the bad guys. My negative points would be that some of the boss fights were over done, I dislike having to over-strategize and hope it all works out because its all based on D&amp;D rules with a non-existent DM. But then again in my pen&amp;paper days of gaming my favorite DM was forgiving and friendly, while others would make you roll dice every 5 seconds to see if you could remain seated on your horse, a mate of mine rolled a critical failure and had to go the rest of our campaign with a permanent broken leg. If you play games for an enjoyable storyline then this will bring you enjoyment. If you are looking for hack/slash and over the top graphics and special effects then buy a PS3 and get Heavenly Sword, or a God of War series and stop complaining. I avoided this game for a very long time because of the negative reviews, and now I wish I had just ignored them and played this earlier. I gave it an 8 because I wish there had been more interaction between characters and boss fights were over done. (Possible spoiler ahead) In general I get irritated when a games makes you kill the boss more than once to finish the game or continue to the next stage. Just die and be done with it, stop lingering.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=411589">Expand</a></span>

NWN2, in my opinion, is a good sequel - not great. Basically, it&apos;s NWN1 with better graphics, more spells, more classes, etc. The default controls aren&apos;t great, but can easily be tweaked to your liking; you can even make it play just like NWN1. In fact, the menu gives users a lot of control over graphical features, control, etc. Added features, like the quick spell menu, really help streamline the gameplay, and make it a much more enjoyable experience. One thing I find disappointing is that NWN2&apos;s toolset system is more difficult to use, and has slowed the creation of community mods. If you&apos;re looking for a solid RPG DnD experience, I would highly recommend NWN2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=412815">Expand</a></span>

After playing through 8 levels and running a second 3 player campaign (which we are only 6-7th level) that the fun was rolling along. Each spell and each night spent with a friend over 1,000 miles away makes me realize, that when the multiplayer servers are up and running, that the game has potential. The graphics are better than I thought, but they do tax my system as well as the interface is still mildly clunky. But heads up. We&apos;re doing a 2-3 player raid which has lasted over 20 hours and is better and better as we go. So far, maybe one gamespy crash. But well worth the 10 minute delay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=394607">Expand</a></span>

Good game, still needs higher end hardware to run well on high settings. Good story, good options, great graphics, familiar feel. It&apos;s a worthy successor to the crown. It&apos;s biggest problem was the system requirements were way misleading and that pissed a lot of people off in 2006.

NWN2 has serious camera issues, AI flaws, and steep hardware requirements. My computer barely meets the requirements, and I have the graphics all the way down. The cut scenes still look decent, but in general, not a big step up from NWN1. I&apos;ve used the toolset a little bit, and its daunting. But with the online community it&apos;s pretty easy to get your feet wet, and after all, for a truly powerful toolset you would have to complicate things...its in the nature of power. Finally, the game is FUN. The voice acting, while at times exaggerated, is hilarious. I can&apos;t wait to play though as an evil character. The different choices do an excellent job of making the player feel like he&apos;s bearing an impact, and quest accomplishment is rewarding. It gets an 9 for its overall play value, and while it does have issues, its one of the most potentially replayable games in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=393778">Expand</a></span>

It is therefore not surprising that there have been no groundbreaking changes. The same levelling system, same classes, races, skills, abilities, spells and feats are implemented. Except for the introduction of a new base class, the warlock, nothing has been altered so drastic as to attract attention. A few changes have been implemented. The first two stem from criticism against NWN 1: the rather uninspired plot and the fact that it was a single character game. So these points have been addressed by creating a better story line and adding a party game system. The third change is maybe the only real new thing: a more elaborate system to create your own items and potions. Many problems make the game rather wearisome. Wearisome because the action is interrupted continuously. Battles are generally followed by resting because you need regenerate spent spells and lost health that way, since both won&apos;t regenerate themselves. Irksome is that by slavishly sticking to the restricted AD&amp;D rule set little interesting is brought into the game. You find that some classes are repeating their actions again and again and again. Notably the fighter class offers little variance. But even when a change of tactic might be possible this is hampered by the way OBSIDIAN has implemented it. The thief class offers sneaking which could be used in other games to scout ahead, but this advantage is nullified because in NWN 2 the thief can&apos;t act on his own. What is even more tiresome is that the already small area&apos;s are filled with roundabout routes and blocked area</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=406588">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s doable, and enjoyable, if you have my specs or even slightly lower. The gameplay is engaging and the character details are fabulous. I also enjoy the &quot;cinema&quot; conversations, which resemble dialogue in your average popcorn movie. The interface is a tad cluttered, and the whole game does not feel as &quot;sharp&quot; as NWN 1, but the trade-off is excellent. I recommend this game for anyone with reasonable computer specs and a love for the NWN story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=399725">Expand</a></span>

There are glimmers of where NWN2 could have done well, but sadly the vast majority of it does not live up to its predecessor. The right-click menu is unintuitive and slow, attempting to do anything while your character and/or the target is in motion is impossible. The AI is pathetic. The campaign itself is rather cliched and while some of the characters are interesting, they are never really given a chance to shine beyond a single cutscene each that never really goes anywhere. A host of romance options were promised, yet there are only a single romance path for each gender. And the male path is completely unexpected, especially due to the personality and actions of a couple of the female characters, inclusing the romantic option herself. Alignment has no meaning and alignment shifts are seemingly randomly placed in dialogs. The toolset. Ah, the toolset... what the hell happened? NWN1&apos;s toolset was complex, but streamlined. NWN2&apos;s is... well, broken, horrific and more complex than anything I&apos;ve seen before. Plus there are only the bare minimum of creatures/textures/etc to make the campaign itself functional, unlike the original game&apos;s toolset that had a considerable segment of the D&amp;D Forgotten Realms pantheon of creatures in it. Combined with the fact that the toolset itself is incredibly unintuitive and that it is difficult or nigh impossible to do anything without fighting it and you have not only a step backwards, but a fall off a cliff backwards. I&apos;d end with the hope that some of this might be patched or at least changed, but considering how significant the problems are and how deep it runs, many of the &apos;problems&apos; are most likely design decisions rather than simple errors of judgement from Obsidian/Atari. I hope that things improve, but can&apos;t see it happening. The only reason I give it as &quot;high&quot; as a 4 is because there is some enjoyment to be had. Otherwise it would be a 0.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=393726">Expand</a></span>

But, that is in the very nature of A.I. so there is really no reason to rag on Obsidian for that. I haven&apos;t been able to play the multiplayer yet, but it doesn&apos;t seem that bad. Just wait for the PW&apos;s to get back in the swing of things. Single player story is pretty good, but I&apos;ve never been a single player guy. A lot of people have been talking about it being a &quot;rehash of NWN1.&quot; Obviously you never followed NWN2&apos;s development. They did that on purpose, going by the &quot;If it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it&quot; policy. I wish they had added more voices sets, but still. It&apos;s progress forward. I don&apos;t have the video settings on high because my comp has been built on a small budget, but it runs very smoothly for how I do have it set, so once again I don&apos;t know what you people are talking about. And, don&apos;t compare it to BG...I&apos;m sorry, but BG wasn&apos;t that good anyway. And, NWN2 is 2 generations past BG. NWN was designed (from my perspective) to sit the fence between single- and multi-player. BG was meant to be single-player. The official campaigns are not going to be the same quality, because they want us to have room to make our own stuff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=394075">Expand</a></span>

<br>The other cause of the fall of this saga would be the MMO system but never will be the same: in NWN you are a hero known by the rest of the server by your feats and your story, while in a MMO you are a number, with lucky you would be known by your guild but never among other players or enemies. NWN is a more close experience, with real DM supervision and a history to share with your community.
<br>I thank all the gods that the recent MMO was called simply &quot;Neverwinter&quot; without a &quot;3&quot; (Did you see Obsidian?), leaving a different game outside the NWN series, so we can still hoping that someday we will see a NWN3...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4804765">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer, especially when played on the dedicated servers put up by the more prominent mod teams, is an entertaining alternative to games such as World of Warcraft.  The animations may appear lackluster in comparison with more recent titles, but the multiplayer is free, and I for one am more than willing to ignore occasional bugs (which are far less common than other reviews would have you believe) in favor of a multiplayer system devoid of monthly fees.<br><br>The player community on these servers is also far more engaged than that of big-ticket MMO&apos;s: roleplay is encouraged, granting an element of versatility to the game and enhancing replay value significantly.  This offer a sharp contrast to the pettiness I encountered during my brief stint playing WoW; players are willing to flesh out their backgrounds significantly and remain true to their characters even when doing so negatively affects gameplay.  While this may not appeal to all, it enhances that the suspension of disbelief essential to many enjoyable video games.  Single player offers a somewhat different position; the original campaign is slow at first (the first few levels feel almost like another tutorial), but it soon becomes more interesting.  While I found playing a truly evil character difficult (the game seemed to be forcing me to conform to a particular brand of evil: those who have reach the end of the game as evil characters know what I mean), neutral or good characters offer a wealth of interesting gameplay with enough material for roughly two interesting playthroughs.  My only true complaint with regard to the single player campaign is the often stilted dialogue of minor NPC&apos;s.  In many cases, they restate their commentary two or even three times before finally relinquishing their unwelcome hold over your computer screen.  The issue of poor voice acting is less prevalent in the first expansion, Mask of the Betrayer, but it resurfaces with a vengeance in Storm of Zehir.  Beside better dialogue, MOTB continues in much the same vein, with the occasional moral dilemma to make the story more engaging.  In conclusion, aside from bugs and somewhat disappointing voice acting, this game is one well worth purchasing, with significant replay value, enjoyable roleplay-based multiplayer and a comparatively low price of $20 on Steam.  I would strongly recommend it for any who enjoy fantasy RPG&apos;s and would like a multiplayer service to occupy a few hours on dreary evenings without the prohibitive monthly fees.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1655144">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s right up there with games like BG, KotOR, and Morrowind. (And the first expansion, Mask of the Betrayer comes close to Planescape: Torment.)

Good moddability but more coding needed.  The mods weren&apos;t as big as in NWN though.  Agreements could be the cause of this, and maybe additional complexity in the toolset.  The expansions weren&apos;t of the snuff but the single player experience with the base NWN2 was very good.</span>

Loot, skills, feats, everything D&amp;D was meant to be! Ah yes, and even the multiplayer works and is a whole lot of fun.</span>

Some patience is necessary but this game is probably 3 or 4 patches away (from v.1.03) from appeasing the critics. This game is in a rough spot, critics-wise, because it&apos;s caught between the rabid loyalty of fans to NWN1 and the excellence of TES:Oblivion. Taken alone, however, it&apos;s a pretty good game. Of course, it isn&apos;t Oblivion, graphics-wise, but if you enjoyed Wizardry in its early incarnations, Bard&apos;s Tale, Ultima and Baldur&apos;s Gates I &amp; II, there is no reason, a few bugs here and there, not to like this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=394178">Expand</a></span>

Baldurs Gate, BG2, Fallout 1+2, PS:T, M&amp;M series, Arcanum, even the Diablo series with mods. The problem with crpgs today is the most important part, the story, is the part that gets the least attention. Big shiny graphics, &quot;life-like&quot; AI, giant worlds; all secondary elements in an RPG to the story. RPG: Role Playing Game, if the role your playing is a courier you have a tedious game. If the role your playing involves exploring many simple areas populated with simple enemies, you have a tedious game. Act 1 of the NWN2 OC was genuinely painful for me; excruiatingly boring &quot;find orc leader, fight through peon guards and kill him&quot; type quests, set in &quot;plod forward through the sea of boring underlings to reach the boss&quot; style dungeons. Act 2 improves somewhat; the keep is genuinely interesting but doesn&apos;t feel like a fully implemented feature. If you could merely join your men on special missions, patrol the roads, guard the farms, some way of making the keep feel &quot;real&quot; rather than just an object you throw money at it would be vastly more entertaining. I haven&apos;t even finished the game so can&apos;t speak for Act3 and am not sure I ever will. I am patched to 1.12 and bugs still exist with alarming frequency in the game, many show stoppers such as, corrupt save games, crash to desktops and missing party memmbers. The AI is literally garbage; your companions will randomly stop obeying commands, attack each other for no apparent reason, cast aoe&apos;s when companions are in the area of effect, etc. The real reason I bought NWN1+2 is the Toolset and the modules resulting from the toolset. The quality of the modules is in direct correlation with the quality of the Toolset; the mods I&apos;ve played have been vastly superior to the OC; VASTLY SUPERIOR! Almost surreally, my toolset will not work and surfing the forums many users, especially vista 64x are experiencing this with the latest patch. I&apos;m sure it will be fixed, but it certaintly is a WTF moment when you pay for something and integral parts do not work at all. The reason NWN2 gets a 7 is the promise of true greatness hiding deep within the engine; the graphics will be tolerable/good for many, many years. I just hope all the bugs will be ironed out before the modding community gives up on the game. Rating the OC by itself I&apos;d give a 2.5/3, rating the &quot;polish&quot; of the game I&apos;d give a .5, the plethora of bugs present after more than 1 year is unacceptable, especially one preventing the toolset from running at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=411638">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t want to spoil anything, but RTS fans may be excited to get this game too. There are some RTS elements thrown into this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=393935">Expand</a></span>

The pros: It looks ok, even given its age, and you have a very deep combat and character development system that gives you lots of variety in the kind of character you can be. The cons: Where to start? The clunky control system; three camera modes, none of which work properly; lacklustre campaign; really ugly faces for your character; UI is just a total mess, popups all over the place; and it&apos;s very possible to ruin your character build from the beginning because you chose the wrong abilities......<br>But even after all that I would have forgiven it, were it not for the fact that it is just a broken game. It&apos;s full of bugs even with all the latest patches, and I mean game ruining bugs like campaign events not triggering. It&apos;s totally unreasonable for Bioware to still be selling a game for a not insignificant price (I paid &#xC2;&#xA3;15 for the platinum edition) which just falls over at random. And then there are the crashes... So really, there are other RPGs out there, and if you want a game that you will actually be able to play then buy something else. But if you are a gambler by nature, then why not try this game. You *might* have fun. But then again you might lose your money and have nothing to show for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1556173">Expand</a></span>

The graphic is nice, the plot, as a whole, is outstanding, the ending &quot;cinematic&quot;&apos;s passable, but not great. The voice work and dialogs are absolutely the stunning. Don&apos;t be discouraged by the naysayers, this is a great game for those who are NOT D&amp;D hardcore and over skeptical. 10 out of 10.</span>

It has a functional party system, some good companion characters, an interesting story line and lots of choices and consequences. However, this game&apos;s user interface is just terrible. there are three modes for camera angles which may drive people crazy because you have to press a button to change it not like in first neverwinter nights, just need to scroll up/down the middle mouse button.  Also this game still has performance issue even with current patch. All I have to say, this game has potential but is not nearly as well-done as the original Neverwinter Nights. so I give it 7 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1784285">Expand</a></span>

Owen T, below has already said much of what I feel signifies the problems with Neverwinter Nights 2. My first problem the first time around was that after four hours of playing and eventually reaching the city from where the game draws its&apos; name, I still didn&apos;t feel like the story had started. The story eventually picked up and even got somewhat interesting (albeit remaining terribly clich&#xE9;) at times, but it was still too slow to start and at times it felt like half a dozen writers wrote a part each and then joined them together hastily. I could probably live with a bad story if the gameplay was smooth. But it isn&apos;t. The controls are sluggish or over-sensitive, depending on what actions you are trying to perform. The interface is clunky, counter-intuitive and the targetting functions in such a way that half the time I found myself throwing fireballs at my own party members only to start applying healing to the enemy. The graphics are at times great, but mostly stick to bland with a few dips into sheer ugly or out of place and often times I found myself thinking &quot;Wow, Dungeon Siege looked better than this&quot;. All this combined with a difficulity that flails wildly from cake walk to hair tearing frustration in the span of two encounters leaves you with a game that you occasionally find yourself wanting to play more of. But most of the time, the uninspired story, the horrid interface and controls and the strange design decisions will just be too much to stomach. I give it a 6, because for all its&apos; shortcomings, NWN 2 still delivers a solid dungeon raiding experience from time to time. Every now and then, you actually feel as if you are playing a virtual simulation of the Pen &amp; Paper game that NWN2 draws its&apos; rules and setting from. It never lasts long and it certainly doesn&apos;t make up for Obsidians glaring lack of polish (which holds true for all their games so far) but it saves NWN2 from being a complete disaster of a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=423092">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. Great voice acting
<br>2.Character choices that affect your world and your interaction with NPC
<br>3. Great quest with amazing variety
<br>4. The story draws you in, has twists and turns, as well allowing you to explore the world.
<br>5. In-depth lore that is given to by the NPC as you go along in the quest
<br>6. Game length  100+ hours
<br>
<br>PLUS a great modding community with everything from expansion mods to graphics and voice mods.  Also, there are 3 DLC&apos;s that easily add another 100+ hours. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4189343">Expand</a></span>

<br>-village under attack, oh noes, must go on a journey not just to protect the village but to rout out this great evil

I have sunk way to much time in it and I still find myself coming back for more. When it first came out it had its share of bugs and issues. Most of these were fixed over time.
<br>
<br>The game is based on D&amp;D 3.5 - and is the closet you will ever come to playing such a ruleset on the PC. The game also features an integrated toolset to create your own adventures. The single player is fun and with the huge amount of quality user-created content out there, it will keep you entertained for a long time. Even building your &quot;ultimate character&quot; is like a mini-game in itself. The sheer amount of customisation that can be achieved is mind-boggling.
<br>
<br>For people that do not know much about D&amp;D, it can be a difficult game to master - but it is well worth doing. It is a game that keeps on giving. Simply put, the game is a masterpiece. I wish we would see more of this kind of game these days.

I suggest that if you like RPG games be patient with the slow start. This game gets better as your party levels and the storylines start to come together. The whole NWN2 experience can be bought on sale in Steam for a song and includes a LOT of (bug free) RPG gaming. Despite its imperfections this game is great in the end and a must buy for RPG fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2681490">Expand</a></span>

But if talking seriously - its a good game because it have a tonn of side quests and its never boring. The bad thing about it is the &quot;waiting for the loading to stop&quot; that takes up about 20 % of your whole playing time... But in all the game is great. 9/10 - awesome</span>

However, the game play makes me regret the week of my life I wasted playing this game. The maps and quests are non-intuitive, the camera angles are awful, the characters are hard to control, the big fights are WAY TOO LONG, and you will bang your head against a wall when you hit the endgame. I literally spent hours trying to beat the last boss... i even resorted to cheating and couldn&apos;t do it. Hell, walkthroughs didn&apos;t help. I can&apos;t even finish the game and many a bug had me reloading to saves the happened hours before. I would only recommend this game if you have nothing better to do and no other games you want to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=394244">Expand</a></span>

The graphics feel clunky, especially the melee combat which is unsatisfying and unrealistic looking.  To compare, take a game like Icewind Dale (which is a 2D game, but has similar rule sets, many of the same spells, etc).  In Icewind Dale, if two opposing warriors attacked each other you either saw the attack animation fail with maybe an appropriate sound (but no specific graphics to differentiate between a block, parry, or dodge) or a successful hit. In a 2D game it is forgivable because you have to use your imagination to an extent. Spell casts in that game were truly magnificent to behold and even the sound of the casting seemed otherworldly.  In NWN2 I could not discern any specific graphic for blocking, parrying, dodging, etc. which is unforgivable for a 3D game. A successful attack results in the flinch animation, but other than that I did not notice any other surprises in melee combat, even with different weapons.  Combat is therefor dull and boring.  I also noted the level of gore and blood.  There is none in this game.  Icewind Dale 2 had it&apos;s fair amount of gore (even exploding bodies), with dead enemies lying in pools of their own blood.  NWN2 unfortunately has none of that.  Death essentially involves an avatar falling down to the floor unconscious.  The bodies quickly disappear after a certain amount of time has passed, but I would have liked the option of seeing them remain.  Dropped loot is not accessed by clicking on the dead bodies, instead little bags spawn beside the bodies, which you are forced to click on, as small as they are (why NVN2 degenerated to that style of loot system is beyond me). The spell-casting also looks completely wrong.  Some spells fly at strait angles to targets.  Take for example acid splash, which looks like a beam of green light emitting from the caster&apos;s hand to the target... it just looks so cheap... like the devs took a shortcut in the graphics department.  It doesn&apos;t look like acid and it&apos;s not very satisfying to behold.  The sound that the casters make when casting is ridiculous and almost comical, it&apos;s like something you might hear out of an poorly translated Japanese anime.  Even if you choose your characters voice at the beginning of the game, every spellcaster makes the same sound in exactly the most horrid tone.  I find it hard to enjoy any spellcasting class what-so-ever.
<br>
<br>A lot of the dialogue in the game is spoken audio, which I think is unfortunate.  The audio is too short and precise to give any feel to the game.  All spoken audio seems plot driven.  The written dialogue is not very clever and I can&apos;t help but feel that the game was presented in such a way that young teenagers would &quot;get it&quot;.  The game is rated T, so go figure.  Any brass humor that you may have seen in similar themed 2D RPG&apos;s do not exist here.  The rating for the game obviously held it back in many regards.  The plot and dialogue completely disinterest me as a result.
<br>
<br>I was expecting a lot more for an RPG.  The graphics totally suck for the requirements and nothing filled me with awe like I have seen in many a 2D RGP such as Baldur&apos;s Gate, IceWind Dale, etc.  Those games impressed me; this one made me glad that I never bought it full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1442652">Expand</a></span>

I am a multiplayer gamer - for me its about fun with friends. On this front NWN2 is a total step backwards. I am really surprised that official review sites have not said more about NWN2&apos;s failure in this regard. I had bought this with the a view toward a good couple of days gaming with friends over the Chritsmas break. NWN2 is just so bad MP we are not even going to try now - its back to NWN1 or something else. NWN2 does have some merit as a single player linear scenario and hence my scoring of it as a 3. I have a very new system with all the bells and whistles but still had to turn graphics down to get sensible performance. I can&apos;t understand why the camera is not as good as NWN1? I am pleased to see I am not the only one it drives crazy. I am guessing the higher ratings are coming from younger players who have not had the joys of NWN1 and BG and who find a very linear scenario helpful. For the thinking and experienced D&amp;D gamer NWN2 can&apos;t be anything but a disappointment. Let us hope that the community can save the game, but given the large and justified (in my view) negative sentiment about the game it&apos;s not a sure thing that this will happen. Only buy this game if you want a liner single player RPG and have a high spec system. Even then I still can&apos;t recommend it as being great value for money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=393751">Expand</a></span>

Most of the bugs aren&apos;t too bad, but eventually you get to one that kills the game.  But the real problem is the stunningly bad characterization and voice acting.

Nwn2 is one of those games that has so much potential but comes up short in nearly all areas, and is a real shame.
<br>
<br>Clearly, the developers did not finish this game. Even with all final patches installed, there are still obvious bugs to be found in the OC. The gameplay is decent, but its ruined by how choppy it gets. As other people noted, the difficulty varies wildly throughout the game, sometimes you will have cakewalk battles, and then enter another area and things become very difficult.  The &quot;rest&quot; feature is terrible, as you will be resting/fighting/resting. Early in the game this isnt so bad, but it gets very annoying later on in the game, as every time you rest you have to rebuff. Rebuffing takes lots of time and gets very, very annoying. NWN2 certainly has a great selection of character classes and prestige classes for you to get your fingers on.
<br>
<br>The plot starts extremely slowly, and only picks up until you hit Act 2. Yes, its sort of cliche, but its not that bad. My biggest complaint with the story is that, once again, you feel as if the game hasnt really &quot;started&quot; yet until you are almost done with the first act. I think part of the reasons why, is because of the poor character development. Compared to other Bioware games, your companions are not nearly as deep as others in more modern games (or perhaps I&apos;ve just been spoiled?) Character dialogue is short, sometimes funny, but short nonetheless. Romance is meager, and only picks up into Act 2 or even Act 3.
<br>
<br>Graphics are pretty good for a 2006 game. Its such a shame that the editor just insists on you having the absolute ugliest character you could ever make.
<br>
<br>The problem with NWN2 is that its an almost great game. Sometimes, you feel as if you are indeed playing a classic cRPG, but then you are painfully reminded that NWN2 has some serious flaws. The choppy gameplay of the &quot;rest&quot; feature, and the sometimes-fun battles, makes me want to bang my head against the wall. Its a game that has a great swing, but doesnt follow through. I really wanted to like this game, as it definitely has the RPG charm to it, but its plagued by bad design decisions and rushed development.
<br>
<br>NWN2 does have a fantastic toolset for others to make their own campaigns.

So the question is: Is it better than the first one?
<br>And my answer is: It depends.
<br>In terms of story, character development, and interesting NPCs to interact with, NW2 is by far the superior game.
<br>Although, when it comes to the technical aspect, like performance, stability and gameplay NW1 is the winner.
<br>So in the end, it comes up to what it&#x2019;s more important to you in a video game.
<br>Are you willing to excuse game breaking bugs, fps issues, etc, to experience a good story?
<br>Because that is what it takes to play the main campaign of NW2 (Note: I&#x2019;m note reviewing the expansions here).
<br>If the answer is yes, than Nw2 is an 8/10 game easy.
<br>Although, if you are like me and are unwilling to excuse game breaking bugs that prevent you from progressing without terminal hacks, constant crashes and frame rate issues, I would skip this one.
<br>UNLESS&#x2026;. you buy the game with the Mask of the Betrayer Expansion (Note: the other expansions suck, though).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4365538">Expand</a></span>

I thought the first one was awesome, engrossing, and addictive.  The second one?  I am truly mixed on this, and dissapointed.<br>Where to start?  Well, if i don&apos;t truly have a high end computer, but it still runs it, albeit the choppy frame rate.  I had to tweak down almost everything on my system settings just to get it to run not as choppy.  And to be completely honest, it got to the point that i just stopped playing the game because the graphics just didn&apos;t look all that well.  i am sure if you have a high end baby, that thing would look stunning but not so much on mine.<br>The A.I as previously stated, does have flaws in it, ie; getting stuck on objects, not following combat parameters, and the like.  The key reason i stopped playing it, was because of the camera angles.  Going into a dungeon, i found it hard to keep track of my party and where they were, and on more then several occasions, i had to switch the view around for almost a minute just to see the loot on the floor that i could pick up.  One of my friends, a diehard NWN fan, insisted they were coming out with a patch to fix all the camera foul ups, but i when i installed the game for a second time, i did not see any patch and the camera angles were still terrible.<br>Sound gets a bit tedious, because if you have played the first one, its the same sounds.  You figured after x amount of years since the game has been out they could have updated.  The soundtrack i liked :) but then again i like weird tunes. CONCLUSION: If you have a high end pc, and its in the bargain bin?  Give it a shot.  Maybe a better pc would resolve some of the camera issues.  But i would still say wait until this baby has some patches which fix the camera</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1460677">Expand</a></span>

I wasn&apos;t expecting another Dragons Age or Elder Scrolls but in terms of graphics, game play, plot and character development I was a little disappointed. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the storyline is well written and the ability to create and edit within the game is excellent but there are more modern games which have surpassed this one.</span>

In my first playthrough I encountered 2 game breaking bugs (one where I had to load from an old save to progress, another where I had to use the console to spawn a particular npc); as well as dozens of small glitches, AI glitches, graphical glitches, quest glitches. The story and characters are decent enough but this game was clearly not put through enough QA and is essentially a beta build.
<br>
<br>As to gameplay, there are some fundamental flaws with the D&amp;D engine that take away from the fun, for example the massive length of time it takes to buff your characters and the needlessly complex character statistics and crafting system. Yes, the game can be really fun but you have to really work for it. For every awesome battle or story arc there is just as much time spent micromanaging inventory and sitting there waiting for buffs to cast.
<br>
<br>As far as plot goes, some of the characters and store were really well done, but the writing is VERY inconsistent and more than one occasion some of the characters said something that literally made me cringe. At one point a character makes a fart joke and then EXPLAINS the fart joke (apparently the devs thought it was too subtle) and then is lauded by two of the other characters for her wit; also while we&apos;re on the subject of writing, can with stop using the phrase &quot;could care less&quot;, it&apos;s supposed to be &quot;couldn&apos;t care less&quot;, this was used at least 3 times in the campaign.
<br>
<br>There is the core of a great game here somewhere, and if you have the patience and don&apos;t mind using the console occasionally then it&apos;s worth putting some time into, but there are MUCH better games you should look at first. If you haven&apos;t played the first NWN or Dragonage then you&apos;re better off checking those games out first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3243839">Expand</a></span>

For example I meet dwarf on road and am do everything to kill him or avoid to join my party but he always do it. And worst from that he always resurrect and heal when am throw him into battle, where only one npc I want to have in team  died at beginning without any possibility to save her. This completely ruin my concept of how play game, because I don&apos;t have any choices. Many things in interface and movement are awkward, sometime am even losing control of movement like this game wants to play itself and you only disturb it. Some dialogs are funny but that is strange dark humor. Definitely I wouldn&apos;t say its better from Baldurs Gate heh noo way! When I was on swamp in road to ruins map look like very linear road in shape os circle, when I was inside ruins  again map look the same linear circle. First puzzles and maps looks most dumbed down I ever seen. For example somebody give puzzle where are hidden 3 items. And then you not only known and see where it is, but npc even literally tell you that. For example clue say one is in green, and there is person dress in green, obviously right? Well they made it even more obviously because npc from team tell you: look he is dress green and item is hidden in green you see green and green like you are total fool. Or one is hidden in chest and there is only one chest around and npc near it stand and say it is that chest LOL its so dumbed-down cant believe this! Or one is hidden in wood and you don&apos;t even have chance to think because when you walk near it npc tells you the answer its here! So whats the point to even have this puzzle and any choices when game lead you all the way in everything? Well after am completed quests in first village this should end as lets say some kind of beginning tutorial training map. Thats ok, but after am leave it in real quest this continued, I was unable to do anything my way and must always joint to team this dwarf. And that false options was just ridiculous like you select something like options: I don&apos;t care about him am just walk here, You can kill him its not my business,, I don&apos;t want to talk with you, go away.. and it always result that you save him from some villains (and you cant escape from that map) and become friends LOL Its worst RPG moments I ever seen. Its not just linear but dumbed down linear. Like go to that box and there is only one box which you see and when you come closer somebody tell you: look its that box LOL</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4421824">Expand</a></span>

This game was Developed by Obsidian Entertainment (one of the worst developers to ever be conceived), and Published by Atari (just in case people assume that the Publisher created the game). Of course this game is terrible! It&apos;s made by Obsidian Entertainment which is infamous for developing sequels in RPG series going to slow and releasing them with half content and don&apos;t bother patching any of the bugs. When they try to create their own games (i.e. Alpha Protocol) It still sucks, they released that game too with half content and many bugs. Also they can never create an original game even if it&apos;s a sequel in a series they should add their own touch, but no they don&apos;t. The worst part is they fail at playing safe too. Obsidian Entertainment is an abomination that should be purged from existence!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1544064">Expand</a></span>

Many bugs, even at this late date, a horrible camera that has to be seen to be believed, perhaps the worst AI ever invented, the list goes on an on.  It&apos;s tragic because there is a good story behind it all.  But the execution is painful to behold.  This game is an excellent reminder that what seems &apos;cool&apos; to game designers isn&apos;t always fun to play.  They would have been better off doing less but doing it better rather than trying to cram every cool feature from the D&amp;D rulebook and creating a god awful mess.  A serious disappointment, even only paying $10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1556370">Expand</a></span>

What was a mediocre game with dull combat and a cliche story now feels like a beta from the 90&apos;s. I completed the quests but it glitched out and doesn&apos;t know it. It doesn&apos;t keep more than one auto-save and leaving and coming back doesn&apos;t fix it, so I just have to start back from the last time I saved. But the combat is so easy you never die, so why save every 10 minutes? It&apos;s BS. Camera is crap. The sounds are dull. In the the previous iteration when you paried your swords would match and send off a spark. Fighting was faster paced and the pop up directional tool tip menu was awesome&gt; I had a lot of fun disarming, knocking down, then triple jump kicking poeple as a monk. Somehow this game ended up a lot worse in terms of interface and playability. That&apos;s where all the points go.

I had been looking forward to this game for years, only to find that it is the worst D&amp;D game in the Black Isle/Bioware/Obsidian line to yet be released. Boring gameplay, lackluster graphics, linear design with virtually no side quests or other optional activities, awful AI, flat, cliched NPCs, counterintuitive interface-- I could go on. The other comments have elaborated on all the problems with this game. I thought that Obsidian showed promise with KOTOR 2, which, despite its obvious flaws and unfinished feel, was a much better game than this one. Hopefully Bioware will do a better job with Dragon Age and Obsidian did with NWN 2. Until then, I&apos;ll keep playing Oblivion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=393782">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> This game is a huge disapointment, the first thing you notice is the woeful graphics, even with a high end system it chugs along creating a disjointed feel. The charater choice system is really crap the faces/hair and races look awful. I&apos;m giving the story line a bit more time and this appears to be the obly saving grace. My advice is don&apos;t buy this game if you liked NWN1.</span>

Unfortunately, these make the game sound good, but I come away with it feeling very dissatisfied. The gameplay is extremely linear. Sure, you can change you class &amp; equipment, but you can&apos;t &quot;choose your own adventure&quot;, so to speak. Everything is layed out for you from the start to the point where you really have no options available to you. You get tons of equipment, but have to sell 99% of it and choose only the ones that fit your profile. These sorts of things make the game fall short on any sort of replaybility or ability to capture your attention for more than a passing fancy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=394868">Expand</a></span>

Even a fighter with great buffs and equipment will be taxed to understand the CR mixture thrown at him. -Cinematics: Terrible, too much, too little PC control, pulled along by the nose and horrible text choices!! You have 4 ways to say yes to a gnome bard joining your group and that is it. &apos;Nuff said. -Conclusion: Play Baldur&apos;s Gate TOSC or TOEE. Vastly superior games in terms of everything that counts to a true DnD fan and not an intellectually nascent Diablo-clone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter-nights-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=395690">Expand</a></span>
