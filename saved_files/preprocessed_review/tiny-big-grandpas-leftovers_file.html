<br>I enjoy physics puzzlers, especially when the terrain can be manipulated in a meaningful way.
<br>
<br>The game screams &quot;INDIE!&quot; but in a good way, from the Central American/Eastern European jazzy music to the graphic novel type graphics. It is irreverent and &quot;different&quot; without trying so hard that it&apos;s like watching your dad dance at a disco.
<br>
<br>It has that &quot;one more go&quot; dynamic down to a &quot;T&quot;  especially as each block move or cut is unique and you can solve each puzzle in any way the engine allows you to.
<br>
<br>Ultimately the game is fun; the vibe is spot on and I hope the developers get to make a bigger game some time soon. Even at full price I will buy it.
<br>
<br>Oh, it&apos;s a kind of 3d 3rd person platformer where you have to make your own platforms and routes by pulling with a rope, pushing with rockets or slicing with a laser. If that doesn&apos;t sell it then I bet you wouldn&apos;t like sharks with lasers either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tiny-big-grandpas-leftovers/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272846">Expand</a></span>

There isn&apos;t much variation in the puzzles (if you could call them puzzles). Sometimes you need to play parts over a few times just to get a laser-cut exactly right, otherwise something you&apos;re creating (say a bridge) doesn&apos;t drop perfect, falls down and is gone for good, leaving you stuck. Worst part of that is that if you&apos;ve collected some collectibles and need to reload a checkpoint, you need to grab those again too.
<br>
<br>On a whole it seems well put together though, but I&apos;ve played demos that kept me entertained longer than this.
<br>
<br>Get it when it&apos;s on sale, the full price is a bit much for this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tiny-big-grandpas-leftovers/user-reviews?user_review_id=4391397">Expand</a></span>

The art and music are memorable and enjoyable. The game play is innovative and unique and the story is, while a bit shallow, enjoyable. The comic style art was flawlessly executed. The game simply looks good. From the open areas bright areas to the enclosed dark ones, the art style never fails to deliver. Visually, the game is wonderful. The soundtracks fit in perfectly with the game. I enjoyed almost every track. The game play is what really grabs you. The slicing, pulling and rocketing is an incredible mechanic that gives you unrivaled flexibility in the game. Since almost everything can be manipulated, it gives new meaning to &quot;the world is your playground&quot;. You can choose the paths the developers created for you and drag a block here and cut a block there or have some fun, explore and be creative. This is where the game shines. That being said, one big gripe i have about the game play is the controls. The movement feels very clunky and when you&apos;re trying to inch along a narrow beam, you&apos;ll frequently accidentally step too far and die. I&apos;d say 80% of my deaths were these kinds. Luckily its no huge deal since the respawns are instant. No load times between deaths, no nothing. Just bam! There you are. And the checkpoints are frequent enough that dying is far from the end of the world. The game does get a little repetitive if you try to play it all in one sitting. If you take this game in pieces, you&apos;ll enjoy every bit of it. The story is incredibly simple but gains a surprising amount of depth. It is simply this: You are Tiny, your brother, Big, stole your grandpa&apos;s magical underwear (and has decided to wear it on his head) and has gone a bit nuts. You have to get to him and take your underwear back. In the last level, the game actually develops a bit of depth and all the stuff around you starts to have some meaning. It was a surprisingly pleasant discovery. The ending is pretty good too. Not the greatest I&apos;ve ever seen but good. Overall, for delivering a fun and memorable experience, I give it an 8. 2 points were docked for the minor control issue and the occasional feeling of tedium.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tiny-big-grandpas-leftovers/user-reviews?user_review_id=2824067">Expand</a></span>

The psychics works well enough and its fun to cut things up with your laser, but it gets old really quick and the puzzles aren&apos;t challenging enough. The platforming do work alright but later in the game when a faulty step can set you back to a checkpoint that you passed a few minutes earlier you start to notice all of the flaws with the platforming. I dont want to sound to critical since i did enjoy my time with the game but there is room for improvement. Its still quite cool to cut up gigantic rocks thrown at you in midair and if you are looking for a short, cheap and interesting game i would absolutely recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tiny-big-grandpas-leftovers/user-reviews?user_review_id=2660262">Expand</a></span>

Combining these tools you are tasked to get back your grandpas old magical underwear, cutting through levels filled with huge rocks, statues and stairways. If you like the artstyle of Borderlands you will find Tiny &amp; Bigs&apos; sandy temples rather pretty. I must warn though that the controls and camera feel a bit slippery in certain tight moments and you might end up dying &quot;for the wrong reasons&quot;. The game is also very short as I completed it in 2 hours. I didn&apos;t try to pick all of the collectibles, secrets etc. though, so if you&apos;re a completionist the game will offer you much more. Also, Tiny &amp; Big is good enough to fool around after being completed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tiny-big-grandpas-leftovers/user-reviews?user_review_id=3195622">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Great and innovative platform-game

<br>- Nice arts, and funny 3D graphic, it remembers Psychonauts

The graphics are disgusting in this game, i know it&apos;s trying to look like a comic, but that doesn&apos;t give it an excuse. To try to hide the bad textures, they devs just added tons of black lines to everything which ends up just making it look worse. The game also prides it self on its supposed awesome indie music. I personally couldn&apos;t stand listening to any of the tracks provided and found myself deliberately not picking up the music tapes so i could play in peace. On top of this, the story is incoherent and boring. the controls are unintuitive and I&apos;d often find myself doing one thing when i meant to do another. Add this to the strange bug where your character won&apos;t walk in a straight line when going up or down an incline, just makes moving around a chore. The worst part of the game however is its camera, which is downright terrible. The character is placed so close to the crosshair, that it&apos;s incredibly difficult to see what&apos;s going on right in front of you, and this makes certain segments of the game immensely frustrating, especially one of the arcade minigames. Overall, it&apos;s not a terrible game, but it&apos;s definitely not a good one either. It gets a 4 because at no point in the game did I enjoy myself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tiny-big-grandpas-leftovers/user-reviews?user_review_id=3210336">Expand</a></span>

<br>The difficulty scales pretty well too :D

<br>Tiny and Big could use a sandbox mode where you just place WHATEVER you want. That would make the game 10x awesomer :D</span>

The graphics are pretty cool, but that&apos;s not what most people play games for. The puzzles are repetitive and dull, and don&apos;t ever seem to use Tiny&apos;s arsenal to its full extent. The controls are awkward and almost broken, and it is riddled with glitches. I was bored most of the time.</span>

When I look at it in my steam library, I don&apos;t really want to play. Yes, the game shows some original mechanics, which can be really cool and funny, but I don&apos;t think it saves the game at all. I think 5/10 is what I feel.</span>

Yes, this game is very short and can be beaten in just  a few hours. But should that take away from the overall experience? No! The price maybe...actually definitely the price, but certainly not the experience. The artistic style is simple, beautiful and gives off a nice &apos;Playstation 2 in High Definition&apos; feel to it, and the soundtrack is very reminiscent of &apos;LittleBigPlanet&apos;; two of the most refreshing aspects of the game. And I don&apos;t know about you, but I needs me some good songs when I be platforming.
<br>
<br>The idea of finding songs is also a great way of encouraging exploration; something most newer games still don&apos;t get right. There is no voice acting, only grunts and groans like in the early &apos;LEGO&apos; games, but this only adds to the overall retro feel of the game. And the whole &apos;cut-anything-you-want-to-get-to-where-you-need-to-go&apos; thing also reminded me of the original &apos;Red Faction&apos; game; which is a very good thing. So overall, for a game where you search for lost pants, it&apos;s definitely worth playing through, if only once. Fans of older platformers will definitely appreciate this one as well as there are several aspects from games long forgotten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tiny-big-grandpas-leftovers/user-reviews?user_review_id=4926531">Expand</a></span>

The game also has small side quest&apos;s in which you can collect all the mix tapes or collect all the &quot;boring stones&quot; in that mission/level you are playing on. If you have a laptop and the controls are a bit hard for you. You can always switch to a controller since the game supports it.

                                        <span>A fun little puzzle/platformer style game with some unique tools that help allow the player to reshape the environment.  I played the game with a keyboard and mouse and had some trouble negotiating a few of the trickier jumps. The game is quite linear and you can&apos;t back-track so if you miss a secret too bad.  Overall, it&apos;s a short, inexpensive but fun indie game to while away some free time.</span>
