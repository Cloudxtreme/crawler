Yeah, it was pretty tedious and annoying, wasn&apos;t it? Thankfully, Warlock: Master is a civ-style turn based strategy game all ABOUT the combat! Gameplay revolves around the 4X style of gameplay (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) and while the game RIGIDLY follows that formulae, the way it does so, combined with a friendly user interface, fantastic graphics and a variety of units with distinct appearances and situational modifiers allows for tons of replayability, completely nailing the &quot;just one more turn&quot; aspect of these civ-style games. The most interesting feature I found in this game, however, is the ability to allow for multiple &quot;worlds&quot; to exist in the maps you generate. These &quot;worlds&quot; are basically separate maps you can access via portals on the main starting map. These additional worlds provide unique or rare resource nodes as well as monster dens that, if destroyed, yield very powerful spells. These worlds, are of course absolutely TEEMING with powerful monsters, to the point where they often overflow into the main map, so they aren&apos;t exactly something you can just claim unprepared.<br><br>Now, time for the breakdown, this score is based on a 10 point system:<br><br>Presentation: 8. Graphics and art style manage to be both cartoonish AND badass, but nothing really unique or too interesting.<br><br>A.I.: - 2. The A.I. is sort of all over the place, no matter the difficulty. Making the game harder seems to just give the A.I. a resource advantage rather than making it play smarter.<br><br>Gameplay part 1: - 4. I&apos;m knocking 4 points off for the hideously bare bones diplomacy system. Or, lack thereof. Every so often a rival player will attempt to extort money or mana out of you, and your ONLY two responses are &quot;WAR!&quot; or to capitulate to their demands. I suppose this was the developers way to try and foster a cut-throat mindset in the players, by attempting to make war an inevitability rather than something that can be avoided. If you aren&apos;t currently attempting to murder the crap out of an opponent, stealing their land to add your glorious war machine, you&apos;re plotting how to.<br><br>Gameplay part 2: +3. I&apos;m giving 3 points back due to the aforementioned &quot;glorious war machine&quot; thing. Because while combat is the sole focus of this game, it manages to be DAMN GOOD. Every battle, every personal campaign I have launched or fought, every one of them has felt like an epic siege. The developers took the combat system from Civilization 4 and 5 and made it actually fun and interesting. For one thing, you can&apos;t stack units on the same tile. a single squad of units is a significant time and resource investment, which means you&apos;ll be handling a siege consisting of maybe 3-5 squads at any given time. That may seem like weaksauce weakness at first, but combine that with the spellcasting system and suddenly you&apos;ve got 2 squads of black minotaurs with VAMPIRIC AXES and immunity to ranged attacks, leveled up and specced for city attacks laying waste to your enemies defensive fortifications while your shamans constantly heal them to full health while you&apos;re waiting for your Apocalypse spell to finish charging. And yes, there IS a spell called Apocalypse, it&apos;s basically the nuke from Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword, except in this case it actually DESTROYS CITIES and is a GUARANTEED one hit kill to any and all units in a 3-hex diameter radius from the epicenter. The only reason I didn&apos;t give all four of those points back is because naval warfare is really... lacking at this point. There are only 2 naval units at this point, as far as I know, and none of them are any good at damaging the various sea serpents that plague the oceans (which incidentally are capable of killing your ships in 1-2 hits) Transport ships are a non-issue, as moving a land based unit onto a water hex automatically spawns a transport ship for them.<br><br>Music/Sound: 0. No points given or taken away for this, as the sound effects and music are exactly what you would expect, nothing spectacular but nothing horrible either.<br><br>Graphics: +1. Looks pretty without bogging down my computers framerate (I have been playing this game on a 2011 Acer Aspire laptop with AMD Radeon HD 6650M graphics card)<br><br>Mics. : +0.5. I&apos;m giving a bonus 0.5 due to the fact that I can skip my opponents turns by clicking the mouse repeatedly. Final Score: 7.5<br><br>So close to perfection, but a few nagging problems keep this game from being perhaps the best 4x turn based strategy game I have ever played. Hopefully the negative elements can be fixed through either patches or expansions. I mean c&apos;mon, as much fun as I have duking it out against the other empires on the field of battle in this game, it would be nice to be able to ally myself with another empire so I don&apos;t feel like it&apos;s just me against the world all the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334442">Expand</a></span>

Do not play if you have anything pressing to do (like eating / sleeping) because you&apos;ll find your eyes twitching and your bladder bursting and realise a) it&apos;s 4am and b) you&apos;ve been playing just one more turn for 6 hours straight. Warlock:MotA is a combat-centric turn-based strategy game that clearly loves the fantasy setting it uses so well. You play as a great mage against a number of other AI controlled mages, each one raising an empire using one of the three selectable races of humans, undead and monsters. The hexagonally tile based world is imaginative, colourful and full of unique touches like portals to different worlds (that you can visit and settle in), and monster-invested caves that spawn evil meanies if left alone. Every unit feels real and unique and can be upgraded with perks through buildings, experience or magical blessings. Trust me, losing a buffed up and beefy veteran can tug at the emotions, not to mention the purse-strings. The magic system and variety of buildings, units and upgrades makes for a deeper experience than first appears and the (almost) constant stream of monsters adds a nice layer of variety. It&apos;s the little things also, like the creeping dread of scouting the land knowing that an ogre or elemental could be hiding under the fog of war. Such encounters, especially in the early game, can prove lethal. There are a few shortcomings, such as the lack of keyboard shortcuts, underdeveloped diplomacy and a poor manual but the game itself plays very well and the &#xC2;&#xA3;14.99 price is bonkers. Also, donkey knights.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2336675">Expand</a></span>

War is also way better. Every unit is useful for quite a while as you can&apos;t afford a big army of the latest units most of the time- their upkeep and cost is going to be way to high. You can also actually work with an ally to defeat an opponent. In civ you hardly ever see 2 vs 1 ganging up on the same screen. More likely your ally is not going to send out any units and will just declare peace on your mutual enemy making your whole plan a waste of time. There are some issues. On normal enemies seem to target neutrals and others rather than you most of the time. They also don&apos;t optimise cites well rather making them jack of all trade places which disadvantages them. They also don&apos;t expand as much as they can (maybe they stop after a certain number of cities or are too afraid of highish level monsters). The lack of any negative side effect of having many cities may mean that when multiplayer comes- whoever has the most cities early on will almost always win- time will tell.

Sure it has some bugs, and AI is not very challenging, but tbh it almost never is, unless it cheats. The game utilizes fine graphic and music, although some units could use a little more details/polygons. The game is really easy to grasp and the mechanics are not very complex, but still the amount of content (building/units/spells/gods/terrain&apos;s types/unit perks etc.) makes it interesting even for folks who already played all 4x games out there. Some features just scream to be developed further, but well, it is as it is. Maybe some mods or expansion can build upon them... This is not Realism Invictus or Fall from Heaven in the terms of sophistication and complexity, but it has its moments. I should also mention that the game works flawlessly so far on my rig - even after 7 hours of game play the time it takes AI to do its turn is virtually the same as it was at the beginning of the game. It crashed on me once (luckily there is an autosave ) when I clicked on a message related to a building in a city I just razed. so I guess the message pointed to some content that was not in the memory anymore. It is a very minor issue thou. There is a demo available, so everyone can check it out before buying. Overall it is a solid game, well worth 20$.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2335507">Expand</a></span>

If you ever played Masters of Magic, this game runs the same concept. You are a great mage in Ardania and want to become the BEST mage. You can do that by several ways (supposedly), and have a lot of units to help you get your utopia. The graphics are nice, the sounds and music are ok, and you can play on very different challenge levels, with more or less enemies and a few customizations for your avatar that make the game more interesting. Now what this game lacks (so far, as I&apos;ve read in the official page that some of this features will be released later) are first and more importantly, a multiplayer (LAN and Hot-Seat at least) option, and from MY point of view, a campaign mode (since you only get to play on the map you created at the moment). Units are varied, but there is only 3 species you can use (humans, monsters and undead). And the units on each are virtually the same, but with special features each (undead are immune to dark magic, for example, but can&apos;t be cured with healing magic). The AI is quite straight forward, and there&apos;s a lack in the diplomacy department (when the NPC mage ask for money or mana, you can comply or declare war, there is no middle point). If you &quot;ask&quot; (demand is the button) something from them, even a little, is war. Once you take the capital, that NPC is dead, and all his remaining cities and units become something like &quot;pirates&quot; (they attack every other creature on the game, except themselves). Here is the winning option I mentioned earlier. You could try to destroy the gods, or become their friend (a pope of sorts, I guess), but so far, all the games I started ended with the heads of my &quot;colleagues&quot; at my feet... If the developers solve this little (but important) things, this game is priceless.  :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2335052">Expand</a></span>

(3) Summary UI elements (Currently you can only see what the town has built by going into that screen and hovering over each hex. It gets confusing once you have upwards of 10 towns. You don&apos;t know which town can build what unit). (4) Objectives path (The game doesn&apos;t tell you how you can win or the progress you are making towards it. You just sorta romp around doing stuff until otherwise dead).<br><br>It&apos;s a decent game with potential. I just hope successive patches will flesh out the content until it&apos;s a better game than what it already is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334742">Expand</a></span>

Aside from being a turn-based hex-map resource management game, they don&apos;t have all that much in common. The Master of Magic comparison is a bit more accurate, because rather than a deity overseeing the development of an entire civilization, you&apos;re a wizard striving for supremacy in a regional conflict. If you really want to compare this game to another of the genre, the best comparison is to the Age of Wonders series. Even the artwork and flavor text are reminiscent of AoW.  That said, this game is on a smaller scale. It&apos;s streamlined, in some cases perhaps a bit oversimplified. Terrain affects movement, but nothing else. The races, units, and spells are more limited, and you don&apos;t have the same degree of specialization you had with MoM or AoW. At first I found that limiting, for example I didn&apos;t like not being able to stack units. But you can&apos;t stack units in the tactical combat maps of MoM or AoW either, and that&apos;s where all the fun was in those games. That&apos;s when I realized that W:MotA is essentially an entire game devoted to the tactical combat aspect of fantasy 4x games, and started having fun. As with Master of Magic, all maps are procedurally generated, which means there&apos;s not really a story line, but if you&apos;re a real RPGer, you&apos;ll create your own story line anyway. If you loved Master of Magic, this isn&apos;t its successor, but it may tide you over until someone does finally come up with the real thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2521625">Expand</a></span>

Also I think the game is a steal at the current price, it&apos;s easily worth 2x the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2337729">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have enjoyed playing this game more than I have enjoyed any of the Civ games. Maybe I am not high-brow enough? Anyway if you are looking for a fun experience that is easy to learn, but has more depth that you will learn as you play grab this game. But grab the demo first to make sure it is your cup of tea.

Paradox&apos;s Warlock: Master of the Arcane is perhaps the best answer to that question. Warlock takes many of Civilization V&apos;s elements -- a hex grid, combat in which ranged units can shoot across tiles, and the franchise&apos;s trademark empire building -- and turns it upside down with an intense focus on war and many unique gameplay features that harken back to past fantasy turn-based strategy games like 1994&apos;s Master of Magic and 1999&apos;s Age of Wonders.  [CITY BUILDING]<br>Warlock&apos;s city building is among the best I&apos;ve seen in the genre. As opposed to Civilization V&apos;s cities which are always visually represented by one hex no matter how many structures they contain, in Warlock structures are individually placed on free hexes within your city&apos;s boundaries. Better yet, some hexes contain special resource nodes on which unique structures can be placed for special bonuses.  [SPELL CASTING]<br>Rather than spending time researching technologies like in Civilization, in Warlock you research a wide variety of spells that you can cast on any turn to try and tip the odds in your favor. These range from offensive spells like fireballs and shadow bolts to defensive ones like melee and ranged resistances. There are even support spells that can be cast to summon friendly units that remain until death -- upkeep and all. [QUESTING]<br>Questing is a staple in most fantasy titles and here, it&apos;s implemented brilliantly. At certain intervals in the game, sometimes even at the very beginning, you&apos;re assigned quests which task you with either killing one or more monsters, constructing a building in one of your cities, or even founding a new city in an allotted number of turns. Upon completing these quests, much like looting monster dens, the rewards range from extra resources to brand new units. Although failing some quests results in no penalty, others give you a slap on the wrist by decreasing your status with the gods -- something that seems insignificant at first but can cripple you later in the game once you gain access to powerful spells that require a certain standing with the gods to cast. I would have liked to have seen a greater variety of quests, but I think they work to improve the game by giving you even more incentive to continue playing for just &quot;one more turn.&quot; [DIPLOMACY &amp; VICTORY]<br>One area in which passive players might be put off by Warlock is that of diplomacy. Although rival mages do exist, most of your interactions with them will consist of handing over resources when they demand them or engaging in all out war. Non-aggression pacts can be formed by handing over some mana or money and you can make demands of your own, but those are the only alternatives at your disposal. In most games, expect brutal wars sparked by ridiculous resource demands that would put you in the hole if you were to follow through with them. Although there are victory conditions that don&apos;t require demolishing the empires of others, because of resource demands alone you&apos;ll need to maintain a powerful economy to meet them. [PRESENTATION]<br>Presentation-wise, Warlock delivers on all fronts. Its interface is clean and streamlined, the game&apos;s visuals are colorful and detailed, unit animations are fluid, and the voice acting and soundtrack are top notch. The game&apos;s engine performs outstandingly, too, delivering high frame rates even on large maps with multiple rival mages and alternate worlds and tons of activity. [CONCLUSION]<br>In some ways, it&apos;s hard to believe the quality of product Paradox has published for just $19.99. Warlock is an addictive, charming game that&apos;s just as fun to look at as it is to play. I can&apos;t recall the last time that I was so engrossed with a strategy game, I sat down to play for just an hour or two and found myself still glued to the computer in the wee hours of the morning. Although it could be improved in some areas, especially documentation and diplomacy, and is oddly missing features such as the ability to demolish buildings, Warlock&apos;s developers have managed to beautifully merge Civilization V&apos;s look and feel with the magical nature of older titles like Master of Magic while implementing many unique ideas of their own. Although multiplayer is currently missing, the developers have stated that they&apos;re considering implementing and including it for free in a future update. Needless to say, unless you&apos;re pinching pennies and refuse to play any turn-based game from which Sid Meier&apos;s name is absent, Warlock is an absolute must-play. For every bad taste pathetic past efforts have left in your mouth (Stardock&apos;s disastrous Elemental: War of Magic comes to mind), this one offers a nice, big glass of water to rinse it all out and then some.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2337835">Expand</a></span>

And I&apos;m saying this as a lifelong fan of Civilization titles. The battle is practically the same, but with the addition of damage types and wide range of hp points for units, which makes for a surprisingly better tactics. There are a lot of spell, and in my opinion, the balance of gold/research/food/mana production is done much better than in Civ V. There is no penalty for expanding here! And dynamic and shifting god favor is quite nice - and adds real weight to gameplay. Diplomacy is not as advanced as in Civ IV - but better than in Civ V. All in all, it is a very solid and enjoyable game. I find myself going back to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2337012">Expand</a></span>

The graphics and animation are superbly executed. The computer AI seems to &quot;gang up&quot; on you and there are a few quirks with the diplomacy feature that I wish were included (like the ability to negotiate for alternative goods / resources than just the ones that are requested by opposing characters. If you don&apos;t give them exactly what they want...WAR!). There is no unit stacking so battles are played out on the world map. I thought I was going to be disappointed by this as I&apos;m a huge fan of the Master of Magic micro battles, but this lends to the games pace and allows you to get to &quot;the next turn&quot; where your kingdom and battles continue to develop. Overall this game is a steal for $19.99 and FAR better than the last offering. If you&apos;re a fan of high fantasy and CIV games in general this ones worth your cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334593">Expand</a></span>

Warlock: Master is a Civ style fantasy romp that can definitely be described as a &apos;just on more turn&apos;  experience if you&apos;re a fan of the turn-based genre. It&apos;s quite a simple game with some lovely variety, there are some slight balance issues (ie: once you get the big scary units you&apos;ll own the opposition), but I quite like this about the game.<br><br>I am a fan of the genre however so will be slightly biased towards this game. I&apos;ll say for certain though that I preferred this to HOMM and a lot of the other fare out there competing with this, and for the price tag, this is some good bang for your buck if you&apos;re into turn-based games and are an old fantasy fan like myself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2338594">Expand</a></span>

The only (minor) detraction is that the pocket planes are too hard. By the time you can tackle them, you can completely obliterate the computer.</span>

It takes half an hour to get accustomed to the mechanics, then you&apos;re away. I&apos;ve been exploring a few games to get my strategy fix, and can happily say I&apos;ve found what I&apos;ve been looking for. Wasted 10 hours this weekend and would gladly waste 10 more if I didn&apos;t have to work tomorrow. Some reviewers will say the game lacks depth, and they&apos;re right, but I like what they&apos;ve built. The game is streamlined in places where it makes sense and is really elegant and liberating. One example is the ocean travel system. If you have a unit that needs to cross water, just walk it to the shore and next turn it will build its own boat and take to the seas. No building a dockyard, then a transport, then loading the transport. This is daring, and ingenious. Basically, Warlock gets out of your way so you can engage in tactical fighting non stop for hours on end. No doubt it will lose its pull a bit quicker than some deeper strategy games, but I really don&apos;t care at this point because I&apos;ve already gotten my $20 worth and will do so five times over. Grab it and enjoy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2826767">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s fun, it&apos;s simple, it&apos;s inexpensive. Yes it can become a little tedious with the massive amount of troops that you can generate, but all in all, it&apos;s a fun little game. I haven&apos;t gotten the DLC yet for this game, and am looking forward to trying that out. Cheers!</span>

<br>
<br>MY ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM MAY 25 FOLLOWS:
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been a big fan of old school Master of Magic from the mid-90s and been trying to find a suitable modern replacement since. This is probably the closest that I&apos;ve come across, although it still has some flaws that keep it from being a full love. It plays like Civ with magic versus its own style. The good: City management, troop management, magic research/casting. The game flows well, and runs smoothly. The bad: Combat stinks and naval/sea is horrendous. Combat is unpleasant since there is no unit stacking (a huge negative, imo), no tactical fighting (a la MoM), and very limited magic casting to support a fight. Also, there is DLC with some hero options, but otherwise there are no hero units available. Honestly, there can&apos;t be enough bad things said about naval. The buildable units are weak, and you are constantly bombarded by sea serpents that are impossible to counter and eliminate. The strongest available naval unit, the Galleon, dies easily and can&apos;t be buffed or spawned fast enough to actually do anything worthwhile. As others have noted, there&apos;s really only an extermination option available as a victory path. I could theoretically cast the Unity spell to win, but it kept getting cancelled by the other wizards, and there&apos;s no way to buff yourself or the spell up higher to avoid the cancellation. With a few balancing issues corrected (notably naval), I&apos;d give this a strong 8 or 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2429638">Expand</a></span>

Those craving tons of death will be a little disappointed. But what the game aims to do it does really well. Which is provide a strategy game with a fast pace that focuses more on action and exploration. I only count off for a few rough spots like lack of some common settings, and a few annoying bugs. It&apos;s well worth the cheap 20 dollar asking price however.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2338273">Expand</a></span>

Probably the best value for money game i&apos;ve ever purchased. Because the game is so completely wonderful in every aspect it&apos;s hard not to simply want MORE, more info in the interface, more data about the civilization, better visibility of unit attributes in specific game-play states - but these features few other games of the same genre have put forth so it certainly doesn&apos;t go against Warlock for overlooking some interface elements.  Diplomacy doesn&apos;t really make a lot of sense, but i tend to ignore that section of the game. I don&apos;t think there is multiplayer. Diplomacy and multiplayer are 2 things i am absolutely not interested in however so this is not a drag. If those things are important to you, don&apos;t expect to have them in Warlock.
<br>
<br>To write Warlock off simply as a &quot;Civ Clone&quot; would be to deny yourself the enjoyment of one of the greatest &quot;4x&quot; games ever compiled.
<br>
<br>Another important point to make is the degree of DLC that has been released since launch, and at micro pricing ($1.99-$2.99USD).  A number of patches have also been released, though i hadn&apos;t noticed any of the bugs they were fixing. The most recent patch was 3 weeks ago, so they&apos;re supporting this game over 8 months since release, that seems pretty cool.
<br>
<br>I hope they make another one and i hope it&apos;s pretty much the same, but with MOOARRR STUFF.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2907865">Expand</a></span>

If you are a fan of the Fall From Heaven mod for Civ 4, then this game is probably not for you.  The Civ games are far more in depth with city management, but this game does its job if you just feel like relaxing on the couch, watching some TV and playing a lite strategy game.  For me, it&apos;s nice to take a break from the micro management of the Civ games and play something like this where you can just beat up on some other Great Mages (basically factions).  As long as you aren&apos;t looking for a Fantasy version of Civ, then you will like this basic strategy game at a cheap price.  Hopefully, in future DLC&apos;s or updates they will expand on things like Diplomacy, AI, and give the players the options for a more in depth game.  This series could really benefit from the player deciding how much micro management they want in their strategy game, since the framework for a basic game is there and works.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2460726">Expand</a></span>

Taking the role of a Great Mage, the player fights for supremacy in a randomly generated world. The game inherits the impressive lore of the Majesty games, thus giving all the creatures ingame a background that helps the players immerse themselves in the role of the Great Mage. When first starting a game, the player will notice a good world customization gui: size, type of map (islands, continents,..) number of Great Mages and parallel worlds are all configurable to the player liking. When thrown ingame, veteran players of Civilization V will feel right at home: infact, the similarities with said game are many, from the hexagonal map to the Gui, almost anything seem to recall (and perphaps revere) the Hydra of turn games. There are three races in WMA: humans, beasts and undeads. The humans are the usual civilization, comprehending all kinds of classical medieval/renaissance units: so knights, cutthroats, catapults, and so on. The Beasts are an inusual alliance between many different creatures: goblins, werewolves, minotaurs, but also gnomes and dragonkins. Finally, the undeads are what you will expect: skeletons, zombies, vampires, and all kinds of evil creatures you may think of. The races are different not only aestethically, but also in creatures stats and building. In every city is possible, after reaching a certain population, to build certain structures. The structures must be phisically on a tile, thus adding an other strategic variable (What should I build? Where should I build? Is it better to build this city near this one, so I&apos;ll colonize this island rapidly, or should I build it farther, granting me additional space in a few turns?) Every unit in WMA will gain skills through experience (may it be from killing evil creatures or to skill/spell related benefits). Note that the skills are all stackable, letting you create true war machines, so powerful they can destroy entire enemy armies. This, along with the one unit per tile limit, in some way discourages the creations of enormous armies, encouraging the possesion of few powerful units that compensate each other. Just think at the Holy Trinity: Tank, Dps and Healer. However, nothing stops the player from ammassing an impressive army, maybe through spells. Yes, because there are LOTS of spells, in WMA, ranging from the classical fireball, to city blessings, to armies evocations. There are multiple ways to receive the spells: research, quests or events. The spell-tree, though, isn&apos;t completely clear: there are always 5 possible spells to research, but seems that there isn&apos;t any correlation between the previous and the next ones, forcing the player to choose randomly between the available five. As said, there are also quests, usually concerning the disposal of an enemy unit. Quests can be given by people of the realm, or by the gods themselves: there are, infact, 8 gods in WMA, each one with its own avatar and special units. Through ingame actions the player can influence its relation with the gods, granting their benevolence (and thus units and resources!) or their hate (that can even bring the god to declare war on the player! And that is one though opponent;) However, despite the good general gameplay and the vast variety of units, buildings and events, WMA suffers from a lack of AI, that isn&apos;t really challangening even on the highest level of difficulty, just sending in waves of units, more or less experienced, to their demise. Technically speaking, WMA shows good graphics, rich in colors and mildly detailed, with nice artistic choices (love the Count Werewolves and the Magic Towers!). In the end, WMA is a good game, taking all the epic feel that 4X games give, and adding its own flavour. The deficitary AI and the few bugs are easily resolvable through patches, and if the future DLCs will add additional civs and features, then we will really have a game to remember for many years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2371330">Expand</a></span>

I saw the x-mas special on steam and downloaded the free demo which got me addicted. Download, installation of the full game were easy on Steam. This game really makes you feel like a great Mage and you have to use all the resources at your disposal to conquer the world. If you like Civilization or Master of Magic, you will fight a great variety of monsters, discover treasure or spells in lairs, do quests for rewards, decide which gods to align with, hire and customize heroes, buy magic items from traveling merchants and explore portals to dangerous parallel worlds. Your units will gain experience and perks. Combat is interesting and highly strategic despite no unit stacking. Your enemies will just not waltz in and capture a non garrisoned city.  The city will defend itself and it will take several turns to wear down its defenses using infantry or ranged or magic before capture. A single unit will rarely be destroyed in one single combat, and terrain like forests or hills will give great defense bonuses especially with unit perks like cover specialist. The rock paper scissor principle applies in building your forces, geography can be altered by creating volcanoes in enemy territory, raising or lowering land,creating dead lands or fertile lands.  I find the combination of strategic planning and random game events great fun. Each new game also takes place in a randomly generated world and you can customize many parameters. For your gaming money, this game offers IMO one of the highest fun to price ratio. My first game took me away from Skyrim for35 hours, and I won it by capturing a certain number of holy grounds. Nuff said.
<br>
<br>This game plays well, is not buggy, you will not feel you are managing an excel chart. It appears to have been designed with lots of game play testing and debugging, by a small company with lots of Russian sounding names and I wish them good luck in their future projects if they keep focusing on quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2864775">Expand</a></span>

The combat is the main focus, cities are much simpler then Civilization but the variety of units, promotions, and potential buffs make combat really interesting.  The fact that the 4 different races are COMPLETELY different is also a nice change from Civ.  I personally preferred playing the undead, where you don&apos;t really need to make food at all, most of your troop maintenance is taken from your mana supply.  It&apos;s nice touches like that which give this game it&apos;s charm.  Mind you the creeps can be tricky when you&apos;re first learning, especially those greater fire elementals, but once you figure out the game there are ways to deal with everything.  There have also been a number of patches since I started playing, the last patch added terraforming spells which I thought were super cool.  I love the idea of covering the land in blight (zerg style) or being able to create water/mountains to form choke points for defense.
<br>
<br>Complaints would be two fold:  Random tech tree can be frustrating, certain spells are so helpful I just don&apos;t see how this would be balanced multiplayer.  Ice prison in particular trivializes fire elementals and your rate of expansion can be greatly affected by how early you get this spell.  Second complaint is the AI is pretty stupid.  It&apos;s challenging enough on hardest setting but only because the AI cheats so bad.  He basically has infinity units.  Still, I wasted a good number of nights playing this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874023">Expand</a></span>

There are always monsters coming at you, so there are never really boring or waiting parts. A lot of units and spells to discover add up to the fun of the game. Definitely recommend.</span>

<br>I&apos;d give it an 8 except I got it for so cheap on Steam that I have to give it a 9.

<br>No simultaneous turns in MP. Very sad.
<br>
<br>Other than that the only real critique I have is that there are only 3 (+1 DLC) factions with not really that much buildings and units. Could be a little bit more complex with a Civ like tech tree, or in general greater unit progression.
<br>
<br>All in all decent game. 8/10</span>

Firstly, I play with the three DLC (total cost under &#xA3;5 for all three)  so my review is based on that. But even the core game has been updated and improved almost beyond recognition (play wise). From patch 1.2 to today (1.4.1) the game has improved a lot. More spells, better AI, better landscape creation, powerful allies to recruit, better tactical options, economy while still simple has now been enhanced (landscape now plays a part as well as many other factors). But above all it is engaging and FUN. You never feel the need to drill down to absurd levels of micromanagement. Tactically it is superb. The number and variety of spells, the freedom to complete the game in so many different way. I completely understand all the paid reviewer scores that came out at the games launch, I agree with them all. As the game was at launch   that is what it was worth.  However, If it was released now  as patched, tweaked and improved as it is today, it would get high 80&apos;s from most publications and low to mid 90&apos;s from those ezines that were more &quot;tactic and strategy&quot; orientated. A gem (BTW the GUI is not from Civ 5 it&apos;s from the Elven Legacy series which predates Civ 5 by several years)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334799">Expand</a></span>

This game is more &quot;Age of Wonders&quot; than Civilization and although it&apos;s quite rough around the edges (such as a lack of simple map grabbing and scrolling - which is an issue with multiple monitors, and overly simplistic diplomacy options) the developers seem intent on evolving the game with input from the player community.

Building cities and expanding them is fun, upgrading units is nice. It has user friendly UI and has this important property, that you want go to another turn. Great replay value. Each new game can be rewarding.</span>

This is probably one of the best fantasy 4x type of game out there and i am sure with a few patches this game can become even better.

It is a combat-focused 4x game with elements of master of magic thrown in there.  The game mechanics themselves are quite well done and it&apos;s interesting to see the range of spells, units, and upgrades available.  Basically, the core of a good and fun game is there.  It&apos;s not very complex, which is both good and bad, and, yet, is satisfying to play.<br><br>However, the one aspect where this game fails quite miserably is the AI.  After playing about 6 hours into the game now, I can surely say that the AI, even on the highest difficulty level, is passable at best.  It makes far too many mistakes and doesn&apos;t understand some key concepts about how to play the game.  It can be suicidal and stupidly aggressive, losing massive amounts of units for no real reason at all.<br><br>Because of the AI, this game is pretty much going to sit on my desktop, unused, until it is addressed.<br><br>So, if you are one like me, who feels that a competent AI is needed to make a good game, then I&apos;d say wait on this.  Hopefully, future patches will address the AI issues and this game will become challenging.  If this does happen, I would easily put the ranking up to an 8 or, possibly, even a 9.  It has the core ideas down, it just needs the AI to back it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2406480">Expand</a></span>

The AI is cripplingly bad, and even the hardest difficulty is fairly easy.  With some better AI and just some minor tweaks to the gameplay this could be a truly great game.  As it is it&apos;s still very fun.</span>

I did not enjoy this game, I would not recommend it. The game attempts to emulate popular playing styles of other 4X strategy games such as Civilization and Master of Magic, however it falls drastically short of presenting itself as even a low budget clone of these strategy greats. If you have never played any decent turn based strategy game then you might enjoy this one. The only reason I can consider this game would have so many positive reviews is due to the generation of gamers it plays to as it&apos;s target audience. I don&apos;t think a hardcore, serious, die hard or enthusiast gamer would enjoy this cartoony rendition of turn based strategy. If you are looking for a decent 4x turn based strategy game, I would recommend Master of Magic for fans of old school games and a variety of mods for Civ 4 for more modern players. Unfortunately there are no mods for Civ 5 in this area that I am aware of but hopefully there will be in the near future. I would appreciate the team that made this game a lot more if they had just incorporated their designs into a Civilization 5 mod, as a stand alone game it does not hold up to my expectations of a strategy game; the lack of depth in the game makes me feel like I am playing a mod that was rejected.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=3637678">Expand</a></span>

Simply put, this looks and plays very much like a CIV V clone in a fantasy genre.  This is no where near as polished as CIV though.  Graphics look nice, management of resources can be a pain, no in game encyclopedia to explain things, AI cheats... A LOT, random monsters appear on your city doorsteps all the time, no stacking of units, and combat system is mediocre at best.  After several hours of play, I have found almost no use for gathering large amounts of $ in game to buy off builds faster.  Had this been a more polished game, specially with key command shortcuts to make ease of use better, I would rate this higher.  Audio is acceptable, you have the same narrator as with all the Majestic games with his silly Sean Connery accent (which was funny the first game, and boring by now), the &quot;tutorial&quot; in this game is a joke.  Its good for a quick CIV like Fantasy sim game, but definitely not worth more than $5 with everything included.  Oh the DLC adds uber units which you can customize a hero to inherit which literally nukes the opposition most of the time, way to overpowered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334818">Expand</a></span>

It took me 1 game to figure it out and 2 to get bored. Unfortunately the focus on warfare has led the developpers to miss out on several key strategy game concepts.
<br>
<br>1) Poor AI: the computers in this game simply suck. They have little strategic concept and will suicide powerful units to take out basic footman. The diplomacy sucks as well, and the ai will break an alliance multiple times, only to renew it again 2-3 turns later (offering you gold/magic each time). Stupid AI.
<br>2) Empire building/planning: theres honestly no real point in planning your empire at all. Little city placement is required and it doesnt matter really what you build in your cities. You focus on a resource and focus on a unit type requiring that resource. Thats about it. Theres macromanagement or micromanagement required when building cities. Oh... I almost forgot: most cities are already randomly placed as neutral cities, meaning you dont have much freedom of expansion. You only conquer them.
<br>3) Research: There are no techs in this game, only spells. You research them and use your magick resource to cast them. Problem is that 1/2 to 3/4 of these spells are just plain USELESS! Honestly why even bother researching something I&apos;ll never use EVER? Early-mid to mid game my spell book just becomes cluttered with useless or outdated spells. Frustrating.
<br>4)Unit commands/strategies: Unit commands are non-existant; move, disband, wait 1 turn, or wait until enemy is spotted. The game spawns enough monsters/ai enemies/levels up ur unit that you find yourself issueing wait commands every 2-5 turns at best. It makes for a fairly boring turn. Theres also little strategic value to units other than their strength (spears do not get bonus vs cav, theres no flank bonuses, etc). Therefore the only useful strategy is to mass and swarm. Somewhat tedious after a few turns (and some 50 units on your side  remember to make the inactice ones wait!)
<br>
<br>Overall, the game concept is great! A fantasy Civ! Unfortunately, the strategy game mechanics are severily lacking and make this game come way short of the actual Civ franchise. I got bored of this game after logging 9-10 hours on steam (as opposed to my 150+ on Civ 5). Its just not a quality game... </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2959803">Expand</a></span>

Instead of research you learn spells; however, there doesn&apos;t seem to be a tree for them so it can be frustrating trying to unlock a specific spell you need. Diplomacy is really shallow and the biggest disappointment in the game for me because you can&apos;t have an allied conquest victory. The non-conquest victory conditions are really hard to complete but hopefully they will allow allied victory in the future. The devs have been hard at work on patches for Warlock and seem to really care about it. Multiplayer was added recent along with hero units and bug fixes. If you enjoy Civ-styled games but want a fantasy twist then this is worth picking up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822790">Expand</a></span>

There are so many thing about it that I love:  The fantasy setting, graphics, gameplay, music,... I&apos;ve played 43 hours worth of gameplay so far, and completed 3 campaigns (they are quite long).  The forums and information available in the manual are both fantastic, so if you&apos;re a turn-based strategy game noob, you&apos;ll be up and running quickly.  For those who have played the Civilization or SIM series, the interface is familiar, yet beautifully streamlined unlike some others.  The game oozes character, from the funny character names to amusing on click dialogues.  Battles are EPIC.  Summoned creatures, money, mana and spells, all there.  This is easily the best fantasy based turn-based strategy I have ever played and one of my favourite games ever, period.  I think it&apos;s destined to be a classic.  If you want a game that&apos;s fun but also makes you think (and you have a few hours to spend) I highly recommend Master of the Arcane.  Oh yeah, and multiplayer is available too, and the developer listens to the community and is constantly making improvements.  Nothing but good things to say about this game.  10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=2553789">Expand</a></span>

Just make sure you know the game inside and out before attempting this game mode as from turn 25 onwards its hell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=3662370">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Few games are updated (much), post-release. For that reason, almost no reviewers update their reviews, post-release. This game has vastly improved, since it&apos;s release. Consequently, the Metacritic score is now *at least* ten points two low. (I added twenty more points, because of the studio&apos;s dedication.)
<br>
<br>The profoundly long list of issues addressed by the developer in the three months since the game has been released can be found here: http://store.steampowered.com/news/?feed=steam_updates&amp;appids=232050 (or search the Steam site for &quot;Eador&quot;, and click &quot;view update history&quot; on the right-hand side of the game&apos;s page).
<br>
<br>How do I know that 175 bugs were fixed? I pasted the list of bug fixes into Word. It was over 200 lines in length. I eliminated those lines that weren&apos;t bug fixes. Each remaining line of text was a bug fix, and there were about 175 remaining lines.
<br>
<br>Should the game have been released without said bugs? Perhaps. (Although, in the Studio&apos;s defense,
<br>it can be extremely difficult to eliminate bugs without widespread bug testing and user testing, for technical reasons.) *But,* the developer has shown extreme dedication in eliminating said bugs. They deserve kudos for that fact. I don&apos;t believe the decision to eliminate the bugs was made by some bean counter--sadly, I&apos;m not sure you could easily make the case to such a person that it&apos;s in the studio&apos;s self-interest to patch a released product. But the studio decided to, anyway.
<br>
<br>Both this game and Snowbird Game Studios deserve your support.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=3285847">Expand</a></span>

Without any unnecessary plot it toss you right into the realm, when you rule your little kingdom. What I do also love about the game, is narrator&apos;s voice  have you noticed?

I highly recommend this game to anyone seeking a fun experience, especially with friends, as the games multiplayer feature allows you to take on enemy lords at ranging difficulties with or against your friends. That&apos;s not all It has another mode known as Armageddon that comes in the form of a DLC which adds a miniature mission based campaign where you and your friends must work together to push back a demonic threat that threatens the land. The DLC brings a very challenging and yet constructive addition to the game itself. Take a look at Warlock Masters Of The Arcane, you will not regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=3247460">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I thought this would be a shallow reskin of Civ, but I was wrong. It&apos;s deep. And wide. It&apos;s honestly the best Civ experience I&apos;ve ever had.
<br>
<br>Instead of researching tech, you research spells. Obviously, you&apos;ll have spells that do damage or buff/debuff, but you&apos;ll also have ones that permanently affect the map or cities. One of the earlier spells enables you to turn water into land, which was immensely helpful. Another makes land more fertile. Another makes your city generate more mana.
<br>
<br>So unit diversity? That&apos;s from resources, like in Civ. But instead of finding iron, you&apos;ll find a minotaur cave or a magic field or an elven village. It&apos;s great. I started off with humans, but by the end of the game, I was fielding elven archers, lizardfolk shamans, massive troll siege units, zombies, liches, elementals, minotaurs, and wolves.
<br>
<br>I struggle to imagine a better Civ combat experience. I suppose I would&apos;ve liked something akin to fighter planes/jets. I suppose I&apos;d like some infrastructure like roads/railroads. But I&apos;m struggling. This game is fantastic. It&apos;s old now and, thus, cheap. If you&apos;re at all interested in games like this, just buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=6338129">Expand</a></span>

<br>First, the point and click of unit control is just so unintuitive, I don&apos;t even know how many movement point I have to take to get to a place, not to mention the unintentional wrong clicking or false route the AI may take, I just can&apos;t bear with this kind of unclear control.
<br>Second thing is the map, there&apos;s no &quot;whole map&quot; view option in this game, and I&apos;m so frustrated to find out that even the option for adjusting the scrolling speed on map browsing is missing...I&apos;m pretty sure a 90&apos;s game may have such a feature, I just can&apos;t tell if it&apos;s intentionally ignored.
<br>If this game was out there in 90&apos;s or early 2k, I might stop whining and try to feel the intense similar to Civ or HoMM or so, but it&apos;s a 2012 game and I believe there are a lot to be reworked concerning UI and gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=4566768">Expand</a></span>

On dirait une vieille bagnole qu&apos;il faut pousser... et cela sur deux configs diff&#xE9;rentes (le fixe avec l&apos;AMD et le portable avec la Nvidia !) et malgr&#xE9; un paquet de patches successifs.
<br>
<br>Forc&#xE9;ment, au moment de la notation, cela s&apos;en ressent... Toujours est-il que ce Warlock (avec son addiction au lock) n&apos;est qu&apos;un ersatz de Civilization 5 transpos&#xE9; dans un monde d&apos;heroic-fantasy. Bon point tout de m&#xEA;me avec l&apos;interface repomp&#xE9;e presque enti&#xE8;rement sur Civ ; mauvais point &#xE9;galement, car la carte est peu lisible jusqu&apos;&#xE0; en devenir confuse. Ce n&apos;est pas le tout de copier : il faut aussi faire les choses correctement et ce n&apos;est pas le cas ici.
<br>
<br>De prime abord sympathique, le jeu finit par ennuyer assez rapidement dans sa r&#xE9;p&#xE9;titivit&#xE9;, son c&#xF4;t&#xE9; bien niais et la r&#xE9;alisation bas de gamme continue de tirer ce petit jeu minable vers le bas, c&apos;est-&#xE0;-dire au niveau d&apos;un simple navet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warlock-master-of-the-arcane/user-reviews?user_review_id=7232046">Expand</a></span>
