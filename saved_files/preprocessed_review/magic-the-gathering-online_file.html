However, Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast have made it clear that their online computer version is not a priority.  Pricing is the same as for physical packs, but digital cards do not appreciate in value like their cardboard counterparts.  The software is riddled with bugs. Magic Online even has a page listing their known bugs, but unlike other computer games, their software team doesn&apos;t view any of these as critical, taking up to a year to remedy.  If one of these issues causes a game or match loss, there is a reimbursement process, but the headache of registering, filing a complaint, and awaiting deliberation is quite the headache, frequently resulting in no form of reimbursement.  Ultimately, if you are looking for a computerized card game , there are better (and cheaper) alternatives available.  It is saddening but Magic: Online is no substitution for actual cards, and it shames the game of Magic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5072808">Expand</a></span>

<br>Now lose every game because,
<br>1. You can&apos;t make a winning deck from those cards.
<br>2. The other players, NOT NEW, they just have New Player Points to spend and want some cards.
<br>3. There is nothing about the game targeted to new players, or casual play.
<br>
<br>Ok lets try a casual game.
<br>Get beat in a hurry.
<br>Make a new deck.
<br>Get beat again.
<br>Try a new format.
<br>Ok you are on round 4 and may have the advantage.
<br>...Your opponent quits because his go to starter move didn&apos;t happen.
<br>One more chance....
<br>Commander, i spent an hour or 2 making a 100 card deck.
<br>... Opponent quits on round 4 because you sent his commander back to his hand.
<br>You go into chat to call him out, and let other players know he is a poor sport.
<br>There is no method of leaving feedback on a player.
<br>Oh you can&apos;t say anything negative in chat about another player&apos;s behavior because it is &quot;harassment.&quot;!!!
<br>... the reason being, that there is no proof to offer, even tho I can watch a replay of the game in questions, i just cant let other players watch it, because then the &quot;poor sport&quot; opponent would feel &quot;harassed&quot;.
<br>
<br>So what do I do now??? I go download Hearthstone and forget I ever played this pile of garbage whose only goal is to bleed it&apos;s playerbase of cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5787263">Expand</a></span>

However, the gameplay itself took some adjusting to, since the program isn&apos;t exactly intuitive. A quick trip to the new user guide on the Wizards&apos; forum fixes that. Another complaint is the New Player section of casual games, which clearly has a lot of people who are neither new to MTG or MTGO. This makes it a hassle to find balanced games at times. All in all, worth the $10, but a bit demanding if you don&apos;t plan on spending more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1749820">Expand</a></span>

<br>Where do you start for something this bad? Lets start with the gameplay. Gameplay is like most TCG. Meaning it&apos;s bad, very bad. Balance among decks are often decided to be &apos;balanced&apos; due to the flawed rock paper scissors ideas that so many games fall into. This means that 90% of games will be decided as soon as you start. If you have the counter to something, you win. If not you lose. The other 10% is decided by the luck of the draw, with both players not counting on skill, but luck to pull them through.
<br>
<br>This creates decidedly uninspiring gameplay, with both losses and wins feeling equally empty and pointless
<br>
<br>Then you have the price. Cards that are worth anything are often more expensive then their physical counterparts, thanks to the infection of bots in the trading. Even then, a second tier pauper (Commons only) deck will cost you anywhere from $15- up to $100. Standard decks cost anywhere from $70-$500. A deck is made up of 75 virtual cards. That isn&apos;t including the $30 a pop events, or the super expensive stuff (There are single virtual cards that sell for over $200).
<br>
<br>And last but not least, the entire client is just.... bad. Those of you lucky enough to be alive during the 90&apos;s, would remember the amount of crapware that came out around that time. Games like Snakes and ladders badly drawn, programmed and shoved onto CD&apos;s to fill up whatever magazine or cereal it was trying to entice you to buy. This game looks and feels exactly like those. Trading is possibly the worst system in any game ever, the entire UI looks like some prealpha rubbish created by a 3 year old on crack, and the thing is generally slow and confusing to use.
<br>
<br>As a final nail in the coffin, is the retarded moderation, the only game, including stuff designed for 3 year olds&apos; which censors out the word &apos;piss&apos;. The entire censorship and over zelous moderators smells of a bunch of 5 year old girls who haven&apos;t grown up enough to realize that people might say and do &apos;Boo boo&apos;s&apos;.
<br>
<br>Actually, scratch that thought. Most 5 year old girls would be insulted to be compared to these guys.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, there is nothing good about this game, nothing, It&apos;s a place for fat nerds to high five each other because they spent waaaay too much money on what is basically a lottery with priddy pictures.
<br>
<br>Avoid at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2616045">Expand</a></span>

<br>MTGO management are a bunch of vampire cockroaches trying to suck every last dollar from the desiccated remains of what was already a skeletal base of players.   One draft a day (~2 hours of entertainment) costs $10... so $3650 a year for this.  Hearthstone is free.  Trying this after Hearthstone was painful.  Worse yet, their program is prone to bugs and crashes that result in you paying $10 and getting screwed halfway through an event.  No returns either.
<br>
<br>Also, from reading forums, MTGO management completely disregards customer feedback.  People say prize payouts used to be way higher, there didn&apos;t used to be a $2 additional entry fee for all events, and things like splitting prizes between the first and second player are intentionally impossible even though this is extremely popular in real life.
<br>
<br>I looked at job postings on their Careers page and it is apparent that whoever is running things is terribly misappropriating resources.  They need WAY more software developers working on this.  There are embarrassingly immature comments posted by many of the higher-ups on forums arguing with players.  They insinuate the blame for all MTGO&apos;s problems lies on the developers but less than half the openings they have are for new development positions.  Way over-managed.
<br>
<br>PS - I&apos;m a huge fan of paper MTG.  The core game is great.  It just got destroyed in translation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4532428">Expand</a></span>

For people that like myself are a long standing Magic player that wants to play online against other people.
<br>
<br>When you start out, you get a bumper starting pack which contains quite a few basic cards, with nearly the entire back catalog of cards available to buy in singles in their virtual formats via external trading sites, or if you want you can buy credits to spend in the shop ingame to buy packs of randoms.
<br>
<br>You have a collection screen that is filterable where you can view all your cards which is  easy to sort through to build your own decks...
<br>
<br>There are various places you can play these decks against others, in tournaments online where you can win cards and player points, There is a cost to enter these tournaments however which can cost you upwards of &#xA3;30 in some cases
<br>
<br>There are other areas where you can play against other people for free in the usual 1v1 / commander and free for all 3way and 4way multiplayer.
<br>
<br>First thing you will notice is how bad the actual client looks, it looks like it was designed and programmed in the 1990&apos;s. The way the screen is represented reminds me of Windows 95.
<br>
<br>Not only does the client look bad, but it also doesn&apos;t function properly, with constant issues with the shuffler performing exceedingly unusual behavior that leads you be at the mercy of it when you play
<br>
<br>The shuffler which according to the very lackluster support is &apos;working as intended&apos; but for any player that has played Paper magic knows it doesn&apos;t resemble a real work shuffle one bit. In fact your win will be dictated by whether the shuffler &apos;decides&apos; you can play or not.
<br>
<br>To worsen this issue the game goes down at least once a week for &apos;server maintenance&apos; that lasts several hours each time.
<br>
<br>The issues with this game doesn&apos;t end there however, just like all online games this game suffers from its fair share of Trolls and Griefers.  The trouble is there are so many of them online on mtgo that you will be hard pushed to find a game that isn&apos;t ruined by some idiot pulling an infinite loop or an instant win card. or just sat there with a deck full of counters, no intention of winning just simple there to make your life miserable.
<br>
<br>Games should be played for fun, simply put Magic the Gathering Online is about as much fun as putting your appendages through a cheese grater.
<br>
<br>AVOID AT ALL COST!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=6809262">Expand</a></span>
