Surely, at this year (2007) Neverend can not compete with all the latest rpgs (oblivion, two worlds ecc); still its not a bad game. the story is short and simple, but not boring: in fact, neverend build a little lovable world, very charming in its traditional-fantasy way. Combat system is intriguing, based on the necessity to balance strenght of the attack with the time they need to prepare. Exploring the world is satisfing, since you can find strange items or monster far from the main paths. In conclusion, Neverend is a little intriguing rpg, fun to play: one of the game that you know are not masterpiece, buit still you remember it as worth the time they took.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverend-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=402533">Expand</a></span>

Neverend would have looked state fo the art about four-five years ago; it would have been a major hit on the Dreamast or PS2, for example. As it is, this game&apos;s strength lies in attractvie prerendered backgrounds, invlolved, non-linear storytelling, a Final-Fantasy style battle system, and some decent voice overs. The Game was a pleasant surprise; after playing it and reading the average reviews, I have to say that the reviewers were strangely harsh in judging Neverend like it is some sort of direct competition to the big guns; it&apos;s just a fun, well-presented RPG for people who like games like Neverwinter Nights, Baldur&apos;s Gate 2, the Final Fantasy games, and such. If you liek flash, then look elsewhere. If you want decent-looking but &quot;older school&quot; with some nice production standards from a small sudio, and especially if your PC rig can&apos;t even run Oblivion (on my PC Oblivion looks like a slide show event), then Neverend is a great buy. Read the reviews on Next Level and Just Adventure, they are a better summary and more accurately review the game than the nuckleheads treating this small-company production like it&apos;s the next Squaresoft/Bethesda release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverend-2006/user-reviews?user_review_id=394859">Expand</a></span>
