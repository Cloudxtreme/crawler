<br>3 basic, pseudophilosophical ideas the game centers on:
<br>contentness, satisfaction, perfection = stagnation, nothing to do, always need new goals
<br>belief should be open ended, you can&apos;t know for certain, shouldn&apos;t hold on to ideology (= anker),
<br>the world is bad and we don&apos;t know much, but we can improve step by step, but need to deconstruct everything first.
<br>These ideas aren&apos;t bad. But they aren&apos;t brilliant, deep or new either and instead of making them sound complicated for 2 hours, one could have added to them differently.
<br>i feel like the creator didn&apos;t read a lot of literature, because these ideas have been done hundreds of times before and much better. It&apos;s not even well-copied for lack of ideas.
<br>
<br>dialogue = simple ideas made to sound complex with naive complication of terms and syntax
<br>also, depressing setting, especially in the beginning, with no justification, needs to be good to be worth it.
<br>
<br>also, tons of game design flaws:
<br>horror athmosphere in the beginning, but nothing ever happens to you, so you ignore the scary feeling.
<br>a train that takes long to go through only to need to turn back, no reward for exploration.
<br>too many long texts scattered throughout the levels that want you to stop to read for a while. especially with Solomon&apos;s notes, that&apos;s too long and not that interesting. this is not a book, but a game.
<br>crab in the last chapter does nothing, you go a long way into a dead-end. takes you a while to realize there&apos;s nothing happening there, then you have to backtrack.
<br>
<br>Dear Esther is the much better game of this exploration story-driven type.
<br>I&apos;m sorry to give this such a scathing review, there&apos;s surely quite some inspiration and motivation behind Leviathan, but the result just doesn&apos;t hold up in any way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-old-city-leviathan/user-reviews?user_review_id=4822005">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- visually this is stunning.
<br>- highly detailed and varied environments, that feel &quot;lived in&quot;
<br>- game has a feeling that much thought and care went into development.  It has heart.
<br>- runs on Windows XP!
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>- the philosophy and amount of reading, especially early on is a bit &quot;dense.&quot;  The game didn&apos;t make much sense to me at first, but as the game progressed this became less of an issue.  So push forward.
<br>- Be aware that the world is not interactive.  You will explore and view the world, but you won&apos;t be interacting with it much, beyond opening doors.  This can be frustrating at first, at least until you understand how things work.
<br>
<br>So yes, I recommend this one for fans of walking sims, but be aware that it&apos;s heavier on reading than you&apos;re likely expecting, and it may be difficult to understand at points - especially early on because your motivation might not be sufficient to want to read pages of text without context.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-old-city-leviathan/user-reviews?user_review_id=6057947">Expand</a></span>
