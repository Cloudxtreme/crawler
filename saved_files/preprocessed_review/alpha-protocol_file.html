Yes, overall &apos;Mass Effect 2&apos; is a better game, but I liked &apos;AP&apos; much more than the flashier &apos;Splinter Cell Conviction&apos;. I hope there will be sequels because when they improve the mechanics and presentation, there will be no better RPGs around. I give this an undeserved 9 for sticking with what matters most (and it ain&apos;t graphics and production values). Go Obsidian! And for Zod&apos;s sake, take care of those bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=747737">Expand</a></span>

This game is highly underrated, and from someone who has played games for over 15 years now, i think it is an injustice to see this game score poorly. The level of engagement in this game, the storytelling, the detailed files and information intelligence gathering makes this game unique and truly satisfying. This is not a dumb persons game. Someone who is impatient(most of the younger generation) and dislikes reading will not enjoy this game. It can be a shooter, but it is a thinking mans spy game with real consequences to your actions. To play a game that TRULY changes outcomes based on your decisions is an enjoyment to play. Thats what makes it so much fun. Make your choice. stick with it. don&apos;t reload or re-save, and carve your own destiny in this excellent game.  Steam has it for maybe 30 dollars right now. This game is for someone who enjoyed games like mass effect, the witcher, baldurs gate, splinter cell. etc. Splinter cell was done well, but was defenitely not as immersive as this game, and wasnt as satisfying. I felt a real connection to the characters in this game and knew my actions would depend on them living or not.  Control wise, the game is passable and not dazzling. but with a story that really gets you immersed, it doesnt matter. texture resolution is high, and gives faces a level of realism that is good. Its not all about flair; its about style, an intelligent story and a deep plot. Its very sad to see games like this not get a sequel because of impatient, brain dead gamers.

Maybe it was the low price, (somewhere between two and five usd, I can&apos;t remember exactly), maybe it was the ultra low expectations, or maybe, just maybe, it was the weed but I really enjoy this game.  Not expecting much, i find it easy to accept it&apos;s faults. Like everyone says, the combat is sloppy (think a poor man&apos;s mass effect, not saying mass effect was anything spectacular), and every once in a while I think the enemy cheats in terms of sneak detection. The story you have heard a thousand times before, and to be completely honest i am only half paying attention to it to keep in context.  To be honest I may have already reviewed this game saying the same things but i just started playing it again and I had to speak of it since a lot of people poop can it (i am not sure if cursing is allowed on here). If you only read about how this game sucks, and assume it sucks, but like the concept of a spy rpg, get it for cheap, you won&apos;t be let down. If you payed 50 dollars for it and were pumped about the game since it was announced i completely understand the low ratings. However if you are curious but wary and don&apos;t expect gears of war 3 with gadgets, or splinter cell with skill points, it is five dollars well spent.  Also, the conversation system beats mass effect hands down. Play this game to see what I mean (4 hours minimum before you make a solid opinion).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115472">Expand</a></span>

The controls are obviously a direct console port, with very little adaptation to the PC. Aiming is the polar opposite of smooth, and it actually has the feel of a controller pointing the crosshairs in the direction you hope to hit. In other words, aiming can and often is a problem. Hit detection will often leave you slightly frustrated. With that said, once you adjust to and forgive this faulty manner of control, the game is quite enjoyable and playable. Alpha Protocol employs interesting interaction between you and many other characters. You will develop a reputation with the NPCs depending on how you react to dialogue. This will alter many parts of the game as you progress. The amount of weapon customization and items that can be equipped is impressive and well rounded. The environments are crafted nicely, and all surroundings look quite good and realistic. The game runs well even in older systems. A positive surprise for a title released in 2010! The hacking minigames (bypassing, lockpicking, and hacking) are well implemented and fun to solve. Espionage is the main thematic focus of the game, and it is realized nicely. Immersion is also done exceptionally well. It is even realistic. Bypassing, lockpicking, and hacking all serve to involve the player deep in the narrative and action. The storyline is very good; comparable to the more developed Hollywood movies of today. The amount of characters you will interact with is wonderful, and they each act entirely different from each other. You will develop an extreme interest for two or three, and be rather annoyed at others. There are three girls that you will interact with that depending on your actions, will be romantic interests of your character&apos;s. Voice acting is done by many different persons, and they all thoroughly exceed gaming standards. Boss battles can be straightforward and curt, but they manage to keep up with how the game progresses and evolves without diminishing the experience at any level. The bosses towards the end of the game are a lot more difficult. The Brayko boss battle is my personal favorite. It&apos;s really cool! All missions are diverse in origin and in their goals, actually having a different feel to them, from one to the next. There are several graphical bugs and glitches. For example, some textures often take one or two seconds to load, but that may be due to my hardware. All is forgiven because the gameplay and story makes up for the game&apos;s developmental shortcomings. Incendiary bombs area great! Use them and abuse them! Alpha Protocol often (60% of the time or more) crashes soon after you quit it, right before it hands over all processes back to Windows. Dossiers add a nice touch of detail and insight as you unlock each piece of intelligence through accomplishments. Reading the dossiers and e-mails prior to missions gives you a better sense of acknowledge and informational power, in addition to some parts of the text being positively humorous. You may specialize your character to tailor whatever playing style you prefer. I personally preferred the combination of stealth with the occasional rifle usage. There should be more games like this. An extensive and branching storyline with lots of NPC interaction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1805169">Expand</a></span>

The soundtrack is good, not excellent but good enough to make you remember one or two tracks, but the voices were chosen to match every character well, very convincing. the graphics are pretty, but a little dull and not so realistic, there is also a delay on the renderization.
<br>but the worse point in alpha protocol is it&apos;s lazy way to use some of its resources and its playability .the controls are slow, and sometimes not respond so well. the way that Mike move around, make he look more like a robot than a agent, the animations are all robotic, even in the &quot;in game scenes&quot;.
<br>Bugs here are common, bullets that pass directly thought walls, enemies here are blind or have the eye of thundera.
<br>well alpha protocol unique, fresh and very good but is more an idea, a prototype, a lot of fans believe this could be an awesome game of the production works better in the weak parts, and maybe use a better marketing</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=4446266">Expand</a></span>

Yes, the developers make flawed games. However let&apos;s look at FNV for a moment, it&apos;s my favorite fallout game. And yes, it crashes and glitches and breaks. However it&apos;s complicated and ambitious, it has detail and quirk. Alpha protocol has it&apos;s own breed of ambition. A more subtle kind. What it does with decision making, rpg systems, and genre mixing is engaging and bold. However unlike new vegas, it feels like a budget game. The movement feels akward, the animation feels akward, the action feels arkward. In a pre-mass effect world, people would be more forgiving. However in this climate of action-rpg melding, xp systems in action games, etc. You have the action fans come in and instantly judge it for what they expect it to be. Rather than what it is. And that&apos;s not their fault either. What the game truly want&apos;s to be is a little hidden. In the end it&apos;s a role playing game - and taken as that, the clumsiness can be forgiven with persistence from the player. However if you are easily offput by production values and a budget feel - you will have already stopped playing this game. And that&apos;s a shame, because it&apos;s got a great choice system at it&apos;s heart.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=2145384">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also a game that you have to know exactly what your getting when you go into it. Alpha Protocol is a pure RPG. It&apos;s not an RPG shooter like Mass Effect, or Third Person Shooter with RPG elements like Mass Effect 2.  A pure RPG. This means that when you shoot with a weapon you haven&apos;t trained in if you, the player, make a perfect shot the invisible maths can make it so you still miss. If you sneak around without points in stealth, no matter how diligent you are, you will be caught. Your stats drive this game as much as your choices. The mechanics of this game are not broken, they are just standard RPG mechanics put in a genre where, if I&apos;m honest, they don&apos;t entirely belong. That said, by the later half of the game you will be sneaking shooting or hacking your way around your chosen field without much problem. Whether you will enjoy this or not is a personal choice, though I find the system to work adequately.<br><br>The choices and dialogues are what make AP shine. They&apos;ve taken Bioware&apos;s Dialogue wheel and Obsidian have advanced their own influence systems, and added their own little twists making interacting with each character both enjoyable and a challenge in its own right. The timed dialogue makes conversations more fluid, reactive and just plain fun.  There are no &quot;bad relationships&quot; with people, hostile influence offer different bonus and can even unlock completely different routes through the game. Speaking of routes, there are so many different possible ways to play through the game and a multitude of different endings (including at least 3 different &quot;bad guy&quot; endings) that replayability is a big plus here.<br><br>Then we come to worst part of any obsidian game. The bugs. Oh boy the bugs. From what I&apos;ve seen I&apos;ve missed the worst of them, but even the relatively tame ones such as the character refusing to stick to the wall for cover, or stick too much and refusing to move in time and be frustrating. Still past the bugs there is a deep, interesting and inventive game that if your willing to accept the rather odd mechanics is well worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1731122">Expand</a></span>

People give it a lot of flak for a variety of problems, and although they aren&apos;t wrong in their criticisms, I personally found those problems minor enough to overlook considering how much fun the game is. The best part about this game is seeing how your dialogue options and choices throughout the game, this is definitely a game that rewards repeat playthroughs. To anybody interested in this game, I would say not to trust the reviews and just try the game for yourself, I think you&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised. I would put this game just a couple of notches below Mass Effect 2 in terms of the enjoyment I got out of it. Decent graphics (especially considering how much people complain about them), fun gameplay, and a great conversation system make this one a keeper.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765980">Expand</a></span>

No alien mumbo-jumbo, but real world, present times, politics, power struggle, black ops, corporations corrupting everything for profit...in a mindblowing story, where you end up drawing diagrams full of connections and relationships between factions, agencies, governments, mafia and their representatives, to understand their intentions and to UTILIZE this in game conversations and choices. Every time you found some little puzzle piece, you will be rewarded. This applies to stealth/combat gameplay sections of game too, where the game properly reflects what player is doing (as in any Obsidian game, I love you guys for this.). This game has the &quot;one more mission and I&apos;ll go to sleep&quot; effect once you get into it. Only thing to prevent you from getting there can be quite slow start and outdated graphics. But it&apos;s definitely worth getting over these.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=2910619">Expand</a></span>

Compare it to, say DA:O, and it`s not exactly an RPGish. Compare it to better installments in Splinter Cell series, and, well you`ll be left wondering &quot;what the hell am I playing? But the story? How it is put together? The sheer amount of interactivity it allows you? And the atmosphere on some levels? Wonderful gem I say, on par with other, older Obsidian`s work. Of course, there are certain problems with the game, and it could use more polish, definitely. But if you had just about enough of slightly nerdish RPGs made for teenagers (admit it, DA:O is one) or overblown, overambitious space-opera FPS-RPG hybrids like Mass Effect, this is the way to go. Something completely new.

The stealth aspect is fairly well done, although it does suffer slightly from enemies having a narrow field of view (meaning you can take out one enemy and another that&apos;s nearby won&apos;t notice unless they&apos;re looking towards you).<br><br>I thought the graphics were very good, there&apos;s a nice number of mini-games to vary the pace (and fortunately you can avoid these if you don&apos;t enjoy them), the story was decent, and thanks to the customisation options and the way stealth was implemented the gameplay was great. The game also lasts a hefty amount of time and is highly replayable.  I only came across a few minor bugs (I think about 3 times in an entire playthrough I&apos;d have a few enemies respawn upon loading an earlier save game), so I don&apos;t feel there are any significant negatives.<br><br>All in all this is a very good and underrated game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1781809">Expand</a></span>

You really feel like  the decisions you make have an impact on the game world and that there are consequences, both positive and negative, for the things you do and say. Some people may not like the dialog system, but I think its absolutely genius! Limiting the time you have to choose dialog responses makes you have to think on your feet and pay close attention to detail. Not to mention, it allows for great replayability of the game. The characters are also really well constructed, each with their own personality, likes and dislikes, that you have to find out to successfully navigate conversations. Voice acting is pretty good too.<br><br>Another large aspect of the game is the RPG element: choosing your skills, specializations, weapon loadout and customizations. Although the interface could use some work, it isn&apos;t the most cumbersome of console-ported interfaces. That said, I think the mechanics are well done. The skill tree is reminiscent of Mass Effect 2 except you have more individual skills to choose from which is nice. I&apos;ve read that the skills can be unbalanced and lead to &quot;power-leveling&quot;, but I&apos;ve chosen to ignore reading what particular skills those are because I like finding out for myself. I&apos;m going to defend the game here and say that unbalanced skills in an RPG is perfectly acceptable; Of course not every decision you make is going to be the right one and that is the beauty of having choices--having consequences to those choices.<br><br>The weapons customization is also slick and adds a good bit of depth to gameplay since you can customize your weapon mods to suit your play style. For example adding a silencer may decrease damage but gives you the advantage of stealth.<br><br>I also like the experience/achievements system which rewards you differently based on your approaches to situations in the game. I never felt like I was missing out by not making a particular choice, because the game would reward me either way, but the rewards would differ.<br><br>Now for the bad parts: Enemy AI is lacking. For example, anytime you sprint, guards have the uncanny ability to hone in on your location. Also, this isn&apos;t Splinter Cell: Enemy bodies disappear almost instantly and guards don&apos;t really get suspicious when you kill their friends as long as they don&apos;t directly see you doing it (or hear you). Also, the alarm system is kind of broken. The game works on a checkpoint system so even if you trigger the alarm in one checkpoint, there are no negative consequences for the following checkpoint area. This means the game is very forgiving when it comes to stealth. Trigger the alarm? No problem, just bust out your assault rifle and kill everybody in the area then continue to the next checkpoint.<br><br>The other large annoyance is the save system. The game uses checkpoints for saves and overrides each checkpoint save when you reach a new one. This can be frustrating when you want to go back in time, only to find your last manual save was 2 days ago because your checkpoints were overwritten. Now when I first found out there was no ability to quick save, I thought it was a stupid design decision. But now, I see that it falls inline with the rest of the game&apos;s design philosophy: You&apos;re choices matter and there are consequences to your actions. Allowing you to quick save whenever you want takes away from the gravity of your actions since you can redo them infinitely without consequence. Overall if I could change it, I would keep the checkpoint system, but have it save each checkpoint separately.<br><br>That said, I think the save system and the poor AI are excusable, given the very engrossing story and the very well executed branching and dialog system. That&apos;s not to say that the action and actual gameplay are not fun in their own right, just that the former elements steal the show. I&apos;m sad to hear Alpha Protocol received such poor reception from the press and initial users, but I hope others will give this diamond in the rough a chance. And just hopefully, Obsidian will be given the chance to do a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1767209">Expand</a></span>

Every choice and dialogue option seems to have consequences an you actually feel like listening to the conversation since you have the think and answer fast when in a conversation like actual people, unlike in other games where you stand there like a cardboard cutout until you feel like answering, possibly checking the wiki and fetching some coffee. **** that, this is the real stuff. Customisation isn&apos;t massive character wise, but you get enough to feel like a spy. Weapons and gadgets are plentiful. I have a lot of fun setting traps for enemies and watching my plan unfold as they walk into electrocutions, mines or my knife. Other times I sneak around undetected. I have to admit that I have only played for 6 hours so far, but that is in one sitting. I was hooked after the first 10 minutes.

                                        <span>Alpha Protocol is an underrated game. It is a true RPG experience where every action you make carries weight. However a lack of polish seems to have put off many players due to outdated graphics, bugs and AI issues. I urge all RPG fans to give it a go and judge for yourself. In my opinion this game deserves a shot.</span>

Especially the characters. The game can be labeled as a spiritual successor to Deus Ex. If you liked that game, most chances you&apos;ll like this one too. In the last years the games industry has entered a prolonged stage of stagnation, and this title definitely breaks that stagnation by bringing something fresh to the market. Not entirely polished, but nonetheless fresh. Face it, if Deus Ex was released today, reviewers would slaughter it, but yet it remains one of the best games ever made.AP spans wide instead of deep and the reviewers don&apos;t like it one bit. There is room for improvement, but not in the most important parts of the game. If the name Deus Ex means anything to you, and if ten playthroughs of it were enough for you, then you should check this one out, and look past the flaws, just like you did with Deus Ex.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=747741">Expand</a></span>

Very few, if any of the professional reviewers appear to have spent any time with this game before they called it bad and moved on. Alpha Protocol is not a bad game. It is not a mediocre game. It is not an okay game.<br><br>Alpha Protocol is a great game. Every decision, literally EVERY decision you make in the game, has a consequence. Whether that decision is letting a young girl live, or choosing to put points into martial arts, that decision will be reflected in the game. Either the girl comes back at a later time, or you smash someone&apos;s face into a table during a cut-scene, instead of just punching them.<br><br>Decisions are what this game is about. Not combat, not stealth, not being a shooter. This game is an RPG first, an RPG second, and an RPG third. The fact that combat is handled with guns from a third person perspective is irrelevant. This game hands you decision after decision, and you have to live with the choices you make.<br><br>Dialogue trees don&apos;t exist. What you have are conversations. If you say something to someone that they don&apos;t like, you don&apos;t get to go back and say something else. They stay annoyed, and the conversation builds off that.<br><br>Don&apos;t think that means you have to play nice with everyone. This game rewards you for everything you do. Did you become friends with all the ladies? Good job, go have sex with them. Did you creep all the ladies out? Tough luck, buddy. Did you piss off a highly trained killer? Hope you like getting shot.<br><br>This game not only deserves a sequel, but it demands it. Any other game that claims your choices matter should take a good, long look at Alpha Protocol, and see if their game holds up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1699044">Expand</a></span>

It is not. In fact, given the caliber of other games in the RPG genre at present it is an absolute crime that Alpha Protocol is not rated better.<br><br>Getting negativity out of the way first, there are bugs, some of them are annoying like one that sometimes crashes the game when trying to reload after they player has died but for the most part these are either avoidable or not a particularly big deal. The controls are very occasionally a bit janky, at one point in the game the post mission summary potentially tells outright lies because of a misplaced trigger and the first couple of hours are definitely not the best part of the game.<br><br>That said, the story while hardly the most original or life changing is a well thought out, extremely well implemented pastiche of every thriller movie, game and book ever. What&apos;s more, the dialog, which is incredibly well written to begin with, reacts to almost everything the player chooses to do, up to and including characters reacting (sometimes dramatically) differently to you if you have rampaged through the game murdering everything in your path or played the game as a stealth game without killing anyone. It is difficult to properly express, without giving anything away, quite how reactive to the player Alpha Protocol is. While the dialog system where you pick the tone of your response and have a limited time to choose has its critics in practice the system is pretty good and certainly an improvement on the wooden and repetitive dialog trees most counterparts offer.<br><br>The shooting and stealth are both fairly good, as long as you approach it as an RPG and not a shooter, the actual gameplay is both extremely reminiscent of and a fair bit better than the original Mass Effect with a mixture of third person shooting and RPG style abilities coming into play. Stealth is occasionally difficult and sometimes slightly illogical but with practice and a little thought extremely rewarding. While there isn&apos;t too much variety in the weapons they all handle fairly well, especially if the player invests ability points in them.<br><br>The only reason I feel people have based Alpha Protocol is they came to it expecting a different game to what they got. It is not a shooter and shouldn&apos;t be judged as one, nor is it a stealth game, it is an RPG through and through and labeled as such. The closest comparisons are the original Deus Ex and the original Mass Effect, both of which it is on a par with for storytelling, dialog and gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1702195">Expand</a></span>

Not to say that Alpha Protocol doesn&apos;t have it&apos;s fair share of problems, but absolutely not any more so than other Unreal Engine games.

I loved the over the top characters and the silly boss fights. I loved that Mike Thorton was a complete dick. When you make choices they actually have real consequences unlike a lot of other games. The combat was fine once you realized that it was an RPG and not a shooter. I have completed the game several times(thoroughly enjoyed it) and if it was a crap game I wouldn&apos;t complete it once. It did have bugs and technical issues, but because of the bad reviews, Sega have pulled all support for it whatsoever- not even a proper patch. It&apos;s a crying shame how badly it was received by reviewers and as a consequence is not due a sequel. I loved the game and there really aren&apos;t many games that gave me such a feeling(Deus Ex, The Witcher, Vampire:The Masquerade Bloodlines are some of them). This game is so underrated and deserves to be a cult classic. Many of the bad reviews are undeserved and a lot of the issues could be fixed with a patch(which isn&apos;t happening BECAUSE of the bad reviews). I really hope that Sega give this a second chance because it deserves more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1793917">Expand</a></span>

You make allies or enemies as you go and depending on your actions various characters either come to help you or hinder you.

A highly reactive storyline unfolding in ways you want (or sometimes ways you don&apos;t want) makes it an excellent experience. And I will stress the word experience because that is mainly what this is; if just the gameplay had been better it would have been an all-time favourite for me, but it does it&apos;s job.</span>

You get the decision making/conversation options/RPG elements similar to Mass Effect; and you get the espionage and humor from Metal Gear Solid. This all blends together to create a unique gaming experience with a huge replay factor, with different classes and game play routes. The story of this game is thrilling and always making you want to see what comes up next, every time I stopped playing I would run scenarios through my head trying to find out what would happen next!
<br>You can choose to be a real spy and go in silent trying not to be detected, or go in guns blazing and making all the noise you could ever imagine. You get to choose who to believe, choose who to ally with, choose who to kill, and so much more.
<br>But like with any other game ever created, and that will be created there are bugs that can get annoying at times. The graphics are decent, not the best, but nowhere near the worst. The enemy AI can be stupid at times and the saving feature is somewhat frustrating.
<br>Overall this game has gripping game play, a very thrilling storyline, and you can replay over and over again. I really hope they make a sequel because this game truly does deserve it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1768912">Expand</a></span>

Also, Obsidian, who I always considered to be apprentices of the Great Bioware, have created such deep and nonlinear alternativity system, in which choices are hard and consequences can&apos;t be foreseen, that it makes me wonder: Did the student become the Master? Only time will tell. On the side note, the technical part of the game is not perfect. Sometimes freezes and lags occur. But, overall, it&apos;s a 10.

Also, AP has perfect pacing; levels never drag on and the game keeps you interested until the end. I only experienced a few minor bugs, so I really can&apos;t relate to all these complaints. To me AP will go down as one of the most under-appreciated games ever.

My first thought was, &quot;why haven&apos;t I heard of this game before, because it is awesome.&quot;<br><br>You play as agent Michael Thorton, everything else you get to make up as you go along.  I don&apos;t think some people realize how entirely different two play throughs can be.  Your choices have a huge impact on the game world and there is no set &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; patch.  You make choices, stuff happens that wouldn&apos;t have happened otherwise.  Deal with it.<br><br>I am amazed that a developer could craft such an open ended game with so many different possibilities.  I&apos;m also amazed that every choice comes with benefits.  Kill that guy?  Maybe you&apos;ll lose a supplier but you&apos;ll face fewer goons when you travel for your missions.<br><br>Even the much hated crouching animation is actually far more realistic than what most games give you.  That&apos;s what a person would actually look like trying to &quot;sneak&quot; around.<br><br>As much praise as I heap on the game, there are also problems.  For one, this game is supposed to be super-realistic and adaptive, yet I can shoot a guy in the head with a silenced pistol, the body will disappear on its own in a few minutes, and nobody will be the wiser.  Someone stumbles across the scene where guard A was supposed to be?  Nobody notices he is missing unless his body is still sitting there and then they give up in a few minutes if they can&apos;t find me.  Somebody just got shot and killed on your watch and you just give up if someone shuts off the alarm?<br><br>The story is the best part.  There are so many nuances that you cannot learn it all in one play through.  You literally cannot, unless you cheat or something.  It&apos;s the best type of game because it encourages you to play it multiple times.<br><br>The RPG aspects are placed above the shooter aspects and that&apos;s fine with me.  It reminds me of Deus Ex in that respect.  You have a low pistol skill?  You can&apos;t hit the side of a barn.  I enjoyed being tied to my character&apos;s skill points more than just my ability to move a pointer around and mash a button waiting for something awesome to happen.<br><br>This game deserved far better than what it received.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1697447">Expand</a></span>

After just beating it on recruit, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story line is every bit as good as ME2 with a multitude of choices that directly effect the game such as bosses, allies, and enemies among a few. The reactive dialogue system is nice, you actually have to make decisions fairly quickly on if you want to kill someone or spare them, dismantle bombs or save the damsel in distress, its your call. The weapon mechanics could be much better no doubt, but it&apos;s not game breaking. Your stats will not affect weapon handling, but the modifications of your weapon will. I focused on stability and accuracy which helped quite a bit naturally. Stealth is nice, but I wouldn&apos;t say any one skill is OP over the others. For instance the shotgun gets the ability to knock down any opponent after stacking attributes on it. It&apos;s huge, I&apos;d just knock em down and stomp on them for an instant kill and rinse and repeat. If anything I&apos;d say nearly all the main combat skills were OP and made the game to easy. That&apos;s were the game&apos;s biggest weakness lies. I beat it on Recruit Normal, and only died 3 times. I died twice fighting the boss Brayko, and once because I climbed a latter with a guy manning a SAW pointed at my face. Those are the only times I died. That being said playing on the more difficult setting recruit the game was way to easy with the exception of Brayko. In fact it has the easiest in boss fight I&apos;ve ever seen. I killed the end boss in a matter of seconds. With the exception of hacking and by passing, the game needs to be more difficult. The AI is not only stupid but ridiculously underpowered. That being said the AI in ME2 had some dumb moments as well and people making the case that ME2&apos;s AI is far superior is almost comical. The games biggest strength is it&apos;s story and dialogue options. There are literally so many variations on how to go about accomplishing missions it keeps things fresh, exciting and unpredictable. There were quite a few moments where I was genuinely surprised at the twist of the storyline. ME2 despite being an awesome game, was very predictable. All in all I think the game was worth 50 bucks, Considering you do every mission available to you it will take you right around 25 hours to beat the game, which is cheap entertainment. Once you go on your first couple of missions to Saudi Arabia you&apos;ll be hooked and you wont put the game down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=747779">Expand</a></span>

The entire time playing I didn&apos;t experience one crash. I did however look up a support post that told me what configuration settings to edit to make the game play smooth. Graphics aren&apos;t the best of the best, but they could be far worse. It seemed to me that the graphics in some parts of the game were better than others. The control weren&apos;t bad. I could do what I needed to get done fairly easy. One exception was the lockpicking/hacking. The controls for that could be far better, they ended up making the &quot;mini-games&quot; more difficult than they should be. A.I. wasn&apos;t bad at all, in fact it seemed smarter than quite a few games I have played recently. I did play on Normal difficulty the first playthrough. This game brought back some old school fun for me. I didn&apos;t have any issues with the weapons like others have posted. I thought the system worked really well and required you to play the &quot;rpg&quot; element out to hit people. This isn&apos;t a regular shooter and you had to actually aim to get hits and skills improved the mechanics. I also didn&apos;t grab skills to make the game significantly easier, so I won&apos;t comment on skill balance. The story was very interesting. The dialogue options overall worked well, though there were some spots to where the countdown timer was too fast and the options a bit ambiguous on how you were going to respond. I am pretty sure that a good chunk of your choices through the game affect the ending. I got the ending &quot;full circle&quot; by playing smart and took down the main culprit (he went to jail). I seemed from my ending that if I had made different decisions early on, I could never have got the one I got. I had spared people that most wouldn&apos;t. Overall I do not understand the the negative criticism. This a gem of a game, well worth playing. Thats if you can appreciate a good RPG with mixed elements. The story wasn&apos;t weak and if I had to compare this to a game, it would be Mass Effect 1 before they gutted the game and brought out Mass Effect 2. This isn&apos;t a Hollywood budget or story. Just good old fashioned RPG fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=747776">Expand</a></span>

A bit linear and sneaking can be quite hard since enemies in some cases can see you when you not expect it... The AI is a bit weird from time to time but not worse than other RPGs. Overall a great game and must have for fans of RPGs, syp-games etc.</span>

Combining stealth, decision-making, a variety of missions and a neat role-playing system, Alpha Protocol is one of the best ideas for a video game this year. It is therefore unfortunate that the game was rushed with a lot of thing left unpolished. Gameplay is glitchy, the targeting system is weird, the animation when you turn around looks funny, ragdoll deaths are terrible, characters seemed cool but were too shallow, story arcs were not explored deeper, loading is horrifying, stealth could be a lot better, etc. It pains me to know that if Obsidian was given much more time with this game that it would have been a real Mass Effect 2 quality product, but unfortunately this is not the case. Nonetheless, if you&apos;re looking for a stylish, Splinter Cell type game, you definitely want to give this a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390127">Expand</a></span>

Yes, the combat mechanics are largely broken but not to the point where a satisfying compromise can&apos;t be reached in terms of gameplay vs. RPG payoff. On par with Jade Empire for mid-to-high level escapism.</span>

They awaited either third person shooter game(aka Splinter Cell) or haven&apos;t even played yet another RPG.(You do an action, game rolls a dice and &quot;Miss&quot; etc stuff) Yet another sad fact: People have no idea what they&apos;re talking about and they got payed for it. While nearly all of players can agree that pistols are way overpowered i read that &quot;pistols are lame, go for assault rifles&quot; in  a few websites that earn money from reviewing.

There are bugs, optimization issues, dumb AI, annoying saving (and loading) system, and short-ish campaign. On the other hand, it *is* engaging. Dialogue options, one of those &quot;choice and consequences&quot; concept that doesn&apos;t fall flat on its face, different gameplay approaches that actually work, and finally a plot that doesn&apos;t revolve around doomsday nuclear weapons threatening the world peace. As an old-time pen-and-paper RPG player, I can confidently say this is a role-playing game. Those who play for action may be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1841020">Expand</a></span>

How surprised I was when after a few hours with it I found myself enjoying it far more than BioWare&apos;s big game. Unlike in ME2, the decisions you make and dialogue options you choose actually matter, and not just by filling some stupid good/bad gauges. Everything you do has an influence on what&apos;ll happen next, and some seemingly good choices can come back and bite you in the ass later on. There are no prop characters existing for the sole purpose of being slain by the protagonist, either. Each person in AP has their own well written personality, and whether they&apos;ll be your friend or enemy is up to you. The combat system shares many similarities to that of ME3, but offers more freedom, allowing you to take enemies down non-lethally or just plain sneak by them. The weapon accuracy is far more realistic, too - firing from the hip you&apos;ll most likely make a lot of holes in the environment and leave your opponent unscathed. Overall, while not as flashy as ME2, AP will always be a better game in my book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=2482147">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphics
<br>Yes, the game is from 2010, so keep that in mind. However, I think that, even for 2010, the graphics aren&apos;t that good. Character editing (glasses, hat, hair) looks terrible, same for the movement in combat etc.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>I usually LIKE stealth games, but this one, I didn&apos;t. I am not sure whether it&apos;s just a higher difficulty or badly done game mechanics. Trying to sneak up on an enemy to take him out often ends up in frustration, as he notices you. However, it feels like the mechanics are just clunky, it&apos;s not some overly high AI or bad playing... I have played several stealth games and usually do ok, but here, I tried to sneak up on an enemy, and sometimes, the silent takedown works, sometimes he suddenly alerts everyone around him.
<br>
<br>AI
<br>Terrible. On one hand, the second the alarm is raised, they know EXACTLY where you are and shoot at you, which I find HIGHLY unrealistic. I wouldn&apos;t mind if they had a general idea quickly and then search for you there, but the second an alarm is raised, it&apos;s like they have a hive intelligence and know where you are.
<br>At the same time, I have seen some moonwalking, and you can just run towards them and take them down with melee
<br>
<br>Combat
<br>Terrible as well. If there are two obstacles, and you aim between them and aim PERFECTLY at the head of an enemy, you won&apos;t hit him. Let me get this straight - two obstacles, you aim between them (yes, there is room between them), and you won&apos;t hit him.
<br>Even when in range, and the dot in your targeting circle is aligned with someones head, you often miss. Having to shoot someone in the head (they wear a mask, or sometimes just a bandana, apparently these items generate a bullet proof forcefield) isn&apos;t exactly that realistic either.
<br>
<br>Minigames
<br>There is lockpicking, disabling alarms and hacking. The first two are... ok. The first one is even fun sometimes (balancing the cylinders of the lock, then releasing your lockpick, with a time limit). The second one is ok. The third one is horrible. Not going into details, the other commenters have commented on how terrible that one is many times.
<br>
<br>Characters
<br>I didn&apos;t like the whole intro, the conversations, the character design. Apart from simply looking odd, I just didn&apos;t care for any character, and I didn&apos;t like the main character either, who looks like a mix between Shepherd from Mass Effect and some kind of cyborg.
<br>
<br>Overall
<br>So much potential. I&apos;d have liked to explore the game more and find all the things that those who liked the game praised... the decision-making, the email conversations or whatever.
<br>However, the intro went on for too long and didn&apos;t grab me at all, and the two missions I tried were simply not fun at all. It&apos;s not the very outdated (even for a 2010-game!) look, it&apos;s the clunky mechanics, bad AI, horrible sneaking mechanics (MGS V and even Sniper Elite 2 and 3 do this SO much better), bad animation, horrible combat/aiming and the minigames.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s sad, because I was looking forward to trying this, I was very much willing to give it a chance, but I have no interest at all to continue after these two missions.
<br>If you can get it on sale (I got it for like 3 or 4 bucks), maybe try it out, but unfortunately, I simply can&apos;t recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=6090335">Expand</a></span>

This may just be the very first title released from a major developer/publisher that I feel most reviewers are being far too hard on. The game is most definitely &quot;clunky&quot; suffering from a whole host of problems. It is most definitely NOT a AAA polished game. But it&apos;s not a dilapidated mess either. The vast majority of its problems focus on control and UI. It is quite possibly one of the worst PC ports ever -- with a control scheme that makes little sense on a control being completely obtuse and suffering from a host of sensitivity problems on a PC. But use a 360 controller on the PC and aside from the general clunkiness of the UI (in particular the selecting of &quot;powers&quot; being a several-button, far-too-long process that should be one, maybe two, a la Mass Effect). I haven&apos;t see any of the AI problems that most reviewers are mentioning. In fact, by and large, and I&apos;d say the AI is quite intelligent. Aside from a couple instances of bugs where the AI has super-sensing powers, I&apos;ve experienced largely realistic reactions at least on par with other tactical games out there. The graphics are notably lacking, but far from a deterrent. They aren&apos;t bad but they aren&apos;t good either. And, most importantly, they are more than adequate for getting the job done and are in absolutely no way detrimental to gameplay. The same could be said of the animations -- lacking, again, but in no way actually detract from gameplay. I find the story to be fairly good (haven&apos;t completed yet, rumor is the ending sucks) at least on par with most AAA games released today. For the genre and with the intent of the game to be largely story-driven, it could probably use something with a bit more depth and less predictability, but it&apos;s far from bad. I get the impression though that, much like Mass Effect, it&apos;s far more linear than they want it to appear. While your individual choices do effect missions slightly, I significantly doubt it effects the overall outcome of the story appreciably. All in all, the game reminds me of Deus Ex in many ways. And perhaps that&apos;s the problem -- it plays similarly to Deus Ex -- a game released fully 10 years ago. But if you&apos;re the type that can play through a game like Deus Ex, though 10 years old, and appreciate it for what it is (superb, albeit dated in terms of controls, interface, and graphics), I&apos;d be willing to bet that you&apos;ll like Alpha Protocol, which suffers from many of the same &quot;issues&quot;. The only difference is that we expect the issues it has from a game 10 years old, not from a new game from a top-tier developer. It is a shame, the game could certainly have been a LOT more polished than it is. But it&apos;s a long ways from a bad game. I can&apos;t particularly recommend it to a wide audience as a &quot;must have&quot; while it&apos;s $50-60 (though you may find it worth that as I have). But it&apos;s most definitely worth at least $30. Which, given critical reception, it&apos;ll likely hit pretty quick regardless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=747748">Expand</a></span>

The issues it may have had have been pretty well dealt with by now and graphics aren&apos;t absolutely amazing, but that doesn&apos;t mean you won&apos;t like it.<br><br>There is linear track to the game, but you get to choose how you play it and how it ends. You can gather allies and enemies by your actions and change the course of the game. Even the pieces of intel you buy will have an effect on the game&apos;s end. Its compelling and the plot is quite good with more twists than you could imagine. There are a few that you might expect, but there are plenty more. The characters are dynamic and interesting as well.<br><br>There is freedom in how you tackle the game and that is nice. I played as a stealth character and thoroughly enjoyed it. Coupled with the plot&apos;s replay value, there is plenty of incentive to play the game again. There are many moral choices to face and not all of them are easy, especially as the game forces you to choose quickly which actually made it more intense than parts of Mass Effect 2 where I sat there and deliberated a decision.<br><br>The save system is a tad annoying, but you get used to it after a bit. Anyway, get this game, especially since its not priced very high. Its just a pity that a sequel has been ruled out. To quote Thorton &quot;then it would just be beta or gamma protocol&quot; and that would be fine with me</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1440440">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s the skill development, awesome selection of characters and incredible branching plot that make this game worth the money. Rambos need not apply.</span>

Pros: 1)	Good storytelling and characters; 2)	Deep RPG elements; 3) Excellent facial animations; 4)	Tough decisions to make, with interesting consequences; 5) Innovative dialog system;
<br>6)	Gameplay that emphasizes player choice
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1)	Bad console port &#x2013; Recommend using a controller for the best experience;
<br>2)	Checkpoint system (I hate that!);
<br>3)	No antialiasing &#x2013; Warning: don&#x2019;t force it through the graphic drivers, or you will break the game). You can have MSAA however if you download this file (http://mrhaandi.blogspot.pt/p/injectsmaa.html) and extract/add it to /AlphaProtocol/ Binaries/ folder;
<br>4)	Lots of bugs and glitches, for example in some missions if you reload a checkpoint, the NPC&#x2019;s won&#x2019;t respawn. Surprisingly the game never crashed on me;
<br>5)	Glitchy controls and camera (sometimes the camera locks, and you won&#x2019;t be able to move, other times it will do a one eighty for no reason.) &#x2013; Warning: Don&#x2019;t assign the interact function to any other key than space, or you will break the hacking mini-game.
<br>6)	The f****** hacking mini-game &#x2013; Warning: don&#x2019;t play this game on hard as a recruit, and put some action points on the technical skill branch before you start the game;
<br>7)	Terrible cover system &#x2013; Warning: avoid throwing grenades from cover, because they tend to explode in your face)
<br>8)	Zero Modding community.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, despite its many technical faults, Alpha Protocol is still very fun to play, and that is what really matters in the ends. If you can look pass the obvious technical problems, you will see that it is a very deep and immersive RPG experience that unfortunately lacks a lot of polish. Nevertheless, this does not excuse Obsidian and Sega for releasing an unfinished product, nor their unwillingness to fix it after release.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: If you like RPG games like Mass effect and Deus Ex, I recommend giving this (very underrated) game a go, but don&#x2019;t expect a smooth ride in the gameplay department.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=4002651">Expand</a></span>

I am an avid gamer and RPGs are especially close to my heart. However, I was disappointed with this game for several reasons, all of which fit under the umbrella of failed to live up to expectations. A breakdown:<br>1. Ability to customize playable character is minimal at best. Cosmetic options are very limited, and the skill trees are drawing from an awfully shallow pool.<br>2. The game borrows rather than steals, becoming a reminder of better games rather than developing past greats into something new. The gameplay is *highly* derivative. To say that the game reminds strongly of: Mass Effect, the Hitman series, and the weaker moments of Splinter Cell, hardly seems like criticism; but the versions encountered in Alpha Protocol are watered down and consistently miss the mark. In doing so, they serve not as a presence of ingenious design and engaging gameplay, but as a poor copy that draws attention to its failure to imitate more perfectly. 3. The game does bring to the table a very interesting dialogue system, modeled on the ME radial. On the whole it is reasonably well-written, supports replay, and fits with the tone of the story. 4. That said, because of the cookie-cutter construction of the game, the dialogue comes out of the mouths of puppets who are obviously puppets and at no point flirt with becoming characters.  5. The AI is frequently stupid and occasionally idiotic. 6. Mechanics issues abound. Errors which in another game might be no more than irritations, in a spy game where goals, story tone, skill trees, dialogue structure are all to some extent hung on the notion of the main character being (indeed becoming) a specialist, the utter failure to allow the possibility of precise and deliberate action was, at least for me, a game-breaking flaw and fouled the whole experience.<br><br>In all, the hopes and enthusiasm I had for the game were soundly dashed by poor design decisions and what to all appearances seems to be an astonishing lack of post-production quality control.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1440677">Expand</a></span>

Some of the big drawbacks are flaky AI responses, poor story continuity, and use of an engine that is wayyyyy dated. I was hopeful on this one, but this looks to be yet another game under the Sega umbrella that blows chunks, regardless of how great it looks.</span>

                                        <span> well, the game was pretty good until i started playing. Production value is just terrible. Movement is clunky and enemies are incredibly dumb. Brought it back saying it could not get past install. I&apos;d encourage others to save yourself the time and dont purchase this one... maybe worth a rent for the consoles but other then that no thank you.</span>

                                        <span>I&apos;m glad I only paid $2 for this on steam. Behind the frustrating control and menu interface bugs, it&apos;s a crappy port of a half-decent 3PS with some RPG elements. The cover mechanics could use some work and the AI is just terribad for 2010. The plot and level design are the only saving graces here. The variety of characters and relevant storyline are enough to keep you interested, even intrigued.</span>

                                        <span> For a game that is supposed to deal in espionage(which one would assume requires stealth and finesse), the controls and &quot;stealth&quot; system were clunky at best. They used the same graphics model with different camouflage skins for multiple firearms, which had some VERY inaccurate stats. I was expecting something on par with Splinter Cell, from all the hype. I was VERY disappointed.</span>

Then, the boss fights get worse as the game goes on. There&apos;s no enjoyment is spending that much time on a fight. The story is very cliche and offers limited choices.

I reinstalled it after month after my first sadness with it at steam to take a look what happened till now.. But really.. Its a huge fail-development and maybe one of the biggest mistakes of obsidian. I never seen much of the story, I never met all the interesting characters and I never decided epic moments cuz one of the mini games in the game ruined all the fun I could have. HACKING is a huge bad portation and the idea to create such an hard mini-game is really sick. AND without a &quot;pad&quot; beyond possibility. My first hack in-game was my very last. I tried it for hours and hours but cuz of the inaccurate mouse-sensitivity I never could log in these randomized keywords. All other mini-games are no match, easy and funny, but hacking is the biggest slur within such public game and a crime against 08-15 gamers. And I wont tell you anything bout aiming, cuz its another joke of the developer. There are no patches to disable Hacking or better aiming since game came out. Do not waste your money like me. The one game I wished I never had bought is Alpha protocol. Buy something better. ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=1708662">Expand</a></span>

The graphics and story are OK, i&apos;m not picky. Okay. I have a decent system, 4 gigs ram, geforce 560ti, core 2 duo e8200, maybe a little light on the CPU but its ok.  I tried all the video options on and also tried the game with them all off. As with most consolitis games, the video options are a bit limitied.

<br>I see that</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I&apos;ll be concentrating on the user interface and the performance. The graphics and story are OK, i&apos;m not picky. Okay. I have a decent system, 4 gigs ram, geforce 560ti, core 2 duo e8200, maybe a little light on the CPU but its ok.  I tried all the video options on and also tried the game with them all off. As with most consolitis games, the video options are a bit limitied.
<br>
<br>I see that this game suffers from consolitis and lacks polish. The loading times are too long, even for something as simple as loading a checkpoint then dying then reloading the last checkpoint. Loading time is also too long for such simple stuff as opening the map or opening one of the menus such as weapons or gadgets. When loading a save or loading a new level at least there&apos;s a spinning AP logo on the screen but  otherwise, the game looks like its frozen. Then there are lots of pauses. Example, you are running forwards then make a 90 degree turn to your left to a stair or ramp, after turning a few degrees there is a split second pause then you find yourself turned 270 degrees so you have the stairs behind you and you&apos;re face into the wall or sometimes its 180 degrees and you&apos;re going back the way you came. The scrolling is horrible in menus. The mouse wheel works but if you have say 2 windows like in the email window, scrolling the mouse wheel only scrolls the list of emails on the left while the message on the right window cannot be controlled by the mouse wheel. You can always click on the scroll up and down buttons but they are soo small. Plus there are pauses scrolling to an email or a weapon that&apos;s on the next page of a list
<br>
<br>The menus like the PDA and the weapon menus don&apos;t recognize the ESC. So for example in the map to go back to the game you have to mouse click on the &quot;back&quot; button then press TAB. you can only jump from say the weapon to the skill menu only by mouse clicking on a small arrow. You can&apos;t use the keyboard shortcut keys. And for exiting those menus going back to the game you can&apos;t press ESC, you gotta press the key assigned to it
<br>
<br>Very Very poor interface design. A shame since the RPG system, the story and the combat is OK</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=2472247">Expand</a></span>

What&apos;s wrong with the game has been stated in other reviews: bad engine, clunky controls, obvious console port.  I got the game when it was for $2 on a Steam sale and thankfully so because if I had paid more I would have been livid. When you read other reviews about how good the story and dialog are in this game be aware you are reading reviews from people who can ignore all the **** to find the diamond.

I found that you get out of it what you put in, combat became a little stale at points so I adjusted my strategies and had fun. If the games visuals and animations were updated I doubt you would see any reviews under a 9. The camera and controls take a bit of time to get used to however once you begin adding skill points to the weapons the shooter aspect isn&apos;t nearly as bad as many have said. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys playing a game through multiple times, if you are just in it for a few hours you probably won&apos;t get the point of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=747734">Expand</a></span>

The action is well-suited to an RPG, basing your skills on your character&apos;s stats and not on twitch reactions. The conversations are well written and interesting, and the characters varied and enjoyable. The plot, while not brilliant, is better at least than the Bourne movies, and certainly kept me interested throughout. I love the way decisions really mattered, and at times I had to choose between allies and mission objectives (when I had to let a friend die to save lots of civilian lives, it was actually a difficult moment.) I&apos;m not saying this game is for everyone, but if you enjoy action RPGs with lots of well-written dialogue and choices that really matter, this game should not be passed by.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-protocol/user-reviews?user_review_id=747771">Expand</a></span>
