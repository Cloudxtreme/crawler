Almost lag neither waiting time for loading a zone. It gives a strange feeling. A lot of professions, no levels, tactics battles. This is not a first person shooter neither a classic RPG. You can even play a non combat character. You will like it or you will hate it. I like it :)</span>

Then the added punishment was that I was heart broken to find out i  had to cough up more money just to play it! My dad re-imburse me the money and said the company was only good for a adolecent learning experience about &quot; life and the rotten world of scum that is out there, so you see son your money was not wasted.

In the beginning you have to wait until people can make more advanced equipment since the game is player operated.  You cant just cast it away because of what the first week is like it is a game the people have to advance.  In fact there are  already masters of those classes that are said to be unable to be trained.  Teras Kasi has been getting better also and Bounty Hunter has also been improved.  I enjoy the game but yes the vehicles havent been put into effect but there are starports and shuttle ports to travel with.  This is what has been happening.  It does take time to make revisions to the game it cant be instantly done there has to be new programming installed which has to be made.  Theses are my comments on the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=53440">Expand</a></span>

I played from Beta0 to release and lasted 3 months after release. it is BORING beyond belief unless you like to grind mind numbing experience. My advice, wait for WOW and don&apos;t waste your money.</span>

                                        <span> It&apos;s an ok game so far. I think I expected too much from this game, like being able to one day pilot xwings or at-at&apos;s but its true to the line of MMORPG&apos;s nonetheless, except with no levels to worry about. I couldnt help think this was sort of a cross between EQ and AO, but as with all MMORPG&apos;s it&apos;ll take sometime to show what LucasArts have up their sleeve.</span>

With these qualifications, I can say that SWG is one of the most disappointing games ever made. Wow, standing around building up XP by killing bugs! Cool, can I please pay $15 a month to stand in a cantina and wait for people to come in so I can heal them? I know this game isn&apos;t the kind that you can master in a day, but come on! It&apos;s incredibly desolate and boring--isn&apos;t the point of a MMORPG to be immersive and full of non-NPC&apos;s? Oh, and the graphics aren&apos;t that great; good, but hardly worth the praise. If you want a SW game, play Knights of the Old Republic, that game rocks!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=371646">Expand</a></span>

I think its a great game, there are bugs and missing features, but look around it for now, patches will fix it later on in the long run. I recommend it for most people.</span>

Combat is sickenly boring, and overall gameplay is full of way, way, WAY too many timesinks. Not to mention far too many things feel like Everquest with a Star Wars theme pasted on it. Another big gripe I have with it is you&apos;re only allowed one character per server, which is retarded beyond belief. Once you get past the very steep learning curve and at times overly complex features (a fair bit of which are completely missing), you find that the time invested in doing so just wasn&apos;t worth it. It might become a good game maybe two or three years from now, but as it is, its nothing more than a way to rip off Star Wars fans who will buy anything labeled as such.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=366453">Expand</a></span>

I am a disabled veteran who has a lot of spare time on his hands, and I have played almost everysingle MMORPG. I picked up SWG on the release date and after the first day of a horrible launch, I thought I had a real gem on my hands. What I did not realize is that his would be the biggest rip-off in the history of gaming. Let me tell you a little about SWG and how they treat there customers. First off I will give you a couple of quotes by just a few off the DEVS &quot;Some problems can be made to go away by ignoring them&quot; -- Raph Koster &quot;We basically gave up on the melee class...&quot; ------Raph Koster &quot;the commando class is working as intended&quot;-------------------Q3PO (commandos could not even gain exp in their trees) maybe that will give you a idea of the mentality of the people that run this game, and have developed it. When SWG shipped there were several classes that were broken that you could not even advance in 1.) commando 2.) bio Engineer 3.)droid engineer, and so on and so on. After a month of play of 5 to 10 hours a day of playing, I have some very good observations about this game. 1.) there is absolutely NO CONTENT. All you do is run back and forth from mission terminals and kill rabbits. This basically sums up the content of the game right here 2.) the DEVS of this game are the rudest developers that I have ever dealt with in 20 years of video game playing. If you posted constructive criticism of the game your post was locked or in my case you were banned from the forums for the above 2nd quote from Raph Koster that I posted that is from his very own website. If you call SWG there phone support is rude. If you talk to ingame DEV customer support you get the same kind of attitude. There are reports from gamers being told &quot;tough shit&quot; &quot;fuck off&quot; 3.) the nerfing in this game is the worst nerfing I have ever seen in a MMORPG. They took a few PvP issues and nerfed entire elite classes like the vaunted SW bounty hunter and Teras Kasi and made them worthless and broken with no regard to player versus enemy. 4.) I have never played a buggier game. The beta testers of this game begged them not to release this game as it was not ready yet, and yet they did to get their 15 bucks a month. I was actually told that if I wanted to help the game instead of asking for broken classes to be fixed I should go play on their test server. I would gladly have done that , but you still have to pay 15 bucks a month to beta test a game. This is SOE&apos;s job not mine. This was the most horrible gaming experience that I have ever had in my life. I was sucked in by the whole Star Wars universe thing , just like 200,000 other people, only to play a bugged game with the most inept and rude game developers that I have ever met in my life. I hope one day laws will be passed to regulate these gaming or any software company from releasing a known bugged to hell product just to sucker customers out of their money. I was really hoping this game would last and be great. I did not want to see it fail. This game is so bad , that developers had player correspondents for each profession to address issues and bugs with each class, and even the Player correspondents are canceling their accounts. I write this to plead with you not to buy this horrible game, and to tell your customers not to be sucked in because Star Wars is on the box. Someone needs to start holding these gaming companies accountable for there actions. And that is why I write this. Thank you, Daniel Richards banned from SWG forums for quoting a developer &quot;Some problems can be made to go away by ignoring them&quot; -- Raph Koster </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=366204">Expand</a></span>

Then i will rate a 10 out of 10 but now i will stay my vote as an 8....GOOD JOB LUCASARTS!!!</span>

I do agree it has a fair few kinks that need to be addressed, however the game is still a very good MMORPG that does have alot to keep people interested. If your a Star Wars fan then this makes the game that whole lot better. You can really build a community in this game, making your own cities, shops and ships. You can become a bounty hunter and fly across the whole galaxy hunting down those imperials and rebels that have pissed off the wrong people, you can become a jedi and live out that Skywalker fantasy, you can become a simple merchant and make your own weapons, armor and even star ships. There is ALOT to do in this game, and if you look past its minor flaws it really does have alot to offer. Even if you just spend your time flying from planet to planet exploring as much of the Star Wars universe as you can it is something that will be both fun, and also a treat for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the star wars galaxie! Give it a try before you dismiss it completely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=390830">Expand</a></span>

The graphics were terrible, the areas were way too big and way too plain. I could literally feel this game dying before it began. Worst of all, the interface was impossible to deal with and most of the time you felt completely lost. This was a total failure by Sony, and if you want a decent Star Wars MMO check out Bioware&apos;s SWTOR. This is a prime example of why subscription fees don&apos;t work for most games.

<br>@babaganush - I understand and respect your opinion but please realize also that my review is based on the game when it was initially released. I had to dish out a decent chunk of change and the end result at that point was a huge letdown. I never played any of the future updates or patches, so I cannot comment on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=2610656">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>this was a great game but anyone reading now obviously wont be able to play it anymore, maybe some day they might try re-booting it, who knows.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4151073">Expand</a></span>

People who say this game is complicated have never played Eve. Also if I could  figure out the game when I was 13 when it first came out it wasn&apos;t that complicated really.
<br>
<br>But for many people that complexity is what makes SWG so amazing. Why is crafting for example so complicated with all these stats and types? Because unlike WoW the items players create are unique items exactly because of this complexity short sighted player complain about. Even if it is way more complicated crafting anything in SWG was more rewarding than crafting anything in any other game because the item you made was NOT another clone item everyone else had built a billion times before like in WoW. This was an item with your name on it with stats likely different from 99.9% of all the other items of the same name/look. You could sell it and anyone who wore would be walking advertisement of your handiwork. Complicated sure but realistic and SO worth it.
<br>
<br>It wasn&apos;t just complicated. It had the vastest game space worlds filed with  more extensive player built cities of any game to date. Maybe they didn&apos;t give you nearly as many dungeons and quests as other games. But they did give a whole lot more class customization , crafting custimization, and player city options than ANY other MMO ever. The faction Vs faction content was among the best of any game. Bounty hunting Jedi was one of the most epic MMO experiences ever really.
<br>
<br>Jedi are actually cool and powerful in SWG the way they should be. I&apos;m sorry but everyone running around as a Jedi that does not feel powerful but average doesn&apos;t feel like a Jedi. In SWG you couldn&apos;t be  Jedi just because you wanted to which is how it was in reality in star wars. As a result Jedi were rare and very hard to become since it was unclear how you even did so, but as a result Jedi are very powerful with the draw back that death means serious XP loss. So in the end it all balanced out for everyone except for people who just &apos;had&apos; to play as a Jedi. I was never a Jedi and it never bothered me. There was SO much more in the vastness of SWG for you to explore.
<br>
<br>I could write a short novel about my SWG characters experience back in the day and it would be pretty epic really with minimum dramatization required. And unlike random do this do that quests or go kill this boss in this dungeon quests it was an adventure quest dictated by my own desires. I wanted to be a bounty hunter and an imperial soldier; I needed power to make an impact in those efforts. So my SWG story was one of search for  team of imperials and BH to help me and also learn how to hunt Jedi. It was hard, it took months, but that is how MMOs are. My problem with Knights of the old republic is that it might as well be a one player game the way I see it. MMORPG games needs the vastness and complexity and harsh realties of SWG to be truly immersive, interactive, and real.
<br>
<br>If you want quests and dungeons and somehow you think that ins&apos;t more repetitive and boring i&apos;m at a loss for what to say. SWG let you make you own quest in the sense almost everything you did would get you xp in one way and idk why you need an npc to boss you around or the simplicity/repetitiveness of a dungeon boss kill for loot to make a game better. Even the best loot in SWG was not looted from a kill in a dungeon but CRAFTED in a dungeon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-galaxies-an-empire-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=5947784">Expand</a></span>
