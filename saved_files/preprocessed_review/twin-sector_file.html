Im a completionist so i finished the game however it took around 6-8 hours altogether with probably 10% of that being loading time, and about 50% being spent speed running through sections of puzzles I had already completed after being sent back to a distant check point upon death. This game could have easily been a great puzzle game however the developers  need to put a little more thought in there level layout(a lot of just giant U turn hallways with cage dividers serving no purpose other then to waste time),  damage settings(falling 5+ feet is a instant death if you dont catch yourself), and the check point layout(the lack of many check points in parts of the game made it very unforgiving and time consuming).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/twin-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=2440154">Expand</a></span>

Wouldn&apos;t even think of comparing it to Portal really, but I can see the similarities now. But it&apos;s completely different. heh Fun stuff, IF you like physical puzzle games. The story is OK too, simple and too the point. The main char has a sexy voice (english ver), and I swear I know the OSCAR voice from somewhere else. A very nice game for the discounted price it is now (I waited and am glad didn&apos;t pay $29, $24, or even $19, but it&apos;s definitely worth the latter).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/twin-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=742849">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t like the &quot;battles&quot; - this is a puzzle game, let it be a puzzle game. Also the controls are clunky, but the physics are decent. I wouldn&apos;t buy for $20, but if it went on sale for maybe $5-10, I&apos;d probably pick it up.</span>

Glitches such as dialog that doesn&apos;t play (I&apos;ve gone though the first level  about 3 times and heard a different number of conversations each time) really break the immersion. I don&apos;t care if it resembles Portal, has a very bland story, or having unmemorable characters that don&apos;t offer any help with the current challenge, but I swear if I pick up a barrel to throw at a switch and it falls without altering my movements at all, something is definitely wrong with the game play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/twin-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=1559477">Expand</a></span>

I just cannot listen to without having my ears bleed. The the graphic. Ok, it&apos;s not THAT awful, but still. They just recycle the same texture, and its not even good looking. And this is even more frustrating, because games with less developers have much more appealing graphics. The puzzles are frustrating, because they aren&#xC2;&#xB4;t nearly as understandable than the ones in portal/ Portal2 were. maybe its hard to compare every puzzle game with Portal, but so it is. puzzle games have to face this enemy. And for me personally, the puzzles in Twin Sector just were confusing, witch is enforced by the strange physics. Huge boxes fly to the air and bounce of the ground as tennis-balls. The game also misses a soul. Portal had this fantastic humour, but Twin Sector has no atmosphere at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/twin-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=2295393">Expand</a></span>

The Story is solid and was one of the reasons I wanted to complete the game. The game&apos;s physics are decent but can get in the way sometimes. The  Gameplay is decent but the enemies as in turrets, environment, and flying robots can be either completely oblivious to you or unforgiving. The Controls are difficult to handle, especially for a platformer game and will take some time to get familiar with. I still found the game to be challenging and  that kept me going back to it. I died many many times and got me frustrated but in the end it was not too bad. Overall, a decent solid platformer. This game definitely tested my patience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/twin-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=3128611">Expand</a></span>
