<br>I bought this game for $10 at a used book store. It wasn&apos;t even worth $5. Maybe $1 (the price of a candy bar). Or, better, yet, for free, because this game resembles free Internet games I have played that do it better.

This game&apos;s list price was actually $20. That is a robbery.

<br>Twice as fun, twice as long, twice as difficult, and honestly I think this game may have been based on it. Any way you slice it, just about anything is a better value than the 1 hour of your freetime it will take to complete this game.
<br>
<br>The only reason I am giving this game a 3 is because I know there are some people out there who will enjoy the game just because it is Battlestar Galactica.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlestar-galactica/user-reviews?user_review_id=3922721">Expand</a></span>
