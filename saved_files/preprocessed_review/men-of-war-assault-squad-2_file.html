<br>
<br>If you are looking for a game against AI, don&apos;t bother all they did was rehash the old maps and game modes and and nothing meaningful to the game at all, the same pathetically limited set of units in player versus AI mode.
<br>
<br>This game has the biggest unit selection of any RTS and they are all locked behind badly design game modes and the &quot;realism&quot; excuse, no sandbox.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4285061">Expand</a></span>

<br>Assault Squad 2 is just more of the same from Assault Squad 1.    It is basically &apos;select this squad throw them  into battle.. select that squad throw them into battle.. select this tank, micro manage it so the damn thing doesn&apos;t drive out and sit in front of an AT gun rinse repeat  *yawn*&apos;

Now I think I gave them enough time to fix their game and to prove they care about their costumers, and I&apos;am sorry but they failed...
<br>
<br>What to say ? AS2 and its developers for me in 3 words ? .. A BIG DELUSION !
<br>
<br>On AS1 I had lot of hours of fun, even if to be sincere 95% of my hours on AS1 were spent with the German Soldiers Mod, a realism mod, so I give credits to DMS for making the basic game but if was not for Blubork&apos;s GSM and all the MoW modders, I&apos;am not sure about how many hours I could have on AS1.
<br>
<br>So in general from MOW to AS1 for me nothing big changed (not that other MOW titles brought bigger changes) if not improved graphic and other little details, main improvements arrived thanks to the evolving of the German Soldiers Mod and new models by MoW modders, but all in all I was happy with the AS1 platform, they even released free updates with new models, and from time to time I could have fun with the vanilla game too, even if nothing serious.
<br>
<br>Main problems of AS1 vanilla for me were the artificial weapon datas and in general the lack of realism, not that MOW had more realism, for example regarding ranges AS1 was a step forward, but with AS1 in my opinion the gameplay went even more fast paced and more COH oriented, I always disagreed with the payback mechanic, I find helping a player losing its units totally unfit for Real-Time-STRATEGY.
<br>
<br>So when AS2 was announced I went on AS2 forum and asked personally to devs if AS2 was going to be a more realism oriented game, not a sim, just more realistic, and they put there the fact that they were going to implement realistic weapon datas, I also asked them if they were planning to implement a territory mode like I suggested in the past and again they answered me that something was coming to satisfy this thing too.
<br>So as I&apos;am a positive person and I like to help who deserve it, I was super happy and I decided to help in the funding of their future CTA title too, even if I was not really interested in a post WWII era MoW.
<br>
<br>Then the big day to try AS2 arrived...
<br>
<br>...and this sadly was my first reaction after trying it (was obviously in italian but I&apos;ll try to translate it : ) )
<br>
<br>&quot;What the &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; ?? are you kidding me&quot;
<br>
<br>Yes, it can sound rude but this sincerely was my reaction when trying AS2 for the first time.
<br>
<br>Performances were terrible (but it was beta so at that time I still had hope here), improvements compared to AS1 ? little to nothing , but what&apos;s worst....
<br>
<br>Ranges were reduced and the gameplay was damn fast paced, maps had a terrible artificial arena look and were damn small, nothing like my suggested territory mode, instead an extreme battle zone mode that had nothing to do with what I suggested, even the realistic weapon datas were not that realistic as the Tiger tank could &quot;360 non scope&quot; in one second with its famously and historically known SLOW turret traverse.
<br>
<br>So for the vanilla game was a total delusion, however the full steam implementation was a nice thing and my thought was that performances could improve as promised and once GSM was released then I could just play that so the COH like gameplay was not an huge problem, even if having to always rely on mods to enjoy a game to be sincere is quite annoying.
<br>No less I even created an AS2 thread on the most famous Italian tech forum, I was still supporting the devs despite the problems and failed expectations.
<br>
<br>After months of waiting I realized I passed more time on the AS2 hub than in game as the game performances were terrible and the vanilla game gameplay a total rush and grenade spam that I was unable to enjoy.
<br>Again, I tried to stay positive and give my best to stay present on the AS2 hub and give suggestions, I invested my precious time there but what I discovered was just that, even with their community the Devs were doing a terrible job, threads locked, people banned, not a sign of listening to player suggestions, even Devs replying to suggestion in a quite arrogant way or over-defending their product and vision of the game at all costs, making you feel like a &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; and totally impotent toward the series future.
<br>I was speechless and deluded, I was no more able to recognize the devs I used to like and I h</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5305195">Expand</a></span>

This review is not on singleplayer, as I do not play single player in MOW, because I find it very boring, I would not recommend this game for singleplayer.
<br>
<br>Just like the first assault squad I see myself putting 1000+ hours into Assault squad 2. Their is no other multiplayer experience that is nearly as fun, or replicates the strategy and gameplay. I would never play another RTS after playing this one.
<br>
<br>The reason I am not giving this a 10 is because of a number of issues with the development and design choices. This game is nearly the exact same as the first assault squad. There are only a handful of new maps, there is less than 10 new units, there isn&apos;t really anything new. On top of that they have made a number of questionable decisions, such as adding in units that you need to unlock. However, many of the units that are locked for players are ones that are needed to win the game.
<br>
<br>Almost all the design time seems to have gone too doing back end improvements, things that don&apos;t really affect the gameplay. The game actually looks worse than the first assault squad in multiplayer because almost all players are forced to play on low settings, because all the new graphical and engine improvements have not been optimized.
<br>
<br>The only real notifiable improvement over the first Assault squad is using steam instead of gamespy for mutliplayer. If you played the first one you will know how big of an improvement this is. However, with barely any other additions, and some steps backwards, I only give this game a 6.
<br>
<br>Me and most of the competitive community feel this way. We will still play this game for thousands of hours, only because there is no other game out there that provides similar gameplay. Assault squad 2 was a wasted oppourtunity to improve on an already great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4201644">Expand</a></span>

<br>Oh so you enjoyed Company of heroes but was failed by the second version, and now you want something harder, more realistic and detailed? Well attach extremely to all of those adjectives and you now understand why this game, (as cool as it looks) has a 6 user score average, of course we cant forget the extreme frustration. At first, controlling each unit seems cool, they all have their own name, and it really simulates the battlefield nicely,  they have their own ammo, and their own inventory so whether there in a tank and have to hop out to repair it, or part of a squad, every man counts. But this slowly maims the game, each soldier has poor Ai, and while &quot;sometimes&quot; they will throw a grenade on their own at a tank when its in range, or maybe a gernade at  a group of infantry; usually, for 75% of the time they will stand in position firing their gun, reloading, until they run out of ammo and your forced to take time to find that unit some ammo for his gun (remember that inventory system you thought was cool, well its biting you in the ass now). So what happens when you have 30 different infantry units on the battlefield, that YOU have to put in cover, that YOU have to find ammo fore, that YOU have to avoid being obviously flanked, that YOU have to move away from grenades and tanks and falling buildings and trees that are on fire, basically you get overwhelmed. I don&apos;t like having to baby units through the most simply of tasks like throwing a grenade in cover instead of running out in front of an enemy tank to do it.
<br>Now thats just the basics, campaign is appalling, literally just a list of skirmishes that you have to do in order for each faction, and while they are different maps, most of them are the same layout of the mission each tier. But honestly, i bought this game to play competitive, and that&apos;s what brings me to multiplayer.
<br>First of all, of all the games ive ever played, this has the worst, i&apos;m talking 99 cent barely out of beta games have better matchmaking. Then of course the fact that at any time there&apos;s only about 8 matches that u can join, and half of them are operating with 200-300 ping. So when you finally do find a match, (Do not do co-op, its pathetic) with good ping, and enough players you will be introduced to an immense learning curve. Seriously, if u cant easily beat the computer on hard in skirmishes, don&apos;t do versus multiplayer, im talking units 30 yards away are invisible in the &quot;fog of war&quot;. You have to be able to micromanage each soldier very good, because I guarantee the first half of the match is who can throw grenades the best and where you put your AT guns. There are no ranked matches, so you will have to deal with the community of mostly vets by yourself, deal with the public chats  of insults and criticizing your moves 3 minutes into the match. It would take another 1000 characters to fully explain the annoyances of multiplayer and the unit AI, and the other things, so I will leave it at this. DO NOT BUY THE GAME TILL ITS AT LEAST 15 dollars, because it for sure is not a 30 dollar one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4265699">Expand</a></span>

The game had been advertised as a pre-order for a sequel to their first Assault Squad game with a lot of promised features. Myself and many other players purchased this pre-order under the assumption that DMS intended to meet this expectation. In order to be brief, DMS has fallen very short of their advertisement. They even went as far to change their game type from pre-order to &quot;Early Access&quot; when they failed to meet their release date twice. Suffice to say, we the customers are very upset and wish to share our disgust. The developers at DMS have chosen to bring on a community manager who makes it his business to completely remove any/all comments posted which even hints at disappointment in their decision to change the game to being &quot;Early Access&quot; at the last second. They have even began censoring all comments, reviews, or chat, that expresses any dissatisfaction in their product at all! Please take an administrative interest in the AS2 Steam forum. Like I said, many customers like myself feel that it is completely unethical for DMS to exercise this level of censorship. We are justified in being dissatisfied and have an obligation to voice this dissatisfaction to deter DMS from completely ostracizing the AS2 community. DMS is clearly showing a complete lack in ability to plan and execute the launch of their new product, including proper risk mitigation. It&apos;s a wonder that 1C can continue to support their fly-by-night software development practices. This game barely has all the features that the first game had and is extremely glitchy and unplayable.

<br>The differences between this game and the first Assault Squad are minuscule - the same maps, the same models, mostly the same audio, and many of the same glitches. There are a few changes, like small visual improvements and changes, but they aren&apos;t much.
<br>
<br>Even with the small changes, the game runs poorly on my pc, which can run most games very well (even Men of War&apos;s competitor, Company of Heroes 2). I&apos;m also really disappointed with the unit unlock system that keeps units locked from use until a higher player ranking is achieved. This means I am playing virtually the same game from a few years ago, but with less units at my disposal at the beginning...
<br>
<br>Admittedly, the first Men of War: Assault Squad was the first Men of War game I played, but I loved it. And I know MoW:AS2 is still a good game because it&apos;s almost exactly the same as the first.
<br>
<br>(There is some debate about whether this is a better game that the games in the Company of Heroes franchise. I think they are both great. Company of Heroes is much more polished, and gives a much greater authentic/cinematic presence of the war than Men of War. Company of Heroes is also much more visually engaging as units move more realistically and the camera is zoomed in more so the combat is right in your face. I also think the suppression fire is done perfectly in CoH.
<br>
<br>Men of War, even with all of it&apos;s faults, can outshine CoH, especially in multiplayer. The frailty of all of your units and their flexibility in combat means small lapses of judgement can cost you the game. The tank combat in MoW is also much more realistic in their firing range and armor protection/penetration.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4418110">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are the same, the performance is garbage too. This is so embarrassing, i dont even know how the developers can sleep after releasing such a piece of *** and they are asking $30 for it.  They have no talent for videogames.</span>

I have been following and playing multi-player in this game since it  first released to the public almost 8 months ago, constantly waiting for it to be fixed, but now I have given up. I loved the first assault squad, but this game is just too broken to play, despite its awesome gameplay.
<br>
<br>First of all, the game has experienced basically no fixes since the first assault squad. Known problems such as path finding, annoying resupply system, and unbalanced units were not fixed. Even worse, maps that the entire MP community agreed were unbalanced were ported into as2 completely unchanged, even though it only takes a few minutes in the editor to fix them.
<br>
<br>As far as new content there basically isn&apos;t any. There is 3 or 4 new playable MP maps, and a couple new units. Graphics were very slightly improved at the cost of a HUGE increase in system resource demand. The graphic changes are incredibly unoptimized! The hosting also changed from gamespy to steam which should be an improvement. Unfortunately the new netcode is really bad and this change has caused MP to verge on being unplayably laggy.
<br>
<br>Two of the biggest advertised changes were matchmaking and a new 8v8 game mode. 4 months after release now, and NEITHER OF THESE ADDITIONS WORK. Due to poor netcode and optimization the game only allows 4v4 to be played, even though there is 5v5-8v8 maps in the game. Meanwhile matchmaking is ruined by exploits, an idiotic and unbalanced new unit locking system, and unbalanced maps. Average wait times to find a matchmaking game are 30min+ because nobody uses the broken system.
<br>
<br>This game is also now way behind other games. Standard features for years in other RTS games are missing in this game. There is no AI skirmish mode, No lobby chat (removed since AS1), and there is textures from 2006 still in the game! A supposed main selling points of this game (first thing on steam store page) is multicore support, which its competition (COH) has been offering since 2006! The devs are still only talking about adding in dx10 support and 64 bit support. Even worse there is no dedicated servers! The game in 2014 still runs on peer to peer! This means the game only runs as fast as the slowest computer in the game. With poor optimization, high system resource demands, and bad netcode this means a huge portion of all mp games are incredibly laggy and usually unplayable.
<br>
<br>The MP gameplay in this game is the best in any RTS without a doubt. However, the game itself is so incredibly unpolished, lacking proper balance and standard features that it is one of the least enjoyable gaming experiences I have ever had. The MP community is a ghost town with a huge portion of the vet community having left the game months ago, average wait times to find a usually incredibly laggy game are 20min+.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile the devs are just awful. Since release they have been censoring negative opinions on their forums while denying they do so. They have basically stated they do not care about the veteran community. They constantly promise fixes, which never come (over 1 month since last patch, even though key features of the game are still broken). They also release patches that either make the game more laggy or do not fix what they are suppose to fix, and then do not roll-back the patch.
<br>
<br>Worst sequel I have ever seen and worst devs i have ever interacted with. Stay away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4425157">Expand</a></span>

<br>i do like the multiple campaigns, which is the only reason i&apos;m not giving the game a flat out Zero.
<br>
<br>is crashes like crazy, and runs poorly on my rig (which is a really good rig) it also stops and goes when things are happening on screen, and when you move the camera around the map. kinda like a scratched DVD.
<br>
<br>the game play elements are extremely identical. actually i can&apos;t find much of a change or improvement at all.
<br>
<br>i don&apos;t recommend people buy this game unless their die hard fans of the men of war franchise. and even then you may be disappointed by the lack of innovation and improvement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4194725">Expand</a></span>

<br>You can play game against computer with other people. But all points for reinf. are shared..so
<br>if you wont buy quick enough you wont get anything. And thats brings everybody buying inf cause its cheaper.
<br>And even if you manage to save for something more expensive then you may wont get it cause its randomly assigned to somebody else. How the **** you can do anything then? Who made this system?

The gameplay is so detailed you can edit individual soldier&apos;s inventories and pick up ammo/supplies from fallen friends of foes. Tanks have fuel, and they can get stuck.

The gameplay is so detailed you can edit individual soldier&apos;s inventories and pick up ammo/supplies from fallen friends of foes. Tanks have fuel, and they can get stuck. You can shoot the tracks off a tank, or you can shoot right through it with a Pak anti-tank gun. The realism is really what separates this game from other RTS&apos;s, such as Company of Heroes. In COH, it takes about 5-6 shots to kill a single guys at point-blank range. In MOW, it takes 1-2 shots.
<br>
<br>However, this game requires CONSTANT micro-management. You cannot send your troops to a position then forget about them. You need to manually put them in prone, crouched, and standing position. You manually must tell them to throw a grenade. With all the mm, it is very hard to manage multiple units.
<br>
<br>As a WW2 simulation, this is the closest to reality you can get right now. As an RTS, it is painstakingly tedious to manage every one of your units, it truly is a burden. If you want to truly experience commanding war in a game, this is a great game, But if you want to send about a squad and forget about them, they will die and you will lose. Your units have no AI on their own and can&apos;t really do anything for themselves. It is really up to you everything they do.
<br>
<br>The micro-management is the worst part about this game, but it&apos;s realistic features still make it an amazing RTS that I recommend to hardcore strategy and war game fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4338245">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are ok but the game play is boring, I think what they&apos;re trying to do to be better than company of heroes is become more real but people need to understand that company of heroes is all about fast paced action with realism, so yeah pretty much this game sucks</span>

We played CoH in MP for a long time until we tryed out MoW:AS2 and then finally switched to it because its much more detailed and realistic. For large scaled WW2 battles with demanding micro management there is currently no other game that offers nearly an comparable experience.</span>

<br>You don&apos;t need to farm resources (like in COH) but instead you just deploy re-enforcements when you have enough &quot;points&quot;.

<br>The graphics and effects are very nice!</span>

Basically you have so many options you will never do the same thing in this game, you will always try something new... The single player mode is more like than an overcomplicated and extremely hard Commandos, which can be fun for some people, but the real juice here is the Multi-player, where you have to put some time into the game to feel your self competitive... I suggest to watch some tutorial videos online, before you give a shot, and try skirmish missions alone to practice what you&apos;ve seen... I definitely recommend this game for buying, it is getting updates/patches constantly, so it will be just better, and the number of players are growing as well...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4897037">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you are a fan of strategy games where you have to think how you do battle this is a must. Using cover and concealment is a must when attacking dug in troops, keeping you army filled with munitions so they are always prepared and utilising tanks and artillery support are just small parts of many this game has to offer.

<br>
<br>Is it ground breaking or revolutionary? No. Graphically amazing? No. Still, its gameplay is fun and the range of units is good. Also the detail for units actions and resources like ammo, fuel, weapons make it the most interesting for me. Being able to battlefield scavenge anything from new weapons and ammo to repairing partially damaged tanks/artillery/APC etc make it really fun.
<br>
<br>Not played multiplayer, which is where a lot of people say the game shines even more so can&apos;t comment on that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4667487">Expand</a></span>

Most of my fun however, is with the various well-made modifications and addon&apos;s for the original game, as well as the editor, which is absolutely superb. This is no Company of Heroes but it is an amazing platform for grown men like myself, to get away with playing a sort of virtual &apos;army men&apos;. You can take control of all the forces of Eisenhower&apos;s US, Hitler&apos;s Reich, Churchill&apos;s Commonwealth, Stalin&apos;s Russia, and &apos;Yes&apos; you can play the French. These units are well detailed and simply pitting the AI against itself in a simulation of your own creation is part of the games main appeal. Think of this as a creative engine. If you desire, you can even speed it up 70 years and play as modern day forces. The possibilities and low price point, along with graphics that aren&apos;t too hard on the eyes, make this a fun experience with a large amount of replay value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4592949">Expand</a></span>

Features, which have little or no benefit for MOW, are rushed in a pre-alpha status and they have completely broken the game. Many people can not start the game, most of the people are suffering frequently crashes. Finishing a 2v2+ game is impossible because of an apparantly unfixable out of sync error.
<br>
<br>After one year from release the game fundamentals, like stability and lag, are still broken and nothing let us think they will be fixed. I waited one year in the hope that items for which the game was sold would be fixed. But this is the status today:
<br>
<br>- steam integration (to start the game you have to deactivate steam overlay)
<br>- improved graphics ( maybe a little on some machine)
<br>- steam multiplayer (lags  as hell)
<br>- matchmaking (does not connect and if it does it does not match)
<br>
<br>Half of the veteran community has been life banned on the forum for reporting problems. In the meantime DMS has abandoned the game, without fixing any issue and is focusing on Call to Arms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-assault-squad-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5367473">Expand</a></span>
