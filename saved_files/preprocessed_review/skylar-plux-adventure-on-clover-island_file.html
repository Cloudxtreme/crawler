As you would expect from a 3d platformer</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Skylar &amp; Plux: Adventure On Clover Island
<br>one of the cringiest games ive ever played
<br>Skylar and Plux is a 3D mascot platformer where you play as a cat lady named Skylar..
<br>setting out to save an island from destruction with her newly acquired sidekick bird friend plux
<br>The game features 3 levels, 1 boss fight, and can be beaten in about 2 hours&#x2026;
<br>As you would expect from a 3d platformer you can jump and double&#x2026;
<br>but here youll be spinning and smashing boxes crash bandicoot style to take out enemies and collect these orange gems that act as your health as well as currency to unlock these creatures in cages youll find on your journey that you can are rewarded for finding with more health&#x2026;
<br>as you progress the game youll unlock 3 gadgets.. one a jet pack to help ypu glide, one an hour glass that slows time.. useful for enemy encounters and moving parts&#x2026; and finally a magnet hand useful for pretty much nothing&#x2026;
<br>I was actually having a lot of fun when the game started exploring its hub island and even the first island..
<br>pure platforming, the level was bright and beautiful..
<br>I was intrigued by the design to explore
<br>but as the game went on the worse it got..
<br>the 2nd elvel being a bunch of boring puzzles and the 3rd just being a generic bore fest of putting a ball in a whole while you listen to your bird friend deliver the cringiest dialog ever in a game..
<br>I can tell not much went into the voice acting here as the main character doesn&#x2019;t speak at all..
<br>and this games villain sounds like a random guy youd meet at comicon trying to do a handsome jack impression&#x2026;
<br>its bad..
<br>They did go for the E rating here and this is accomplished by having your bird friend say funk in place of the f word and things like your butt is grass&#x2026;
<br>and I could feel myself die a little more each time I heard these 9 year old versions of naughty sayings
<br>instead of just.. you know.. writing with a little effort..
<br>Skylar and Plux is a mediocre time throughout&#x2026;
<br>it isn&#x2019;t fun beyond the first 3rd , it runs horribly and starts to lag when things are moving too fast across the screen
<br>You wont necessarily hate your time with this game&#x2026;
<br>and youll at least get some laughs out of the cringefest&#x2026;
<br>but beyond this.. theres nothing here worth seeing
<br>I guve Skylar &amp; Plux: Adventure On Clover Island
<br>a 5.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/skylar-plux-adventure-on-clover-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=7453157">Expand</a></span>
