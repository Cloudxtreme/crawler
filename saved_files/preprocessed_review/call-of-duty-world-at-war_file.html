You knife slower in succession, can&apos;t jump continually, reload slower, etc.</span>

                                        <span>I like this game. Its an solid WW2 shooter. With the decent COD4 engine. There are numerous WW2 games on the market. Yet i had most fun with this. It has that Cod4 feeling, simple to pick up and play. Single player was too short but at least it offered an Zombie mod. And lets be honest we all mostly bought it for multiplayer.</span>

The multiplayer is still active because of its quite amazing search (Used also in BO) for it. The zombies mode is still though somewhat active just it has mostly players (1-2/1-3) playing on modded maps/custom maps. The game is quite a nice game if you compare it to all their newer games.
<br>
<br>I miss this great series that had a few easter eggs and few ways to get to places. I do not hate BO but I do hate BOII for the overloaded repetitive insane amount of easter eggs that are basically essential for living in zombies mode.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is quite ok and it is one of the last remaining good multiplayer CoD&apos;s along with CoD 4 (I personally don&apos;t really like cod 4) and maybe BO.
<br>
<br>The campaign mode is quite amazing since well you don&apos;t have a huge amount to work with since it was based in WWII and you had no real main ways other then boats and stuff to get places.
<br>
<br>I really do enjoy the zombies mode and I really do enjoy that it has coop which if you look at it no other CoD has (I am 95% sure). The zombies mode is quite refreshing since it never goes the same way since 95% of the time the people you play with have 200-400 ping and they don&apos;t speak English and they are 10-12 and have no idea how to play.
<br>
<br>Over all I give this game a 10 even though in reality I would give it a 9 (just to balance out the 69 trolls).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4054486">Expand</a></span>

But otherwise I love the Game. I am a WWII addict and this quenches my thirst for some heavy FPS WWII style action. And with the added Nazi Zombies, it also quenches my thirst for realiztic zombie survival. Top Notch EA ^_^</span>

World at War&apos;s campaign goes thus: GO GO GO SOLDIERS! FINAL PUSH! GO GO GO THIS IS IT! OH MY GOD THIS IS THE FINAL PUSH Sniping mission GO GO GO FINAL PUSH BULLETS EVERYWHERE FINAL PUSH plane mission FINAL PUSH INTO ENEMY TERRITORY THIS IS IT ULTIMATE BATTLE. etc etc. It has none of the pacing that made cod 4 so good. Call of Duty 4, made by infinity ward, the real developers of call of duty, had the perfect balance between action, set pieces, scripted segments and stealth. Just compare the first level of call of duty 4 to the first level of call of duty world at war. In call of duty, you are getting the drop on the unsuspecting crew of a ship. After the shooting starts to tire a bit, there is an excellent set piece in which the boat sinks. Call of Duty World at War starts off looking to be good. There&apos;s a nice 1st person torture scene which sets you right into the action. Your team mates slit the throats of your captors and give you a gun . &quot;Ooh, a little stealthy action here? Taking them by surprise?&quot; I foolishly think. &quot;CALL IN ARTILLERY!&quot; *BOOM* &quot;GO GO GO!&quot; Apparently not. I love action games, but this is no half-life, or counter-strike or even call of duty. The multiplayer is decent enough. Treyarch managed to copy almost every aspect of multiplayer successfully, and even managed to copy left 4 dead in a totally irrelevant (and boring after the first go) zombie map. If you&apos;re considering getting this, you&apos;d better have loved the hell out of the multiplayer in cod 4, because that is world at war&apos;s only saving grace.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=83236">Expand</a></span>

For example, they attempt to create WW2 versions of most Modern Warfare killstreaks. Recon Planes replace UAV for example. The campaign was indded pretty good but I found that the enemy AI was lacking in their actions. Why would a Japanese soldier attempting to stab Americans with his bayonet run padt the 3 or so guys in front of em and attack me?! I&apos;m only a regular soldier after all. Enemies focus on you too much. Another poor design choice was the decision to make grenades come out and try to kill you without being thrown form soemone if you stand in place to long. It just gets really annoying. I do enjoy the new weapons they put in such as the Flamethrower though. The multiplayer is a severe disappointment because it attempts to copy MW but the weapons don&apos;t feel right. Since when was a WW2 era SMG as accurate as a modern day Assault Rifle? The best part of the game is no doubt the Nazi Zombies. It&apos;s an interesting game where you get attacked by Nazi Zombies who have a crappy backstory. Honestly, it wasn&apos;t fun alone because I would always get overwhelmed. There should be bots that are able to play with you in case you can&apos;t go online because when you do Nazi Zombies Co Op and have good team mates is when Nazi Zombies really shine because it becomes very fun. Overall though, the online multiplayer and co op really aren&apos;t fun because even in the middle of the day at the most there will be 6 or 7 multiplayer servers but only some of them will actually have people playign in them. Co Op servers are even more rare with usually about 2 or 3 of them with them often full. The game is okay but NOTHING, I mean NOTHING, compared to MW or MW2. Treyarch needs to be original instead of trying to use the success of MW to help them sell the game. Din&apos;t believe the game box, this game isn&apos;t AT ALL &quot;War  liek you&apos;ve never experienced it before&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1363888">Expand</a></span>

I tried to delete the local content and play again, but when i deleted the content, it was removed from my game list. STEAM SOLVE THIS RIGHT NOW OR I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MY FREAKING REFUND!!</span>

                                        <span> Sure Call of Duty: World At War is a good game, but Modern Warfare is still better. One of the best reasons for this is because MW is in modern time, which adds more intensity to the players with airstrikes, helicopters, and modern maps, such as Chinatown. I hope Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will be much better than what Treyarch have created.</span>

They&apos;re not even related as far as I&apos;m concerned. The single player is frustratingly difficult even on normal difficulty only because the enemy AI will throw grenades like the war is ending tomorrow. The first level I played there was one part that took me 14 tries to complete because I had to avoid five grenade blasts every time in a very small area. It&apos;s constant, every level after that it&apos;s more grenades. More often than not it&apos;s not gunfire killing you, it&apos;s dogs, grenades, tank-fire or banzai attackers. Treyarch made the game like every Nazi and Japanese soldier was a grenade spamming jerk waiting to get a cheap kill on you. In multiplayer, the weapons are way, way too accurate, you can snipe with a machine gun and even a sub-machine gun can best a rifle at 100 feet. The entire multiplayer system is taken directly from COD:4 except they replaced the helicopter with the excessively broken dog strike. One minute of dogs attacking you, sometimes three at a time, a particularly awful glitch in the programming allows them to attack you through walls, the floor, sandbags and the ceiling. They also have very poor hit detection from bullets and melee. I&apos;ve seen a dog attack that lasted for 10 minutes because every person on the enemy team had one. Also rank means nothing in multiplayer because some servers will give you 8000 exp per kill, which allows you to max your rank in one game. The single player is bad, the multiplayer is fun most of the time. The graphics are good but what game doesn&apos;t have good graphics these days. The voice acting is made up of some of the worst stereotypes I&apos;ve ever heard and they all speak English, poorly. Seriously, worst stereotypical English voice acting ever. Worth a look if you can get one for free, I wish I would&apos;ve waited until it hit a more reasonable price of $30 US.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=421594">Expand</a></span>

If you only heard about Call of Duty when COD 4 or MW2 came out, you will most likely hate this game. On the other hand, if you have been playing COD since COD1 and you think COD1 and COD2 are some of the best games ever made like me, you will love this game. World at War revisits the WW2 setting with a souvenir from COD4, the beautiful IW Engine 4.0. The pacific front is absolutely beautiful in the engine and the single player is gripping and exciting, just like early CODs. Characters are memorable, especially your Russian sniper friend Reznov, who leads you through a &apos;All Ghillied Up&apos; styled mission, only in Nazi territory. Multiplayer is lackluster to me as with all COD games as none can really compare to the scale of the Battlefield series but the singleplayer was definitely worth it&apos;s money for me. Nazi Zombies however was a lovely addition to the game and it really shows how much care Treyarch has in trying to accomplish as much in a game as possible. All in all, Treyarch was unexpectedly capable of living up to the COD name and with Infinity Ward ruined by Activision, I would not mind having Treyarch take over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390138">Expand</a></span>

Los enemigos son muy idiotas, te ven enfrente tuyo y si corres de ellos te empiezan a perseguir (sin dipararte) para clavarte un cuchillo que por alguna razon te mata de un solo golpe. La verdad es que soy fanatico de los juegos viejos de callof duty, pero cuando salio esto, empece a ver a todos los FPS de otra manera. Y encima el juego no supone ser un desafio, capaz las ultimas misiones te trabes un poco y mueras unas cuantas veces, pero todas las demas son extremadamente faciles. Una decepcion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3108625">Expand</a></span>

Otherwise, the game is a bust for anyone who has any notion of WW2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=422225">Expand</a></span>

About the gameplay itself... Some say it&apos;s a copy of cod4, I&apos;d say a copy of the battlefield series with even worse upgrades. If you use the grenade launcher with fireworks, you can kill anyone in sight (even those wearing protection agaisnt explosive). you can also lob those anywhere on the map without being seen just by looking the &apos;red dots&apos; once someone gets his 3 kills. Yes, it lacks all the vehicules of battlefield but it&apos;s almost the same. COD was different by being a player vs player gameplay but now it&apos;s not. Why would you buy a half biased game with lots of bugs when there&apos;s better out there doing the same thing. Weapons are not army/nation based. This is a big down point since it doesn&apos;t matter which army you end up as since you can take any weapon you want... Usually ends being 4-5 weapons used whatever map it is. Even the bolt actions are rather useless since in softcore they,ll take 2-3 hits to kill and in hardcore it&apos;s 1 hit but almost all other weapons can 1 hit (semiauto rifles, bar, dp28, etc.) if you set them right. The tanks also have 3rd person view which makes it so easy to play as them and almost impossible to sneak on them. Dogs are somewhat easy to kill but they 1 hit and if your team is bad you will end being stuck in the spawn being struck by artillery and a spam of dogs. The only good thing which is also a bad thing... is that the community of cod2 has moved to cod5 (and 4). The wrong part about it is that cod2 has almost as good graphics but its gameplay is more unique then the package of random ideas half made and loaded with bugs that is cod5. would have gave it a 0 if it wasn&apos;t from how many players are online to play with and that it wasn&apos;t a ww2 game. Is there no alternative of gameplay with a strong community still left out there??? Why can&apos;t we simply have a good old wwII game with infantry and without the random weapons. Oh yea... betties can be planted in solid concrete and still detect pressure? (they&apos;re easy to counter but still is lame)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=84329">Expand</a></span>

They did the original COD, COD2, and COD4. All of them absolute hits, pushing the envelope further every single time. Think of them as the creative geniuses of the genre. Treyarch - an industrial bulk game development shop (&quot;focusing on AAA quality next generation games&quot; as per their own website). AAA as in subprime AAA? They have done no less than 25 games so far - not a single one of them being a success (including COD2). They are basically the whore studio of Hollywood and they are the kind of guys you hire to develop a crappy little game to go with a big budget movie (e.g. Spider-Man 2). Look up either studio on Wikipedia to learn more about them. As such, you should not be surprised that CODWAW was not named COD5, since it is more of an expansion pack for COD4. Basically Treyarch decided that they are indeed incapable and unworthy of contributing to the COD franchise, but to nonetheless milk the captive audience, they put out some garbage while the guys at Infinity Ward are working on the next truly innovative installment. Factually, CODWAW is basically a few more missions set in WWII and powered by the old COD4 engine. There are new fire effects - exciting for 2007 but embarassing in 2008, at a time when we have Far Cry 2. If you watch up close the grass burn, the grass object is simply shrunk and is given a black coloration while emitting smoke. And only some objects can burn; and there&apos;s no catching fire concept. Now try the same in Far Cry 2. Watch every leaf and every branch get charred, watch how the fire spreads in the savannah, see the AI respond to it, and imagine all the strategies you can apply using it. So now that we&apos;ve established that the engine brings nothing truly new, let&apos;s focus on the actual solo missions. They shamelessly plagiarize COD4 - you will be injured countless times, shot, drowned only to have your good buddy rescue you in a slow-motion scene. There are also two parallel plots that you alternate between. However, the specific missions are extremely heavily scripted. More so than the original COD4. In many instances you&apos;re better off going to the right place to trigger the next event than focusing on doing a good job shooting. There&apos;s a scene where you man the machine gun on a plane, but that is also incredibly scripted. Overall this plays much more like an interactive movie than a real game - which is a huge drawback. Think of the sniping mission in COD4 - how incredibly immersive it was - there are whole websites with strategies for the last part, right before you get rescued. There is no equivalent here. Its much more point and click. The realism element is missing, and I could not relate to any of the in game characters. Do not buy this game - play COD4 multiplayer and Far Cry 2 single player in the mean time, and await patiently COD6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=420132">Expand</a></span>

Call of Duty 4 was a masterpiece(PC). Call of Duty 5 was a miss. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I like the game; but the fact of the matter is there is a lot missing in this game. 1. The weaponry sounds should have been taken from CoD2. The only guns that packed a 1940&apos;s punch was the trench gun and the sawed off shotty. Shooting a gun is a violent event; thus it should be violently portrayed. The best game that demonstrates my point is Medal of Honor Airborne. Put those guns in this game and consider my Review a 5+1. 2. Unlike CoD4, the sequel has no tutorial at the start so you just jump right in. Problem is the gun drops/placement sucks. For the first Japanese missions you have a horrible assortment of weapons to choose from. (Literally the WORST guns in the game. What I can&apos;t understand is how they expect your an experienced player from the start without a tutorial and yet they don&apos;t let you use any weaponry you want. I know they design it to create a &quot;learning curve&quot; but most players who are buying the game just want to see awesome, visual effects and guns. Oh, and Nazi&apos;s. 3. Shortest CoD I&apos;ve ever played. Clocked 3 hours play time. I was a bit disappointed in it&apos;s length. Then I started thinking, &quot;How much milk can a person get from a cow?&quot; The WWII cow has ran dry. 4. The Graphics are on par with any game of last year. It&apos;s not a small feat but for a company that has an engine to start with I was not impressed. Ok, I&apos;m a negative nelly. But there some good points. The mele knife was fun and visually stunning. All the levels were enjoyable and intense. The storyline was engaging enough to not be too boring. All in all a good game. Personally I regret purchasing this game. I recommend it as a console rental over a pc purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=420321">Expand</a></span>

The past several Call of Duty games on the PC have had more than their fair share of thrills and innovations, but this installment just feels flat compared to the others. The single player campaign has incredible production values and presentation, but its really nothing new. More of the same trenches, more of the same counter attacks, etc. Only now we havevoice over by Keifer Sutherland that is so intense and serious that it is practically a parody of itself. Anyone who played CoD 4 should be familiar with the multiplayer aspect offered in WaW: gain experience, unlock perks and new weapons etc. However, the maps, while beautiful, are poorly designed, uneven and lead to ridiculously one sided matches where one team dominates and pummels the other, often before the even properly spawn. The multiplayer and Coop modes and fun for a while (notably Nazi Zombies mode) but it wears off fast, unless you have someone to share it with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=740770">Expand</a></span>

Any person who has ever played a game knows the person with better, more accurate reflexes will win. Period. End of story. If you&apos;re taking too long to aim, you are NOT experienced in any way. He makes these assertions based on the fact that HE isn&apos;t on top, so he assumes everyone else is a noob. Do NOT listen to this guy, if you want to have a good time, don&apos;t be swayed by someone who isn&apos;t good and whines on metacritic. This game is a good, quality game that is essentially COD4 with a couple new perks. Is it worth the new value? I don&apos;t really think so, seems more like an expansion. But both COD 4 and WaW are good solid fun for all gamers. Don&apos;t let stupid historical problems with weaponry sway you from buying a good game. I also love how he refers to the &quot;Chopper of Doom&quot; from CoD4. To put it simply, SHOOT AT IT. Any truly experienced player knows that noobs get killed by choppers. Why? Because they dont know enough to shoot at it. Worth 50 bucks? Not really, especially if you have COD4. My recommendation: Get COD4, You will become addicted to the best multiplayer online since CS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=421753">Expand</a></span>

It was undeveloped just go and shoot no real reason ect. Now if i still had that 60 bucks and didnt use it and i KNEW how bad it was going to be i would of bought call of duty 4 Modern Warfare. The missions in that are developed, you know whats happening, and its not just point and shoot. In C.O.D Waw theres only 1 mission where you use a sniper. And only use it for about oh lets say 5 minutes through pretty much they whole game. Now in C.O.D. 4 theres 2 missions where you use sniper. And you MUST be sneaky. Now i like stealth games and C.O.D. 4 is a combination. Overall i think cod 4 is the better buy personally.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=422028">Expand</a></span>

So, what does destroy this game? Well, first of all, the campaign is really short, you will have it completed in no time. Not to mention the fact that it makes no sense, in the campaign Treyarch wants to tell you that WW2 was just about &quot;revenge and to murder the enemy, not to end a war&quot;. A war is to simple murder everyone? That&apos;s not how WW2 was, that&apos;s not how any war was and is, Treyarch, you couldn&apos;t get it more wrong than that stupid statement. What&apos;s also wrong, is that in multiplayer you can play on any team with any weapon. Meaning, when playing as Russians you can just pick a Japanese or American or German weapon, it makes no sense. This is NOT like Call of Duty 4, where you can say that one team &quot;could&apos;ve imported the weapons&quot; you think Russians were able to produce American weapons? They were national weapons, ffs! Speaking of weapons, you waste your ammo so very fast (because you won&apos;t stop shooting at the unending waves of enemies in both single- and multiplayer) that you are forced to pick up enemy weapons, like you do that in a real war! With that being said, I now come to THE WORST of the game, multiplayer. Multiplayer is so sad that it a shame to gaming. The game is just SO fast paced, that any experienced gamer will die over and over again, only the lucky noobs will get loads of kills. Hardly any experienced players will be seen in the top, because if you try to take a careful shot that would take five seconds, you have already been killed from someone behind you. You can literally die every second, sometimes you even spawn extremely close to the entire enemy team, making this even worse. Can there be any worse things about multiplayer, oh yes, there is. Dogs. The chopper of doom, from CoD 4, had been replaced by a pack of vicious dogs. First of all about the dogs, the amount of dogs used in a live shootout back in WW2 can probably be counted on one hand. Secondly, they one hit kill you. You need to waste more than a machinegun clip on them to kill them, but if they hit you, you just die. When was the last time that dogs were superior to humans armed with guns and rifles? EXACTLY. For those that want to know it, I&apos;ve rated CoD4 a 0, too. Two games that are epic failures. This game is, just like CoD4, not worth your money!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=421638">Expand</a></span>

I bought it because I was sick of CoD4&apos;s multiplayer: Crouch with an overly accurate m4 or run and gun with a piss poor accuracy mp5. World at War&apos;s guns are a huge refreshment: there are lot&apos;s of balanced SMG&apos;s to use, rather than just the MP5 and the P90. The round drum attachments are innovative, as well as the second chance ability. They could have done a better job on vehicles. Another thing that drew me to WaW is the multiplayer maps. They&apos;re all absolutely fantastic. On CoD4 I felt like every map was a complete M4 over-balanced spray fest. On WaW, a single person can take out several members of the other team if they use the map to their advantage. Overall, I think Treyarch just wanted to put the best WWII game out there. Obviously, WaW is the best WW2 shooter out there now, and CoD4 is arguably the best modern shooter, so I think they accomplished what they set out to do. I honestly don&apos;t like single player on any game, but WaW&apos;s SP does get a bit repetitive. Nazi Zombie is an epic win: you&apos;ll see when Der Riese comes out for the PC, it&apos;s jaw-dropping on the PS3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=84078">Expand</a></span>

Maps leave a lot to be desired, and many of the weapons are unimpressive. Pros: - Cinematic campaign. - Co-op campaign. - Excellent graphics. Cons: - Linear, repetitive gameplay. - Multiplayer rather boring and difficult. - Poor multiplayer exasibated by the lack of decent maps. - Unlike Call of Duty 4, the single player campaign does not really play out like a movie. Character depth is essentially non-existent (the Russian side of the campaign is slightly better in this regards, though not by much).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=419725">Expand</a></span>

You tond get inside buildings even if the door is wide open. There is just a invissible class wall. But the 8 comes because of the multiplayer. Same modes as in modern warfare, witch is good. Best WW2 multiplayer I have played so far. Love It!</span>

There is the new idea of co-op that works very well and the MP is as the cod4&apos;s , but in a new ambientations, with new weapons and skills.I like prestige classes too. In conclusion it&apos;s a must.</span>

Treyarch&apos;s World at War sounded promising indeed - the fact that it&apos;s seen as &quot;yet another WW2 FPS&quot; didn&apos;t bug me in the least. Then of course, I bought it. It goes without say that WaW doesn&apos;t even come close to CoD4 in terms of story, depth, emotion and atmosphere. Halfway through WaW I didn&apos;t have one OMG moment...whereas with CoD4, I had about five within in the first half hour. The graphics are stunning - make no mistake. But, like the godawful Crysis proved, graphics don&apos;t make a game. World at War is insanely buggy for a major release, has some of the dumbest AI in recent history, the sound effects are weak and musical score is anachronistic: Electric guitar riffs? 1940&apos;s? Well done Treyarch. Also, some the conflict situations are so overly populated, busy and chaotic - not &quot;intense&quot; or &quot;realistic&quot; - chaotic. I like the design of the loading screens between missions - I don&apos;t like the &quot;getting pulled to safety by your friend&quot; bit. A shameless ripoff of CoD4. Don&apos;t worry Infinity Ward, these bozos at Treyarch never came close. See you boys in CoD6!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=420157">Expand</a></span>

Not worth the $50 if you&apos;re a multiplayer-type, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=420817">Expand</a></span>

This game has taken the psychic, uber-aiming tanks and snipers of the crysis games and combined them with endless rip offs of things infinity ward did better. When you come to the sections where you meet the clairvoyant sniper, you may just give up on the game. Its not rewarding enough to be worth the boring repeat of this level until finally the sniper cant see you through walls, shoulder his weapon and pick up a headshot in the same time it takes you to hit the &quot;steady rifle&quot; button. AI this bad truly should have died back in the 90&apos;s. Yet another game where the reviewers are on the payroll of the company - add treyarch to EA and ubisoft on the list of bribers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=420836">Expand</a></span>

Campaign : 6.5 (Coz its co-op enabled) Multiplayer : 7 (just wish ppl would stop hacking :/ but what can ya do) Zombie Co-Op : 8.7 (Due to DLC and little story) Graphics : 6 (They Need to sort it out so ppl cant just put there graphics to lowest and see through all the grass.... or atleast force it on for all clients) Overall : 8 ( Good buy if you got some friends to play zombie mode with // once ya get bored of multi and co-op campaign )</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=742403">Expand</a></span>

Then I thought how poor Call of Duty 3 was to its predisesors. THEN I thought, &apos;there is no way this will live up to the 4th installment&apos;. Then I was proven wrong. This game makes excelent use of the CoD4&apos;s engine to recreate one of the most brutal and merciless wars our planet has ever seen. The addition of tanks and &apos;slightly&apos; elevated gore deters you from going gung ho into enemy lines (but never really stops you). There&apos;s still the heart thumping, adrenaline fueled gameplay of 4 but there&apos;s much more. The sounds, the visuals, the pace and the overall feel of the game wraps you in a cucoon that has you believing for fleeting moments thatyour actually being shot at, and you truly are fighting for you&apos;re own life. You&apos;ll never feel quite the same after charging through an artillery strike (yes its idiotic but i think there&apos;s an Arnie in all of us that thinks &apos;i&apos;ll be fiiiiiiiine&apos;) to find yourself alive and kicking on the other side. You may even find yourself having to catch your breath on the other side when you realise that this whole time you&apos;ve been holding it... One thing I will say though... ... I really HATE the dogs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=421471">Expand</a></span>

With luck and if you die about 20 times maybe you can advance through the next level. Not to mention the banzai attackers who only stab you at any time and you can barely see where are they hiding. But all this is just a few things of what is wrong with this game. The campaign is too short, and many of the missions are boring like others call of duty that I played before. For sure and I think for the most people the best is Call of Duty 4. But if you want a FPS with only good graphics but with bad gameplay, and you have the patience too die many times and keep trying, well maybe this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=421869">Expand</a></span>

No matter how hard I try and ive played all the call of duties as some record of proof i don&apos;t know , no matter how hard I try the game always leave me with guys running around holding down left click . The levels are sometimes to busy to the eye with no visual rest that you cant even see your attacker or figure out what happened. There&apos;s nothing more frustrating then the player getting killed and not knowing why or how or where from. i say this all knowing what faults in my argue ment there may be but none the less I give this a zero too many times im left frustrated and want to leave my computer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=425603">Expand</a></span>

While I was able to run Call of Duty 4 perfectly, World at War greeted me with crashes and bugs, and with no official fix in site, I had to troubleshoot my own problems. I was able to run the game finally, but the framerate isn&apos;t very solid, and I had to sacrifice the ability to watch cutscenes for what little stability I had. Not only that, but there are no dedicated servers for co-op or Nazi Zombies, which means any games you find for that mode will be few and laggy. I&apos;d be happy to give this game a 7 or even an 8, but until Treyarch acts to fix all of the problems related to just running the game properly, I can&apos;t recommend this game to any PC gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=83786">Expand</a></span>

First, the gameplay hasnt evolved at all, tightly scripted game with the ai taking lame shots at each other, waiting for you to do something, so immersion is nonexistent. The gun sounds are truly bad, really bad, i didnt fell anything from shooting.</span>

The flamethrowers and tanks who tried to blow up the house of Dimitri and Reznov. The water that flooded the entire underground tunnel. It&apos;s even better when you get to scream with your friends on microphone through Co-op mode while everybody are playing it the first time. When the campaign missions are done you can replay it countless time with the zombie mission. A very original idea which only came true on 2D flash game is now avaliable in 3D FPS. The mutiplayer is very well done as well, with all the levels and unlocks to keep yourselves busy. Overall, CoD:WaW is the perfect WW2 FPS game to play when you&apos;re down in your luck one day and can&apos;t kill a single person in Red Orchestra.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=420110">Expand</a></span>

Unlike COD4, I personally found myself really pulled into the life of the characters and found the game more interesting than COD4; quite possibly due to the great cut-scenes and montages during the loading screen. The plot in the game was great most of the times, with exception to some parts being a little too extreme (where normal people would have most likely died). The graphics in the game were quite visually appeasing and the sound and music for the game was amazing as well. Some weaker points in the game I have to mention is the lack of variety in close combat attacks, as it would have been so much more interesting to have a wide variety of melee attacks instead of just a few (or the exact same counterattack when you&apos;re pinned down). Another mention of problems is the attempts at realism. This includes the stupidity of the AI at times, and certain impassable terrains that could have easily been added for more realism. The AI blocking you (as realistic as that might sound) is a pain in the ass when you&apos;re trying to dodge grenades and such. After beating the game, zombie mode was quite fun as well and also worth buying the game if you ask me. it&apos;s essentially like zombie panic (half life source zombie mod), where you hold off the zombies and barricade yourself for endless waves of nazi zombies. playing with friends make it all the better as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=420241">Expand</a></span>

I had some amazing experiences with it, and some terrible ones. Multiplayer was extremely fun, with the majority of maps being balanced and pleasing to the eye. Much more suited to smaller LAN parties than rammed 30+ player on-line games. The Zombie mode was amazing beyond words, and it&apos;s a shame most people have moved over to Black Ops zombies, as the mods, custom levels and community within this mode was perfect. The Single Player / Co-Op campaign is what lets this game down. It&apos;s hard to place your finger on exactly what you don&apos;t like, but it just doesn&apos;t feel like a Call of Duty title. More like a free-to-play game, with regards to maps, animations, and storyline. Saved from a yellow score, because it felt good to have my bolt-action rifle back again!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-world-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1852452">Expand</a></span>
