Having given it a once through, I find it interesting enough to want to try it again with another faction. Much has been made about its voice command ability, but if you know anything about the technology behind voice recognition, this feature should be spotty at best. Fortunately, the game plays perfectly fine without voice command.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-endwar/user-reviews?user_review_id=2932232">Expand</a></span>

The graphics, sounds, ect are satisfactory, BUT the in-game UI will have you wondering what is happening? First off the games voice command system is a nice touch, but the developer built the game to rely on it heavily, which flaws the game because the voice command system is flawed. You haft to speak slowly word for word and thats just not fun. But, the biggest draw back is the games camera. Your camera is anchored and FIXED onto your selected unit and you CANNOT scroll away from it to look for threats, pre-plan the terrain or anything. You can only see what you unit sees. Making it worse even with air units your camera is placed under the, For example a helicopter. The camera is really low and you cannot see threats over or behind (Buildings, Trees ect.) You also cannot zoom out to see to get a better view of the action. If anything they did however add a  &apos;binocular zoom&apos; which makes looking are pixelated pebbles on the ground easier to view. Therefore it gets a 1, because at least the game works I just can&apos;t play a game that blinds you to your surroundings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-endwar/user-reviews?user_review_id=1987338">Expand</a></span>

While some gamers may criticise it for being a non-stop rock-paper-scissors match, this is a reflection of the modern battlefield. A tank will never be defeated by any number of rifle wielding infantry, but it will never stand a chance against a group of wel entrenched combat engineers. And artillery, if used properly, can truly devastate anything on the battlefield. The depth of the game is actully to scale as well, which some gamers may not like. the tactical interface is very similar to the military&apos;s FBCB2 system, which allows a commander to keep track of his units and give command digitally as well as by voice. Gamers that want a massive, epic RTS with legions of troops on both sides hammering away at massive emplaced defences and on field bases should search elsewhere, but those interested in seeing how an actual battle developes from the perspective a modern battalion commander will love the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-endwar/user-reviews?user_review_id=740227">Expand</a></span>

This game has bare minimum content and bad graphics, The voice command system is flawed (I had to mess with too many settings to get it to work, and if you don&apos;t speak in a monotone voice then the game will not recognize your commands). Little effort was put into this game, while comparing it to World in Conflict. It is as many others have put it, a non-stop rock-paper-scissors match.

In a world where we have many classic and beloved strategy games such as Command and Conquer, Starcraft, Dawn of War, etc, Ubisoft should be trying to raise the bar and blow us away. Instead, we recieve a half-baked piece of crap, with poor graphics, poor AI, and a TERRIBLE voice command system. Spend your money on a decent game.</span>

<br>you can never overwhelm the enemy with superior tech advances, the enemy will pickup
<br>at least two ranks behind you, so if you upgrade your army in anyway, it doesnt help that much
<br>3) voice command. not much, but if you made mistake using this feature, it can give u setback.

The graphics, sound, etc. are simply jaw-dropping. For a game made in 2009, I was expecting Age of Empires III-style graphics, but NO, they just had to be EPIC. The gameplay leaves something to be desired, though. The campaign is mediocre and does not really retain any lasting value once you finish it. I found that I had to restart levels several times to get out of sticky situations. The story itself was disappointing (SPOILER HERE): Russians versus everybody else, but I guess that&apos;s to be expected from Tom Clancy. The multiplayer, on the other hand, was great. Playing against others online was a refreshing experience with the good graphics. The complaints I have, though, are pretty big. ONE: Although the voice-activated UI is an interesting idea, it never picks up steam (okay, bad pun). Even with the calibration, you have to speak slowly and precisely several times for the Siri-thingy to catch on. This could be a problem just with me, because I&apos;m an American, and Americans tend to slur and talk fast, but this really dampened the experience for me. The other complaint I have is that you don&apos;t have an independent camera to move around the entire battlefield  instead, you are stuck with the unit your camera is on. Sometimes I just want to enjoy the wanton destruction, but when I have to survey the entire battlefield to make game-changing decisions, the frozen camera just doesn&apos;t cut it. Aside from those, however, this is a game that is solid. Patience is needed, but the reward is great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-endwar/user-reviews?user_review_id=2974969">Expand</a></span>

And i still find Endwar to be my favorite. Although it is alot simpler than most RTS and contains less units its boiled down to the strategic use of units, which is where most players go wrong. You have to learn what counter what and how to use this effectively. In the end i feel its a great game with few flaws which don&apos;t pull the product down.
