I can say that the game captures the feeling of the thing reasonably well. I found my palms sweating from the heights, my face from the constant (real life) leaning and crouching. The soothing immersive nature of real climbing is there, where you focus only on the wall in front of you and quickly lose track of everything else, including the ground below. Some mechanics are a bit arbitrary, like chalking/stamina, and all holds are more or less equally good - crimps and slopers exist, but the difference is mostly aesthetic.
<br>
<br>The game certainly felt familiar to me, but one of the most important aspects of climbing is missing: balance. A lot of holds in real life are untenable unless you approach them from the right angle, but here anything you can reach is fair game, and stretching up or crouching down will expand your reach. (Could be balance is introduced later, I&apos;ve only played the first two levels.)
<br>
<br>All in all, $50 is a bit steep for a game that includes only one relatively shallow gameplay mechanic. It&apos;s an impressive experience, and probably something you&apos;ll want to break out for friends, but I don&apos;t see a whole lot of depth or replayability. But this really is the new generation of VR, with games built to be experienced rather than with VR support thrown in as a gimmick (I&apos;m looking at you, Lucky&apos;s Tale).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-climb/user-reviews?user_review_id=6350574">Expand</a></span>
