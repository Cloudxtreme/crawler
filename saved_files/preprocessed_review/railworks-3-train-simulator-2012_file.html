I am not a train maniac, trainspotter, or anything like that, just a regular gamer looking for a good game. This one definitely is a good game, great even. I would have never expected that driving a train is so much fun. This sim gives you really good mechanics, (easy to learn but difficult to master), and hundreds of trains and routes (with DLCs and fan content). What I don&apos;t like about it is a game engine, which is dated and not very smooth, even on decent machines (Core i7, 6GB RAM, ATI Radeon HD 5560). Also DLCs pricing is quite hard on your pocket, on the other hand you can get a lot of fan made content for free. Overall - A great game with hundreds of hours of gameplay and minor bugs. For everyone who enjoys gaming not for train lovers only.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/railworks-3-train-simulator-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2131361">Expand</a></span>

The scope of this simulation is massive, as is shown by the huge quantity of DLC available on Steam.  There are a core selection of routes and trains to appeal to a broad spectrum of rail enthusiasts and the regular Steam sales mean that DLC can often be picked up at a discount price.<br><br>If you are not into driving trains then this sim will not be for you; I would imagine there are many people who will not get it and shake their head in disbelief that such a title would even exist.  I would respectfully say to stay away and let those of us who are into rail simming to enjoy it without the negative comments.<br><br>The recent scenarios have been more inventive and show a definite progression in quality.  Horsehoe Curve route in the deluxe edition raises the quality bar with stunning scenery and cinematic scenarios which include a credible storyline.  The cheap DLC Trains vs Zombies is another recent highlight which shows that the developers have a sense of humour and do not take themselves too seriously.<br><br>There are some bugs, but because the sim is so vast I think they are forgivable.   Also, there are frequent Steam updates whenever there are major issues.<br><br>If this was just a sim I would give it a 7/10 but what pushes Railworks from good to great, hence my 9/10 score is the toolkit which forms part of the package.  Although there is a learning curve, the tools to build your own routes and scenarios are surprisingly powerful and the sense of satisfaction of creating your own content is amazing.  There is a thriving online community where FREE routes and scenarios are widely available, some of which rival the available payware.<br><br>I have spent hundreds of hours playing Railworks and based on that I think the value for money is phenomenal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/railworks-3-train-simulator-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2099485">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t believe this is my PC since the engine, doors, ambient sounds etc are all really good. Can we please have a free sound upgrade??<br>Fantastic sim tho!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/railworks-3-train-simulator-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2058463">Expand</a></span>

Most games, or simulators of this type have lots of content made by 3rd parties.  Just look at all the content for Microsoft Flight Simulator.  This actually makes the game more interesting because you can add what you want and keeps the replay value high.  That being said I think the game should be rated on it&apos;s merits.  This game does exactly what it says.  If your interested in driving a train through beautiful landscapes and challenging environments, then this game is for you.  If you have no interest in driving a train, don&apos;t buy it.  It is definately made for a select niche of simulator fans.  And for these fans it&apos;s an awesome simulator.  Make sure you have the machine to run it though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/railworks-3-train-simulator-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=1977160">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m going to be blunt here: this is my least favorite game of all time. Why? It&apos;s a blatant money making scheme that almost insults the intelligence of the simulation gamer. The game itself is a pretty OK simulation game that can keep your attention for an hour at a time, and maybe for as long as you own it about 10 - 15 hours total. Then you realize that the base game, overpriced already as it is, is incomplete. There seems like there should be so much more there... and there is! You just need to pay about $200 in area expansion DLC. Now here&apos;s where things get worse: there are now about $1800 worth of Railworks Train Simulator 2012 DLC. Only those $200 I mentioned earlier are justifiable, because all of the DLC besides those (and a mildly exciting Zombies vs. Trains DLC) are seriously them just reskinning trains (to an experienced modeler this can take less than 10 minutes). That&apos;s about $1600 in reskins that have had so little effort put into them. I don&apos;t know one gamer, NOT ONE, who can look me in the eyes and tell me that $1600 is a justifiable amount of money to spend on ANY game, much less a decent train sim, especially when most of that money is pouring into something that just about any modder could do in an hour or two. If you think the base game will be fun, wait until it&apos;s like 75% off and go for it, but DO NOT let it become a money sink-hole, and DO NOT buy into their scheme. You and I both know you&apos;re smarter than that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/railworks-3-train-simulator-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2215451">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been very unlucky building my own route, because I&apos;ve had problems putting trains on the track, game freezes, had to reinstall and lost my unfinished routes.  Once Railworks can sort out these problems in route building then I&apos;m sure it will be better.</span>

If they&apos;re still developing and releasing stuff I think it&apos;s safe to say this game has a fan base regardless of the sillies who don&apos;t even know what it&apos;s about.<br><br>Guy who gave (McF) this a zero expects his train simulator to include wings and a jet engine, oh and a plane simulator too?  Trains have rails.  Don&apos;t try simulators if you don&apos;t have any clue what they entail.  Nevermind the DLC price, you bought this game for the wrong reasons.  Or didn&apos;t at all.  I&apos;d give it a 10 to counteract but that&apos;s almost as dumb as giving a game a 0 because one goes into it blindly.  It&apos;s not perfect, but it delivers exactly what train fans want, if not a little poorly textured.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/railworks-3-train-simulator-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=1984416">Expand</a></span>

When driving a recent GE&apos;s locomotive, I expect to see working Integrated Function Displays. If the menus are not modeled, I expect at least the main screen to be completely working exactly as the real thing. It should show the brake pipe pressure, the main reservoir pressure, the equalizing reservoir pressure, the brake cylinder pressure of the locomotive, the speed, the estimated speed in one minute, the reverser position, the power and brake lever positions, etc. The estimated speed in one minute is especially useful. Since you are in a simulator and can&apos;t feel G forces, it&apos;s hard to feel what is the current acceleration of the train. Right now, only the speed needle is modeled.
<br>
<br>The controls that show up at the bottom of the screen could be improved. The power lever should show a notch number instead of a percentage. The brake lever should have tick marks to the side to show where are mininum reduction and full service. The automatic brake, the independent brake and the dynamic brake all use the same lever and you need to press one of three buttons beside the lever to choose which brake you want the lever to control. You can obviously see why this is a bad control scheme.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t like the horn. It&apos;s hard to do the short and long blow patterns properly. The horn keeps on going too long after you release the horn button.
<br>
<br>As it is right now, it feels more like a toy than a simulator and the game loses its appeal to me.
<br>
<br>Aside from those issues, the game is fine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/railworks-3-train-simulator-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2550728">Expand</a></span>

I saw this and played a demo because I was interested to see how &quot;real&quot; this was. The inside of the cabs are modeled accurately, with the controls and interiors spot on. Aside from that, this game doesn&apos;t really do a good job of simulating trains or railroading at all. You see, in the Professional world of Railroading we have a name for people who loves trains and dont work for the Railroad: Railbuff&apos;s (or Railfans). Yes, REAL railroaders look down on these folks. Because Railfans only see the perceived &quot;mystique&quot; and &quot;glory&quot; of trains. In reality working on the railroad can be grueling and quite dangerous. This &quot;simulator&quot; plays on Railfans love and ignorance of trains. They get to work the throttle and brakes and make the train go back and forth and blow the horn- just like playing with a train set. However the physics of railroading does not translate at all in this game: slack, bunching, &quot;train feel&quot;, grade, dynamic braking, ect. Railroading is more than going back and forth on a joyride. The way the train feels as it is operating is a big indicator about what is happening to it at any moment and this fact is something a simulator game like this can never capture. That and it is very inaccurate in terms of how yard/ track switches operate, signals, handbrakes, ect ect. I guess working for a real railroad ruins the &quot;experience&quot; (if you can call it that), but I have flown a plane before and even computer flight simulators convey more realism than this train simulator does. Don&apos;t buy it!! And if you are a Railbuff who thinks this will get you anywhere near the real thing- it wont, never, ever, ever!!! If you love trains so much then get a job with the railroad. Just remember to keep your Railfanning a secret because the Railroads dont like Buffs- they end up staring at the trains passing instead of paying attention to the shove they are supposed to be protecting and end up derailing something or hurting someone!!
<br>
<br>Bottom line is: This game is just that- a game. It is not realistic nor representative of how trains actually operate!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/railworks-3-train-simulator-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=3104114">Expand</a></span>
