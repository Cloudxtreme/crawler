It gets high praise from me for teaching you new game rules without needing to throw a tutorial at you; you get to learn the game as you play. Allowing you to figure out these concepts is very satisfying; it&apos;s too bad that more games don&apos;t work this way. It&apos;s oddly refreshing to play a game where dying is not the end of the game and falling into a trap is a legitimate way to win. My only complaint is that the game is feels a little short.  It&apos;s possible to play though this entire game in a few sittings.  There are some bonus challenges, so that extends the life of the game to a degree.  The end credits in particular are pretty awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-goes-on/user-reviews?user_review_id=4351345">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, in this game you fill the moat with corpses so you can walk across without getting your feet wet.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s the basic idea behind this otherwise rather normal platform puzzler. You have buttons that change things, you have conveyor belts (with and without spikes), you have cannons that can shoot your knights about (and kill them in the process, only to land them on buttons so they keep them pressed)... you get the idea.
<br>
<br>All done with incredibly beautiful and cute animation that makes you almost feel bad for using the cute knights as cannon fodder (and quite literally so). The only problem is that the novelty factor wears off eventually and it is, well, yet another puzzler. But for the price of what you&apos;d pay for a pizza, so it&apos;s still a good buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-goes-on/user-reviews?user_review_id=6580522">Expand</a></span>
