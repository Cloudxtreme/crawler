After Clem and Lee, Javi seems like a joke rather than an actual character - he is bland as hell, I actually did my best/worst to somehow harm him through my choices, but to no avail - this cardboard cutout appears to be immune to fire. Making him the lead was a disastrous choice, he barely stands on his own two feet as a side character. You rarely control anything here, it&apos;s mostly cut-scenes with occasional Xs and Es to mash. And that would be fine if there was anyone to root for, but there&apos;s just no one except Clem and she gets less and less screen time with every episode. Javi, the chick he bangs and the kids are just meaningless, washed out bots whose slaughter wouldn&apos;t force out of me anything except for a sigh of relief. And hope that someone with an actual personality might replace them.
<br>However, IF you happen to like Javi and IF - for whatever reason - you did not play the previous episodes and have no emotional connection with either Clem or Lee... then yeah, I suppose. But for a fan, one hour of blandness ain&apos;t enough I&apos;m afraid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier-episode-3-above-the-law/user-reviews?user_review_id=7211125">Expand</a></span>

<br>As expected, almost none of the issues were addressed in Episode 3. It took them 4 bloody months to release this episode and it&apos;s still a bad episode (but better than Ep1 and 2 - but that doesn&apos;t say much since Episode 1 and 2 were so bad that anything could top it) and short as **** Literally the only thing they listened to was that there&apos;s at least some more character development this episode but still no hubs and a determinant character wasn&apos;t killed at the start of the Episode and was handled pretty damn well - but that&apos;s it. That&apos;s all they improved on. Episode 3 was **** and it does not save the season from the abysmal state it&apos;s in. This season shouldn&apos;t even exist. It&apos;s not the official S3. We played as Clementine in Season 2 and shaped our Clementine, and now Clementine is a supporting character again plus her personality doesn&apos;t change at all depending on your choices last season. The story is awful, and Clem is just a side character shoe-horned in when she was pretty much the main character for the previous two seasons. This isn&apos;t Clem&apos;s story, this is Javier&apos;s story - so this shouldn&apos;t even have Clem in it if Telltale wants to tell Javier&apos;s story so badly because she&apos;s just shoe-horned in and a side character. All the false advertising pre-release doesn&apos;t help either. Her being in every ****ing advertisement also doesn&apos;t help.
<br>
<br>Ep1 and 2 (3 is pretty much the same):
<br>
<br>Short 60 minute episodes (and the awful story makes it even worse), Clementine is playable for 5 minutes per ep, false advertisting pre-release, this is Javier&apos;s story for whatever **** reason even though we never asked for this and just wanted a GOOD continuation of Clementine&apos;s story (but this is an ABYSMAL continuation - this shouldn&apos;t even be called S3), The story is awful, and Clem is just a side character shoe-horned in when she was pretty much the main character for the previous two seasons. This isn&apos;t Clem&apos;s story, this is Javier&apos;s story - so this shouldn&apos;t even have Clem in it if Telltale wants to tell Javier&apos;s story so badly because she&apos;s just shoe-horned in and a side character.

We played as Clementine in Season 2 and shaped our Clementine, and now Clementine is a supporting character again plus her personality doesn&apos;t change at all depending on your choices last season. Easy choices and deaths don&apos;t affect you because there is not enough character development and the game just pushes you forwards without any chance to talk to characters like in Season 1 (and even S2). This review would be too long if I talked about every issue, but SOME of the main issues are up there. SOME of the main issues. S2 choices don&apos;t **** matter for ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier-episode-3-above-the-law/user-reviews?user_review_id=7205807">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you have any respect for Clementine or Lee, don&apos;t buy this game. It destroys everything from the past 2 seasons.

<br>This is an insult and a betrayal to all fans.</span>

Also trying to care for each character and keep there respect  was hard which is</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">i gave this a 7 out of 10, to me it was the worst episode out of the three we have so far,  but it is by no means a bad episode there are some tough choices that the game makes you pick not ruining any spoilers but i found taking the medicine a hard choice even though I already kind of knew the outcome. Also trying to care for each character and keep there respect  was hard which is something i enjoy out of this series. Also this episode explores family bonding which makes some decisions hard in terms of ethics and morals and still keeping respect with the characters that I feel invested in. However I&apos;m still looking forwards to the next episode.
<br>
<br>But this episode looses points because it had such a week ending. And some choices seemed to be meaning less or have no real effect as the game will still force you to move along something telltale need to start paying more attention to. To me it wasn&apos;t worth the nearly 4 months wait, but in a sense it does lead up to what episodes 4 and 5 will be about and now we have an actual plot for the rest of the series. All in all good game but don&apos;t expect it to have those Holy Sh*t moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier-episode-3-above-the-law/user-reviews?user_review_id=7177187">Expand</a></span>
