<br>
<br>Ultimate General Gettysburg is a hybrid RTS/Arcade game where speed and accurate clicking play an essential role in your success.  The game is still under development.  UGG is fast-paced, has a subtle learning curve (easy to play difficult to master), and is bisected into manageable battle chunks that allow a Phase to be completed in about 20 to 45 minutes.  The results of the Phases influence the player&#x2019;s options to fight future Phases (for example &#x2013; if the CSA does not take Seminary Hill in Phase 1 they will need to try again in Phase 2).
<br>
<br>The fantastic:
<br>Taking on Gettysburg in a game design is a significant challenge &#x2013; it is one of the most well-documented, controversial, and accessible battlefields in the world.
<br>The AI implementation in UGG is unparalleled &#x2013; the AI opponent characteristics can be set from a menu of 9 behavioral attributes from defensive to aggressive with 3 levels of difficulty.  The AI leaves every other history title&#x2019;s AI I&#x2019;ve played in the dust.
<br>UGG excels at providing details such as portraits of the brigade and battery commanders.
<br>Players always know precisely how many men are serving in each unit and the status of the men.
<br>The game has a wonderfully detailed and accurate map of Gettysburg that is visually stunning.
<br>Game scale allows players to control large armies at the brigade-level that are visually satisfying.
<br>Infantry units move over the map in columns, for speed, or in lines, for battle.
<br>Command and control concepts are easy to understand.
<br>Orders are easy to issue with troops moving along drag and drop paths.
<br>It is great to see a design team taking on historical titles with the intent to make games that replicate historical battles.
<br>
<br>The acceptable:
<br>Game speed is fixed &#x2013; which requires all players to play at the same speed.  This can be a challenge for new players as they learn to identify unit status, organize responses, and react in RTS time scale.  Most players get over the learning curve quickly and genuinely enjoy playing UGG at the selected game speed.
<br>Historically the rock walls at Gettysburg played a key tactical role in the battle (the Angle or the Slaughter Pen are examples).  In UGG the map includes features such as rock walls on the map; but, there is no value for the &#x201C;cover&#x201D; these positions provided for the troops.  As a result players tend to move their defenses to areas of higher &#x201C;cover&#x201D; that primarily include forested areas, particularly those at the crest of hills.  It doesn&apos;t impact the game play &#x2013; but it does shift historically relevant landmarks.
<br>
<br>Could be improved:
<br>There are a number of implementation choices made by the design team to ensure outcomes that meet the goals of the design team.  For example, the 2 Union cavalry brigades that opened the battle of Gettysburg are broken into 5 units to ensure the CSA does not sweep the field before Union infantry arrives in the morning of July 1.  Victory Point locations also impact the flow of the battle to ensure players play according to the historical script.  For example, Herr&#x2019;s Ridge is an important location for the CSA to hold in Phase 1 &amp; 2.
<br>There are also design team perspectives on &#x201C;what makes a good game&#x201D; that take precedence over historical reality (so I&#x2019;d argue the game is more RTS/Arcade than battlefield simulator).  For example, the design team favors cavalry &#x2013; so cavalry plays a vastly more important combat role highlighted by the effectiveness of cavalry charging.  The cavalry implementation is not in line with the role cavalry actually played at Gettysburg or during the ACW.
<br>Artillery is anachronistically too powerful &#x2013; so the speed of artillery batteries is significantly reduced to prevent artillery &#x201C;Panzer&#x201D; formation attacks.  While slowing artillery down achieves the desired result the unintended consequence is that the game drags a bit while the artillery glacially moves forward to provide support for maneuvers.
<br>
<br>Bottom Line:
<br>This is one of the best historical titles ever released!
<br>The AI is heads and antlers above anything that previously existed in the game world (IMO!).
<br>The game is challenging and the historical divergence tends to be small enough that even a historian can sink their teeth into the UGG experience and get a deeper understanding of the battle.
<br>I&#x2019;m looking forward to other historical titles from the very talented UGG design team.
<br>For $10 there is no better bargain for a game that provides hours of entertainment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4451220">Expand</a></span>

<br>Have not been able to play a MP game due to limited opponents, and the presence of only one map may be off putting to some, but for the price you cannot find a more accessible, enjoyable, and tactically rewarding wargame than Ultimate General.

Attentive interaction with programmers in the testing stages has yielded a slick product that continues to impress.  The terrain map is perhaps the most beautifully detailed I have seen.  The game is less micro-intensive than you might expect which makes it friendly to the novice gamer, but there is enough there to do for even the most intense micro-manager if they wish.
<br>
<br>Also the AI on the single-player side is pretty tough.  The only complaint with the game is that the best players might find it &apos;too easy&apos; but that is in the eye of the beholder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4451355">Expand</a></span>

The control interface is intuitive. You draw arrows with a swipe of the mouse, telling your men to march along specific path for specific distance and end up facing specific direction. Simply beautiful.

A sequel is also planned, if I could I would pre- order it now, and I never pre-order lol :-)</span>

Complex AI and tactical gameplay are behind a very easy to use user interface.  The game is perfect for those who want to try out a strategy game, but don&apos;t have a lot of experience, yet offers deep and compelling gameplay to strategy die hards.
<br>
<br>Focusing on the 3 day battle of Gettysburg, the game offers a number of battle phases fought in real time, with success or failure in each affecting choices in a branched campaign system.  Included are a number of single battle scenarios and multiplayer battles.
<br>
<br>The graphics style is very evocative of a tabletop wargame, as you move infantry, cavalry and artillery around a beautiful, hand drawn battlefield where terrain affects your unit&apos;s performance and field of view.
<br>
<br>Despite featuring only a single campaign the game offers lots of replayability as you try out both sides and multiple strategies. When you&apos;re done with that, multiplayer gives a whole new challenge.
<br>All of this at a very reasonable price points makes this game a must have for anyone who loves strategy games like the total war series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4952867">Expand</a></span>

What really makes this game stand out is the intelligence displayed by the units, particularly your own units.  They&apos;ll put themselves into appropriate formations in battle and will withdraw if things are getting too hot for them.  The enemy AI is a worthy adversary, particularly on the higher levels.  And setting the enemy AI to a higher difficulty level really does make it play differently and not just increase the amount of punishment enemy units will take before they break.
<br>
<br>Although this game is about Gettysburg, the engine could (and hopefully will) be quite easily adapted for other battles, and not necessarily just Civil War ones.  Also if the developers can add a strategic level to future games, this could develop into a series that will be a serious challenge to Total War.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4971434">Expand</a></span>

I even enjoyed Antietam for its greater scope, but it doesn&apos;t compare to SMG.  UGG is a spiritual successor to SMG.  I felt right at home playing UGG, and even if you haven&apos;t played any game like it before, UGG is fantastically simple to learn.  So this will be a sort of SMG vs UGG comparison here.
<br>
<br>For me, this is a 21st century SMG.  The graphics bring the battle to life, and the scope gives a visual &quot;awe&quot; to the battles that you don&apos;t get in SMG.  There&apos;s more simplicity to the unit commands in UGG which, for the most part, are just fine with me.  The unit AI is surprisingly good.  You don&apos;t need to babysit your units too much.  I&apos;ve seen units charge on their own to support an adjacent battalion.
<br>
<br>The controls are extremely simple and visually appealing.  Drawing lines all over a map has a satisfying &quot;General&quot; feel to it, and its an easy way to see your overall movements all at once.
<br>
<br>Unit information is easy to gather.  The numbers strength always hovers over the unit, so you can see that Ames has 1431 men, for example.  Visually the unit size scales to show larger formations, so a 1500 man unit will be much larger than a 300 man unit.  Clicking on the unit shows real-time info on Morale, Condition, Cover, and Reload.  After playing the game, and even after reading the manual, &quot;Condition&quot; seems the most ambiguous info for a unit.  I&apos;ve had a lot of units at low or zero condition, and they still fight, still hold their position, and seem effective.  I&apos;m sure it IS affecting the unit, but not to such a degree as to care much about it.
<br>
<br>Morale takes in all sorts of factors that, if you&apos;re knowledgeable of the war or have played similar games, you&apos;ll automatically know that units get morale boosts from nearby Generals, friendly units, and not being shot in the back by a flanking enemy unit.  The game uses some symbols on Morale to show bonuses, but its not entirely clear HOW much morale boost a unit is getting by looking at its Morale.  On the same note, UGG doesn&apos;t do a great job indicating a unit with flagging morale like SMG does.  SMG&apos;s units all had a flag you could see to identify morale (the flag would be large and flapping if it had great morale, and low/sagging with poor morale).  In UGG, a units icon will flash white when their morale is low or broken.  Usually by the time its flashing though, the unit is moments away from routing and there&apos;s not much you can do.  So the only effective way to know if a unit is losing morale rapidly is clicking that unit and seeing how fast their morale is dropping, or based off instinct from playing the game. If I see a lone unit attacking a defended position on a hill and taking fire, I already know their morale is dropping fast.
<br>
<br>Cover is extremely important, and is very useful to see the % of cover a unit has.  Reload is interesting too but a more useful indicator for artillery units.  If a unit is in poor conditon/morale, they reload slower.  You&apos;ll see after a unit fires their Reload go from 100% to 0%, then slowly build back up again.  This reload time is also dependent on many factors.  But, in general, Morale and Cover are icons I reference the most in my decision making.
<br>
<br>The ebb and flow of the battles, and the length of the battles, are far better than SMG.  Battles in UGG can go back and forth for some time.  Resting/keeping units in reserve is very important for counterattacks.  Retreating from a VP location is OK if you need to reassemble.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played two games now, one as the CSA and the last as the USA.  Both times I played with the standard &quot;Balanced&quot; AI.  I played first as the CSA.  By the end of the campaign, I came out with a minor victory but at great cost.  I lost a lot of boys out there.  I love that UGG tracks every kill, and unit losses/positions carry over to the next map.  In order to &quot;win&quot;, you have to take your objectives but not lose all your men in the process.
<br>
<br>As the USA, I completely annihilated the CSA.  It wasn&apos;t even close.  The final scenario I literally wiped every CSA unit off the map.  There&apos;s more difficult AI&apos;s I&apos;m going to try, and there&apos;s also a &quot;Boost AI&quot; button which, I don&apos;t know, maybe gives them extra units or faster reloads or something.  UGG is definitely worth finding an AI that will give you a run for your money, so I&apos;ll be experimenting with the difficulty levels.
<br>
<br>UGG&apos;s campaign is a lot of fun.  You get to choose your next move after each scenario, and everything you do carries over to the next phase/map.  I spent a lot of time pondering strategic decisions.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t give this a perfect 10 because I miss the flavor SMG brought to the game, namely voice overs.  Units in SMG would give audio feedback to indicate morale like, &quot;We got em now!&quot; or a holler whenever an enemy unit routed.  The battle sounds in UGG are satisfying, but voices would do wonders for it.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t hesitate to buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=5238380">Expand</a></span>

It has an easy learning curve, beautiful graphics, complex battlefield AI, and a beautiful art style to represent the largest battle of the American Civil War. Controls are fluid, even if picking exact units is a little troublesome, but the scale and depth is magnificent. Performance is awesome. There are hundreds of scenarios representing different parts of the famous three day battle and the nine AI settings all perform differently and competently. Combat is focused around infantry brigades firing volleys and batteries of artillery that can limber an artillery and the game features a line of sight system for what the player and his units can see. Infantry brigades are rated based on the unit&apos;s historical reputation and by a three star rating system (for instance, the famous Confederate Texas Brigade or the Union Irish Brigade are rated with three stars, while less reliable units like some of the Union Eleventh Corps brigades are rated only one star).
<br>
<br>There are few historical quirks and rating differences I disagree with though. For instance, Union corps are labelled with Roman numerals, which is an anachronism for the period, and some generals like Richard Ewell of the Confederate 2nd Corps are rated as three stars, when I would argue that his performances would earn him a lower rater. Overall, however, these are minor and I found didn&apos;t detract from the gameplay experience.
<br>
<br>The only gameplay negatives is that sometimes matches can drag on and there is a timing issue. There is no fast forward button, only pause and play. Pause is useful for micromanaging, but arranging attacks and waiting for units to march across the field can take a long time. If you wish to arrange an intricate assault with a lot of maneuvering, this will often eat into match time. The game is also limited to just the Gettysburg battle, though a future expansion with Antietam is being talked about.
<br>
<br>However, these negatives are not overwhelming. By far, Ultimate General Gettysburg is an excellent, light, but intelligent title and recommended for Civil War Buffs and Strategy Fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=5347270">Expand</a></span>

I come from playing mainly the Total War series of games as my strategy background. UGG has been a really fun game to be involved with in early access the devs have been great with updates and the game has been kept going in a very positive direction.
<br>
<br>The gameplay moves at a decent pace with micro-managing your units with flanking moves and plugging gaps in your lines. The sound design isn&apos;t great but is being worked on while the graphics style is very nice looking as well as being able to run on lower end systems pretty well.
<br>
<br>The dynamic campaign style is really cool to see also with choices as the battle progresses giving the game replay-ability. If you have enjoyed more casual civil war games before then you will love this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4435864">Expand</a></span>

The art style works, the game controls are innovative and (once use to) helpful to control your large army. The U.I. is lacking badly, both in function and style. The campaign is bare bones and difficult to understand all that is happening. The information given at the beginning of each engagement is difficult to understand it&apos;s full meaning. It says I have XXXXX reinforcements and no more units arrive, or I have no reinforcements so I attack too soon as reinforcements arrive. The game is fun, more than worth the 10 bucks you will spend, but a single play through is only a couple hours. Buy it not for itself but for the next game the Devs will make, for if this is their first go, can&apos;t wait to see the next one!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4436020">Expand</a></span>

Updates are regular and provide additional and noticeable features each time. Ai is a great refresh from other strategy games, providing numerous different styles and behaviours, each with noticeable differences, the art style is beautiful with a great elevation map overlay, elevation also makes noticeable impacts on troop movements and line-of-sight (which is another great feature). Troop moral/condition both work very well and make it important to manage your troops correctly (not charging them up hills constantly for example). Multiplayer has recently been added but only has limited connection slots but more are being added. Control scheme is simply yet effective and interface is fantastically minimalist, no more 1000&apos;s of menus found in other strategy games.
<br>
<br>Campaign missions flow one to the next depending on how you play each mission so there are 100&apos;s of different battle scenarios available to the player and their play style.
<br>
<br>The price as beyond reasonable for the quality and promise this game has.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4435952">Expand</a></span>

I do like how there&apos;s 9 different styles of AI, though really only the 3 hardest ones are worth playing against.
<br>
<br>That aside, the game suffers from a lack of content.  It really needs to be a full Civil War campaign with dynamic paths to follow depending on battle results - not just one battle as it is now.  Also the various phases of the battle have a way of ending abruptly with no warning, sometimes while the battle is just warming up.
<br>
<br>Units respond instantly with no courier system to relay orders.  There&apos;s no command HQ for the general commanding the armies, and the corps HQs don&apos;t seem to make any difference to unit morale or rallying disrupted/routed units.  There&apos;s no way to set formations, to limber/unlimber artillery (which by the way must be closely micromanaged as it has a mind of its own), or to detach regiments from brigades.  Artillery line of sight is troublesome, often with units refusing to fire even though the LoS display indicates no problems.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer will be interesting, but the single player at the moment is only good for about 20 hours or so of playtime after which it loses interest.  I hope they continue to add to this game and expand it to become the classic it has the potential to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4475676">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One of the most enjoyable overall wargame packages on the market, the friendly AI is sufficiently aware as to not need babysitting, the enemy AI is perfectly capable of catching and exploiting any tactical indiscretions and the book illustration style graphics are beautiful.
<br>
<br>My only criticism (and why this is not a 10) is that it needs a proper tutorial, there are a series of videos that rattle through the controls but there is no explanation of the effects for anyone who isn&apos;t a confirmed ACW nut.  A tutorial battle with detailed prompts would be a great help for the beginner.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4615302">Expand</a></span>

<br>And that&apos;s it?
<br>Yes sure, and no! There&apos;s much more!
<br>Compared to most other titles of the genre this game has a very high level of strategical and tactical depth. The morale system is very complex. The positioning of the units has to be thought out well. Even the strongest brigade will route at some point when it&apos;s getting attacked in the flank. And a general always has to ask himself if his troops are able to perform the given orders or if he demanded too much and sent them on an impossible mission. From this point of view the game isn&apos;t simple at all.
<br>
<br>The &apos;Battle of Gettysburg&apos;  takes place as a serie of several smaller battles with various conditions on different maps with different terrain types which are all part of the larger surrounding area of the city of Gettysburg.
<br>Although the game is finished and released the developers continue their work and still add improvements and new features to the game. Thus the game will even get better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4787221">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is simple enough to learn and act fast while playing, but requires you to keep focused from the first second to the end of the battle.
<br>Overall, a quality game, and hopefully the first of a series !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4435940">Expand</a></span>

<br>I miss more scenarios. Only playing Gettysburg scenario makes game repetitive.
<br>I&apos;d like to see in the future more scenarios in the american civil war or in other wars.</span>

<br>
<br>The map, whilst very nice to look at, is horrendous. It gives no real visual clues to anything, especially line of sight. You place your cannon or men in a position which looks like they&apos;d clearly be able to fire and engage someone, and they will sit there, motionless. You click on an enemy unit, and they refuse to fire at it. Doesn&apos;t matter that they are lit up to be in your LoS, whether they think they can actually see it is apparently random.
<br>
<br>There is a topographic mode included, to help alleviate this bad visual design. Shame that&apos;s mostly useless as well. You place your cannon at the top of the hill, they still can&apos;t see bugger all. Oh, it&apos;s because I placed them a few meters to the left so now they can&apos;t see. Even with the Topographic mode it&apos;s still hard to tell ridges and valleys apart, so in the end I felt I had to play the same map several times before I even knew where and where not to put my units, or where I had to exactly place my cannons for them to be useful.
<br>
<br>Every battle so far seems to have its share of bugs. Units will sometimes follow crazy paths, they will need to be told to do things several times, or sometimes they will just suddenly become pacifists and never fire at anyone. In my most recent battle, almost all the units on the map stopped fighting each other. They apparently declared a truce and  never did anything to each other. I could order them to attack and they would stand there. I could position my units so that they were physically intermingled with the enemy, and still nothing. When ordered to charge they ran past the enemy unit and had a tea break. In other battles I&apos;ve had magic positions on the battlefield, where any unit that enters it is petrified for the rest of the battle and can never move again, both my side and the enemy. This isn&apos;t the pre-release version. This is several months AFTER release mind you, plenty of time to fix issues like this.
<br>
<br>When the Unit AI isn&apos;t bugging out, it&apos;s actually rather good, at least for Cavalry and Infantry. They can often be trusted to carry out orders without any intense micro-managing, but I found it&apos;s easier to keep check on them in case they decide it&apos;ll be fun to walk across 50 enemy cannons and have a tea party whilst being flanked. Cannons need to be micro-managed though. If you place it just below the crest of the hill (A very easy mistake to make with the unclear maps) and you order it to attack someone, there is no clear visual or audio feedback telling you they can&apos;t attack. So rather than having an artillery barrage help break the line before your army attacks, your attack has been routed because you didn&apos;t know your cannons are  a few meters out. You&apos;d think that they&apos;d maybe roll forward at least a few inches so they can attack what they are being told to attack, but they prefer to just ignore you
<br>
<br>The enemy general AI, however, is brilliant. There are several different AI Personalities that a general can get, ranging from ultra defensive to all-out attacking. And they do make a big difference to how a battle goes. The AI isn&apos;t stupid either. They actually know how to fight battles, using actual proper tactics. I&apos;ve been fairly outplayed by them a  good few times. They know when to attack weak units, when to charge, when to swap out tired units for fresh ones, and a few times I&apos;ve been totally out flanked. It isn&apos;t just good AI, or passable, this truly is some of the best I&apos;ve ever seen in a game.
<br>
<br>The UI is rather pretty, but this is apparently at the expense of usability. It gives very little feedback on your units, terrain, or the battle. It&apos;s hard to determine when a unit is breaking or not without first clicking them to bring up their small info-boxes. Whilst it is manageable in the smaller battles on the first day, as soon as large battles start it can be incredibly easy to miss units breaking or routing on different parts of the field, or whether or not that unit you&apos;re attacking with is in any condition to fight. This all isn&apos;t a very bad point or anything, but it is more of an annoyance. I would much rather have a lot more information presented to me rather than having a screen that looks pretty.
<br>
<br>In summary, this is a flawed game. Bugs can easily ruin enjoyable battles, and it&apos;s Mobile orientated design saps a lot of character from units and makes it very hard to easily tell what&apos;s going on. However, the AI is really something to admire. I&apos;ve not seen Strategy AI this clever in a long, long time. It&apos;s such a shame that the rest of the game lets itself down</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=5311037">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>A very cute tactical game. To be honest real time tactical strategy aint my choose to play but UGG is another story - it&apos;s very friendly and with the same time AI is quite good, replayability is there as well. Since it is only early access gameplay there are always some things to be improved and I think the game will be even better on realse:)</span>

In addition, as a rule units do not require constant micro-management the way they do in some games where the A.I. seems to have the reasoning power of a cannonball.
<br>
<br>Not only will your own units generally respond intelligently to threats, but the A.I. system for the Computer Opponent in Single Player is without question the best I&apos;ve ever seen.  The game is still very much a work in progress, with improvements being made constantly, and these include the recent addition of early Multi-Player functionality.  But for the first few months it was out, play-testing was focused on single player against the computer, and I was very impressed.  In addition to the old familiar scale of difficulty that ranks the general ability of the A.I. opponent, you are also able to determine its relative degree of aggressiveness.   In combination, this produces the most dynamic A.I. I&apos;ve seen in a strategy game.
<br>
<br>While I said the game is approachable for the novice player, those who want to delve beneath the superficial will discover depth and detail to satisfy veteran war-gamers without becoming bogged down in cumbersome minutiae.  The  line of sight is well executed, and the mechanics used for calculating musketry and artillery effects are complex and feel accurate.  Artillery can be ordered to fire solid shot, shell, or canister, or set to auto and left to determine the ammo it deems best based on the range.
<br>
<br>But for me, the single most impressive feature was the playing surface.  I love maps, I freely admit it.
<br>Studying an accurate map of a battlefield, made around the time it happened, gives me a much greater understanding of the events that unfolded, because of the undisputed importance of terrain to the outcome of a battle.  The map in this game is, in a  word, BEAUTIFUL, and it has the sort of effect on combat I would expect.
<br>
<br>I liked this game when I first played it, but as it continues to evolve, it just seems to keep getting better.
<br>Its a solid 8 right now (and I&apos;m a tough critic) but I fully expect it to eventually be a 9 or 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4438834">Expand</a></span>

This game is a gem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4502593">Expand</a></span>

I previously gave the game a 3/10 but I&apos;m glad to say that I found the game to have been improved considerably.  Firstly, the game has fixed a few things that I criticized before: Your pathfinding AI is now better. Units won&apos;t run around aimlessly. Artillery is easier to use and acquires targets on its own now which is great. It&apos;s still difficult to tell if you&apos;ll be able to shoot at some enemies or if a tree or barn is in the way, but overall it is greatly improved.  Now on to the good: The map looks nice and you can see where all the landmarks are easily .  Both factions play differently, the north is more defensive and likes ranged units, while the confederacy is more aggressive and likes to get into melee combat. They aren&apos;t perfectly balanced, but that&apos;s to be expected. Maps aren&apos;t super long and I like who what you do in the previous battle affects your placement and options in the next. However i did find that sometimes when i captured an objective in one battle, the game would take it away from me for the next, which is annoying but not game breaking. I&apos;m not sure how long or short the game is, some people say you can win on the first day while others say it&apos;s taken them 4 days. I&apos;ve always finished in three days which is about 6 separate scenarios.  It&apos;s still difficult to discern what affects the morale and condition of your troops (which drop rapidly). I wish things like this were easier to figure out. In the end, unless you&apos;re interested in multiplayer (which isn&apos;t very active) the price is a bit steep for what&apos;s offered.  Recommend waiting for 50% off at least.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4739726">Expand</a></span>

You get used to it after a few games, but given the depth and detail given to these systems in development, they could show it off a bit more.
<br>
<br>That said, I would highly recommend it - especially at the price point, it&apos;s a pretty unique strategy experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4608800">Expand</a></span>

Anyone with any interest in the American Civil War will want to have a copy of this and it is well worth the 15 dollars being charged for the game.  The games does a very good job balancing historical accuracy with playability and the visual presentation is stunning.
<br>
<br>At its core, this is an American Civil War tactics game with the brigade being the primary building block.  The battle of Gettysburg is represented as a series of scenarios  which represent significant engagements fought by the 2 armies.  Each brigade is modeled historically in terms of size and performance based on how they did at Gettysburg historically and their reputation throughout the war.  Each scenario sees the player commanding 8-10 brigades on average with accompanying artillery modeled as seperate units that take 30 minutes to an hour to complete.
<br>
<br>The primary gameplay is derived from testing the player on executing and making decisions using ACW linear tactics and  trying to present to the player an idea of problems that require solving by Division, Corps and Army level commanders during the Battle of Gettysburg.  This includes selecting good terrain that affords units  good cover and holding elevated positions as well as forming a coherent battle line which is not easily enveloped by flanking manouvers.  Learning when to hold reserves, where to hold them and how to attack positions are simulated and the decisions asked of the player reflect reasonably on historical tactics from the time period.  Morale management is also a serious consideration as units which are sent in on their own against overwhelming odds will break very quickly and become useless to the player in battle.

<br>The highlights of the game include the saving of unit casualties and position during the campaign as you shift from scenario to scenario.  Poor performance and excessive casualties earlier in the battle may come back to haunt the player as a subsequent engagment may have the player using depleted and exhausted brigades in later maps in the scenario.  This emphasises the need to preserve troops under player control as asking the player to balance between a potentially more costly victory in the immediate scenario and risk having shattered and demoralized troops  in later scenarios.
<br>
<br>In between each scenario, the player gets to make a strategic decision as to what the overall battle strategy should be employed which brings the player to the next scenario and map.  Completing a well executed campaign while minimizing casualties is very satisfying and there is great replayability in attempting to replicate historic decisions made by executing the battleplan better than your historical counter parts, or by &quot;what if scenarioes&quot; by selecting different strategies than the one actually taken historically (ie.  What if Euwell attacked Cemetary Hill on Day 1 instead of being cautious).  An overall order of battle listing at the end of each scenario gives the player easy to understand reports.
<br>
<br>Movement and control is both well executed and at times frustrating.  Moving units involves a simple system where you draw a movement path for each individual brigade you wish to move.  It is intuitive and easy to learn but the some more precise manouvers require you to either be able to visualise exactly how a brigade will form up out of march or require some tinkering to maximize use of cover which is very important to the game.
<br>
<br>Flaws in the game range from minor inconviences to omisions that should have been dealt with before release.  The most pressing problem is that this game is lacking on a good tutorial.  The one presently in the game is rather barebones and doesn&apos;t explain key concepts well to brand new players.
<br>
<br>For those who are not well versed in historical tactics or are used to Command and Conquer / Starcraft style gameplay will be in for a shock and there have been frequent forum posts by such players not understanding core mechanics.  A good tutorial will go a long way to resolving the issue.
<br>
<br>Line of sight obstruction is another inconvenience as the game does not relay easy to read information and lines of fire can be obstructed by things which are not always obvious.
<br>
<br>Others may find historical inaccuracies jarring though in my opinion as a historic gamer, the developers have made a decent trade off between playability and historic representation. For example there is a vocal player in Early Access that has continually stated that artillery is anachronistically to powerful. I personally have not found it to be so and in most battles the game sims out, artillery casualties are well within line of the 8-10% casualties.
<br>
<br>Overall this is not a perfect product but it is a very enjoyable one and for 15 dollars, its is a steal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4647194">Expand</a></span>

First the graphic presentation is stunning; the map is detailed and very accurate. Second, the animation graphics are extremely well done; artillery rounds have arc of fires and impact explosions, massed rifle fires are well done, casualties littler the ground after a fire fight, and movement commands have neat effects to show intended movement paths. But the really impressive thing is the Artificial Intelligence built into the game engine. Not only does it handle higher command on the opponent&apos;s side in single player mode, but it handles all of the sub-brigage functions during the actual game for both sides. You, as commander to do not have to attend to every detail of every unit if you do not choose to do so. The brigades have intelligent actions and autonomous functionality built into them. The total effect during a game is extremely well done and very impressive. There are a plethora of scenarios and &quot;what if&quot; situations that make for interesting historical exploration for those who are students  of the period. About the only thing missing is a good 3-day campaign game, something the episodic scenarios cannot quite compensate for.  But, the development team is hard at work improving the system based on first-user feedback and I am confident that this omission will be corrected as new patches are released. This is definitely a system worth investing in, as I can easily see this becoming a &quot;franchise&quot; system like Total War. Recommendation: Buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4911039">Expand</a></span>

<br>The UI is simple and easy to navigate. There are a variety of options for the enemy AI and you can tailor the game&apos;s difficulty to your liking. You can set the enemy to be defensive, aggressive, balanced etc. The controls are so good its a wonder other games haven&apos;t done something as intuitive. You move your units by clicking and drawing a &apos;arrow&apos; on the map. It just is satisfying and reminds you of those old battle maps from your history class.
<br>
<br>Changes have been made to the game overtime allowing for even finer tuning of unit movement. The game is ultimately worth every penny.
<br>
<br>There was also some controversy when Apple decided it was better to censor the game because its artwork displayed the confederate flag; a context the flag belongs in. It was a period of US history that did happen. To remove the confederate flag is to undermine the sacrifices made by the men on both sides.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=6112679">Expand</a></span>

Troop reinforcements vary in time adding realism and replayability to the scenarios but simultaneously making it very difficult to develop a consistently successful plan of attack against even the weaker AIs.
<br>
<br>To elaborate on the control scheme, I&apos;ve really never seen anything else as accurate in depicting battlefield orders.  You can command your troops to suicidal marches across long stretches of open ground and they will follow you, but only if you place generals to guide them.  Without leadership they are easily routed.  Routing units follow orders inconsistently, again making for a very realistic command experience.  All these commands are given through drawing routes by clicking and dragging units around the battlefield, similar to Madden 09&apos;s system for drawing audibles on the Wii.
<br>
<br>At the same time the system of units routing is the source of a few minor bugs, occasionally your troops will be unable to stop attacking a destroyed unit and the entire battle will be broken as a result.  Minor flaws like this currently prevent the game from being consistently enjoyable.
<br>
<br>I will be very excited to see further efforts from game labs and the improvements in patches to this game, but for now the game feels like an unpolished demo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4964521">Expand</a></span>

<br>I am still a fan of Sid Meier&apos;s games and CA&apos;s Total War, but this &apos;Gettysburg&apos; is far, far beyond anything encountered in any other &apos;Gettysburg&apos; or other large-scale wargames. The UI is sometimes criticised because the Player actually needs to Understand what they are Doing... [?]
<br>
<br>Ultimate General: Gettysburg is the new baseline in this game genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4991317">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game revolves around the battle of Gettysburg which was a major battle, and some say the turning point of the civil war. The map is detailed and true to life map of Gettysburg PA. The whole game consists of this one battle which covers four days. If you have ever read in depth about Gettysburg or the civil war you will immediately recognize all you commanders as they are the real commanders from the battle. The objectives you need to capture are the real strategic points from the actual battle.
<br>
<br>The game play is pretty simple, click a group of soldiers and tell them where to go by dragging a path on the map. Tell them to charge, run, hold, or regular attack. There are four stats to consider with every with every group; cover, morale, reload, and condition. There is also artillery with a few commands of their own (canister, shell). There is also cavalry, skirmishers and commanders. The commanders provide a morale boost to troops close to them. I just pretty much described every mechanic available, but within this framework is a polished and in-depth strategy game that is a lot of fun. The ai is fully adjustable with 9 different settings, and there is multilayer head to head.
<br>
<br>In my opinion this is one of the best, if not the best civil war strategy game on the market. The re-playability is there if you want to try it from both sides, and then start to adjust the challenge with the ai. I recommend this game to anyone who is new to the genre, likes the civil war or wants to play a really fun game that is not that taxing. Unlike a lot of strategy games it does not take hours to learn. You pretty much know how to play right from the start. The trick is getting good. I have only played multi less than 10 games, so im no authority on it, but it was very fun and it had me actually sweating with suspense. Fans of total war should feel at home here. And the price is less than $10, a steal in my opinion!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=5277798">Expand</a></span>

<br>Ultimate General simply amazed me with it&apos;s simple controls but extremely deep tactical gameplay.  over all it&apos;s historical accuracy is good as well. There are a few TINY things that could be tweaked but nothing that is big enough to even mention in this short review.
<br>
<br>UG:G has easily become one of my top 5 computer wargames of all time and I&apos;ve played tons of them over the years.
<br>
<br>The fact that this small company stood up to Apple and chose historical accuracy over potential sales on the Apple store impressed me greatly. Because of this decision I will be sure to support Game Labs in the future.
<br>
<br>This is a game that will go down in history as one of the best ever. If you are a wargamer this game is a MUST buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=5365784">Expand</a></span>

The flaw is, twice as the south, i took both roundtops. The next fight, I had to re-take them and finally won. Need to get that right. Wish that when a battle is done, like cwg2, the armies would get rested and resupplied.</span>

<br>PRO&apos;s- Easy to pick up and play, simple controls, great GFX on all settings (set to low for an improved performance with little cost to the games cosmetics). Stays true to the historical events that was the Battle of Gettysburg and its locations geographically speaking (down to the unfinished train tracks).
<br>
<br>CON&apos;s- Can not think of any at this time...ah the unit movement can sometimes feel clunky and unresponsive...fixed this to some degree with unit haste.

<br>1) It is focused, it concentrates on one battle and does it well, although some may consider it to small, I like the directions they could take this engine to expand it into a more total war esc game.
<br>
<br>2) The AI is intelligent and the difficulties are not just eye candy, they are what it is like. Cautious means that they take their time, slow build up using artillery and advancing slowly while aggressive AI will charge your lines, flank you, encircle you and destroy you.
<br>
<br>3) You are rewarded for smart play as casualties carry over in the stages, enabling you to in or lose the battle on the first day of fighting.
<br>
<br>Admittedly, I am a very long time strategy fan and I will enjoy almost any game that actually improves over time (cough cough total war cough) a definite buy for strategy gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=5642825">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The UI is simple and easy to navigate. There are a variety of options for the enemy AI and you can tailor the game&apos;s difficulty to your liking. You can set the enemy to be defensive, aggressive, balanced etc. The controls are so good its a wonder other games haven&apos;t done something as intuitive. You move your units by clicking and drawing a &apos;arrow&apos; on the map. It just is satisfying and reminds you of those old battle maps from your history class.
<br>
<br>Changes have been made to the game overtime allowing for even finer tuning of unit movement. The game is ultimately worth every penny.
<br>
<br>There was also some controversy when Apple decided it was better to censor the game because its artwork displayed the confederate flag; a context the flag belongs in. It was a period of US history that did happen. To remove the confederate flag is to undermine the sacrifices made by the men on both sides.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ultimate-general-gettysburg/user-reviews?user_review_id=6592898">Expand</a></span>
