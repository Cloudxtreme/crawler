On one hand, it is exactly the type of game (or more accurately, experience) I love: Great looking environments, freaky atmosphere, chilling story (though nothing extensive at all, but it makes you think a bit about what happened to the characters and to draw your own conclusion), and AWESOME soundtrack. Anna is much like Dear Esther which I actually liked for the same reasons, but Anna is an actual interactive puzzle game. So then on the other hand, the &quot;puzzles&quot; are absolutely frustrating and over-complicated, and most of the stuff you have to do to progress seems simply done to extend the game&apos;s playtime (which is more than a few hours without using the help system or cheating with a walk-through online). In the end, Anna is a daring experiment I am glad I experienced but doubt I would visit again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anna/user-reviews?user_review_id=2764297">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Firstly the character walks very slowly, and while early on this isn&apos;t a problem it becomes annoying during the later segments that have large areas you need to keep backtracking through.
<br>The Graphics are visually fine but nothing exceptional, some low res textures here and there and some models are quite blocky.
<br>
<br>Horror wise it isn&apos;t too bad, a few paranormal events happen every now and again when you&apos;re in an area too long which are quite nice, sort of like what Underhell did during the House segment.
<br>
<br>My main issue though is the almost random tasks and the hint system, the game suffers from the typical adventure game problem of having illogical tasks and solutions and the game has a hint system, unfortunately that hint system often doesn&apos;t tell you what you need to do on a certain task or is very vague, there is also no way of checking the tasks so I would often be wandering around only to find there was an item I missed picking up.
<br>There is also problems with using some items on certain areas, you may use the item on the object but you often have to click just in the right area for it to work.
<br>
<br>If you like point and click games or art games you might like Anna, and it&apos;s probably worth playing if you see it cheap, however it&apos;s quite short and gets let down by the vagueness of the tasks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anna/user-reviews?user_review_id=2650361">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it is quite short and yes, you may want to wait until it is for sale and not pay the full price. Other than that, it has received a major makeover with a new optional hint-system that helps you out where the solution is too obscure. I find all solutions logical, especially since you have only a few items in your inventory and objects to interact with - so even try and error gets you progress easily. Sadly, the developers implemented an obligatory registration via email for the game to be started at all. The game manages to build up a lot of tension and atmosphere with only a few rooms to explore. The soundtrack and triggered events are well implemented into the game-play. The controls are smooth, the graphics beautiful and if you take your time to explore and recap what you have seen and found, you will find the solution on your own. I have only one issue with it and that is that there is a possible ending within 20 minutes of the game. If you do not know that this is a speed run alternative ending, you may get frustrated. Simply waiting a few minutes before unlocking the final step for the quick ending will solve this problem. There are three endings to unlock and I was encouraged enough by the game and the storytelling to find them all. In total, this will still be a quick play-through with about 3 to 4 hours if you take your time. For me, the experience was worth the price but I guess you really have to like this kind of puzzle game. If you are not a fan of both subtle horror and puzzle adventure and if you do not want to spend time just enjoying the ambiance, this game is probably not for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anna/user-reviews?user_review_id=2783496">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s definitely not your standard &quot;any retard can figure it out&quot; kind of game. It makes you think. If you buy this game, keep in mind that some things must be combined that you&apos;d never think of combining in your inventory. I love the mindset behind this game. There&apos;s no guessing the ending in this game. You cannot see what&apos;s coming. The music is beautiful and kinda eases the nerves at times. This is not an &apos;action packed, shoot em up&apos; type of game. It&apos;s more of a &apos; what the hell is going on, this is really creeping me out&apos; type of game. :) Very original. Keep in mind, it is a independent made game. Not like Blizzard made it or anything.

<br>And unsettling Adventure
<br>In Anna you play a character who decides to visit a home they constantly see in their dreams in hopes of finding his love Anna.. or at least what happened to her
<br>And wouldn&#x2019;t you know, the house is a bit haunted.
<br>This is a point and click horror adventure game&#x2026;
<br>And by point and click game I mean monkey island style in a first person 3d setting&#x2026;
<br>Its all about picking up items, finding items and figuring out how they all go together&#x2026;
<br>It literally took me 40 minutes just to get inside the house because these combinations are so obscure..
<br>Every solution seemingly needs a chain of events rather than being self contained&#x2026;
<br>So I decided to just restart the game and play with a guide&#x2026;
<br>much less frustrating experience that way&#x2026;. Im not an add a toaster to the water kind of guy..
<br>if you are.. youre going to really enjoy this game.. even more than I ultimately did
<br>it takes place in 1 house and took me 2 hours to complete with a guide&#x2026;
<br>As you explore the house youll come across books and items that give a back story.. you can even combine different intuitions to get the full picture of what happened and why you keep dreaming of this house..
<br>There are no jump scares here.. the horror is more psychological&#x2026;
<br>the game does a great job with its sounds and placements of items to make the journey to the end as disturbing and unsettling as possible&#x2026;
<br>You can even choose to just leave any time you want&#x2026;
<br>The game has 8 endings and you can get to one of them in literally less than 5 minutes&#x2026;
<br>But I wanted to full story so I stuck it out&#x2026;
<br>And it ended up being a great horror experience with a compelling story..
<br>One I figured out before it ended..
<br>but even at the end I couldn&#x2019;t believe that it was exactly as I thought&#x2026;
<br>Anna is definitely worth experiencing for horror fans as well as adventure fans&#x2026;
<br>But its definitely one of those games you should play with a guide handy
<br>Because the puzzles triggers and combination of items even with a guide made no sense most of the time.
<br>I Give Anna Extended Edition
