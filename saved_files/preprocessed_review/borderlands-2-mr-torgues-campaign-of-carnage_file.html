While the Captain Scarlett DLC had the pirate theme, the Campaign of Carnage sort of makes up its own theme, and does it well. I thought the character of Mr. Torgue was both genius and downright hilarious, which added a lot more to the DLC than I thought before playing it. Please, buy this DLC. You won&apos;t regret it.</span>

My favorite part was the game revewer bashing they did in one quest, which was just hillarious.</span>

Story fairly straight forward, the rewards nothing special at least from and what I &apos;ve seen from some other people, but the raid boss has amazing rewards! A definite buy not so much for the story but for the laughs(there are lots) and the loot!</span>

TCoC adds Torgue currency that you can buy powerful (explosive) weaponry with, and is also quite challenging.  That being said, there are some issues.  In terms of bugs, enemies sometimes come out of their huts and just stand there, one of the bosses got stuck in the floor, and there are some exploitable areas where enemies ignore you if you stand in them.  Catch-a-Ride systems are a little *too* spread out.  Despite this, it&apos;s still a solid DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-mr-torgues-campaign-of-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=2780825">Expand</a></span>

I beat the main story arc in about 4 hours. It&apos;s a lot of fetch quests and some maps are a bit more claustrophobic than what you may be used to. Mr. Torgue is fairly entertaining, but the quests are less compelling. The loot isn&apos;t terribly good either, as I&apos;ve maybe added one piece from this to my rotation. The Torgue Machines are nice in that you can snag a Legendary weapon as the Deal of the Day, but they cost a bit over 600 Torgue Tokens. I&apos;ve played the DLC through in addition to a fair few side missions (though not all side missions give Tokens as rewards) and have maybe 250 Tokens. It&apos;ll take a while to build up enough Tokens for even one legendary. Nice that if, like me, you can&apos;t get a crew together to farm Seraph Crystals, there is at least SOME way to get some higher end items (though by the look of them, these legendarys aren&apos;t that great). Feel like more quest rewards should have included them. Look forward to a lot of grinding. Also, the loot shower you get for beating the boss is massively underwhelming. If no good weapons, at least give us some Torgue Tokens! Eridium is useless to all players at level 50 (which lets be honest, most people who will be playing this expansion at this point will be).
<br>
<br>I wish the story was longer and the loot was better. Most of my best loot is still from the main game, with some mixed in from Capt. Scarlett. This was overall a short and rather unsatisfying experience. I certainly don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth the 9.99 alone, but is simply an alright addition as a part of the season pass. I was hoping for more meaty DLC with better weaponry. Here&apos;s to hoping the next two DLC are more enjoyable experiences that raise the level cap and gives us some nicer loot. Side note: I really disliked the tower where you go to fight Fly Boy, as you can easily fall into or be knocked into the lava. It&apos;s rather annoying to die so cheaply (or expensively, as each death costs me somewhere near 250-300k dollars). Not game breaking or something that effects the score, but certainly obnoxious and worth noting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-mr-torgues-campaign-of-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=2781451">Expand</a></span>

Essentially a do-over of the original Borderlands&apos; (much maligned) 2nd DLC, it&apos;s a series of arena fights with story quests between them and some side-quests thrown in for good measure.  This is one of the funniest DLC&apos;s I&apos;ve ever played, and Mister Torgue is probably the best new character in the franchise since General Knoxx.  The DLC switches off arena fights and story missions.  Anyone who complains about the arena fights being too simple probably shouldn&apos;t have purchased a DLC that centers around arena fights.  The big problem that this DLC has is that it features the absolute worst final boss in the Borderlands franchise.  Be prepared to die multiple times against a boss who only defeats you because it has massive damage reduction and reflection, and a mountain of hit points.  You must also fight it in an open ring with no cover, so don&apos;t plan to fight tactically.  I don&apos;t mean to dwell on this issue, but it really is the first thing I think about when this DLC comes to mind.  All in all, it&apos;s worth playing up to the last quest, then just walking back to the main game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-mr-torgues-campaign-of-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=2818001">Expand</a></span>

Mr. Torgue is absolutely hilarious to listen to, and his breakout popularity shows in his recurring appearances in later add-ons and in the Pre-Sequel. In gameplay terms, Campaign of Carnage is has less ground to cover then Pirate&apos;s Booty, with a greater focus on arena battles, timed challenges and Torgue-brand guns, with special Torgue vending machines that allow you to purchase Torgue legendaries more easily. There is some driving, and even a vehicular boss fight, though its tucked away in a side quest. There&apos;s few new enemies aside from the bosses however, being Torgue-themed reskins of the existing bandit enemies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-mr-torgues-campaign-of-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507783">Expand</a></span>
