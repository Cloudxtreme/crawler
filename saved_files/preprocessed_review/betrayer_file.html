This is more of an experimental game, toying with different gameplay and storytelling concepts. This is the definition of an immersive experience, building on very quiet natural sound design and relying on player agency for exploring the world. Now this game is definitely not for everyone ( ala this game is really divisive). For some the visual style can be visually confusing, the sound design can be a little too barren (albeit intentionally), and the gameplay can get a little stale. Personally I thought the sound design fit the experience impecably and I fell in love with the visual style to the point where my entire 15 hours was spent in that visual styling without any issues. I also found myself enjoying this game mainly because of the open exploration this game offers. If wandering around a field looking for different secrets and objectives, while navigating the game&apos;s deadly enemies sounds like a good time, this game might be for you....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4296481">Expand</a></span>

<br>When initially presented with a largely monochrome menu screen with the exception of a red face on a post, I was a little put off. I hadn&apos;t seen reviews of this on Youtube, or any trailers. It threw me. A lot.
<br>After about five minutes playing in a generally monochrome setting, I got tired of it and tried to change the graphics options and sure enough, was presented with a means to give the playing field a lot more colour and a lot more life of which this game is otherwise entirely void of except for deadly spaniard spirits and a woman doing her best to resemble a grown up Red Riding Hood
<br>I&apos;ve found the gameplay thus far massively frustrating. The colour scheme of the hud doesn&apos;t match well with the environment of the play itself - with white being the same colour as the clouds, it&apos;s hard to determine the direction of noises when a block either side of the compass bar is generally masked by white cloud. So you&apos;re still none the wiser about what direction to go in unless you&apos;re hiding in the shadows of a tree.
<br>Combat is woefully punishing. This game FORCES you to play carefully and quietly. In some ways this would be a good thing, but it&apos;s not. I think it takes a lot of the &quot;fun&quot; factor out of the game. You have one central base in which to return, only two swigs of some kind of healing liquid to patch your health back up to 100%  - and within a couple of always ruthlessly accurate shots, you&apos;ve used those two gulps and find yourself having to either find another source for that liquid or having to traipse back to Fort Henry just to resupply for health alone. It&apos;s remarkably tedious, and you most likely *will* have to take the latter of those options just to be able to actually get anywhere.
<br>For some reason the sound is a little confusing - the audio quality needed fine tuning here - I&apos;ve heard better sound engineering from Ubisoft and the like, but it still did the job. The noises though can be particularly unpleasant on the ears with the wind, the bells, the whole nine yards - if you have sensitive hearing, which can be caused by all manner of tricky issues with ears, this is not one of those games with which to wear earphones.
<br>It&apos;s a little bit of fun in very small doses, but the dangerously (and historically unbelievably) accurate musket fire of long distance contacts makes this game remarkably unrewarding, no matter how patient I may be, this in turn makes it impossible to keep wanting to play it for extended periods of time after the third or fourth trip back to base to get resupplied and the like.
<br>It&apos;s certainly original in many respects, but originality is not always the hallmark of quality, and there are some aspects of this game in which it seems to be missing that little bit of finesse in it&apos;s final production.
<br>A risky purchase for any gamer I reckon, and those who gave it 10 out of 10 are either remarkably tolerant and forgiving, or just really liked the game - for reasons I doubt I could fathom.This is not one of those games I would absolutely recommend to just anyone. This one will definitely be appreciated only by those who have &quot;acquired&quot; tastes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4085181">Expand</a></span>

If you think that FPS specifically and games generally have been &quot;dumbed down&quot; for the console generation, you&apos;ll appreciate the influence of the developers&apos; experience working on classic PC FPS such as NOLF and FEAR. Casual gamers might be turned off by the difficulty and some might take exception to the unique (and slightly controversial) art design, but overall this is a must-buy if you&apos;re looking for an alternative to the hand-holding of modern console shooters like Call of Duty.
<br>
<br>If your experience with the FPS genre begins and ends with CoD: Modern Warfare or Far Cry 2, this game will come as something of shock. Even on the normal difficulty enemies are challenging, and you can&apos;t expect to wade into a group of foes and emerge victorious. There is no cover system, and health doesn&apos;t regenerate, so expect to be punished for charging blindly into combat unprepared.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s signature art style is also the game&apos;s biggest source of complaints. The game is intended to be played in a high-contrast black and white, with red the only visible color. Per the dev team, the point of this is to both disorient the player, making exploration and combat more intense, and emphasize creatures and items of note (which glow a jarring red). Normal colors can be restored in the settings, but this takes a lot of atmosphere out of the game. I found adjusting the black and white levels slightly was an acceptable compromise.
<br>
<br>I got in on the Early Access part of the game and have watched it improve over time. The devs were active in the forums and engaged in the community from the get-go, and comments and critiques made in the forums found their way into the final product. It&apos;s refreshing to see developers in this day and age actually listen and respond to players in a professional manner, and even more so to see them actively incorporating player concerns and suggestions in the final product. The point of Early Access, i.e. that players can take an active role influencing the development of a game, seems to get lost pretty often, so it&apos;s always good to see a dev team using Early Access as more than just a way to get funding.
<br>
<br>This game isn&apos;t really made to appeal to a wide audience. There are a lot of people who will find it too challenging or will be put off by the lack of eye-candy. For fans of classic FPS, survival horror, and atmosphere, and for &quot;hardcore&quot; gamers, there&apos;s a lot of bang for the buck here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4106184">Expand</a></span>

<br>I turned the colour up by 0.1 and stuck with it. But its fine the way its initially presented. The only reason it loses a point is because it didnt have the budget/Team behind Dark Souls. Play this game for yourself</span>

<br>These people have been whores for so long they no longer enjoy foreplay.  This game is excellent... a great story, VERY challenging combat, and a love of exploration prerequisite.
<br>
<br>[PROS]
<br>- The black-and-white esthetic is beautiful, but replaceable if you&apos;re not into that.
<br>- The storyline is amazing and the characters you meet are written to make you like or hate them -- a lot.
<br>- The stealth combat is great -- creep into shadows and expect to get owned if you go running at two bad guys like an idiot.
<br>- Shadows count toward stealth
<br>- Wind counts toward stealth
<br>- When you&apos;re nearby important items, there are audio cues to draw your attention
<br>- Four hits and you&apos;re dead
<br>- You are rewarded for exploration
<br>- You can&apos;t lose aggro -- enemies will follow you until either you are dead or they are dead
<br>- Very simple inventory system; tons of lore and each clue you find is recorded just in case you want to review it later.
<br>- While sprinting, you never get winded
<br>- In my opinion, good game length
<br>- If the combat is too difficult or time consuming, there&apos;s a button for that
<br>- Full rekeybinding with warnings when you unbind a key
<br>- Audio cues are important, but if that&apos;s an issue, there&apos;s an option to turn them into visual cues
<br>
<br>[CONS]
<br>- Limited graphics options (no 1080; MAX = 1280x720)
<br>- There is no warning when you are exploring and walk into an &quot;exit zone&quot; to the next area. So while exploring, you might accidentally leave the area and then have to come back -- which is a pain.
<br>- FOV slider goes to 110, but it looks very weird visually and really hinders you given how important it is to zoom in to hit targets at range with your bow and arrow.
<br>- Light refraction off of water is junky
<br>- Enemies always walk in a triangle, so you can anticipate where they&apos;ll be.
<br>- Enemies occasionally walk on top of a tree
<br>- Enemies make a huge ruccous when they spawn
<br>- There&apos;s no letter or other device to tell you why you&apos;re here at the start of the game. You can piece together the story as you go along, but the first fifteen minutes of the game could be a lot more informative
<br>- Game is very linear all things considered
<br>- Each area takes about an hour to fully explore and technically you have to explore them twice (I won&apos;t spoil why)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4082421">Expand</a></span>

<br>The soundscape is amazing in this game. The wind blowing, the lack of music and the subtle sound effects are work well. Instead of a quest arrow, you can listen to a sound when pressing X. This is an awesome mechanic and should be in more games too. The bell and other sound effects in dark world are creepy as hell, just perfect for the game. This game needs to be played with headphones on, otherwise you&apos;ll have hard time figuring out where the enemies and objectives are. There is no voice acting, but reading the dialogues is not a problem.
<br>
<br>It looks great. Especially the dark world with it&apos;s sun shafts and fog-like environment. There isn&apos;t many textures, most of the game is just grass, trees, rocks with wooden forts. But they look good. The black&amp;white&amp;red theme works surprisingly well. I had to change the contrast values a little, but the colorless version is unique and really good.
<br>
<br>The combat feels pretty bad first, but when you get used to the speed and aim of the bow and remember to use all weapons when fighting it gets pretty solid. Upgrades feel good and are worth the money. Enemy AI isn&apos;t the best, but good enough to provide a challenging gameplay.
<br>
<br>Good little game. Doesn&apos;t feel like totally polished, full game, but you can see that from the price tag. Definetly worth getting, at least from a sale if you&apos;re interested.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4084261">Expand</a></span>

A negative reviewer should think about what games they love before they write. I don&apos;t personally love arcade side scrollers so I don&apos;t play them. This is a game made for adventure/horror/creative types. Totally sandbox, beautiful art style that keeps your goosebumps on high, and enough weapons/powerups/enemies to keep you playing for hours.

<br>You play as a shipwreck survivor  in the 17th century exploring your new environment. Pretty soon it becomes clear that there are supernatural forces at large, and various sub plots clues and locations begin to unravel the story of what befell the settlers.
<br>Like your character, we the player are left to our own devices. There is no training level or hand holding, it is you, alone, with only the wind trees rocks and birdsong for company.
<br>Upon death there is the &quot;Demon Souls&quot;frustration of having to clear an entire area again of  respawned enemy in order to reclaim your hard worked loot , but despite this and the fairly repetitive &quot;crouch sneak kill&quot; combat Betrayer is compelling enough to draw you back in for one more go.

Creative writing went into this story and characters. I hate how people whined about the black and white atmosphere so much the devs made color an option as there&apos;s a REASON for this, but respect them for doing so to cater to the gamer. The presentation is fresh and relative enough to keep you enjoying it throughout the game. Very easy to be overwhelmed if you run and aggro too many enemies. Awesome visual and audio cues will make clue you in to your exploration rewards. Fairly difficult default gameplay, in that if you just charge into 3 enemies you WILL die. Overall I loved the game and can&apos;t wait to see what they come up with next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4097022">Expand</a></span>

The game has a great atmosphere, especially with its nice touches, such as realistic wind effects, and the ability to change the colour saturation when playing.
<br>
<br>At first it appears as though the game has no story. You arrive in a wooded area with scattered forts and military outposts. Everyone aside from one NPC are dead and it&apos;s your job to find out what happened to this place. As you travel from one open area to another, you find clues and remains of the conflict. In each area you are able to traverse between the normal world and the dark world. In the dark world you are able to communicate with the spirits of the dead, hearing out their side of the story, and eventually putting together the clues that tell you how they died and why.
<br>
<br>In each area, there is a variety of enemies you encounter, each of which poses a threat, especially when they come in groups. This means you often have to approach them with strategy and stealth, because most weapons are either not that powerful or take a while to reload. It kind of felt like Dark Souls but in 1st person - dangerous enemies, dying takes you back to a safe place with all enemies in the area revived, and most of the story told through clues in the environment.
<br>
<br>I generally enjoyed the game and found myself very immersed, but there were a few minor drawbacks. For example, it started to feel like it was dragging on a bit in the latter stages since the gameplay did not change much between each area. I also found exploring the dark world to be a bit tedious because the environments were being bland. I think it could&apos;ve been made a bit prettier with some more detail in the environments. Just because it&apos;s meant to be grey and dark does not mean it has to feel empty. There were also very minor gripes, like some wearable charms having useless bonuses, like having a 4% chance of being harder to spot (why equip that when I can equip charms that increase my melee damage by 50 or even 100%).
<br>
<br>In general, this is a solid game. If you&apos;re into games with an open-world feel and lots of things to collect, and story being subtle, you should enjoy it. If you&apos;re not into those things, you might, just like me, enjoy it still.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=5249135">Expand</a></span>

<br>I only have a couple of negatives. The first one is a bug that causes each save to take longer and longer until the app crashes.  I could get about 15 saves before it crashed.  The got caught in scenario a few times but nothing major. The biggest compliant I have is that the game didn&apos;t really bother introducing any of the concepts that you needed to know so you were left guessing the first half of the game and then realizing you had to backtrack to the earlier areas to do stuff. The final complaint I had was that there was simply too much backtracking and searching.  A simple way to mark locations on the map could have saved a lot of time searching around for things I had already found.  Quicker methods to get back to areas I needed to get to would have also been useful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4955645">Expand</a></span>

<br>Blackpowder Games deserve praise for attempting something a little different with BETRAYER, and although it remains, at heart, an action RPG, they have succeeded in taking the genre in an unusual and interesting direction. This is a game that&#x2019;s big on atmosphere, even if it is a tad light on content. Visually the game is quite unique, and the small indie studio have managed to create a world that&#x2019;s far more eery and mysterious than can be found in most AAA horror titles. And this creepy atmosphere is further enhanced by excellent audio design. The combat is fun and reasonably challenging, and it does stealth pretty well too. It would, perhaps, gain something from a wider variety of environments and maybe from some voice acting, but on the whole this is an excellent little game. And it&#x2019;s also great value for money. Some have criticised BETRAYER for being repetitive but personally I found my 26 hours within the game thoroughly enjoyable, and it never felt like a grind. And I managed to get all the achievements &#x2013; huzzah!

<br>The game itself is - well.. lets be honest .. pretty lame. There are some rather simple puzzles - if one can call them that ... and a few ghostly enemies that are seriously lacking some brains. Then there is a story that does not quite work very well in terms of storytelling. - oh and it is also not very creative.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/betrayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=5250821">Expand</a></span>

The quests can be tough, since clues are scarce and not always obvious. Also you have to do some backtracking in the end; luckily when no enemy is a real threat anymore. The game is default black and white but you can turn on some colors. Recommended.

I think it would&apos;ve been beneficial to have the game condensed to a couple hours shorter. It also wouldn&apos;t have hurt to see a little more diversity with regards to objectives and environments as the game does become increasingly repetitive towards the second half.
<br>
<br>The intended visual effect does appear atmospheric, but is also hard on the eyes. I thought the ideal colour set up included reduced brightness and contrast with a slight tinge of colour. The environments themselves look decent enough, but gun models leave much to be desired. While the gameplay mechanics and UI are solid enough, it&apos;s clear that Betrayer is a low budget title with quite a few limitations. Given more resources, I&apos;d be interested in what else Blackpowder Games come up with, as I quite like the artistic direction and &apos;feel&apos; they seem to be going with their products.

                                        <span>A criminally underrated game. It has a lot of clunky unpolished bits compared to other FPS games you may see, but its focus is on the beautiful black/white/red aesthetic and the amazing story that keeps you guessing and guessing as to the fate of the British colonists.
<br>
<br>Ignore the horrific critic scores, it is truly a great game that has been panned for the few shortcomings it has.</span>
