Now arena awards packs from a random expansion, which means the only way to keep up with the latest is by paying hundreds of dollars. Just buying one or two packs a day with gold gets you nowhere. And even if you pay that obscene amount, you still lose to aggressive combo decks who stall until they have the correct cards to burn you down in a single turn, while you are unable to react. If you are a free player who wants to be competitive, Hearthstone has become a chore. If you pay, it has become an endless money pit while you try to build a deck that is fun to play and doesn&apos;t lose to combo rush decks. By the time you realize that this doesn&apos;t exist, a new expansion will be out. Rinse and repeat. Hearthstone continues its downwards spiral into straight up money milking waste of time territory. Get out while it&apos;s still early.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-the-grand-tournament/user-reviews?user_review_id=5501049">Expand</a></span>

<br>Overall, TGT has brought 2 new decks into the Hearthstone meta, of which one is unfortunately too overpowered and dominating the game currently. (I&apos;m looking at you Secret Paladin, don&apos;t you hide behind those secrets!)
<br>
<br>While the other archetype, dragon priest, is pretty cool, the new card Mysterious Challenger ruins the current meta in constructed.
<br>
<br>Balance changes were left out, and unfortunately no regards to arena gameplay was payed when it comes to card rarity. F.e. Murloc Knight is a common card that will single-handedly win you the game in Arena in many cases, making Paladin OP in both constructed and arena.
<br>
<br>With already enough unbalanced cards around TGT should have provided tools to counter or balance those cards - instead, it created a handful of playable cards, among which Mysterious Challenger is beyond overpowered, and over 100 unplayable cards.

I think only of four legendaries that are good. First is Justicar Trueheart (Battlecry: Replace your starting hero power with better one.) which is neutral card and can be played in all of your decks cause its ability is useful in almost every type of deck. Second card is Nexus-Champion Saraad (Inspire: Give a random spell to your hand.)  which is neutral card too and his ability is very powerful. Over all you&apos;re getting mostly just one spell cause its too much threat. Third is Confessor Paletress (Inspire: Summon a random Legendary minion.). I think it&apos;s the most powerful card priest can have. But if you want to use it good you have to wait to turn nine or just be lucky and get it some different way which isn&apos;t much usual. Last card I really like is Varian Wrynn (Battlecry: Draw 3 cards. Put any minions you drew directly into the battlefield.) which has got the most overpowered ability in game. I think Varian is first card that needs to get nerfed. Well that was about really good cards. Sure, there are some common cards that are good too but this expansion was mostly about legendaries. And we&apos;ve got here a new mechanics named Inspire and &quot;Joust&quot;. Inspire means: &quot;When you use your hero power, it&apos;ll do something. And &quot;Joust&quot; means: &quot;Reveal a minion in each deck. If yours costs more do something&quot;. Joust is good to find out what deck you&apos;re standing against. But these mechanics aren&apos;t that good as it seems. Joust is just another RNG-like mechanic. When you&apos;re Inspiring your biggest problem is that usually you can&apos;t play your hero power on the same turn as card with Inspire or you have to wait to turn when you can play a card with inspire and play hero power. Well i think that&apos;s enough I hope you got something from this review and I&apos;m waiting for new Solo Adventure named League of Explorers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-the-grand-tournament/user-reviews?user_review_id=5702518">Expand</a></span>

<br>Never pay a cent for this expansion; just try to craft cards that you really need to.

<br>Big hype and lots of garbage cards. At least they in a small amount of buffed priest and control warrior. That&apos;s why I gave 1 point.</span>

<br>
<br>Let me address one thing first - if a review (at least for this game in particular) is just negative because the reviewer is complaining that you need to pay to win, then he&apos;s just flat out wrong. And you should just stop reading. It is possible AND EASY to play this game on a good competitive level and not pay a single dime. There are guides on youtube that show the creation of a new account to rank 5 in on month (see Trump F2P session for example). On a review you should comment on the game itself and since its a free game, saying you have to pay to win is just pointless and in this case extremely false.
<br>
<br>That being said - The Grand Tournament expansion - Most of the cards are really fun and the new mechanics are great, inspire is really fun and adds alot to the game, jousting is so far abit weak so far since the meta is still too fast. There are some really bad (weak in power level) cards sure, but that&apos;s always going to happen, and as more cards are released there could be future interactions that will make them viable. And overall its really balanced, since no card was really overpower that you must include in almost every deck (like Dr.Boom in Goblin vs Gnomes).
<br>
<br>The only really negative point in TGT for me, is the lack of decent warrior common cards for arena, making warrior a class that is REALLY worse than all the others in arena.
<br>
<br>If you are thinking of playing a card game then Hearthstone is really one of the best. And TGT should encourage you and not the other way around.

The thing that encourages to throw away that **** is the devs attitude. let me explain. There was one deck that didn&apos;t cost too much to make, namely Patron Warrior. it revolved around throwing a card that summons it&apos;s exact copy when injured but not killed, and card that gives them charge.
<br>It has gone and stormed through the ladder for ages, but no nerf was coming, so people started trying to play around them and started succeeding, effectively pushing deck out of meta. No sooner than then Ben Brode rode from the sky with his angels to salvage us by making the card that gave charge to a crap that would still be bad even if it cost 1 mana less. He didn&apos;t agree to at least buff statistics, since that would &quot;kill the soul of the card&quot;[ sic].
<br>Game would be good otherwise and was good in beta, but power creep killed it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-the-grand-tournament/user-reviews?user_review_id=5760389">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As always, some cards are sadly a little bit to strong (Mysterious Challenger is such a case), while lots of other cards will never see play outside of Arena, but that is okay - balancing a game without the feedback of a big player base is not nearly as easy as people assume.
<br>
<br>Out of the cards there are in fact point to criticize. When Blizzard introduces new heroes for real money only there was a hope that Blizzard realizes that a good free2play monetization revolves around selling cosmetic stuff, not competitive stuff. Sadly, with the recent changes the opposite is fact - since you can&apos;t grind packs from the newest expansion in Arena as easily as before, since the reward packs are randomized now, the pressure to pay money for competitively needed content is higher than ever - and that is sad and may endanger the future of Hearthstone if there will ever be a worthy contender.
<br>
<br>Still, this can&apos;t have a to big impact on the rating for this expansion, since these changes were not part of the expansion. It is still something that makes this expansion a little bit more annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-the-grand-tournament/user-reviews?user_review_id=5831501">Expand</a></span>
