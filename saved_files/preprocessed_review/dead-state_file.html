<br>It&apos;s riddled with bugs:
<br>
<br>&#x25BA; Worst pathfinding i&apos;ve seen in a game:
<br>- Characters randomly teleporting to stairways (means sometimes you&apos;ll be engaged in a fight with one of your characters stuck on the opposite side of the map).
<br>- Blocked items (important ones for quests, like laptop data, or entire racks of medicine).
<br>- Characters often hovering above ground or sliding instead of walking (breaking whatever semblance of immersion DS has to offer).
<br>- Characters constantly unable to move to an object unless you move other characters away. - Unresolved pathfinding actually crashing the game.
<br>- Enemies inside walls.
<br>- Bodies piling on top of one another (unable to loot them).
<br>- Etc.
<br>
<br>&#x25BA; Very predictable enemy behaviours, only made unpredictable by bugs and poorly implemented combat mechanics:
<br>- Cameras staying fixed on the last character that played instead of following enemy action (wow!), means when that character happens to be on a different floor you won&apos;t be able to see the combat.
<br>- If you have a character with high enough APs to wield a Sledgehammer and high melee skill, all you have to do to clear the map of zombies is approach them from behind (or the sides) and one-shot them one at a time... This makes zombies little more than scarecrows, offering no real menace, unless they&apos;re compacted into huge groups (which i&apos;ve seen happen like once).
<br>- Enemies spawning out of nowhere (thankfully rarely).
<br>- Getting stuck in turn-based combat for infinite turns with no visible enemies around.
<br>
<br>&#x25BA; And the final blows that made me end my own misery and stop playing:
<br>- Broken quests (plural).
<br>- Unrepairable upgrades plummeting base morale.
<br>- And finally the car magically disappearing from the shelter.
<br>
<br>But i can forgive all the bugs on a rushed kickstarter release, when the team behind the game has worked so hard to keep all their promises and continues to devote their time to patching it up (though you shouldn&apos;t make paying customers beta-test your game, and i&apos;m afraid putting such an unpolished product for sale in an effort to catch that little xmas boost will mean disaster for future sales).
<br>What i can&apos;t really forgive is the lack of attention and creativity that pervades the entire game:
<br>
<br>&#x25BA; Horrible, awkward, amateurish inventory system:
<br>- Very unresponsive drag&amp;drop often forces you to keep trying the same item over and over.
<br>- No way to dump your entire inventory into a container without painstakingly shift-selecting one by one (often accidentally dragging instead of clicking to make things even worse, or misclicking somewhere and losing the entire selection), when it would be so damn simple to just use the shift to instantly transfer items.
<br>- No way to distribute loot from containers to all characters, having to waste awful amounts of time depositing and withrawing stuff to maximize your carry capacity.
<br>- No game pausing when using inventory leaves you open to ambush while you&apos;re merrily arranging items.
<br>- Guns only unloadable in characters&apos; individual inventory (not on inventory transfers between base/characters/containers).
<br>- Annoying pop-ups (with no shortcut key to dismiss) warning you of exceeded weight (when it would be so, so simple to just auto fill and leave the excess in the container).
<br>- No info on character max carry capacity in item transfer windows (only in individual inventory), makes you keep guessing... Add that to the fact there&apos;s multiple units of weight in use (imperial system, really?! Why?!) and prepare to spend yet more time guessing!
<br>- Can&apos;t stress enough how much longer you&apos;ll spend organizing inventories, instead of actually playing the game!
<br>
<br>&#x25BA; Crappy interaction between characters:
<br>- You pretty much only have four questions for everyone for the entire game! That&apos;s it! No more dialog, except:
<br>- You get cut-scenes in the morning: one after the other, completely disconnected, and often asking you to do things you&apos;ve already done.
<br>- Characters just stick to the walls of your base, more lifeless than zombies, instead of moving around, or (dare i ask) manning the posts you assign them on the job&apos;s board (which, by the way, is a whole other can of worms).
<br>
<br>&#x25BA; You have a huge base, but only ever use 10% of it (4 rooms), the rest is desolate deserted space you explore once at the beggining and never visit again.
<br>
<br>&#x25BA; Practically zero ambient sound and music coupled with very basic graphics leaves you with a game completely destitute of atmosphere.
<br>
<br>And i could go on and on, but i doubt a lot of people will have the patience to read this already endless wall of text. And there&apos;s always the (very incomplete) official List of Known Issues on Steam (if anyone cares to delve further into this mess).
<br>
<br>TL;DR: Needs another year of development! If you don&apos;t mind playing a survival game filled with bugs and awkward interactions, go play Project Zomboid. At least that has good music (and a lot more fun)!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=4808629">Expand</a></span>

If you want a perfectly polished title, Dead State might not be the game you are looking for.
<br>
<br>I think many of the reviewers have the problem that they quit the game to fast. Yes, it is damn hard to get into it, the escape from the burning plane feels more annoying than comforting and the first mission doesn&apos;t show the best part of the game either. I had some hard time starting the game as well and nearly quit at the beginning. But i didn&apos;t - and because of that i could see what a great game it was.
<br>
<br>Dead State is probably the best mixture of strategy and role-playing game i ever played - and i don&apos;t say that lightly. It has its weaknesses, like a bad AI and Zombies moving out-of-vision to fast and seemingly appear out of nowhere when you are to loud, but that&apos;s okay. But it makes up for that by a really nice atmosphere, good characters, a good storyline, a good base management system, a good general game balance and lots of other very positive things.
<br>
<br>The scavanging, searching for food and discovering new places is just a great mechanic overall and the crisis events are a great way for character developement.
<br>
<br>I only wish that DoubleBear had some better programmers, because when we look at it, the programming (AI, Bugs, malfunctioning user interface elements) is really what keeps this game from getting 10 out of 10 points from me. But still, after all, i would consider it the best game i have played in 2015 so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=5834419">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed beta testing the game for DoubleBear and helping them to use the EA process to better the game.
<br>
<br>I think the game is a blast even in its frustrating buggy state.
<br>
<br>Now onto the reason why I think people should not buy this game or support the company DoubleBear for any future games until the Give a public apology.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know about all of you but I found Kickstarter and Steam Early Access to be a wonderful breath of fresh air. I was sick of big AAA and medium sized AA Developers and Publishers pushing out 3/4 made buggy games that after I paid full price for had to wait months before it was patched up and enjoyable. This was the norm and I was sick of it.
<br>
<br>So I started supporting only EA and Kickstarter games, more than I could afford at times. Dead State is one of those games and I was very happy to support Doublebear.
<br>
<br>Sadly DoubleBear betrayed its fans and sought to deceive new buyers into believing that Dead State was a finished product in order to take full advantage of the Holiday shopping season. Brian and the Dead State team had pages of known bugs and some of them were game and story breaking.
<br>
<br>Ask yourself what reason would a Developer move a product that is known to be a buggy mess from Early Access to calling the game fully released. We the gamers are there Publisher and we were not on their backs pushing them to release the game in a unfinished state in order to reap the profit from the Holiday season.
<br>
<br>My over all point is that when small gamer funded games pull the same fast one as big AAA developers something has to be done about it. This type of behavior and not be rewarded.
<br>
<br>These type of actions corrupt the new system from within. If this is allowed to happen then we get get a bunch of small studios acting just like the AAA ones because they can.
<br>
<br>I and many others went onto Dead States forums to ask for an appology and get an answer why they felt the need to move a unfinished game from EA to fully released. We all found ourselves pounced on ,forum post locked and in several cases found ourselves banned. These type of actions are those of people wanting to hide what they did not ones wanting to correct the mistake that was made.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know DoubleBears reasons to fall to to such a low level. If they had funding problems there are so many other more honest options. We gamers have shown ourselves to be very giving.
<br>
<br>I ask people to avoid this game until the game is finished and DoubleBear publicly apologies for its mistakes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=4847326">Expand</a></span>

That said its amazing what they were able to do with a 10 person team, and a small budget. I paid full price and feel like I got my monies worth with it. Is it perfect no, but does it deliver on the experience of managing a shelter during a zombie out break yes. This is not an action game its a thinking game, and those who enjoy that will enjoy this a lot. Personally I am ready to throw another 50 at an expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=5391921">Expand</a></span>

<br>Visually, it&apos;s not great, but a good game can allow itself some leeway in the graphics department. It looks like Fallout 2, and plays somewhat similarly to Fallout Tactics.
<br>
<br>The basis of the game is simple; zombie apocalypse, gather survivors, build shelter, survive. Zombie apocalypse means there are zombies and looters. A very basic AI means very easy gameplay after a while. There are a lot of items, but all characters gravitate towards the same overpowered build, with the same weapons. Character backstories, or any story for that matter, is wafer-thin, and even feels inconsistent from time to time. Building the shelter is nothing more than a set of pre-defined upgrades, that change values in a spreadsheet (not kidding). Surviving entails gathering resources, which starts to feel repetitive after the first hour. The maps are indeed different, but there&apos;s nothing that feels new; walk up to zombie/looter in a group, hit it until it stops moving, loot stuff, repeat.
<br>
<br>In short; boring, very sparse featureset, and a lot of time-consuming activities.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=5777184">Expand</a></span>

The ideas are there...base building, character interaction, an actual plot with an actual ending (rare in games these days).  Also, there are no micro-transactions, which is great.  This was meant to be real game, reminiscent of Fallout.  But for some reason, the developers appear to have quit development early and released an incomplete game as if it were a complete product.  Many features are buggy or missing, and the whole thing feels like a late alpha-stage game, maybe an early beta.  Everything is limited, scaled down, dumbed down, or broken.  The timing of the release--just before the holiday binge--makes one wonder about the motivations of the developers in releasing an incomplete game.  I so badly wanted to experience a game like the old Fallout games, but this sure isn&apos;t it!  Another eight months of development, and believe this game could be good.  Perhaps the developers will take the money they got from the broken release and invest it in finishing the game (rather than sticking it in their pockets and laughing at their customers).  If the game improves I will update this review (assuming I am still interested in revisiting it in a year or so).  Dead State is in an incomplete state, and needs more time in the oven.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=4862991">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game overall is quite good,  it definitely keeps you thinking about how you&apos;re going to spend resources,  and balancing risk versus reward as you go scavenging.  Combat is turn based and reminiscent of Fallout and Wasteland 2.
<br>
<br>You have the opportunity to influence how some of your NPCs grow by making choices that determine their growth path,  though many you cannot influence.
<br>
<br>The game is overall in good condition today with only a few bugs remaining and I&apos;ve not run into any gamekilling bugs.  NPC&apos;s are generally well written and believable.  You do find yourself making hard choices,  such as leaving competing groups alone or engaging them even though they aren&apos;t overtly hostile.
<br>
<br>The &quot;Leveling&quot; mechanics are innovative.  You don&apos;t gain levels from killing things,  you gain them from scavenging and making decisions.
<br>
<br>It does have a few cons,  variety of loot becomes repetitive after a bit,  and NPC gifts are almost completely dependent on the random generator,  making it very difficult to find some things.  Another minor annoyance is that some areas are locked so you can walk over them and never see anything until someone tells you about it.
<br>
<br>Overall it is a fun survival RPG and I&apos;d recommend it to anyone who is ready for a non-standard RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=5046354">Expand</a></span>

On the strategic level, you need to secure a shelter, gather food, fuel, other fellow survivors and try to keep your little community expanding, thriving and, mostly surviving each passing day. when you choose your foraging party in the morning (and at the same time assign other less exciting tasks to those who stay behind in the shelter), you go out to look for what you need to survive in a dreadful, apocalyptic world of death. Then you get to meet the enemy: zombies -yes- but especially other human survivors, who are often more dangerous than the living dead.
<br>Tactical combat (turn based-JA2 style) follows with a good many options and  weapons. I find also this part of teh game very satisfying, and cannot say I have found all the glitches and bugs other reviewers mentioned (after the &quot;reanimated&quot; patch of mid may 2015). Overall, I love this game, but it still has room for improvement: a) overall morale of the shelter seems to have a limited game effect b) more dialogue option would be beneficial c) you cannot kneel or go prone in combat d) there seem to be little option to use stealth usefully in combat. I hope the developers will address some of these points.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=5284649">Expand</a></span>

Great characters, good graphics, challenging but also simple battles. The only drawback is quantity of bugs and glitches, which, i hope, will be resolved soon.</span>

Strange, but hopefully it wont happen again. I then could play some more and I feel I should update my review and score:
<br>
<br>So I tried going down to Downtown Splendid. Here I met some human looters. I must say that human enemies seems impossible. So I had surrounded a &quot;Nervous Looter&quot; with Renee, Sarah(me) and Joel. I attacked him with melee 14 times, hitting him only three times. By then he had shot Joel dead (4 gunshots, whereof 3 hit Joel). Finally I was able to knock him down after 16 attacks total. By then his friends showed up, probably due to the noise from the gunshots. His friends were much much harder, a &quot;Tough Looter&quot; and a &quot;Serious Looter&quot;. One equipped with a knife and a pistol, other with a long polearm. I tried to attack them but my attacks all but one missed. Then they just killed Renee and Sarah. This is pretty unsatisfactory. I have followed all the advice from the games tips dialog boxes and then this happen? I thought that being three together in my party would give me some safety. Maybe I should take four with me next time (can&apos;t take five since that fifth guy had to stay at home at the base to fix some important stuff (not revealing this because of story)).
<br>
<br>At this point I have to give the game a 7. The game is simply to hard, to the point of being imbalanced.
<br>
<br>OLD REVIEW:
<br>This is seemingly a very interesting Zombie apocalypse turn based action and strategy game, featuring ressource collection, character management and base building, repairing and crafting. Everything seems pretty detailed. If you ever played State of Decay, which had rather simple base construction and management and also rather basic character management then know that Dead State is highly complicated and detailed in these features and that is a big big plus.

<br>Unfortunately the whole experience is hampered by the game not being ready for release. Game breaking bugs like consistenly getting freezes and black screen when you travel to a specific area seems unsolvable because it doesn&apos;t help to load the save game again, it keeps happening. Loading from an even earlier save will help for a while until it happens again. This forces you to all too often to rewind your progress to an earlier save which is really REALLY horrible for a game like this. Loosing your progress is the absolute worst a game like this can do to the player. That is why I, sadly, am forced to only give Dead State a 4. If not for the game breaking bugs the game deserves a 8 or 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=4795786">Expand</a></span>

<br>Combat is actually quite difficult and unpredictable, and human enemies are very dangerous.  It&apos;s a refreshing change of pace.  For once, you have to consider whether or not going into combat is even worth it. Combat costs you ammunition (if you use firearms) and medical supplies(for the impending injuries you&apos;ll receive)  and possibly deaths.  You need to weigh up the possible scavenging benefits to all of that.  Especially since you don&apos;t get EXP from combat (which i love).  Much better off sneaking in, scavenging, and sneaking out, then you are fighting.  Very much enjoying this game, and definitely re-playable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=4799968">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>-Bugs:Encountered many bugs with the newest patch.Skills that arent working at all or they work just wrong.Some of the mechanics seems broken too and this influenced my experience!Minus -2 for that in the end!
<br>
<br>-Visuals:Ugly as hell, sorry.
<br>
<br>-Sound:Some of the worst sounds if ever heard.A character is injured?The sound they play to &quot;simulate&quot; that is hilarious.First i thought a porn is running somewhere.Turn out this is to &quot;simulate&quot; the heavy breathing caused by the injury.WTF??Music is not good too.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:Bare minimum.Some active skills, some passive ones and some perks.Nothing fancy, its ok to keep you going.Problem is, some of them will not work or will not work how they should be!Movement is a pain, no real sneaking.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:While the things i said sounds all terrible i had great 4 days with the game.Unitl i reached a point where i die for no reason!!!Just like that, someone stabbed me to death in the shelter without a major incident and many of the residents liked me.No warning, nothing.Food for weeks, gas for weeks, everything was fine.Suddenly Davis says &quot;people are dying because of you&quot;.What?Not ONE in the game is dead!I think something in the mechanics isnt working like it should but im really pissed at this game.
<br>I dragged myself through this awfull game because of the story.The story is great, there is everything.Tension, passion, you like and/or hate the people you lead.But when bugs like that happen and you waste your time its the worst.
<br>
<br>The game is for me without the bugs a solid 5 bwcause i had fun despite the poor sound and the poor graphik.With the sheer amount of bugs(quests that wont end properly for example) its just a 3, im sorry.
<br>This game had potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=5053002">Expand</a></span>

Upon release, this game was unplayable, but the devs cleaned it up to about 80% playability (without wanting to punch your monitor). Why this game was released with so many known issues is beyond me -- I can only guess it has to do with some type of contractual obligation to either Steam or Kickstarter.
<br>I currently have 70 hrs invested in this game, and I&apos;m starting to get a little burnt out.  It does become a little repetitive, but only because of the bugs slowing everything down.  It&apos;s very cathartic bashing zombies heads in after a hard day, but its becomes frustrating when those glitches kick in and slow you to a snails pace, or when a major event happens, but its glitched and you are powerless to make a decision .... Usually resulting in very negative results.
<br>Graphics and music are also decent and the maps are fun; however, all maps are pre-written and never change.  In other words, you restart the game, same maps, same zombie and enemy placement, zero replay ability factor .... But there are ALOT of maps.  This is a real shame, because if the maps were random (or any random events for that matter) this game would have a huge replay ability factor a la Xcom meets Oregon Trail.
<br>Right now, this game is going for $20 to $30 on steam, but I think a $12 to $15 price tag is more appropriate.
<br>Check it out, if its on sale, or they gear up some substantial DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=4815589">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is the most brutal and punishing game i have ever played! You get NOTHING but punishments in this game! The only rewards you get is less punishments. You are babysitting a group of people who never offers you any rewards only complaints. You get to do decisions where if you pick one way you will get punished later on by something and if you pick the other way something else will punish you later on instead. Nothing rewards you for anything! Killing zombies doesnt reward you, it can only punish you, opening locked doors cant reward you only punish you. This game is like playing on a minefield, take a false step and you get to pay for it! If you screw up in this game you screw up BIG TIME! Because of how punishing the game constantly is you will be forced to either reload or restart the game because its almost gamebreakingly difficult if you mess up! Lose a teammate and the game becomes insanely hard. Which leads me to the combat. This is the part where i hate this game the most! There is no room for tactics in this game because you can only solve every fight the exact same way! Either bash them with melee or shoot them with firearms, but if you do use firearms you will, can you guess? thats right! you get PUNISHED because all the zombies will run towards you and if they spot you in a horde you are doomed! You cant get rid of them! No matter where you run all these CRIPPLED zombies will keep up and never lose you. This is the dumbest decition ive ever seen in a game like this because when you are locked in combat you cant flee, you cant travel and the only way to go is a certain death! Ammo is scarce, melee weapons do almost useless damage so every single zombie takes MINUTES to kill! And this brings me to the games length. Its lengthy all right! In a full day i played this game and only got about 5% of the map. Its not that the map is big its just that the COMBAT TAKES FOREVER! Its so utterly slow and tedious and repetetive and punishing! If i only got rewarded with XP points for killing zombies it would be somewhat worth it but its not! The developers must be a bunch of truely misareble people who are only able to make up misery but no joy! The whole time i played it felt like a big tutorial because i didnt feel like i had free will. I always had a main mission and if i didnt commplete the main mission in that specific day all hell would go lose and the punisher himself would appear!
<br>
<br>If you play games for fun STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME but if you like babysitting and work for punishment then maybe you are a masokist and will like this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=6334603">Expand</a></span>

It really shows that the game was made by experts in RPG&apos;s like Brian Mitsoda who work at Troika and made Arcanum and Vampire : Bloodlines.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796441">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Good: Community building, conflict resolution, character development, standard and specialized resources, story telling.
<br>
<br>The Bad: Graphics are a little primitive, but not that bad. I like high resolution in first person shooters, but &apos;illustration graphics&apos; are fine in an isometric. Pathfinding could get weird.
<br>
<br>The Ugly: The turn based combat could use a little refinement.
<br>
<br>I did not find any bugs that broke my game play or really annoyed me. I have played a lot of games over the years and this one wasn&apos;t that bad...HEY PEOPLE, Kickstarter or not, you can only go so far with the budget you have and they delivered a fine product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-state/user-reviews?user_review_id=6696557">Expand</a></span>
