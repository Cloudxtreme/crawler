You can tell it&apos;s developed by a small studio and i agree with some of the flaws. While dungeons and indoor area&apos;s generally look pretty good, the graphics outside are pretty dated. This bothered me a little at first, but the world is so detailed and fun to explore, that i quickly started to look past it. So graphics aren&apos;t great, but they do the job well enough. The music, like with all divinty games is excellent! Combat wasn&apos;t very convincing to me at first, but i grew into it. he game is challenging, fast and thanks to the wide selection of skills it&apos;s still pretty enjoyable. The world isn&apos;t very huge, but it&apos;s big enough and there&apos;s tons of stuff, items, gear, sidequests and dungeons to explore. The game does this very well. And it has some very cool stuff like dragon flying and having your own battle tower. hmm, i didnt mean to start writing a whole review actually :) In short, if you can look past the technical flaws (mind you, i find the game still pretty polished), there&apos;s really a lot of fun to be had. Otherwise i&apos;d have given this game a 9. If you&apos;re a fan of action rpg&apos;s you really should check this out. finally, i don&apos;t want to preach, but don&apos;t leech games from small devs like this. buy it if you like the game! We don&apos;t want another iron lore, troika or ascaron on our hands.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-ego-draconis/user-reviews?user_review_id=744007">Expand</a></span>

Graphically, DAO it isn&apos;t but even DAO wasn&apos;t amazing in this category. Whilst the appearance is enough to immerse you but has issues with tearing that forcing Vsync on does nothing. Playing around with the game&apos;s graphical settings can reduce this to a level where it is less annoying, but I don&apos;t see screen tearing acceptable on my PC which is more than efficient to run this. So, it loses a point for that. One of the game&apos;s biggest highlights so far for me is the humour and the voice acting. Some of the conversations and mindreads will make you laugh, and even the music will give you the odd chuckle. The quests are many and enjoyable, and can be completed in various ways so as to keep you thinking, and always adds to replay value. So where does it lose it&apos;s 2nd point? Well as pointed out by another reviewer, it is the combat. I have only played 5-6 hours but that is enough to at least give a review on the games&apos; combat system. It does leave you a little underwhelmed having come from a game such as Dragon Age, but it is not fair to compare as this game is far more twitch based, a little like The Witcher without the combos. If you retrospectively consider this combat system you can allow it&apos;s shallow feeling, because in the end, it&apos;s not like games such as Diablo 1+2 or similar action/RPG games were any more involved than this one. So, it loses a point here, but in a good way. I am yet to witness the Dragon combat, and I know this is a large part of the game later, so if that is good then i&apos;d give this a 9, if it isn&apos;t then it&apos;s a 7. But for now I&apos;m satisfied that I have invested in a game that will keep me engrossed for the next few weeks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-ego-draconis/user-reviews?user_review_id=743617">Expand</a></span>

The rest of the game was solid, albeit somewhat tedious to do all the sidequests (but then, I&apos;m a completionist), and the physics could have used some work. But it was a good game.

Divinity 2 is 3rd person RPG game with very fluid action and combat orientation. Really refreshing game for any RPG lover, a must have.</span>

I never read a review or anything and up untill I saw it on the shelf in the store, I never knew it existed. So this is a stone cold review from a baseline of zero. This is also for the console port on the 360 rather than the PC version. Graphics were to as expected for a title of this generation of console. A liberal use of light and shadow along with various shadings of light to set certain moods. Example would be that while exploring a cave certain fungus put off phosforescent light but of a purple hue. And it shades everything around it. Honestly I enjoyed the graphics and felt the paper doll representing the player character, scenery, and the monsters to be as well done as I have seen. It is beautifully rendered on my 56&quot; HD TV. The background music is just that. It stays in the background, changes in certain areas to help create moods of tension when combat is immenent. It gives a folk like environment when near a farm. It does all this without you noticing which is what background sound is supposed to do. Very professional job. Voice acting couldn&apos;t benifited from a few more different voices instead of one or two guys changing the way they talked so they could be &quot;voice #2&quot;. Its not a game breaker. Only a mild annoyance. The controls were very fluid allthough when turning the camera and rolling during combat there was some chugging on the framerate and skips did occur. It was mild but noticable. And while not a game breaker, it is the one thing that keeps me from saying everythnig moves fluidly which it doesn&apos;t. That would be a lie. Spell effects are colorfull and varied enough to not appear to be the same animation again and again but in a different color. It works for this title. Character building is very unique in its flexibiliy and how varied. Some skills are for show as they are worthless to gameplay and some have serious balance issues. I won&apos;t name them because I don&apos;t want to spoil someone&apos;s game. But there are certainly some borderline balance issues. Combat is very simple. Its a button masher with jumping and rolling for defense. You have a limited tactical ability in using landscape as cover. Line of sight for mobs can be used to easily break up large quantities of enemies into smaller more easily digested singles. Meaning when you are close enough for the name to appear, mobs notice you unless you are sneaking. If two mobs are close enough then two will notice you and the others around them will ignore. Personally I found the combat to be unentertaining and just plain bad. There is no reward. You do not win because you are a jumping, rolling, dodging machine. You win because your level is the correct number. If you are too low then spells won&apos;t work and the enemy cut through you like butter. There is nothing you can do. If you are the same level it isn&apos;t even a challenge. If you are higher level then they basically can&apos;t hurt you. You basically monitor your health bar, hit the hot key button for a potion from time to time and mash a button. There are few real tactical advantages to be had by playing well. There is no playing well. You are either of the appropriate level to be there doing that and you will succeed or you won&apos;t and you will die. The saved game system is broken so when you die.....and you will die....you have to reload. You don&apos;t respawn at a nearby checkpoint. When you reload you may or may not be clear on the other side of the world where you previously saved the other night because the way this game overwrites saves doesn&apos;t &quot;over write&quot; everything and keeps things from previous saves.....which can sometimes kill your game and cause you to start completely over from scratch after putting in 12 hours of gameplay. Let me tell you how happy that made me feel. I have found that when you go to save that if you don&apos;t over write and instead delete old saved game and then save a &quot;new&quot; one, the saved game glitches are eliminated. So at least there is a work around. Otherwise this game isn&apos;t playable unless you never die, and play straight through till the end without stopping for a break. The story is poorly concieved and the player is left wondering what is going on and who the heck that was who talked to him. You get the general idea that certain people are bad and are in need of killing. So you go kill them. You don&apos;t get to play as a dragon untill you are around level 18 or so. And the content for the &quot;dragon&quot; is very structered to the point where it just seeme like a cool way to get from point A to point B alot faster and along the way you get to play a mini game of shoot the bugs down. This game offers so much. Oh you get to play a dragon. Oh you get an undead servant which helps out in battle and is customizable by what body parts you collect. You have guys who abstractly go out and collect alchemy componants and based on how you equip them effects their success, time spent collecting, and if they have to be healed. You have an upgradable war tower you use which has a real effects in the game depending on if you upgrade the various platforms. There are so many cool ideas and concepts about this game that you would think it should be great. It just isn&apos;t. They were great ideas poorly implemented in some cases and not finished in others. I think that is what this game suffers from. It was released before it was done. From quest NPCs dissappearing randomly, to broken quests that you can&apos;t finish, to the game killing save bug. So if it sucks so bad then why give it a 5? Its all about perspective. When I go out and spend 50-60 dollars American on a CONSOLE title, I am supposed to be buying a finished product. This was not a finished product nor was it tested. The game wasn&apos;t a complete failure. It definatly passed the look test but not much more than that. I would suggest to people to not buy this game. Rent it. Borrow it and play it first. If you can have fun with it then evaluate the flaws on your own terms and decide. This is a game that sounds good on paper but doesn&apos;t deliver so don&apos;t be fooled.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-ego-draconis/user-reviews?user_review_id=743182">Expand</a></span>

It IS an action beat-em-up combined with stunning, huge areas to explore and interactions. The features to craft Diablo-style random items are fantastic. This game would have great replay value. This is game is simply &apos;awestorm&apos; to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-ego-draconis/user-reviews?user_review_id=86243">Expand</a></span>

The story is epic and a lot more mature than most RPGs, and the balance between serious and funny quests is thoroughly polished. I can&apos;t think of any bad thing to say about the game, yes the ending is a little... shocking, but I&apos;m certain the developers have a lot of great ideas left and I will now eagerly for the sequel!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-ego-draconis/user-reviews?user_review_id=85097">Expand</a></span>

You think you&apos;ve seen everything and the games just keeps getting bigger, more complex and interesting. It&apos;s a european RPG through and through so if you need hand holding or can&apos;t understand the idea of having multiple ways to finish a quest (or even start a quest) and proceed through the game then stay well away and don&apos;t come here and cry about it. The combat in this game is some of the best for a european RPG i&apos;ve ever played (i&apos;ve gone through about 35 hrs now as a warrior spec) and it just flows really nicely. Between your pet, dragon form, lair and the rest of the maps (think of it as having very large zones [larger than STALKER] that you can travel between or directly to with different teleport systems or by simply walking or flying through the levels. It is simply EPIC. I think it is definitely worth a playthrough again as a spellcaster. The game is well balanced but rewards your dedication. Early on for the first couple of hours the combat will be hard until you figure out that you can dodge spellcasters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-ego-draconis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1439670">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are beautiful and well done, and have higher resolution textures than most newer games I&apos;ve played.<br>I&apos;ve rarely seen an RPG of this calibre - there&apos;s a couple clunky encounters, but the writing quality is significantly superior to many far larger budget games I&apos;ve played, and there is an element of humor in almost every aspect of the game that doesn&apos;t undermine the plot at all. I only wish more games understood the value of good writing.<br>The voice acting is also above average, though suffers slightly for having too few distinct voices - honestly, I&apos;d prefer that to having a larger number of distinct yet poorly acted voices.<br>The gameplay itself is mixed - melee is definitely somewhat clunky, but ranged combat plays quite well.<br>The game is very reliant on quests, but the quests are actually interesting (again, the value of good writing).<br><br>Of the technical issues so many reported, I can only say the vast majority seems to have been fixed now. The only issues I ran into was the graphics engine occasionally needed to be restarted, and once in a great while the game would crash on switching between areas (more so in FoV than ED).<br><br>Overall, whatever faults this game might have had originally, the version that exists today is quite well done minus a handful of poorly designed encounters. It remains one of the only examples of an RPG with good writing I&apos;ve seen in recent years, and that alone makes it worth buying for any RPG enthusiast in my book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-ego-draconis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1616082">Expand</a></span>

But overall being a dragon is fun and whilst the spells that you can cast are limited in effect it is still a well balanced game.</span>

The next issue is the dragon combat parts, they just take way too long because it&apos;s so simplistic, you have a very small number of abilities whereas there are a lot of turrets to take down considering you have to defeat dragons first. Enemy dragons respawn but the problem is that there is a whole bunch of them. Next is the font...the numbers which pop up when you deal damage, the numbers in your stats screen...it&apos;s horrible. Larian simply didn&apos;t have the budget/experience for this game which is a shame since they&apos;re a talented bunch. Ego Draconis is not memorable but I was happy to support Larian.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-ego-draconis/user-reviews?user_review_id=3359469">Expand</a></span>

Graphic: 9 The Graphic is dark age mostly, but there are light areas in the game, but as always in my book, graphic is the last thing on the list to a good game. I would not recommend playing this game on a 32&quot; as I do, but it works okay. Sound: 8 The sound is actually good, but some places you get tired of what I call small sound bugs. Like tumbling sounds of a keg rolling, which keeps repeating it self. It gets really annoying.  Gameplay: 8 I almost gave this one a 9, but there are just things which makes the gameplay a little heavy. Though in general I will say that the whole setting of the game, the UI and the little funnies are what makes this game worth playing. I love the little puzzles of the game and the, sometimes lame, references to books, TV and other small enjoyments of life. The mindreading part is great and really makes the game different. I also love the little videos in your skill menu where you are shown how the skill you are looking at works. And all the funny characters you meet. So if you really want a game which steals away time and feels larger than it is. Then you should go with this one. For my overall review I could give the game 9/10, but my gut tells me to give it 8. The sound bug thing is actually my biggest hates for this game and even then I would totally recommend it. My official score is 8, but for you deep RPG lovers out there, you should take it as a 9 and go buy the game. Oh and it does run fine on Win7 64bits Home Edition</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-ego-draconis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320625">Expand</a></span>
