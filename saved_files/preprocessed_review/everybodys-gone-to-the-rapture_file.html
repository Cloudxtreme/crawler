<br>-Graphics, artistic direction, music and professional voice acting, do a great job on sucking you into the world of Everybody&apos;s gone to the Rapture.
<br>-A complex, philosophical story with a narrative structure that reminds of the intelligent style of Dear Esther.
<br>-Fun doesn&apos;t end with the game, you still need to piece together the story in your mind and figure out what the heck just happened. It really makes for great debates with your friends and/or online!
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Keep in mind that, &quot;interactive books&quot;, like this game, lack any kind of gameplay except for walking from one place to another. The challenge is -solely- in piecing the story together..
<br>-Non linearity doesn&apos;t really fit, making the game a bit tedious in too many parts.
<br>-World is too big and open for so little content, wich leaves little reward for exploration and time investment (this could be solved by, for example, doubling the running/sprinting speed).
<br>-Too short to justify a 20&#x20AC; investment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture/user-reviews?user_review_id=6561330">Expand</a></span>

<br>(dynamic shadows of clouds!) The music is just marvelous, orchestral scores fit the overall vibe perfectly. I could listen to them even without the game. As I said, it will not satisfy everybody, because gameplay is minimal. The game is hardly interactive and focuses purely on an experience of the world and story as it is. It&apos;s like reading a book. And watching a book. And listening to a book. :) The same concept was used with their previous creation &apos;Dear Esther&apos; (great short story btw). It may sound paradoxically but this game is not really for playing but for exploring the world and story .

<br>
<br>The graphics, musics, voiceovers are wonderful, but the game is terribly implemented:
<br>
<br>The 3d engine is very slow; his is the absolutely slowest game I&apos;ve played in the last year (on par with Gone Home) - it will stutter even at 720p with modern, relatively highly specced hardware.
<br>
<br>The approach to controls is too &quot;puristic&quot;, and it just doesn&apos;t work.
<br>The &quot;run&quot; functionality seems to work sometimes but not most of the time.
<br>There is no jump; this is in line with the game, except that after 10 minutes of playing, I already got stuck in a place without exit.
<br>The walking dynamic is very strange; it&apos;s supposed to mimic real life (so it has a fast/slow cycle), but it is not appropriate for a videogame.
<br>
<br>To wrap up, play a &quot;demo version&quot; (cough cough...) before buying it, as youtube playthoughs will not give you an idea of how infuriating this game is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture/user-reviews?user_review_id=6352587">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is not a game.
<br>This crap do not fall in to criteria of a game and is just a false use of the media.
<br>Pretentious story telling of a mediocre and boring idea.
<br>After 20 min even 10 year old can guess what has happened and what will happen. The whole &quot;game&quot; is in one enormous map with very, VERY slow pace and boring narrations.
<br>The characters are even more uninteresting because there are no &quot;faces&quot; of the characters to care for. Another pretentious idea of this studio. This kind of &quot;faceless&quot; characters make empty world even more empty and meaningless, because after the narration is over there is NOTHING afterwards to remind you or point to what happened.
<br>Simply, empty space.
<br>This emptiness nothing can shake. Should be shaken by the story as you &quot;progress&quot; but the dialogs are sooo useless and out of tune with the whole situation that after 2-3 hours playing I was asking my self why I wasted my money and time on this? I am not Jim Sterling! I don&apos;t have to write critique for some overrated crap!
<br>
<br>After so much walking I lost interest in anything what was connecting the first part of the map with the next one. Who cares about the people in the camp when they do not have any impact on the story?! Who cares for all the characters when all happened and there is no change?!
<br>Why we go trough this when afterwards there is not even slightest notice of our presence in this world?! Not even slightest...
<br>
<br>Most of the time we play games to change something in that world or at least have impact on the character we play. In the end there is no need for payoff. It does not matter if we leave or not, but what matter is that we have some kind of interaction in the world and hopefully we made difference for good or bad. But, what we have here is just walking. Walking after everything is gone, after all has passed and after all already was. Our interaction - bloody audiologs!
<br>
<br>Developers, put this in your pocket - STOP with the **** audiologs! They are boring and stupid, especially when they are overused and nonsensical. Find some &quot;normal&quot; and logical way to tell the story or get lost. Enough already!
<br>
<br>In this, so called &quot;game&quot; you will find audiologs on most stupid things like radio, payphone, home phone or radiophone. They should be the narrative force but they are just wasted time. They don&apos;t say nothing new after the first 3 and that&apos;s it! That&apos;s the &quot;game&quot;.
<br>There is a solid 3 from me for the vistas and all the rest is pure pretentious garbage. Even the time, If I understood correctly, should represent &apos;80s but even that is mismatched and misrepresented. (Trust me, I know &apos;80s well).
<br>
<br>One thing that is so high above this misery of &quot;game&quot; is the music. Music is something that have some sense and does not feel pretentious and try to &quot;outsmart&quot; us. Most of the time worm and idyllic, enough to don&apos;t feel the pain in your wallet so much.
<br>
<br>Try to avoid this &quot;game&quot; and save your money. Amateur  pretentious writing is not worth your time. Buy yourself a book and you will have more fun than with this &quot;game&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture/user-reviews?user_review_id=6333805">Expand</a></span>

Rural Shropshire is stunning and the writing and acting are superb, but the 1 mph walking speed ruined it for me.
<br>I had not realised that you run by holding down the shift key for several seconds, it&apos;s not an instant sprint. In the end I followed the instructions at the PC Gaming Wiki and downloaded an app called Cheat Engine that let me sprint at three times speed by pressing shift. Once I did this the game became bearable.
<br>The game is more work than it should be, but the powerful ending makes up for the earlier frustrations.
<br>It&apos;s an emotional, sophisticated piece of art. Reminded me of a Radio 4 play, although sometimes it came close to The Archers. Definitely worth persevering with, but they really should fix the running speed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture/user-reviews?user_review_id=6687494">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a pretty great art piece but a piss poor game, technically it&apos;s a shocker, I had to play with the 30fps cap enabled on medium settings just to maintain a somewhat stable frame rate, 60fps was out of the question even on low settings. It is a very nice looking game, on the same level as The Vanishing of Ethan Carter which blew me away but with considerably worse performance (60fps solid in TVoEC). The video settings menu was almost completely empty with only the basics available. The audio was really great though, both the music and voice work, absolutely no complaints here. Gameplay wise, well there wasn&apos;t any, at all, you literally walk around (VERY slowly) and press X occasionally, a lot of games are falsely labelled as walking sims but this really was just that. This would have been a much better game with proper optimisation and a proper run button (there&apos;s a sad excuse for one where you hold R2 and you slowly build up speed but it&apos;s not always available and you barely move any faster).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture/user-reviews?user_review_id=7329199">Expand</a></span>

Bastardi.
<br>
<br>Passi il walk simulator, passino i controlli di merda, passi la lentezza estrema del gioco...cazzo il doppiaggio &#xE8; superbo e la storia ti prende....MA LA TRAMA...perch&#xE9; sempre TRAME DI MERDA??! Perch&#xE9;?!?!
<br>
<br>Nessuno, nessuno...ripeto: NESSUNO sembra interessarsi alla QUALITA&apos; della trama...tutti che elogiano o criticano il gioco a livello tecnico...ma cristo di un dio in croce ma vi sembra normale una trama basata sul fatto che l&apos;estinzione della razza umana la decide una cazzo di scienziata pazza in preda alle mestruazioni che sclera perch&#xE9; il marito si va a bere una birra con una ex e allora via, tutto il mondo a puttane!? Ma porco dio...ma di cosa stiamo parlando qui?? Ma questa &#xE8; gente da rinchiudere, ma chi l&apos;ha sceneggiata sta roba, la Boldrini?
<br>
<br>Se ne incontro anche uno solo di quelli della Chinese Room gli spacco i denti, giuro. C&apos;hanno la fissa della fine del mondo e del suicidio? Beh gliela giustifico.
<br>Ma che cazzo...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture/user-reviews?user_review_id=7195496">Expand</a></span>
