The only reason it doesn&apos;t get a 10 is because its a touch buggy and I HATE when games are released like that. That being said, the core of the game is outstanding. The atmosphere, gameplay, replay value, and historical accuracy are great. You can jump right in on the easy settings or rack your brain trying to get a firing solution on max difficulty. Aside from the odd bug, almost everything in this game is top notch. However, I would have personally liked to see some ships in the ports and maybe a bit of wildlife in the sea, but I&apos;m just nit-picking. If you like anything to do with war or water you need to buy this game, even if its just to sit atop your bridge and stare at the mid-blowing water effects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=380165">Expand</a></span>

<br>Otherwise you&apos;ll get bored, you&apos;ll come here and start writing reviews saying how boring this game is, etc.
<br>This is a WW2 U-boat simulator, this means that you&apos;ll spend most of the time sailing the huge empty ocean waiting for a ship or a convoy to get within your reach.  If you are fine with this, then keep reading, if you&apos;re not, then forget about the Silent Hunter saga.
<br>I&apos;m using the GWX 3.0 supermod in combination with other minor mods, and I think this is the best ww2 Uboat game ever made.
<br>You start your career as an officer of the kriegsmarine (you can start anytime between 1939 and 1944)
<br>you are given the command of one of the most advanced &quot;submarines&quot; in the world, your mission is simple: patrol your ocean sector and sink as many enemy ships as you can. Depending on the realism settings you decide to activate, you will need to use trigonometric formulas in order to calculate the target&apos;s course, angle of the bow and speed...thus enabling you to launch your torpedoes in the exact time and course to sink the target ship (just like in WW2). Only for this, SH3 should be a game to be respected. Of course you can also use some instruments and members of your crew to help you find out the &quot;torpedo solution&quot;, so don&apos;t worry, you can sink enemy ships even if you are not fond of trigonometry! SH3 has other virtues too, the graphics engine isn&apos;t bad at all (is still acceptable even for today&apos;s standards), perhaps the main issue you&apos;ll find is that the game doesn&apos;t have widescreen support (though you can use mods to make it so). I&apos;d recommend to use the GWX supermod and the SH3Commander app to play SH3, as they bring the game to a whole new level. They give SH3 a lot of the quality it lacked at first. Another virtue of SH3 is that you can upgrade your u-boat&apos;s engine,batteries,electronic systems (radar, sonar,hydrophone),torpedoes,conning tower, guns, etc.  You will receive promotions and medals and your crew members aswell. You can also change your &quot;old&quot; u-boat for a newer one (like the uboat type XXI). You can manage your crew all the time, deciding to rest or deploy them in order to get the maximum efficiency from your men. The AI in this game isn&apos;t bad, so if you&apos;re not careful you&apos;ll be sunk. By 1943 you&apos;d better be like a ghost in the ocean, otherwise you&apos;ll be sunk before you can even launch the first torpedo against a convoy. Another aspect to point out is the HUGENESS of the ocean...you&apos;ll literally spend months in the sea unless you use the time compression setting (using SH3Commander you&apos;ll be able to reach a time compression of 8192x...provided your computer can take it). Don&apos;t be surprised, the uboats used to sail at speeds around 10knots (20km/h, roughly), so yes, you&apos;ll need a lot of time compression in order to finish a patrol of several months in just some hours...the uboats were slow and the oceans are HUGE.
<br>As a result, finding a convoy in the ocean is like finding a needle in a haystack. You could spend most of your fuel reserves by looking for convoys at sea without finding anything...it may be frustrating, but it&apos;s realistic: 90% of the time spent in uboats was pure boredom, just sailing the ocean for months without any enemy contact. Some people may think this is an issue, but it&apos;s not, it&apos;s just realistic.
<br>Don&apos;t worry, in my experience, I&apos;ve never returned to port empty-handed. I&apos;ve always sunk 20000 tons of shipping at least. You only need to check the shipping routes map and deploy your uboat in a &quot;hot spot&quot; like northern Ireland... there you&apos;ll find some ship sooner or later. Still, the game has some issues. For instance, you can&apos;t save your game while you have another ship WITHIN YOUR SIGHT...If you do so, your savegame will crash to desktop the next time you try to load it. There&apos;s another issue concerning the change of weather conditions (they don&apos;t seem to change), you can solve this by applying some mod or editing some game files, but still, this shouldn&apos;t be happening.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I think SH3 is the best and most complete WW2 uboat game ever. Using GWX, SH3Commander and other mods you&apos;ll greatly increase its quality.
<br>
<br>Enjoy the hunt!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2713731">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I launched the career and started in Kiel. First assignment was to get to some area in North Sea. Alright, so I leave the doc filled with people waving us goodbye. Bye bye!
<br>After some time sailing out the harbour, then toward the Nord-Ostsee canal, I I tried to increase the time compression. Not that I don&apos;t appreciate the landscapes, but I was eager to get into the real thing. Unfortunately, It wouldn&apos;t let me get above 4. I suspect because I was close to the shore. At one point, we passed another ship, for which time I could get to 32x. Once it was too far, back to 4x (not really logical, but well...).
<br>
<br>So I don&apos;t know how long it took in real time to cross the canal, but at least it was a game which let me practice my guitar.
<br>After about 30 minutes, and 1/3 way in the canal, i had other things to do, so I saved and quit.
<br>
<br>I should have known better. Next time, trying to load my save... Loading screen.. and crash.
<br>Damned. Try again, same thing.
<br>30 minutes sailing gone to waste.
<br>Ok, I try to load the start save in the harbour... Same crash.
<br>Try to start the career over ? Same. Delete it and create a new one ? Just crash.
<br>
<br>Sailing the forums for solutions, at least one thing appeared, crashes are a quite common thing with this game. Especially, I read you mustn&apos;t save while a boat is in sight, or the game will crash on next load.
<br>Wha-- ??
<br>Wait a minute, you can&apos;t save if there&apos;s a boat in sight ? In a friggin submarine game ? No wonder it wouldn&apos;t load my harbour save! How could Ubisoft quality control let this kind of problem out?? If I was playing a game about guiding camels in the desert, I could be ok with a such a rare circumstance. But this is a naval battle game goddamnit.
<br>
<br>1 because the few I saw of the game was interesting. Still, it was 6 wasted dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4166163">Expand</a></span>

The aces of the deep are still a great memory in gameplay. The first attempt of Silent Hunter to go for the Atlantic scene with the U-boots was not a full success. This issue has been corrected. So, I have to cut my reply short, I have to some work to do on the high seas.</span>

The enemy AI, crew you can see, station tools,dynamic campaign and level of realism is superior to any sub sim I&apos;ve seen. I usually only play flight sims, but this things got me hooked.

With the mission editor itself its a sub-sim modders wet-dream (pun intended) :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=380148">Expand</a></span>

This Game might turn away a few people that are used to all out action all the time, but if your willing to put yourself into this game and spend hours that are needed hunting enemy subs and use tactical manuvers then you will agree that this might be the best looking sim out there to date. Graphically the Sky and ocean look like your looking at a movie. If you play this game and find that getting to your patrol point takes too long you have the option of time compression but that would spoil the point of this whole sim. Traveling to the destionation and engaging the will take hours ...just like in real life. There are a few surprises that really add to the realism such as when you go to outside views. zooming in and out will not let you go through objects like most other games ... So the collision detection even in view mode is set correctly. The interior of the ship is done nicely showing all gages and areas of the ship but not as photorealistic as the envirement outside. The next installment of SILENT hUNTER Should address this one area...but With everything this Sim has going for it It is a must buy for any fan of this genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=391228">Expand</a></span>

The variable difficulty levels make it a pure joy for sim or action fans alike. The only problem I&apos;ve had are a few graphical glitches and control hang-ups, but nothing major. The latest patch fixes these minor flaws anyway.</span>

You play on the side of the Germans which may not float your boat, but i def recommend this game to any sub gaming cravings.</span>

                                        <span>Silent Hunter 3 is one of the best sub simulators out there. For a game made in 2005? It does an amazing job at everything. The game is really easy to play and if you say that the game can&apos;t run? Well don&apos;t put the installation in Program Files(x86) Put it in your C: Drive instead. Overall I have no complaints about this game. Better than any sub Sim right now!</span>
