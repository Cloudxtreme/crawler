<br>
<br>The story is decent, if a little disconnected. Lara is searching for an artifact that killed her mother years ago. A great excuse to send Lara to a variety of diverse locations, from a sleepy South American town to the frozen mountains of Nepal. Zip and Alistair provide some snarky commentary as she proceeds through the levels &#x2013; some of it almost breaking the fourth wall. It helps keep the proceedings light-hearted and fun, even if what is happening is quite serious. Lara herself is keen, quick-witted, whip-smart, and always ready with a snappy come-back. TR: Legend was actress Keeley Hawes first time voicing Lara, and she does an absolutely fantastic job.
<br>
<br>The platforming is well-executed and slick, with timed movements (move quickly before the platforms collapse) and required momentum (remember to HOLD the spacebar to jump in some places, or Lara won&apos;t jump far enough). Gun-play just feels odd; lock on to a target, use the arrow or WASD keys to switch the lockon from target to target. While doing this, Lara can run, jump and dodge. There is a free-aim mode, but once engaged Lara cannot move at all, so the lockon mode will be the one used most often. I rebound the keys to what I wanted, so there is that. There are no waypoints; not really an issue in a game this linear. The climbing puzzles are generally well done; remember to use Lara&apos;s binoculars first to scan an area for hints before trying to solve a puzzle. Some bosses can only be defeated with the help of the environment, so if a boss seems like it is taking no damage, start looking around for switches and levers (and things to grapple). Nothing is handed to you in this game, though once you figure out a puzzle or boss, it will be solved or defeated in a matter of seconds.
<br>
<br>Now for the issues, and there are more of them than there should be. Lock-on would sometimes result in strange camera movements, and the camera doesn&apos;t immediately auto-rotate to the forward direction when riding a motorbike. The platforming direction controls aren&apos;t always intuitive. A similar issue plagues the QTEs; the onscreen arrows don&apos;t always indicate the correct direction, resulting in multiple fails until finding the right button-press. Disable Next Generation Content in the graphics settings; TR: Legend looks better with it, but this will eliminate nearly all crashes. And there is the near-game-breaking bug in the Nepal temple level. A cutscene, then Lara needs to run to a door, hit it (I won&apos;t say with what, because spoilers), the door will open, triggering another cutscene and a platforming section. But hitting the door doesn&apos;t always make it open, meaning progression through the game is blocked. Just keep re-loading a save until the game works the way it is supposed to (it took me seven tries the last time I played it). Ridiculous, but there it is.
<br>
<br>The saving grace through all of this Lara Croft herself. Unlike more recent versions of Lara, this one has no lack of confidence. You never hear Lara telling herself, &#x201C;I can do this.&#x201D; She already knows she can, and can worry about other things. I still highly recommend Tomb Raider: Legend despite the game&apos;s issues, because there is nothing truly game breaking, and this remains one of my favorite &#x201C;older&#x201D; versions of Lara. If story-driven platforming and puzzling is your preference, or you just want more Lara Croft, absolutely get this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-legend/user-reviews?user_review_id=6513897">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll be blunt: Legend was the absolute worst, by far.  The puzzles were easy, combat was a joke, and the boss fights were a chore.  If anyone else is considering playing these titles, do yourself a favor and skip Legend.  Anniversary is an excellent remake the original, and Underworld gives you the final installment of these set of games.  And don&apos;t worry about missing the plot from Legend.  Underworld brings you up to speed with a short video, or you can read the wiki, which would only be about 10x as fun as actually playing this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-legend/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874806">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This means on PC, a game pad, or another stilted movement system where there is a &quot;placing&quot; sort of thing needed, not as bad, but still like the last game.  Certainly not as free-flowing as Prince Of Persia, for example.
<br>
<br>Nice only graphics and only good sound, but a brilliant opening theme tune and game intro. Reminded me of those 80&apos;s cop&apos;s shows like Starsky and Hutch, striking music and fast animations in silhouette and action movements.
<br>
<br>So better than the last game, but by not as much as I would have liked. This because of lazy console conversion - again! And by extension a crazy keyboard layout (H to fire gun?) Graphics not as good as they could be, now that we have seen Half Life 2 (which is 2 years old! Reminded me of the Freelancer graphics, if you&apos;ve played that game) but they are good enough to do the job.
<br>
<br>Also have a feeling there will be bugs. When you cannot read the text box leading into a mission because the level loads too quickly and the box disappears before you can read all the text you know it hasn&apos;t been play-tested that well.
<br>
<br>So I give it a 7. Getting better, but still not the Tomb Raider games we knew and loved 10 years ago, which after all, is what Crystal Dynamics promised us.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-legend/user-reviews?user_review_id=58228">Expand</a></span>

As with the previous reviews, the game seems too easy and too short, making the game seem like an interactive movie rather than a full-fledged adventure game. In some cases, in order to die, a player has to force him or herself to. The enemy AI in the game is rather weaktight and not very strategic, and the animals are surprisingly harder to kill than the humans. While the game has improved on Lara&apos;s ability (ability to jump from ledge to ledge while hanging, various martial arts stunts), it has also decreased it from the last editions (Lara holds her breath for approximately 30 seconds instead of 60, she can no longer sprint). The graphics are appealing, but nowhere near as advanced as they can possibly be (case in point, Halflife 2) without pushing the computer beyond its structural limitations via next-gen mode. The game also follows a linear plot, resulting in an unwanted &quot;To be continued&quot; ending, unlike the previous games which each had their own storyline. (A Tomb Raider Legend II would cause a lot of problems in the system) However, the positive issues about the game that save it from a flop is the intriguing storyline itself, and how it connects Lara&apos;s past to her present. The architecture in the levels are superb and show that a lot of effort has gone into the design of these levels. The movements of Lara are fluid, and her emotions and reactions are penultimately realistic than they were in the previous Core Design series. If Crystal Dynamics intends to make a sequel, a skill-building system should be placed in to make the game even more realistic and appealing to the public. In short, the game is hopefully a foreshadowing of the next improvement in the Tomb Raider product line.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-legend/user-reviews?user_review_id=388965">Expand</a></span>

A nice game which, technically, isn&apos;t that good. Tomb Raider has always been a long game, and this one is really short. Tomb Raider has always got great performance and graphics, while the performance on this one sucks very much. The gameplay is fine, but not as good as old as the one of the old Tomb Raider (P.S.: I miss the very big jumps). The plot is very good. Also, the bad point is that you can carry on only 2 weapons. That&apos;s really sad, if you think that, in TR3, you could bring on really many weapons (such as pistols, uzis, assault riffles, shotguns, desert eagles, flares, water gun, etc.). Graphics and performance: 4; Longevity: 3; Gameplay: 6; Plot: 6+ (6.25). OVERALL SCORE: 5- [4.81] (4.75 out of 10 [Mediocre]).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-legend/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874081">Expand</a></span>

Can&apos;t tell you if the plot is any good.  I got sick of fighting the damned game  controls and bashed the uninstall button, which is the only thing that worked good.  Lara&apos;s got a nice rack, great legs and a fine ass, though.</span>

One BIG downside to this game is that it is very short, this I suspect is because heavy detail has been included but the levels really should be extended. Eidos are defenantly planing to bring out a second game because the plot ends on a clif hanger were many gamers (including myself) were expecting the rest of the game but it only reveals the credits and a lot of dissapointment. Even though this is a must have game and the added insentive is that lara&apos;s breasts bounce all over the place. the &quot;Next generation content&quot; is really good but its too slow for me and i have a 6600GT but it still looks great without.

I especially loved the improved feel of the controls (the most infuriating problem with all previous TR games), no more slow-turning Lara, or having her unexpectedly change direction when you make a jump, JUST because you didn&apos;t approach the edge at a perpendicular angle... The whole &quot;cubic&quot; feeling of the game has been removed, and now the levels are starting to feel a lot more real. The graphics are incredible, and the levels are well-designed. The addition of Zip and Alister was a great idea, as the dialogue between them and Lara, lets them know exactly what&apos;s going on in the lead character&apos;s minds, as well as profiding a few laughs. The developing storyline (also done much better in this game than in any predecessor, except perhaps the original), is what I feel truly makes this game a &quot;must buy&quot;. If you want a shoot-em-up, buy Battlefield 2, but when you want to be pulled into an exciting and intruiging world, you&apos;re thankful that there are games like this out there... My only problem with this game is the up-in-the-air ending. Crystal Dynamics, PLEEEEASE give us an ending to this game, don&apos;t just leave us hanging! It&apos;s inhuman torture!

I&apos;m playing on PC with a mouse and keyboard, and the control feels natural, which it didn&apos;t with the old games. Finding it very enjoyable, although i&apos;m afraid it might be a little short.</span>

Need more games that are actually fun like this for PC, instead of all the war simulation and fanstasy strategy games for geeks that make up 90% of PC game releases. would be better though if the tomb raider franchise wasnt ruined by that whore Angelina Jolie.</span>

The graphics were mind-blowing for it&apos;s time, being one the the first next-gen titles. For the first time in the franchise, the control are GOOD. The game is a joy to play. The sound is top-notch, the voice-acting is pretty good, the story is surprinsly good too. It&apos;s not just  find this 500 years lost artefact. No. It&apos;s a personal story, and it shows, making Lara more human than she&apos;s ever been.
<br>
<br>The control are good, the puzzles are decent, mostly on the easy side. There is no tough nut crack  to here, unfortunately. The level design is just ok, as it doesn&apos;t reach the hights of its predecessor or its successors for that manner.
<br>
<br>Good: 1) CONTROLS. Yes! They did a marvelous jos here.
<br>2) Graphics, for the most part.
<br>3) Sound. Energic, for the most part.
<br>4) This may be a first for the Tomb Raider series, but the story is actually good this time around.
<br>5) Utilising Pixel Shader 1.1 to 2.0, or none at all, the game is VERY good optimised. No slow-downs, no crashes, no cracking sound.
<br>6) Doing 100% takes somewhere from 10 to 15 hours. Bad:
<br>1) The story itself lasts around 7 to 8.5 hours.
<br>2) Some might find the level design unispired and the difficulty too low, even on Hard. For a Tomb Raider game, it&apos;s a very easy one, on both fronts.
<br>3) With the next-generation features enabled on PC, Lara looks weird and unnatural sometimes. Also, some effects like her wet clothes are nowhere to be found with the next-gen features enabled)
<br>4) The is too much sound  There should be a sense of solitude, but the music is pumping always.
<br>5) The PC version recieved the short stick, compared to the Xbox360 version. Without Next-Gen-Feature enabled, the PC version is heads-above the PS2/Xbox version, utilising Pixel-Shader 2 effects to a great effect. With the Next-Gen-Features enabled, the PC version looks mostly identical to the Xbox360 version. But we have poorer lighting, a shocking lack of vegetation compared to the 360 and some effects missings, like the dripping of water from her wet clothes. Also, some levels of the game (Kazahstan and Nepal) are unplayable with NGF activated. The game just crashed, even patched up to the latest version.
<br>
<br>All in all, this games easily deservers and 8.3. If not for the technical issues, maybe an 8.7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-legend/user-reviews?user_review_id=3037664">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Legend was a fun game, but it was nearly ruined by some of the gameplay mechanics that I found just terrible. This was on PC, and I&apos;m sure the porting process is at fault for much of that.
<br>
<br>The storyline wasn&apos;t bad, but at the end I couldn&apos;t have helped thinking that wouldn&apos;t the main antagonist have at some point said something to Lora to explain what was going on, rather than just fight her the whole time?
<br>
<br>The puzzles were fun but simple, everything was very linear, which isn&apos;t always terrible but it started to feel too structured and gets a bit stale.
<br>
<br>It really consisted mostly of some combination of platform&gt;combat&gt;puzzle&gt;boss battle, where combat was usually easy, puzzles were quite simple, and boss battles were tedious and painful. A couple boss battles were actually fairly simple and quick once you found the trick, a couple others were miserable. Combine that with two human bosses having three lines that they repeated every few seconds, it was no fun at all, just an obstacle to enjoying the game.
<br>
<br>One boss battle (in England) was exceptionally difficult, clumsy and poorly designed. Between having been started with a reduced amount of rifle ammo, having very little time to switch from shooting to grappling to pulling, having to dodge every second, and having actions sometimes not occur on the first press of the key, I just couldn&apos;t do everything fast enough to survive. After an hour of miserable frustration, I discovered that I couldn&apos;t even complete it due to a glitch that made one of the four items that I had to utilize not even work, imagine my frustration at finally surviving that long only to get stuck there anyway! I had to download a savegame to continue at the next mission. Apparently some others have suffered this glitch, while most who managed to struggle through that battle did not.
<br>
<br>Shooting was one of the worst problems in my opinion. The auto aim had no idea what was going on and randomly aimed at different things. An enemy would be shooting me and Lora would be pointing at some interactive item or another enemy. At one point I&apos;m surrounded and auto aim has me shooting up at the ceiling! Manual aim with a first person view was mostly useless because you could not move. Being unable to manually aim and move at the same time was extremely frustrating, and pretty much ruined the game for me. Auto aim is nice when driving or handling a couple enemies, but trying to fight a large group was nearly impossible, there was no way of strategically engaging targets and utilizing cover. When you tried to shoot from behind cover, your gunfire struck whatever was next to you even though your view showed a clear shot, you had to be pretty much out from behind cover to shoot. Grenades were also thrown a few steps in front of you without the ability to aim, so throwing grenades out from behind cover was impossible.
<br>
<br>The actual platforming, exploring, puzzle solving, and trap avoiding parts were fun, easily played, and quite enjoyable. If the game had totally eliminated combat and had just continuous exploration, I would have enjoyed it more, even though it would have made the game a little less interesting. If they had replaced combat with more and better puzzles, or made combat good instead of terrible, it would have been a much better game.
<br>
<br>The graphics were fair for 2006, they looked a little better with next gen graphics enabled, but there were so many glitches and game crashes with next gen graphics, that about 3/4 through I had to switch them off. The music was ok, in some parts it helped make the atmosphere very well, in others it was entirely forgettable. Lora looked good and her movements were pretty fluid and intuitive, but the camera often game me very useless views and moved around very quickly and jerky, if you were in a confined space the camera was a problem.
<br>
<br>Overall, I enjoyed the game, but I definitely wouldn&apos;t play it again. It wasn&apos;t interesting enough, and the miserable combat is a chore rather than an enjoyable challenge. It is interesting to see how Crystal Dynamics progressed from something so rough, to something that is much more refined in the 2013 game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-legend/user-reviews?user_review_id=3905061">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I run it with a PC game controller Saitek P2600 and it recognizes so then you can adjust your buttons in game. I am playing in Hard difficulty, the game would be easier with more buttons on the controller but I am working through it just fine.  Similar game-play to Prince of Persia (trilogy) but with guns and some more advanced climbing/jumping tactics.
<br>
<br>I give it a decent score because it supports PC game controllers, Next Gen Content and its fun so far. The graphics are great. The game was released in an era where shotty ports were really bad.
<br>
<br>This one was a better one of that time (visual options inside + outside of game). LEGENDS is single core only usage but the sequel UNDERWORLD uses more than 1 core (but 1 core seems to be in  more usage than other cores although probably just dual core optimized which makes the difference between the LEGENDS and UNDERWORLD).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-legend/user-reviews?user_review_id=3962685">Expand</a></span>

Enjoyed the personal Lara&apos;s quest driven story, but the sequel baiting in the finale was kinda unnecessery and out of place. Tombs themselves were awesome with excellent design and with well executed eerie atmosphere. Combat on mouse+kboard worked fine enough, but it was much better back on PS2 version, overall if you can i would reccomend the PS2 version, even over PS3/360, cuz next gen graphics take away lot of atmosphere and Lara imo looks wrong copmpared to last gen version of her.
