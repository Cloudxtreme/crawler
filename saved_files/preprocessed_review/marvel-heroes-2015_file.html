I supported and threw alot of money in the game, so they could make it as good as it has the potential to be.. Like all game the faced different bugs, with no major issues, but around 6 months after release Memeroy leak started to wreck even the best gamer computers at that time.. And now 1.5 years after memory leak started, they are still &quot;working on it&quot; and &quot;appreciate&quot; our patience.. they have no help to offer you what so ever other than they are thankfull.. You have to be a computer geniuss to fix files, to make it better temporarly until next patch.. their strategy only seems to invovle releasing new playable heroes and zones (with alot issues in em, especially on top of memory leak), to make money &quot;to fix the problems&quot;.. But the last thing they &quot;fixed&quot; and spent alot of money on was servers which only was located in US, wich did nothing for people from other parts of the world.. The developers and technicians are all under education, have no idea what they are doing (with fixing the game) or are just simply laughing at their customers, keep making them buying new stuff, even tho the game stills havent been fixed for 1.5 year!

I never played at the initial release. Since joining i have to say whilst the Devs have done a great job communicating and acting on feedback, Marvel Heroes is bogged down by what is it&apos;s biggest strength but also weakness. They have a weekly publish cycle and try to cram too much in resulting in bugs that shouldn&apos;t be there (and wind up staying even after claims they&apos;ve been fixed at times). Additionally, new content gets added that is simply not finished or fully implemented (Team Ups and their gear as an example), new heroes are added to the game but end up needing to be polished in the live environment after feedback offered regarding them on the Test Server is often ignored.
<br>
<br>Recently the game has been balanced around a level 52 review baseline yet there are several heroes not at that baseline because they are yet to be reviewed and therefore perform poorly alongside their updated brethren. Outside of almost weekly events where loot and drop rates are tuned (server side) since joining i&apos;ve found the game gradually become less rewarding for the time i put in&gt; The awesome loot explosions that were there early on are a fleeting memory unless there one of the previously mentioned events on. The new Omega system is to me a disappointing system that forces one to spend hard earned points in choices they have no need or interest in to get to the good bits and several of the categories of the Omega system are not yet available due to either not being ready or being gated behind events to come.
<br>
<br>However the game does have a (mostly) friendly and healthy community willing to help new comers, combat is quite enjoyable and for the most part is soloable for me even with my latency from playing from Australia. The store has a good offering of content to buy if you want to take that route,and about the only things you CAN&apos;T get without spending a cent  are stash space (very limited) and select costumes (which are purely cosmetic skins for certain heroes.
<br>
<br>If you had asked me to write this review a month ago it&apos;d probably have given the game an 8, but the direction it seems to be moving in is slowly sapping the fun of the game away for me. The game is good fun and definitely worth a look. But make sure you take a good hard look outside of loot (and drop rate) buffed events so you see the whole picture. Definitely also recommend making use of the forums as there is a lot of good info that will help.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4251791">Expand</a></span>

<br>Review:
<br>I was invited to the open beta for this game, played for a couple weeks, and left. Was very disappointed in the initial experience. Especially my personally favorite hero, Hulk.
<br>
<br>Then I came back about 3 months ago, and what a completely different experience. Between the new game modes (midtown Manhattan, X Defense), additional difficulty levels, variety of gameplay among the heroes, the 52 Reviews of existing heroes, it is a completely different experience. Not to mention the events that Gaz has! Between buffed loot drops, buy-one-get-one on costumes/heroes, etc, almost every week has something going on.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t emphasize how varied the heroes gameplay is. As soon as I get one to cap, I look forward to leveling another one.
<br>
<br>Another huge difference they have now from launch is how easy it is to get heroes. Costumes and heroes were very overpriced (in my opinion) at launch. Now, they are much cheaper, and you can grind an in game currency to purchase them as well.
<br>
<br>The only reason this is a 9 and not a 10: needs a bit more client optimization, and there&apos;s definitely some lag that occurs whenever too many heroes are on screen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4250809">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>that sums up what this whole experience is.
<br>
<br>Lots of bugs are still in the game that are reported but gets ignored. Even the Wizard doesn&apos;t have an icon in the minimap and its been a year already, that just shows how lazy the devs are, always trying to implement &quot;new&quot; stuff and completely forgetting the broken things left.
<br>
<br>On the optimization side, your PC might be able to run Watch Dogs on the max settings without hiccups but it will still crawl when this game is played. PC People should stop with the &quot;But can it run Crysis?&quot; jokes when getting new hardware and instead say &quot;But can it run Marvel Heroes?&quot; since there is still no hardware powerful enough to play this game without lags.
<br>
<br>On the community side, there are some annoying fanboys that attack anyone that has an opinion. Think the prices are too high?  Think one-hit kill attacks are bad? Better not post on the forum since its filled with obnoxious nerds that have a very dry sense of humor when replying to any opinions or queries. They act like Deadpool on the replies but most of the sarcastic replies made are so unfunny that its borderline pathetic. But don&apos;t get me wrong, its not all bad, there are still dozens on actual good members... too bad there are hundreds of jerks.
<br>
<br>Iron Man Heartbreaker costume exploit, an exploit where someone can get hundreds of costumes are craft them to new ones. Devs did nothing. On the recent cake event, an exploit was found and some people are getting tons of Uniques from it, what does the devs do? Shut down the event, punishing everyone but the exploiters.
<br>
<br>&quot;Doomsaw&quot;, the lead developer was asked in-game on why Spiderman is weak (a valid question since Spiderman has low damage output and keeps dieing during that period). His reply to a kid was &quot;your&apos;e just playing the game wrong&quot;.  Hulk bug was found where players can kill bosses in seconds, instead of fixing it, the devs just disabled/removed the power altogether. On the damage review they did a few months ago, they just upped the damage/defense of everything and called it a day. And the biggest failure is the Level 52 Review, every hero was so crap during the launch that they had been forced to &quot;update/review&quot; each hero just to make the hero decent, its like they purposely try to give crap on the beginning and constantly make it decent so they can say its &quot;new content&quot;.
<br>
<br>And 5/10/15/20 bucks for a single costume. Don&apos;t get me wrong but  a few costumes are worth it but most have various flaws. They are charging premium price for an unfinished product, and any posts pointing out the flaws in the costumes are deleted by the devs. and locking costumes in the &quot;fortune cards&quot;, each fortune card only costs one dollar but even opening thousands of cards cant get you the locked costume you have, they did make ammends though... want to get a certain costume? then pony up 95$ bucks for it. and its not just costumes, they are now experimenting on locking up team-ups on this 1 dollar slot machines and see if the community will accept being gouged on money for &quot;exclusive&quot; content.  If that aint greed then I don&apos;t know what is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4296159">Expand</a></span>

If you do play for more than a few hours if you can bare it be prepared too spend cash on things like bank storage and too play through the same content over and over again, don&apos;t expect bugs or hero imbalances too be fixed or repaired any time soon getting the new content and heroes in too the cash shop is more important too Gazillion that and deleting any forum post on site they can find that tells people just how bad this game actually is and are not one of the sycophantic basement dwellers who have spent hundreds of hours on this game with the social skill and graces of a dead dog on a termite mound.

The regular, steady addition of content doesn&apos;t hurt either.
<br>
<br>The game is not perfect, of course. Optimization remains muddled, as well as some ugly leftovers on the UI from the beginning of the game&apos;s development. However, this is a titanic undertaking for a new studio, and Gaz is doing quite well given their circumstances.

<br>The game definitely improved by miles from launch a year ago, but it does still have some annoying flaws.
<br>
<br>It had the worst F2P system of any ARPG at launch, and the system got slightly better but still definitely the worst ARPG F2P system.
<br>
<br>You pick 1 free hero from a starter lineup of around 10-11 heroes. Only after you beat the normal mode story by level 25 will you get enough &quot;Eternity Splinters&quot; to get a 2nd free hero. But you have a limited selection of only the 200 splinter heroes or pick the random hero box. The random box can contain any hero including a duplicate of one you currently own.
<br>
<br>You gain 1 eternity splinter for every 8 minutes of gameplay. It will take 23 hours of gameplay ( Actual gameplay of killing things not sitting in a hub afk ) but add in time spent afk in a hub or taking a bathroom break, you&apos;re looking at close to 30 hours before you will get another cheap hero or random box.  Some heroes cost up to 600 splinters, so if you like spiderman and want to save up for him, you&apos;re looking at a 150 hour gameplay investment before you will be able to grab him using the F2P system in the game.
<br>
<br>Stash space is very limited and must be purchased using cash. You cannot earn more then 1 general tab stash space without spending money period. The only exception to this is the current event this month that will give you a free stash tab, but you can only obtain it this week. Inventory is shared between all heroes which makes using different characters for &quot;muleing&quot; impossible.
<br>
<br>Majority of your experience obtained in this game is via &quot;orbs&quot; that will drop from kills and quest completions. You must run over and pick up the orbs to gain the experience for your character. This quickly gets repititive and annoying. It also encourages mindless running around during combat to make sure you don&apos;t miss any. And if the orbs came from any non boss monster, the xp they give will start to get lower and lower the longer they sit on the ground ( The graphic will shrink ) which just makes the problem worse. Why they have a system like that is beyond me. This gets worse later when Odin marks and Omega points also drop as orbs and items on the ground which need to be picked up.
<br>
<br>Leveling speed without boosts feels fine, 1 to 60 ( max level ) will take you a month if played very casually, otherwise roughly 2 weeks.
<br>
<br>The Green / Red terminals while leveling are nice and feel fine. Cosmic terminals which are 60 only, definitely have a large difficulty jump but they do reward you well for doing them. Raids are pretty much for organized groups only. Pugging them in the current state is borderline impossible.
<br>
<br>Overall the game isn&apos;t bad and it is fun. If you&apos;re willing to drop some money on the game you will definitely have a much better time then if you go the strict f2p route.
<br>
<br>For F2P players: If you don&apos;t mind playing a single hero or two heroes for a VERY long time with the current starter lineup, then you will enjoy the game. It has alot of content now then it used to have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4252216">Expand</a></span>

<br>The biggest draw is the dev team though. I&apos;ve never experienced a more dedicated and hands on group of people in any MMO I&apos;ve ever played. They engage the community, they listen to the community, and hell, sometimes they PLAY with the community. It isn&apos;t uncommon to see some of them watching streams on Twitch either. These guys live and breathe Marvel Heroes, and it shines through every single day.
<br>
<br>With the addition of the Omega System (an alternate advancement system), new heroes every month, and the newly added Raids, there is no other game or company doing what these guys are doing.
<br>
<br>If you played it before and didn&apos;t like it (like me, and many others) do yourself a favor and reinstall this game.

The game is incredibly enjoyable and addictive to a degree I haven&apos;t seen since Diablo 2, and the company listens to its community like no other company I&apos;ve ever seen.  They have made numerous changes/upgrades to the game based on community feedback and will ask for input regularly which is very smart and very refreshing.  I will also mention that they&apos;ve done a nice job of making almost everything attainable without spending any money ( if you put in the time to save up the in-game currency) and they give away an amazing amount of freebies.  Overall a terrific game and terrific user experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4253496">Expand</a></span>

The short of it is Marvel Heroes 2015 is the new &apos;season&apos; of Marvel Heroes, which launched as a catastrophe of a game and somehow, against all odds, did a COMPLETE 180 turn into one of the most amazing MMOs, and hands down the most successful MMOARPG, in a long time. Tons of characters to choose from, tons of modes, absolutely beautiful and intense graphics and battles, new features and constant updates, and the most interactive and transparent dev team I&apos;ve ever known. Hands down, also one of the best, if not the best, F2P styles ever, with all but Storage space earnable in-game (and even in this, you are still given 3 stash tabs, Team-up inventory and your own inventory for free!).
<br>
<br>I honestly don&apos;t know how Gazillion does it. They&apos;ve hired some real gems to run this game and it shows. It makes sense that one of the best game development teams out there could make one of the best games. 3,000 hours and counting.

It has the gameplay of an ARPG, but the quests and longer term progression that is more like an MMO. The result is something that&apos;s fun to actually play, can be played in small blocks of time, but at the same time has that long term advancement that makes MMOs so addictive. There&apos;s a good variety of gameplay from solo questing, group events, open world fighting, PVP, and now raids. The background is well done and the characters are diverse and interesting. The devs are also highly involved and enthusiastic. Sometimes you see devs and wonder if they&apos;ve ever played the game. These guys &quot;get it.&quot;
<br>
<br>It also has that impossible to define fun factor. I look forward to playing and there always seems to be something to do. In the last year, there have been three games (FFXIV, D3, MH) that have turned themselves around 180 and gone from poor or mediocre to good or great. Of them, MH is almost certainly the best.
<br>
<br>This is a free to play game with a cash shop, but spending money is almost entirely optional. The big pay items are heroes, costumes, and storage. The only real &quot;gameplay&quot; element that most people will want to spend money on is storage. Costumes are very rare drops, but completely cosmetic. Heroes come at a very regular pace. By the time you&apos;ve leveled one to 60, you will almost certainly have enough shards to buy another.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4252254">Expand</a></span>

The Developers not only read the forums and their private messages, but they also respond to ideas/critiques/issues/pm&apos;s.  Far and away the best development team in any game I&apos;ve ever played.

<br>Here&apos;s to another year of Marvel Heroes.</span>

But as the time went and fans stuck with it and the devs showed love it showed it&apos;s diamond in the rough. After a few months of changes and addition i could tell this game would be special. It deserves it&apos;s time in the lime light. Perfect blend of ARPG game play, MMO atmosphere, and amazing Universe in Marvel. If you are a Marvel fan this is a MUST play. If you are an ARPG fan this is a MUST play, if you are just a video game fan through and through.. THIS... IS..... A..... MUST..... PLAY.
<br>
<br>Come join us for another year of awesomeness. Watch as the game grows to new heights, and watch the Devs do what they do best. You will be blown away by the way Gazillion games works with there fan base it is amazing,
<br>
<br>I love this game and don&apos;t regret a single penny i have spent on it. Now back to getting to my 1000 hour mark.

THIS, however, is the game we&apos;ve all been wanting.  As Marvel Heroes celebrates its 1 year anniversary, it renamed itself &quot;Marvel Heroes 2015&quot; and... IT.  IS.  AWESOME!  This game is everything Diablo 3 should have been with the added bonus of being Marvel Universe characters.  Hulk, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Captain America, the Fantastic Four (Mr. Fantastic has not yet been released, but he is coming soon), numerous X-Men (Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, just to name a few) and a whole host of others mean that you will, undoubtedly, find someone you love to play.  Each hero acts as its own unique &quot;class&quot;, and truly, no two heroes play exactly the same.  Sure there are archetypes - your &quot;ranged nuker&quot; or &quot;melee bruiser&quot; and so forth, but even within these archetypes, characters don&apos;t feel the same.  Thing does not play like Colossus, even though they are both heavy hitters, for example.
<br>
<br>The most impressive thing about this game, however, is the development community.  The devs for this game are more active and hands-on with the community than any developers for a game I have ever seen in my life.  It&apos;s not uncommon for a dev to give you a personal response on the official forums.  They constantly tease us with upcoming releases and sneak-peaks.  They respond to our ideas and thoughts.  And they play the game themselves, which means they actually care.
<br>
<br>New content, in some way or form, is released nearly every week.  Either a new character, a new feature, a new costume, or something else entirely.  Additionally, the devs put on near constant special events.  Either zone buffs, or boss (and loot) buffs, daily login gifts, etc.  I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve had a weekend without an event going on since like February.  It&apos;s glorious.
<br>
<br>Marvel Heroes got off to a rocky start one year ago, but everything has changed, and this game is amazing now.  Absolutely worth playing.  Oh, and the whole &quot;free-to-play&quot; thing...don&apos;t be concerned.  It&apos;s not one of those &quot;free-to-play but...&quot; games which blocks you with a pay-wall every 30 seconds.  You can unlock every single hero in the game by just playing the game.  The only thing you really &quot;need&quot; to spend money on is storage space if you happen to be a dirty gear hoarder like I am.  Otherwise, you can achieve everything you want without spending a dime (although personally, I think once you realize how great this game is, you&apos;ll want to reward Gazillion...I sure felt that way!)
<br>
<br>Go play Marvel Heroes 2015 right now!  You will not regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4251227">Expand</a></span>

So much to do that it is almost impossible to become bored.  Even if you hated Marvel Heroes at release, you risk nothing to try it again.  You won;t be disappointed, especially if you have been wasting your gaming time on D3.</span>

All the heroes had been nerfed to the point that a lot of them are nearly unplayable. The very good omega points system has been eliminated in favour of the dumbed and boring infinity system (they should have call it infinity boring grinding). Unique items have been eliminated, and there were a lot of other changes or removals of things that were good and worked fairly well. And if that wasn&apos;t bad enough, on the top of that, no new game content has been added at all.

<br>Not that hellgate was bad but brevik and his team they dont know how to make quality.They have some good ideas but they cant translate them and create a quality game.
<br>If blizzard was not behind diablo 1 and 2 these games would have been a total dissaster.
<br>And i realised it now after the many attempts of the so called diablo creator David brevik.
<br>If he is so damn awesome why he cant create a good game with his team and why he tries to scam people and get money with tricky ways.
<br>Because as jay wilson said 3 years ago F....ck dat LOOSER.
<br>Brevik and his team are a bunch of loosers that want to eat your money and serve you sh...t
<br>It&apos;s a sorry game and you will feel very sorry you tried it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5836070">Expand</a></span>

I have dedicated 3000+ hours on the steam client and over 500 hour on the stand alone client. Total hard earned money spent on the game was $1530.00. Recently my account got banned, I was issued no warning or a set reason to why it was that i was banned. I was a paying customer there and then and normally your customer service should be in tip top shape when it comes to consumers spending money. I have had major problems with the game the way the devs riggs the game around  making it a free game but some how or some way costumes seem to be a tad bit over priced. I have been supportive of the game cause again am a marvel fan but they way they go about handling the game is by far one of my worst experience playing a game. The way they handle the forums banning or issuing warnings cause you disagree with another member of the community is I would call it childish. Every game has its critics and every game has its fan boys. I am definitely a fan boy of marvel but I am not a fan of how they have treated players in the past and they continue to gloss over paying customers. So my account got banned because i have a friend who gave me his account back when the game was launched in 2013. I had just began to stream the game also and my account was capped back in oct 2014 so I decided to hit up my friends old account since the account was practially untouched  and had like $300+ bucks of heroes and store items on it. I had accidentially typed my password one day on stream as you often have to relog due to a memory leak that has been around the game since its launch. Now not sure what really happened after that other than my friend notifying me that he got a notification of am email asking for address change. The game was experiencing a few reports of people being hacked at first I didn&apos;t believe it until another streamer got hacked. Gazillion came on the forums multiple times saying its not withing their database or some bs like that. The account then dissapeared like couldn&apos;t log it or it wasn&apos;t even reqistered anymore under my friends email so he called me up and we talk and I advised him to submit a ticket. Months passed and they never replied to him so I submitted a ticket which got ignored for 3 months also. Finally yesterday i went back on the forums on another account and alerted the devs of the issue. I was there accused of selling my account on a 3rd party website, then breaking multiple rules and how my account won&apos;t be reinstated. Now I asked the devs whihc account are they talking about and if your gonna ban my account in which I have invest 2+ years and some cash on I won&apos;t mind you showing me some kind of proof since there was no way for me prove I wasn&apos;t trying to sell my account. The dev then ignored my messages and is moving unto banning my account that I use to talk to them. Its not right for a company and I know this is gaming to take your money and time and not explain or even send out warnings. I know for a fact I didin&apos;t try to sell the account and everytime you go n the forums to bring about how their customer support sucks they block or ban your accounts even seen them deleting posts if you criticize their game. Before anyone invest time and money into this game, better of playing diablo 3 since they are the same thing just without the crappy support.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5193102">Expand</a></span>

<br>You are not part of a community you are a minion in their dictatorship and they dont understand that negative feedback is still feedback.
<br>
<br>Also if you look at some of the banned people profiles the development likes to label people, one of the worst I have seen is them labelling someone as a sexual predator with no statement to back it up and blatant refusal to listen or talk to their community about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5235406">Expand</a></span>

SHOULD being the operative key word here.  Ultimately, it&apos;s about 2-3 weeks of fun, followed by a frustrating, unpolished button-masher with no endgame content.
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>-Diablo clone that remains true to the fun &quot;army of enemies&quot; gameplay.
<br>-Weekly &amp; Daily event quests - Each week, some part of the game or another converts to event content (better loot, stronger enemies)
<br>-Free to Try.
<br>-Easy to hit endgame. Took me about 10 days to hit max level of 60 on my starter character.
<br>-Entertaining cinematics and motion comics.
<br>-Stunning litany of Marvel Villains... From A-List to F-List and everything in between.
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>-No secure trading between players.  You have to drop the item on the ground and hope your intended gets it before someone else does.
<br>-No Auction House.  Forces extra hours or days of grinding, and makes the in-game cash worthless, since there&apos;s virtually nothing to spend it on.
<br>-Unless you feel like paying $5-$20 for each character you want to try, you&apos;ll have to grind for weeks just for a random hero, which may or not be one you&apos;ve already got.
<br>- You start with access to only one character, selectable from a group of 7 C-listers and Captain America.  Because of the above point, you&apos;re locked into this character for at least a few weeks.
<br>-No customization.  You&apos;re one of a dozen people on your map with the same exact character and gear.  Unless you want to buy an alternate costume, which costs money and adds no abilities.
<br>-Zero endgame content.  Two instances and that&apos;s all you get.  Marvel&apos;s endgame is just repeating the things you&apos;ve already done, but on a higher difficulty and with zero changes based on the character you use.  After two years, they&apos;re just now getting around to their first raid boss.
<br>-Most of the player community does not know RPG combat roles, and Gazillion makes no attempt to make them clear.
<br>-Story mode is WAY too short.  By the time you finish it the first time around, you&apos;re not even halfway to maximum level.
<br>-All gear stat categories are randomized for each piece of gear.  The result is a confused jumble of abilities that your character has literally no use for, taking up the space where a useful stat boost could be.  Energy damage buffs on gear only usable by a melee character, healing stats for DPS characters, etc.
<br>-Zero replay value.  Once story mode is done, all that&apos;s left to do is grind mobs or repeat the same story again.  Even new content patches do not add story content.
<br>
<br>All in all, I was remarkably disappointed by this game.  The utter lack of endgame content, limited play options, disorganized character design, shoddy gear design, and pathetically limited story mode overshadow my Marvel and Diablo fandom.
<br>
<br>All in all, this game feels like it got the greenlight before Beta testing was completed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4527553">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t let the inflated positive reviews from MH2015 forum members (whom the devs asked to leave a positive review here) fool you. Most of these reviewers either set very low standards with their games, blind fanboys, or people who never played a decent MMORPG. I&apos;ve logged in around 1500 hrs on this game since they rebranded this to MH2015 (to skew the review scores) in the hopes that they add some good endgame content and it&apos;s just been one big disappointment.
<br>
<br>The whole game is just an ILLUSION of having more than it really has. It gives the impression of having a lot of endgame content, but only a couple of it is worth running (3-4 cosmic terminals, 2 raids and oneshots, CMM, and the AoU &quot;mode&quot; that&apos;s really just another oneshot). There&apos;s a big 48 hero roster, but ALL of them are DPS characters and most of them have similar play-styles. It&apos;s not A lot of the skills are pretty much the same. It seriously looked like they used stock animations and slapped on variations in visuals (like Invisible Woman&apos;s Seeker Orbs, Storm&apos;s Ball lightning, Iron Man&apos;s Repulser Barrage, etc).
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- It&apos;s free.
<br>- It&apos;s not P2W. The heroes can all be obtained in time and you can get cosmetic skins with a little RNG luck from the costume blender. The storage STASH is probably the only thing that you need to buy.
<br>- They give out a code almost every week for a small buff boost. It&apos;s not much  but still good.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- There&apos;s barely any challenging endgame content. Even mobile games like Order and Chaos have
<br>- The game is extremely repetitive. You either spend your time leveling/prestiging characters or running the same instance over and over again to get boss specific gear.
<br>- Straight up hack n&apos; slash. There&apos;s only one role in this game and that&apos;s the DPS. The bosses are immobile punching bags with only 1-2 attacks.
<br>- Poorly optimized game that takes up around 30GB of space.
<br>- Lots of bugs with every patch. It seems like they find something new to break every week.
<br>- Most of the community (players and devs) can&apos;t handle (the truth) criticism of the game well but they&apos;ll hand out praises like candy over the smallest stuff.
<br>- Seems like 90% of the developer team&apos;s resources are spent on creating new heroes, costumes, and team-ups to put in the cash shop.
<br>- A lot of the new content (excluding costumes) they release are either rushed and wasn&apos;t thought out very well, incomplete, or bugged. New heroes are notorious for getting nerfed the following week.
<br>- PVP may as well not exist.
<br>- Damage, Crit/Brut ratings, health on medkit, Invul proc, and MP are the only stats/affixes that matter.
<br>- Terrible crafting system.
<br>- The weekly server side buffs and cosmic event trivialized the leveling experience. Cosmic prestige is no longer a prestigious achievement.
<br>- &quot;New content&quot; most likely mean, &quot;Here&apos;s a new hero. Now go level and gear it.&quot;
<br>- Half of the skills for each hero are useless and most of the heroes only have one good build.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5315081">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ You can unlock any hero just playing the game
<br>+ Fun gameplay. Top notch voice acting, good music, graphics and sfx..
<br>+ Developers try hard to do their best.
<br>
<br>- Memory leaks, CPU problems, many bugs.
<br>- Loot drop rates are the worst in any arpg, maybe developers think that Korean grinding is a good idea.
<br>- Pay to win. Experience boosts, currency boosts etc. have a tremendous impact to your hero progression.
<br>- To many weirdos in forums like people posting transsexual images etc. The exact opposite are those who play the game, they are nice and friendly.
<br>- Overpriced item/costume shop
<br>
<br>Despite its flaws (performance issues, pay to win boosts) this game is one of the best Marvel games since X-Men Legends / Ultimate Alliance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5326880">Expand</a></span>

<br>Not a game you will want to waste your time in. The game play itself is not bad but it still has a ton of issues that really drag the experience down making it mediocre at best and the community in this game is even worse.
<br>So i&apos;ll start with games problems.
<br>- UI is very distracting and takes up most your screen, since you can not control the camera in this game it becomes a major annoyance especially in enemy crowded areas
<br>-Movement does not work properly, your character does not always attack and move the direction your pointing or it will bug and your character will not stop moving or will start dodging all over the place
<br>-The game gives you a massive overabundance of loot from everything and anything. This forces you to have to empty your inventory every couple minutes (and this is not exaggerated). The different tiers of gear mean nothing since you can get the best tier of gear very soon into the game and after that it is extremely easy to get (i&apos;ve been using the highest tier gear since i hit lvl 12 without trying to even get any of it....). Looting in this game is basically no fun at all, getting new items does not have any excitement to it.
<br>-There is no difficulty. This game is as easy as it could possibly be. 1 shot everything. Kill bosses in 5 seconds. Run group content solo, kill those bosses in 10 seconds. It&apos;s a joke. The only difficulty you will find is if you run content 5-10 levels higher than the character you are using.
<br>-Acquiring heroes will take you forever, not only are they required, they will take you months at the very least to get unless you want to drop some $$ in the cash shop.
<br>-Navigating through the terrain is a pain, you get stuck on walls if you end up to close to them, some areas you have to walk perfectly or else you get stuck, if you dont have a character who can glide over obstacles then your going to have a really hard time.
<br>-Picking up loot (should have put this up higher on the list) is a chore. Not only do you have to pick up 20x items at a time, they overlap eachother so you have to pick everything up even if you just want the item at the bottom of the pile (means you have to toss items out of your inventory constantly) and if they drop near an npc or portal then good luck picking any of it up, the cursor will choose to talk to the npc or use the portal before it will let you choose to pick up an item
<br>-Game settings are originally set to the worst options available. You start with everything important being disabled while everything you dont / should need enabled. They even start you off by having some &quot;beta&quot; options enabled (which work like ****).
<br>-Mechanics on enemies are pretty bad. The way they make bosses / mobs &quot;difficult&quot; is by buffing their damage 1000% and then making their attacks unavoidable. You have to either spam health packs, fight the enemies while being overgeared, or kill everything in a few seconds. There is no skill to this game at all
<br>
<br>Now lets talk about the community, since i have only been playing this game for a few days my opinion and what i witnessed could have just been a fluke. However with that said, this community is horrible.
<br>-Difficult for new players to get any help. A lot of people expect everyone to know everything, if not then go study the wiki till you have the game memorized.
<br>-Too much trolling, trolling can be fun and humorous but only in moderation. This community does not understand that however and trolls the chat 24/7 (and none of it is even funny, it all sounds like its coming from a 5 year old kid)
<br>-To many fanboys, the community literally seems to only consist of hardcore fanboys. If the chat isnt trolling its heated discussions of marvel comics and how DC is garbage. It gives an extremely awkward and uncomfortable feeling if your not a huge fan of the marvel franchise.
<br>
<br>All in all, this game gets a generous 6. It is not worth your time investment unless your a hardcore marvel franchise fan, it seems that they are the only ones even playing this game. It had the potential to be great but the complete lack of difficulty, proper loot system, and screwy movement has ruined that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5456613">Expand</a></span>

Items/gear is bland, no new ground broke anywhere.  Literally every other diablo clone has something over this one, but it&apos;s technically free so that&apos;s that.  Have painfully tried to support this since release (marvel fanboy here) and can recommend it to no one.  Many heroes are not well represented, others pretty decent.  Most of the popular characters are NOT done justice, but have several things for sale associated with them.  And it&apos;s brutally short--you repeat levels/areas non-stop, the same 2 amounting to 90% of your time.  I hope it gets fixed but there is serious work to be done.  Wait on this one, it&apos;s not ready yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4899839">Expand</a></span>

An army to aim at their critics (See Doomsaw&apos;s disingenuous plea for &quot;fair&quot; metacritic scores).
<br>I remember being threatened with violence by one fanboy who insulted others constantly in favor of Gazillion, and that guy was still allowed to play. Because people who defend Gazillion are allowed to break as many rules as they like.
<br>I&apos;d like to play again, but there is no way I&apos;m supporting this company again.
<br>
<br>Right on their first game Gaziliion and its minions are well known for threatening Steam users and official forum users that made negative reviews.
<br>It&apos;s funny other companies like EA, Activision, Capcom and most recently WB games have gotten a lot of flak and public scrutiny even from youtubers because of their decisions.
<br>Meanwhile in this game developers can get away with charging US$95 for a SINGLE COSMETIC COSTUME (Deadpool&apos;s Ultimate Costume and Punisher Noir Costume come to mind) and they still get defended and get their balls licked by the blind fanboys.
<br>
<br>Their &quot;refresh&quot; of the title adding 2015 to bury the old 50% of approval Marvel Heroes here shows what kind of company this is.
<br>You can&apos;t even say they&apos;re really creative, cause 95% of characters moves are obviously borrowed from much better Marvel Games, like Marvel vs. Capcom, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Marvel Ultimate Alliance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
<br>
<br>Also the forums are horrible, it&apos;s like Nazi Germany where Doomsaw runs the Third Reich and has his own SS army of digital goons and rabid fanboys.
<br>Anyone calling them out for being the greedy whores they are that spend more time selling cosmetics for a steep price than actually fixing the damn game gets an insta ban.
<br>Even if the person is polite and simply reports a bug, INSTA BAN.
<br>
<br>No warning, No message...of course they won&apos;t say: &quot;Hi, we got offended you think we charge a steep price for things and haven&apos;t fixed some bugs since BETA, so we banned you&quot;. If they did that people would print it and throw around the internet to put an even bigger **** stain on this already pathetic company.
<br>
<br>Marvel Heroes is a good game, has a lot of potential yet not fully realized, it could be great, and it probably never will, cause this horrible company makes everything to ruin it.
<br>
<br>That really breaks my heart, cause I&apos;m a huge MARVEL fan and I wish they would&apos;ve sold their licenses or whatever to another developer. The material is much better than the **** company in charge of it.
<br>They don&apos;t deserve the awesome MARVEL characters.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s basically a company being runned by retarded authoritarian man children with the mind of a 10 year old autistic texan kid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5388755">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have 431 hours on record on Steam, I do sometimes tab out and read the forums while logged in but most of that is active play.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll try to explain the most glaring issues and say the main reason I play is because my friend does &amp; I love Xmen.
<br>
<br>1) It has a lot of bugs.
<br>
<br>Gazillion has years of content planned ahead of them &amp; they become more focused by the day on rushing it out on *schedule* regardless of the consequences.
<br>
<br>They post a new hero, or feature, on the Test Center, receive every bug report they need from their avid fans and testers, &amp; fix a few of them before continuing on with the live release and a post in the respective forum asking for bug reports on the self-same thing, 99.9% of which are just repeats from TC forum.
<br>
<br>A recent example that was whitewashed by them is that items dropping in the &quot;Special Item Find&quot; pool have been too low for multiple patch periods. For a staff that responds on the forums regularly, their silence on this was extremely disheartening. They said nothing about it, responded to no post about it, and then suddenly it was mentioned on a stream that it would be &quot;fixed&quot;, nothing more, and then it shows up without pomp or circumstance in the middle of some other bug fixes in the last patch. &quot;The drop rate of several items have been increased for enemies created post-launch, including things such retcons, unstable molecules and Fortune Cards.&quot; (Yes typo intact).
<br>Now I didn&apos;t play for a lot of months between release &amp; this year, so I don&apos;t know exactly when this started, but it has been only since this year, so I don&apos;t know what post-launch has to do with anything but it certainly isn&apos;t an explanation as it was broken in old content as well as new.
<br>
<br>It also suffers from the worst lag in any game I&apos;ve tried.
<br>Some people have no problems with it, but a lot of people who have systems that should run anything on max settings can&apos;t play it smoothly, and anyone with a system closer to recommended specs can forget it.
<br>I didn&apos;t play for most of it&apos;s initial release period because the lag in every zone except for solo instances was so bad. They fixed it enough that when I tried again it was tolerable to good in most areas.
<br>Over time it seemed like each patch would screw with one area, like combat zones would be fine but it took 5 minutes to load into a hub with no FPS to speak of. Next patch hubs are much better but X-Defense is now the FPS dead zone.
<br>That changed over time to be every patch added more lag to everywhere.
<br>I can&apos;t keep playing much longer at this rate. I freeze constantly in Midtown Patrol and Holo-Sim &amp; certain skills in a group of enemies drop fps if it hits enough of them.
<br>Lowering effects and graphics and whatnot sure makes your game look N64 bad, but it has next to no actual performance gain. You can tell by running near other people fighting that their combat stuff happening is still affecting you, and I can also tell that part of it is server related. Or if the difference between Live with nothing on being horrible and TC with almost everything on being perfectly playable doesn&apos;t prove server issues I don&apos;t know what does.
<br>
<br>2) Lack of scripted &amp;/or skill based encounters.
<br>
<br>All content outside of the new raids basically focuses on loading the screen with trash(*) to the point where even if you could see most of the projectiles coming at you (which you really can&apos;t anyway) there is no intelligent or reflexive dodging capable of avoiding them in time; you simply have to get used to moving every 1-5 seconds based on damage intake.
<br>This has the added effect of punishing any power set built around long cast time/channeled powers.
<br>It also make projectile defense OP, &amp; since some characters have 100% or more from powers or passives they are now having to add it into the weakest defense heroes to compensate. This is furthermore a stat that does *not* roll on random stat gear, it is only set on the fixed stat &quot;Uniques&quot; of some heroes.
<br>
<br>Bosses have a few scripted moves, which they can spam at times un-intelligently &amp; most of which are not telegraphed well or at all, as well as random affixes # of which is based on difficulty of the zone. All &quot;cosmic&quot; difficulty bosses have 3 affixes and cosmic orbs. Cosmic orbs spawn in sets of 2-3 on the ground &amp; semi follow the boss around. They do a high amount of DoT &amp; spend a lot of time under the bosses feet punishing melee power sets.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m way out of characters so I&apos;ll finish the last point quickly relating to 2 &amp; 3. You can kill 125 trash to gain a bonus chest in cosmics but some which can clear boss can&apos;t even do this without dying a lot so they boss rush or just boss rush anyway for time efficiency.
<br>
<br>3) (*)Trash (elites too) is nearly pointless because it has effectively no loot table and compared to ie D3 there is 100x more of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4290295">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is a cashgrab.

<br>
<br>Now they&apos;ve implemented more and improved the overall quality of the game, but the way they run the game is atrocious. The devs censor the community, they constantly make small (often unannounced) alterations to try and frustrate people into spending money, and major glitches created by past patches will go unattended for months and months. Not to mention the game has had a memory leak since launch they still haven&apos;t gotten around to fixing.
<br>
<br>On the upside there&apos;s a lot of Marvel heroes and if you&apos;re a nerd like me you&apos;re gonna enjoy beating up bad guys as Gambit, Deadpool and many more. They also keep adding more characters, which is nice to break up the monotony. And hey, it&apos;s still better than D3.
<br>
<br>With different people in charge this game could be so much more, but under the current regime they&apos;re gonna keep screwing the fans over. It&apos;s that kind of thing that makes people annoyed with F2P games, but it is what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4357775">Expand</a></span>

As for surroundings, the industrial environment is cool (cities, metro tunnels etc), however the &quot;natural&quot; environments including snow and trees suck big time. Many different game modes like protecting Xaviers school,  doing shield holo training, patrolling 2 huge zones or just running terminals (short versions of previous dungeons). Not to mention they added a Raid and second Raid is coming shortly. So lots of heroes lots of engame, why only 5? First, the game is buggy as hell with the tradition of new patch erasing some bugs and bringing new even more annoying ones into action. End if I say buggy, I mean it. I have never ever encountered a game with so many bugs as this one. The second is not good enough fusion of arpg and an mmo. Like lvling with friends was done very poorly (it&apos;s better to solo), fighting bosses with more players - you won&apos;t see the bosses because they&apos;re stupidly small and skill effects covers them completely. You&apos;ll be fighting a shining colorful cloud of other players powers... And one more thing, it says free to play, but you actually HAVE to buy inv space or else the game will be torture, nothing more. If you love marvel and arpgs try this game and add 3 points to my score and start downloading.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5134713">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately the story mode is terribly boring and short, and there is very little content in the game past that, unless you want to grind for dozens of hours to get the bear gear... so you can grind some more.
<br>
<br>It is &quot;free&quot; to play but if you&apos;re gonna play the game even remotely seriously, you&apos;ll spend at least $10 on bank slots since you share it between all of your characters, along with the inventory. You get to pick one $4.50 hero for free when you start the game, the game also has a bunch of $9 heroes and all the popular fun ones at $13.50 (Spider-man, Deadpool, etc). You can also buy the heroes in game with a droppable currency you find in game, but it&apos;ll take a *lot* of time. You can also buy different costumes for your heroes and those are also $4-$13.50 and are only visual upgrades, no way to buy them in game, only for cash. New heroes are added regularly but new levels, zones, missions etc are not.
<br>
<br>The game doesn&apos;t run very well and the engine used (Unreal) is less than ideal for this type of game. The game is buggy and every new patch introduces another bug. The Developers are close w/ their community so there are a lot of AMAs (Ask Me Anything) and they have a few people that reply to the players in the forums and on the subreddit /r/marvelheroes. The community is very fanboyish and split between young kids and adults with nothing better to do than spend $100s of dollars in game and sink 100s of hours playing. Your experience may vary but generally speaking any kind of criticism in game about the game will be quickly drowned out and the official forums are heavily censored from what I hear. Overall the game is fun though, like a Marvel Action Figures Beat &apos;em up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4407543">Expand</a></span>

It can be fun to play with established heroes, Most of the heroes currently have a different style from each other. Playing Emma Frost is different from playing Loki or Dr Strange or the Hulk. However the game has its faults.
<br>
<br>It is leaning towards more and more homogenised play meaning the characters are losing their distinct unique feel. The loot table has been broken for months with no signs of improvement. Certain items have all but vanished from it. The new One-Shot is currently in a bad spot, the amount of time and effort required to finish it does not correspond with the loot given. Gazillion seems to react in a knee-jerk fashion when it spots something it considers wrong and frequently spoils the fun of many players in the process.
<br>
<br>While the game is technically F2P it is made in a certain way that makes it very hard to play it for any long period without spending at least some money on it. Besides being a profitable business model for Gazillion it also allows them to hide behind the screen of &quot;you don&apos;t have to pay money if you don&apos;t want to&quot; But realize that you will spend many hours trying to organise your limited stash, and wondering why the other paying customers seem be having more fun than you are.
<br>
<br>As a Marvel fan I have to give this game at least a 6. I do not know if I would play this game if I wasn&apos;t a die-hard comics fan though. To make this a good game regardless of the IP Gazillion would have to improve its loot and make the game a better co-op experience. That they haven&apos;t made better strides in this direction after a year is disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4277562">Expand</a></span>

Being a better game, however, is not the same as being a good game.
<br>
<br>Marvel Heroes is shiny looking, with some great interpretations of classic Marvel heroes, but utterly lacking in content. You can easily see everything this game to offer (aside from its single raid) in six hours or less, and from there on out, it&apos;s all repetition. What ruins Marvel Heroes 2015 is the people you are forced to deal with. The community is as cancerous as any F2P online game, and Gazillion, while charging wildly exorbitant fees for even the smallest bits of content, has such poor support and moderation that I am honestly surprised they have not been kicked off Steam. It&apos;s too bad. In the hands of a professional development team, this could be a great game. Unfortunately, all the development resources seem to go to creating new heroes and costumes to be sold in the store, and almost no effort is spent expanding the tiny amount of content those heroes can explore, once purchased. All in all, if you can spend hundreds of hours replaying six hours worth of content, can stand a community made up almost entirely of Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons (all of whom are in permanent white knight mode for their perfect and wonderful game), then I think you could enjoy your time with this willfully mediocre title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4581908">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game has been poorly optimized, every patch has new bugs, no hero is released without less than 5 bugs on them that takes months, almost a year to fix, and worst of all the management is corrupt. They will do anything they have in their power to silence you from bad mouthing their game.
<br>
<br>Every month they promise better optimization, know how many months its been since release? Coming on 15. Their patches are as large as hell, the last one was 5gb, for the new hero rogue, jean grey level 52 rework, and a terminal bronx zoo. Things that, normally would take any other game company about maybe 1-1.5gb. Their regular patches are anywhere from 300mb-2gb and those are weekly patches.
<br>
<br>Bugs bugs bugs. Should&apos;ve been called bugged heroes 2015. Always bugs always, its amazing because no other game have I noticed so many bugs, not even WoW, and WoW pushes things out fast too. Some of these bugs have gone without a fix for months. Loki, a playable character, one of his builds is absolutely garbage, because they can&apos;t seem to take maybe a day to fix how bosses react to cc effects, or change how the abilities work.
<br>
<br>The game deserves no more than 0 in my opinion just because of the above, they would get higher if they showed they cared to fix these issues, but they don&apos;t. As long as people praise them like gods and still feed them money, well, they&apos;ll still pretend to the tyrannical gods they are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4512109">Expand</a></span>

After my initial impressions were somewhat lukewarm its clear that the game has received considerable polish. The core mechanics are still there. The game&apos;s DNA is evident. Developed by creator of Diablo David Brevik; you can&apos;t help but notice the influence. Its also interesting that like Diablo 3&apos;s launch? Marvel Heroes had quite a rocky launch itself back in 2013. Player feedback of issues like limited content, hero tokens, and in game store prices was largely brushed aside.
<br>
<br>The devs began to take the feedback to heart opening up communication with its players in forums, etc. The results are evident. The character models and environments are nicely detailed. The heroes are voice acted and animated nicely. Its also fun to hear your character make a quip about another player&apos;s chosen hero. Speaking of the voice acting...there is some high profile voice talent to be had. David Hayter of Metal Gear Solid fame voices the Winter Soldier. (Approrpiate right?).
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s story is broken into chapters with some very well done animated cutscenes with characters like J. Jonah Jameson and Nick Fury. Your hero&apos;s abilities are earned as you level up. Leveling up provides you skill points that you can distribute in any of the three trees as you see fit. This kind of character building is immediately familiar if you are a fan of D1 or D2. Loot drops frequently never letting you feel undergeared. Gear is color coded as you might expect. Blue and green are uncommon and common respectively; while purple and yellow are higher. Yellow items are what are called cosmic items which are often of better quality/value. You can equip anything from medals, artifacts, and gear on your character to provide stat boosts and bonus effects. However it is a bit disappointing that this gear doesn&apos;t actually show on your character. But I expect this was to make things feel cohesive. The gear that you can&apos;t use or don&apos;t need can be sold or &apos;donated&apos; to a crafter to increase his level. Increasing his level allows you to craft some great gear.
<br>
<br>Eternity splinters now drop off of enemies. These splinters can then be used to buy heroes and costumes in the in game store. However I feel that the drop rates in general for splinters and costume&apos;s are incredibly low. This of course is likely to encourage you to spend money in the cash shop. Before I might not have but I have since bought two heroes because I found this reimagining to be far more enjoyable. But they do offer some login bonuses from time to time. As of writing this tomorrow they are offering 400 splinters for logging in which is enough to purchase one of the heroes or a skin. Granted not one of the more popular characters as they tend to be priced a bit higher. If you are a fan of Marvel or even Action RPG&apos;s like Diablo? Give the game a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=6112619">Expand</a></span>

Yes, the game is astronomically better than when it first released but it still has plenty of problems albeit smaller issues for the most part (performance being a bigger issue). I have 323 hours in the game and I&apos;ve spent at least $300 on the game (no you don&apos;t have to spend this much and no it&apos;s not pay to win) which is more than I&apos;ve spent on any game other than my years playing paid MMOs. The game&apos;s certainly worth trying now especially if you tried at launch and disliked it. Take many of these 10/10 reviews with a grain of salt because while the game is great now, it&apos;s still not perfect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4253536">Expand</a></span>

They listened to player feedback and shown a great willingness to interact with the fans, exceeding expectations after the initial product was quite underwhelming. For those of us who stuck with it and saw the inherent potential, there has been a substantial payoff and the game is easily the best it has ever been.
<br>
<br>Are there still flaws? Of course. But many of the bugs and issues are constantly being corrected by the dev team and I don&apos;t believe any feedback directed at them goes unheard. Most importantly, this game offers some freshness that hasn&apos;t been seen before in the ARPG genre and gives you a variety of gameplay option rather than forcing you to spend all your time on story, for example. The community itself is also pretty great the vast majority of the time and you&apos;ll typically encounter people that are helpful and generous. Sure, there are a few elitists and so on, but just ignore them and your experience won&apos;t be affected much.
<br>
<br>Best of all, you can truly play free and there is no cap on progression or power if you don&apos;t spend money. I know this is important to players and rest assured there is no legitimate &quot;pay-to-win&quot; feature here. You can earn every hero just by playing and putting in the effort.  On the other hand, costumes are such a rare drop they might as well not be one. Be prepared to dish out some dough if you want to sport some fancy new Iron Man armor or the black Spidey suit. Cosmetic items are their moneymakers, and are somewhat overpriced. Still, optional content is just that: optional. It has no impact on gameplay.
<br>
<br>in summary: If you&apos;re an ARPG connoisseur or just a Marvel fanatic, there is a lot to like about this game, especially now compared to a year ago. I can&apos;t guarantee that you&apos;ll love it, but I can promise that the playable hero diversity and choices at your disposal will likely pique your interest and give you the urge to play more, see more, and earn more. The free-to-play aspect will get you started and, with any luck, the regular, frequent content updates will keep you playing for months upon months to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4256171">Expand</a></span>

This game does have a lot going for it, but also lacks a lot of substance overall. At the core of the game, it feels very much like any Diablo game but with Heroes and Villains from the Marvel Universe. Where the game differs is the direction in which the game attempts to merge other genres together. Marvel Heroes 2015 should be classified as an MMOARPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Action Role Playing Game) because of how the game tries to meld a Diablo and WoW style game together. The end result is a lot of ambition from the developers and tons of design space, but that space isn&apos;t necessarily filled and a lot of the game&apos;s features seem to be lackluster or incomplete.
<br>
<br>The game has been out for a year now, hence the change, and in a year there is no doubt it has come far. You will enjoy this game if you like Diablo, but personally I will be sticking with D3 for some time as the endgame content found here is an attempt at blinding the player from the repetitiveness that they are continuing to experience. With Raids being implemented, the endgame content will be a bit better, but I&apos;m not sure that with the current structure in place for the stats that heroes will play a lot differently from one another. The skill trees are customizable to an extent, and will likely be expanded upon as the developers get around to it, but at the end of the day, many heroes play exactly the same.
<br>
<br>What you should take away from this review is that the game is enjoyable, but limited in what it has to offer you. If you like grinding the same levels over and over and over again, this won&apos;t be a bad choice for you considering you get to use your favorite marvel characters (without paying a cent mind you), however a lot of the game&apos;s features come down to when, not if. This is a bonus considering that raids came in a somewhat timely manner, however if you are looking for a more complete experience, look elsewhere. If you want to enjoy a game for what its worth and to experience a breath of fresh air in the ARPG genre, go ahead and give this game a spin, just don&apos;t expect to stick with it for very long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4256769">Expand</a></span>

Everything I could possibly want from this type of game and they are constantly adding new content and heroes.  Every time I try to take a break I find myself sucked back in within a week.
<br>
<br>Overall awesome game, and I can&apos;t wait to see it get even better!!!</span>

This is a different game in a lot of ways and it has come a long way from release. Much more content, improvements on every front, characters are over time being completely redesigned with the &apos;52 Reviews&apos; to get a rework of their powers and often more of them. There&apos;s lots of variety in the cast and new free content is always on the way in the form of characters, items, and missions/zones. The most recent patch, that updated the game to 2015, includes sweeping changes for almost everything. Big new features here are the game&apos;s first 10-person Raid, Shared Quests and the Omega system, which is the game&apos;s Alternate Advancement system.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving it an 8 since the game still has issues. The UI could use work, it&apos;s clunky in places and takes external modification of ini files to use more than one skill bar effectively, for example. Constant fast-paced content pushes means bugs, generally harmless silly ones but sometimes something ridiculous does go through to live. Performance could use some better optimization. Last major issue is that although many characters have gotten reviews a handful are still in need of them and while some of the characters without their review are still strong, they are typically boring to play with their limited options. This is getting worked on though, it&apos;ll just take time to get to everyone.
<br>
<br>All in all, for a free to play game, it&apos;s quite nice. If you haven&apos;t given the game a chance since a year ago, it&apos;s certainly worth a second look now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4252592">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The devs actually care about the game and are constantly updating it. Yes, they do some dumb stuff along the way, but they are a young company, and it&apos;s better to me than the slow-paced delivery of content made famous by Blizzard.
<br>
<br>Give the game a try for FREE, and watch it evolve (or mutate if you&apos;re into that).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4252711">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all, stay away from this game if you have lousy internet connection as you will need to download 1GB to  4GB once a week since the idiots who made this game probably doesn&apos;t know how to code a scalable MMO game and you basically have to re-download the game or huge parts of the game each and every week. Not only do you need to have bandwidth problems, you will also need to worry about lag problems with this game.
<br>
<br>Like most of the other reviewers have said, this is just a Diablo clone with Marvel skins. Bad thing about that concept is its already 2015 and it still plays like an decade old game. I don&apos;t mean to compare it to
<br>other Marvel Games but even Marvel Ultimate Alliance has better gameplay than this game and that game came out ages ago. Speaking of gameplay, it is buggy as hell. If you thought the Assassins Creed debacle was bad, its got nothing on this game. And you will need a beastly rig to run this game if you wan&apos;t to play this on high and want to participate in the MMO aspect of the game since even my 980 i7 rig crawls and freezes when there are too many player. But if you play solo, it runs very well, I could run solo content with my laptop using integrated graphics on the lowest setting.
<br>
<br>There are now a lot of characters but a lot of them are weak and unenjoyable, not to mention incomplete. The devs badly botched making the heroes and had to totally rework each hero, and its already almost their 2nd anniversary and they still havent finished cleaning up their mess. But even after &quot;reviewing&quot; the hero, it might still suck since ideas are all over the place. They constantly come up with a concept, quickly implement it, not apply it to every hero, rise and repeat. Which totally destroys the balance of game since the devs can&apos;t make up their mind and are too lazy to implement new concepts on older heroes.
<br>
<br>Speaking of heroes, most of the hero design looks like crap. I would give the artists props on the newer heroes/costumes but like the devs, they also botched on the old hero designs. One of the most notable botches are GIANT HANDS, almost all the original heroes have mutated ape hands and the artists are also too lazy to fix those despite constant request. Even on newer heroes/costumes, the artist sometimes botches and the result look like the hero/costume they are suppose to represent but there is just something not right about it (the closest analogy I can say is it doesn&apos;t look like the hero, but just a cosplay player dressing up as the hero).
<br>
<br>Now on the part that requires you to cough up some doe, most prices are surprisingly reasonable. Heroes and Costumes averagely cost 10 bucks. There are some costumes that are locked behind a paywall (a card which you can buy for 1 dollar which has a small chance to cough up an exclusive costume), and the unlucky ones have to shell out 95 bucks if they really wanted that costume.
<br>
<br>Now on to the community, I would say the community can be divided into two. The forum dwellers and the ingame players. The ingame players are mostly nice and helpful. The forum dwellers, well... it&apos;s probably one of the most toxic environments I&apos;ve encountered. If you&apos;ve ever seen the film, The Cable Guy, then that could be one of the best portrayal of the forum community. The forum dwellers are obsessed with the Devs and become rabid fanboys simply due to the devs posting on the forums and they think they are now &quot;best buds&quot;. This are the same people who constantly defend the devs from flak when the devs makes blunders and botches in the weekly patch (which is more often than you might think). This are the same people who will lash out on anyone that has a criticism on the devs (and I mean a real criticism with no insults whatsoever) . I&apos;m actually worried those guys would hang themselves if ever the game is canned, that&apos;s how desperate and attached those guys are.
<br>
<br>On closing, I did enjoy the game, I&apos;ve spent many hours on it. But at the end of the day, this is a mediocre game and you will only enjoy it if your bored and out of altrnatives or a Marvel fanboy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5044895">Expand</a></span>

At the release there were quite a lot of problems with this game and not enough content especially at later levels(it probable would have been smarter to release it as open beta since that&apos;s kind of what it was). However the marvel heroes staff is one of the most active I&apos;ve ever seen during that time, lots of posts and updates. However after a while I got bored and quit the game and went to play D3 and GW2.
<br>
<br>Recently I picked this game up again and it&apos;s a completely different game from the release, none of the bad things that made this game were boring were still in it. Ever since I picked this game up I haven&apos;t played a minute of D3 anymore. There are still quite a few things MH can improve upon though however most updates will take time which is understandable.
<br>
<br>The most positive things are still the regular updates this game is getting and the marvel atmosphere that is very well executed. Also none of the hero&apos;s feel boring to play and each different hero has distinct things about them that make them feel very different from the other hero&apos;s. For me that means it&apos;s very hard to point out a main character since all of them can be fun to play.
<br>
<br>The storyline is well executed in my opinion as well and with the introduction of raids now there&apos;s plenty of content to enjoy. There&apos;s also enough variation in viable builds and customization with the omega system and Hero Synergy bonuses.
<br>
<br>Further of all this game is completely free to play and the only useful thing that you can&apos;t really get for free is stash space which is completely fine by me. All hero&apos;s can be earned by just playing the game so if you don&apos;t want to spend money you can still have plenty of fun.
<br>
<br>Costumes still cost quite a bit but they&apos;re cosmetic and in all fairness I don&apos;t think the price is that bad on a lot of them, there&apos;s cheap and more expensive costumes so if you really want to have your hero look a different there&apos;s plenty of options.
<br>
<br>There are however still quite a few hero&apos;s that need a lvl 52 rework but this will take time and won&apos;t happen overnight and the hero&apos;s even in their old state are quite balanced compared to others.
<br>One thing I do hope to see improved is the pvp system as I really don&apos;t like this to much. Also I hope that in the future more one shots and terminals will be released to give even more variation but I&apos;m quite sure that this will happen somewhere in the future.
<br>
<br>Now this game is by no means perfect, but it&apos;s still a good game overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4251978">Expand</a></span>

<br>The item hunt, the combat, the selection of characters, all the end-game content, will keep you coming back again and again. With constant updates and patches, the game will remain fresh for years to come. This game certainly deserves more recognition for the place it has got to from where MH was before.</span>

Now a year later, the game is better than ever and the developers show no signs of slowing down. There are a multitude of heroes to choose from, each with their own playstyles and flavorful abilities. The end game has been expanded greatly due to the introduction of Prestiges, Hero Synergies, and the newly launched Omega System. Now, every experience point you earn, either at level one or at max level, now progresses your overall account in a meaningful way. I have 25 Heroes unlocked so far and over 800 hours of play time with no signs of stopping. This game warrants a second look, especially if you are a comic book or ARPG fan. For those players who don&apos;t want to spend any money, be forewarned. There is a LOT of grinding required in order to play for free. There is a decent selection of free starter heroes, but most of the heroes require hours upon hours to unlock. If you find the gameplay enjoyable, the process of unlocking new heroes wouldn&apos;t seem too tedious. My recommendation if you like the game is to buy one hero you wouldn&apos;t mind grinding with to unlock the rest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4251164">Expand</a></span>

But still lacks optimization and the minimun system requeriments they stated aren&apos;t quite enough to play a big part of the content. Besides that the game is fun and awesome, f2p and really far from ever becoming p2w totally worth a try :)</span>
