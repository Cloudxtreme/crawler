You&apos;ll recognize the voice acting.<br><br>Gameplay-wise, the game plays very much like other Tower Defense games: You build towers along a grid, trying to stop the bad guys from reaching your fortress. Unlike most other TD games, however, you also go on the offensive: You build your own waves of critters and send them back through the map toward the other guy.<br><br>While this is nice in theory and could make for a fantastic game, it just wasn&apos;t executed particularly well. You&apos;re susceptible to &quot;zerg rush&quot; tactics in multiplayer, the unit selection feels tactically unimportant (you&apos;ll use the same few units constantly), and the standard campaign doesn&apos;t have enough interesting challenges for an experienced TD player (although there are some challenge modes). An experienced Tower Defense gamer can expect 6-8 hours from the campaign. It&apos;s quite easy.<br><br>One disappointment in particular is that you don&apos;t seem to be able to play the other 2 races/factions in campaign mode, which would go a long way to adding replayability to the very short campaign.<br><br>Even after a patch applied the day after the release, the controls feel sluggish and unresponsive (although the patch fixed the most glaring errors). Graphically the game is nice and the sound is appropriate.<br><br>Even the multiplayer experience has some issues. You cannot type messages to other players, everyone is booted back to the main menu once a game is over instead of returning to a lobby, and the AI always gangs up on Player 1 from the very beginning, never changing tactics or trying to surprise other players. Still, there IS an AI to play against, and in a game where tactical decisions need to be made it&apos;s interesting and welcome to have an AI at all.<br><br>Game modes include free-for-all, 2v2, and 2v2 survival. The AI can be used in any of the modes. So, for your friends that can&apos;t handle playing against another player lest they (gasp) lose, there&apos;s options for their tender feelings.<br><br>I don&apos;t know if there is a technical issue, but I was unable to find any open multiplayer games online. I was only able to get people into my game by inviting them directly via Steam.<br><br><br>If you&apos;re a fan of TD games then Defenders of Ardania should be in your library; if you only have a passing interest in the genre, you may want to consider alternatives.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/defenders-of-ardania/user-reviews?user_review_id=2245502">Expand</a></span>

<br>The deployment of the game is stuffing  because the only thing that you can do is send troop  build towers  and wait for the result that very often you can&apos;t in any manner determinate.So very often at beginning you win but you do not know really why because you  do not manage the action in a useful way.Graphics and animation are good  except for the window  pop up of some command too much invasive that obscure a huge part of the field of battle  but this is&apos;t enough to make a good TD  Defense Grid ,Fieldrunner and also  GratuitousTank Battle anc Comet Crash are really in another planet........</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/defenders-of-ardania/user-reviews?user_review_id=3052387">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I personally love tower defense games, and this one lets you both defend and attack which is great.  It gets progressively harder as you continue on as well to keep things from being too easy.  What makes me like it more, is that it still follows the Majesty lore.  You have a limited amount of towers you&apos;re allowed to place, so you have to think before you spam the field with towers.</span>

<br>1. You can&apos;t take over the game even if you played well, every missions are too much depended on pre-planned scenario.
<br>2. Limited towers, troops &amp; resources.
<br>3. (2x) mode doesn&apos;t work at all.
<br>4. Controls are half in keyboard &amp; half in mouse, very hard to remember them while playing &amp; its pretty bothering.
<br>5. No fun.</span>
