So, in order to do that, he decides to organize a music competition and win the whole thing.
<br>
<br>- Unlike the previous episode, this episode has several layers - first, you have to get everyone to take part in your competition and later, you have to make sure your band is the best one. It&apos;s quite a bit shorter than the previous episode, but there are slightly more things to do during Extended Play.
<br>
<br>- Certain max achievement requirements are super tricky and are practically sure to be missed without a guide.
<br>
<br>- Also, this episode does not contain the mini game in which you create your own Teen Girl Squad comics, even though the comics itself makes a return in some shape or form. Also, no extra game like the strategic field in the previous episode.
<br>
<br>- The bonus video mini game in this episode revolves around using a spaceship, shooting aliens and rescuing people and it&apos;s quite a challenge to beat the score of 45000 points.
<br>
<br>- Overall, I like the musical theme of the episode, however, I still feel that the previous two episodes were better and more &quot;funny&quot;. The part where you have to sabotage each band is great, nevertheless, not as funny as you might expect, because certain characters&apos; relationships change quite a bit during this episode.
<br>
<br>- Instead of being able to see card boxes as in the previous episodes, you have to use your microphone during this episode to make them appear. Basically, it&apos;s a big guessing game and it&apos;s not very fun.
<br>
<br>- The episode took me 6 hours to finish 100% and I had to replay it once as it was impossible to 100% the awesomeness during the first time through.
<br>
<br>So, for the slightly weaker substance of this episode and some missing features, I am going to reduce the rating to 7 for this episode. It&apos;s still fun, but the previous two episodes were simply better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episode-3-baddest-of-the-bands/user-reviews?user_review_id=5230358">Expand</a></span>
