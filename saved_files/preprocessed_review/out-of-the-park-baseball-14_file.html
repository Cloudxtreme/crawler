I&apos;m a Baseball fan, and I haven&apos;t been this addicted to a game in a LONG LONG time. This game is just that good. It&apos;s not meant to replace MLB: The Show, rather it&apos;s meant to compliment it. This game is much more simulation based than The Show, and really shows you the GM side of Baseball. Great game for Billy Beane wannabes. Gotta say, it&apos;s super fun to finish 1st in your division and win the World Series in this game. Heck, it&apos;s even enjoyable waiting during loading screens! because during loading screens, the game tells you all sorts of interesting things about the great game of Baseball. For example, I learned that Babe Ruth pitched a 14 inning complete game once in the WS. Also, the season Roger Maris hit 61 bombs, he wasn&apos;t walked even once! overall great stuff to learn for any baseball fan. If there is one thing wrong with this game, it&apos;s that you don&apos;t fully get the feeling that you&apos;re playing in the MLB. There is an optional add-on you can download from the add-on center in the game itself (another very good feature) that provides you with all the MLB logos, player faces, and managers. Still, many of the players are depicted with great inaccuracy, and generally the feel of the Majors is lost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-14/user-reviews?user_review_id=3286101">Expand</a></span>

Made by a company that cares and is very active with it&apos;s users. The learning curve, has mentioned, is steep but if you take it step by step, watch a Youtube tutorial or just check on the forums (where you can have questions answered within minutes usually) its nothing to be afraid off. Play modern MLB, historical seasons starting in 1800s! or even make your own baseball universe in any country you want, with any rules you want!
<br>
<br>I rate it a 7 simply because there are a few things I personally would like to be added into the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-14/user-reviews?user_review_id=3884472">Expand</a></span>

You can create fictional leagues with fictional players or use major league players from any season, or you can use the current season&apos;s players and rosters and play out &quot;what if&quot; scenarios with your favorite teams and players.  You don&apos;t have to pay extra for any season disks or add-ons, and the game forums are the most user-friendly and detailed of any on the Internet.  The game is geared towards the strategy/general manager side of baseball, and although you can play out every game if you want, the graphics are not arcade quality and the game is not designed for that  yet.  The developers are quick to respond to user problems with the game, and they always have an open ear for suggestions.  Rosters and players can be edited fairly quickly, and there are literally thousands of options when designing leagues.  The learning curve for this game is fairly steep.  You can&apos;t just pick up a controller and start playing.  But if you believe in hard work equating to big rewards, then this is the game for you!  You will not be disappointed with the features.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-14/user-reviews?user_review_id=3892721">Expand</a></span>

If you kinda like baseball you will still probably love this game. The only negative to this game is that it can be overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it you won&apos;t stop playing it. Final Comment: Just get it. Its fantastic.</span>

It might not do or be absolutely everything to anyone, but it seems like every year there&apos;s at least something big and new for most. Unfortunately I don&apos;t have the time to play OOTP as much I used to, but I do recognize that it is better every year. I do worry that it might be too complicated or detailed for newcomers, but we keep seeing plenty of new people in the community so it must not be too difficult to get into. My biggest wish for the series at the moment would be for it to fully flesh out league affiliations. That was a huge feature to me a version or two ago and many of its issues were fixed, but I&apos;d just like to see affiliated leagues have separate and joint histories, awards, and all that good stuff, not just be joined in the limited manner that they are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-14/user-reviews?user_review_id=3893234">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s worth noting right off the bat that this is not your typical baseball game. There aren&apos;t graphics or animations, and you don&apos;t actually play out the games yourself. Rather, it&apos;s more of a text sim that puts you in the role of owner, manager, and coach, allowing you to build and manage every aspect of a baseball franchise in a real or fictional league. The depth of the game is enormous. You can set up a league that takes place in the current day MLB, or start in 1957 with all the proper teams and players, or simply create your own fictional league with its own structure, teams, and players. Or a fictional league with MLB players. Don&#x2019;t like minor leagues? Don&#x2019;t have them. Got a custom logo for a custom team? Upload it and the game will use it. If you want MLB logos or actual player pictures, there are free downloads for them. If you don&#x2019;t like the current playoff structure or schedule, you can edit both to suit your needs. Want to play out every game for a season? Go ahead. But if you&#x2019;d rather take the reins for a 30-year career as manager, you can do that, too. Or play for 100 years. Or 200. The game will keep generating fictional players for as long as you want to play. You can sim through a game, or a week, or a year, or manage every game on a play-by-play basis. Literally the entire game is at your fingertips, to be edited and played as you see fit.
<br>
<br>Yeah, the game has the occasional bizarre AI decision, but it&#x2019;s to be expected, just like in any strategy game, and honestly, it happens far less often than most games. The amount of work and care that goes into every iteration of the game is just phenomenal. It&apos;s a must-have for any baseball fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-14/user-reviews?user_review_id=3897258">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You can play any current major league team, or any team from any year in the past.  You can also play a fictional team in a fictional league.  You can play games out in detail, or you can &quot;fast sim&quot; any number of games at a time, from one to entire seasons.  The options are beyond your imagination  want to play a league in Thailand, where the roster size is 28, they don&apos;t use the options rule, and batting averages are high?  A little experience with the setup options, and you will be able to do exactly that.
<br>
<br>The draft and player development are quite realistic, and if you play with scouting on your personnel decisions will be just as complex as those found in real life.
<br>
<br>Lots of multi-player online leagues are available, easily located on the game&apos;s website.  I&apos;m rating the game as a whole a 9, thinking of single player.  Online mult-player is a 10+
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a text based sim, so you are not watching live action, but the player pictures are pretty good.
<br>
<br>A world of customizable stats are available, supporting very deep strategy.
<br>
<br>Downsides:
<br>1) The user interface remains somewhat less than intuitive.  You&apos;ll probably struggle with where to find things for the first hour or two.
<br>
<br>2) A few features never seem to work quite as well as the rest of the game  trading, AI opponent logic, feeder leagues.
<br>
<br>3) This is a very small operation, and, as a result, response time to technical problems can be kind of slow...  although one can get some kinds of help on the forum  but don&apos;t post blunt negatives there, the crowd on that board can be fiercely protective if they feel criticism of the game is unwarranted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-14/user-reviews?user_review_id=3894375">Expand</a></span>

OOTP is an extremely realistic baseball simulation game where you&apos;re given the option to play out each game or sim seasons at a time. You have complete control of your leagues and can do just about anything a Major League GM, commissioner, or manager could do. Buy it now and don&apos;t regret it.</span>

Don&apos;t worry about that.  The learning curve is no steeper than any other comparable game.  While you can set up your league however you want (which means lots of options to learn), there are quickstart options to get you going immediately.  From there, if you are considering buying a game of this type, then you are already expecting to spend some time with the game learning it all.  Once you get going, you&apos;re going to WANT those options.
<br>
<br>The game is quite addicting, with the effect that other &quot;just one more turn&quot; games can have.  Judging from the game&apos;s forums, people have been playing this game daily for years (granted, through several versions of the game).  Compare that to story driven games that last a couple of days to a week, or first person shoot-ems that gets boring after only a few weeks.
<br>
<br>I gave the game a 9 since there are some rough edges that could be smoothed out or implemented better.  But to be fair, I can&apos;t think of any game that&apos;s better in this genre.  If you want to finagle trades, pour over stats, and be a baseball mogul, this is absolutely your game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-14/user-reviews?user_review_id=3911489">Expand</a></span>

It is that good.  Without exaggeration, one of the most absorbing, constantly surprising, absurdly fun games I have played in any genre. Although not for the faint-hearted -- it certainly requires some patience and manual / forum reading to learn.  But once you get a sense of the sheer scope and flexibility of what you can do, you will be hooked, and astounded.  Want to manage your favorite &apos;real life&apos; MLB team? Or do you just want to GM? Or manage your favorite MLB team with entirely fictional players? Or do you want to manage in Double-A ball? Or create an entirely fictional league? Or manage the 1973 Mets? Or have independent North American, Japanese, Taiwanese, Venezuelan major leagues, where free agents can move from one league to the next? Or have high school feeder teams that provide prospects for your drafts? Or have your scouts concentrate on Cuban prospects? Eliminate the DH? Shorten the season to 156 games? Have the Rule 5 draft?    ...the list is pretty much inexhaustible. Basically, if it can be done in real baseball, it can be done in OOTP.

It takes a bit of investment but that little investment pays many dividends.  I have probably got more of my moneys worth out of this game than any other I own...and sports games are not my favorite genre!</span>

If you want to be a GM or on-field manager, this is the game for you.  This isn&apos;t a game like MLB: The Show where you will actually be playing the game as a player, it is strictly a management sim.
<br>
<br>However, if this is your type of game, it is absolutely the best at what it does.  You can play any historical season starting from 1871, and you can essentially build a new history of baseball.  You can also add any number of other leagues (Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan, for example) and play fictional or current modern day leagues as well.
<br>
<br>The databases used bring almost every single player who has ever appeared in the major leagues, and you can get other user-done databases that will bring in Negro Leaguers, old Pacific Coast Leaguers, and so many more to the table.
<br>
<br>If you are any kind of a fan of the history of baseball, or just love to manage baseball, this is the game for you.  The mod community allows you to get pretty much any team logo, uniforms, and photos and what they call FaceGen&apos;s for pretty much any player who has ever played.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t pay any attention to some of the troll reviews.  It isn&apos;t an on-the-field game, but it doesn&apos;t need to be.  Any baseball nut is missing out if they don&apos;t play this game, and they&apos;ve been making new versions for well over a decade now.  Great support AND community!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-14/user-reviews?user_review_id=3963636">Expand</a></span>
