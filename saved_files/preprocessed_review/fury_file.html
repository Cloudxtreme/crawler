The games graphics look washed out, might have something to do with the unreal 3 engine so i can see them being improved once the engine gets a fix. The game play is complex and confusing at best with fotm builds running supreme, The skill is finding the fotm build or having a friend tell you it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fury/user-reviews?user_review_id=403648">Expand</a></span>

Specifically, the graphics, the gameplay, the UI, the lag, the queue times, the myriad technical issues, the ridiculously complex proliferation of skills and gear, et cetera. Tested since Alpha. Tons of potential. None of it utilized. Simply not ready for release -- too many bugs, too little optimization. I&apos;m the target audience for the emerging CORPG genre (also a long time GW player), but the game is just premature. Pointlessly large and complex lobby is not fooling anyone -- not a meaningful persistent world, which is fine. But why 700 artificers and repairmen and skill trainers for the same skills? Too many issues resulting in too low a population to really flourish. New players are pretty much destined to get ganked by the few experienced clans remaining -- not enough people to allow the matchmaking system to really work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fury/user-reviews?user_review_id=404814">Expand</a></span>

No matter how much mouth-foaming walls of text you&apos;re going to trow to slander the game and other reviewers, the truth about it will come out. The people you call &apos;fanboys&apos; are jaded PvP gamers who are tired of the mind-numbing sugary miasma of the mainstream gaming industry and can&apos;t wait for CORPG games like GuildWars and Fury to revolutionize the market. The fact that you actually like World of Warcraft discredits any opinions you may post about PvP games. Graphics and Performance: I run the game on a Core2Duo E4300 OC system with 2GB Ram and 8800 GTS 320MB, what many will consider midrange/low-end by current standards. I play on the High-Renderer (UT3) on medium settings and get 50-60 FPS. There is a going thread on the Fury forums listing people&apos;s machines and FPS reports - and the majority can run high settings. That&apos;s despite known bugs in the code that cause lower FPS then the engine is capable of - something that&apos;s going to be ironed out in the coming patches. The Visuals in the game are on the modern level, and while you can nitpick and find occasional misses there are many more stunningly beautiful designs and views in the game. The animations are great, with some impressive details and very few mistakes you&apos;re unlikely to notice. The character designs are very theatrical - a style that emphasizes expression over realism. You&apos;re not supposed to play the game zoomed in with your character right under the lens. I enjoy playing the game as intended and watching my character run around and kick ass in intricate armor. Support Auran are probably the most community friendly developer in the CORPG/&quot;MMO&quot; market. They care about the concerns and opinions, and frequently remind everyone of their presence on the forums. Many key improvements in Fury during Beta and after Release have been derived from interaction with the gamers. What&apos;s more important they do not avoid responsibility and admit when they mess up. We get constant progress reports and they are working on making those even more accessible and detailed. No other company in the business is being this open and honest. This gives Fury a huge potential for balancing and improvement over time. Gameplay Fury is not just a fire-and-forget game release. It&apos;s a competitive PvP platform with hundreds of factors and abilities being balanced towards fun skill based gameplay. This goal is obviously impossible to achieve right after the retail release - much like GuildWars, Fury will take time to reach its full potential for skill based play and competition. Unlike other games Fury developers are 100% focused on that task without distraction from PvE carebears. Is the gameplay sufficiently deep at this point? Compared to other MMORPG&apos;s PvP - YES. Compared to the CORPG standard set by GuildWars, not yet but getting there. Most people who review the gameplay do not play with all abilities unlocked, aren&apos;t aware of the metagame, and don&apos;t compete with clans. You can&apos;t gauge the depth based on your newbie experiences, unfortunately. What I can guarantee is that there is already significant skill depth and some clans are much more skilled then others. There&apos;s a variety of ability builds you can use and roles you can play in a match (for example not every top team is running a dedicated Healer, there&apos;s a working alternative for more self sufficient damage oriented builds with the ability to alternate between offensive and defensive action. As a newbie just getting the game it will take you at least a month to reach veteran levels of understanding, and as you progress it will keep getting better balanced and diverse. There will always be something fun to discover and ways to improve your strategy and execution skills. The current best mode is Vortex because its much more about tactics and mobility and much less about nitpicking the best possible ability combo. BloodBath, the non-team FFA mode that most reviews are based on, is nothing but a for-fun arena for most. I&apos;ve you&apos;re competitive you&apos;ll find Elimination (TD) and Vortex (CTF) to be much more attractive. I could write more but getting tired. Overall I gives this game an 7 (above average) with existing problems, an easy 8 in the coming weeks as more of them get resolved, and an eventual 9 as it matures within a month or two. I&apos;m giving it 10 right now to somewhat offset to highly unfair 0 rating and shallow mainstream media reviews. Watch the reviews from TenTonHammer and Epileptic Gaming once they are released - both sites delayed them to allow the game to mature and iron-out the typical release issues. If you enjoy competitive PvP with strong emphasis on strategy and team tactics Fury is a blessing!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fury/user-reviews?user_review_id=404303">Expand</a></span>

Not enough content, overly complex archetype skills that are just the same thing with a different color X 4000. What could have been a good PVP game turned into a cheap knock off of GW pvp and WOW arena done very poorly. Horrible user interface, unbalanced skill sets, and the worst implementation of the unreal engine ever. For all the resources this pig eats up, it runs like crap and looks nowhere near as nice as the screenshots they advertise with.

This game has many bugs and issues, but Fury is trying to fix it during each patch. Slowly but at least they tried. They listen to what gamers want and try to fix the problems. Right now, the population is slowing dying because of those noob critic review who didn&apos;t even play. This is a GREAT game in the making. It&apos;s a MMO game, it takes time to fix bugs. Did WoW have no bug during the first month? A lot of bugs have been fixed for Fury and the only issue is dying population due to bad critic whom don&apos;t know what they are talking about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fury/user-reviews?user_review_id=405854">Expand</a></span>

The one or two others who rated it above 50% are from sources of questionable integrity which have a habit of artificially inflating review scores of horrible games due to advertising dollar or other corporate considerations which are not at all related to the quality of the game. For example, one professional review site which gave the Fury game a 65% score, also gave Master of Orion III -which was almost universally considered to be trainwreck (as is Fury!), - a 92% score. That score was artificially inflated by at least a 52% margin, so by applying a necessary realism standard to the Fury score from the same site, instead of the 65% score for that review clearly Fury should be worth merely 13% (65% minus the 52% artificial score inflation margin). Using knowledge like this it isn&apos;t hard to see that if all reviews about Fury were done by honest, credible reviewers, then there would be an average score for Fury of no more than 40%. So if you see a tally of average professional reviews scores of Fury scoring anything above 40%, do not believe it because that number is far too high to accurately reflect the quality of the game Fury. Thankfully, the *majority* of professional reviewers out there are honest and have integrity, and have very plainly laid out the facts that Fury is a horrible game for all smart game fans to be warned away before flushing their money down the drain by buying Fury. Fury is a very bad FPS game with melee weapons instead of guns, that pretends to be a MMO. Which it definitely is not. Think of a very badly made end-user created modification of Quake III Arena that barely runs, and only has a few mundane levels in it. And that&apos;s the entirety of the product. Then take away all of Quake III Arena&apos;s great gameplay and replace it with total crap gameplay instead. Take away the guns, and replace them with melee weapons. The end result you get from doing all that is pretty much the same thing as Fury. The only reason the metacritic user score for this game occassionally fluctuates slightly above 4/10 is because some of the (very few) players of Fury artificially inflate the score with bogus 10/10 ratings and ridiculously praiseful comments in the hopes that some poor saps will be hoodwinked into buying this very bad game. Probably in hopes that the servers don&apos;t go offline a few months down the road due lack of any incoming revenue due to hardly anyone ever buying this game. I can&apos;t say I blame the hardcore Fury players for trying to prevent that from happening even if it requires getting into the morally gray area of painting a very misrepresentative picture of the game to hoodwink new players into making a bad purchase decision. BUT, if *you* are the poor sap shelling out $50USD+ for this trainwreck, you will NOT be a happy camper if you let them trick you into doing that. Out of desperation (and because there is nothing else whatsoever good to say about Fury), some of the hardcore Fury fans who cast fake votes and write fake reviews claim that although Fury is crap now, it will magically become a good game with some future patches. We all know that is impossible. If a game at it&apos;s core, is total garbage, as Fury is, then trying to gloss over it with some shiny coats of paint can never ever fix the core issue that it is garbage in the first place. The late great Chris Farley probably said it best in the classic movie &quot;Tommy Boy&quot;: &quot;If you want I can take a crap in a box right now and write GUARANTEED on it, but all that means is that you have got a guaranteed piece of crap&quot;. Fury may by worth buying for a select few people who enjoys *receiving* sadomaschochistic pleasures. I have faith in the intelligence of you readers of this review therefore I won&apos;t even define that word for you because I know you are smart enough to understand it on your own. If you are *not* one of the select few who enjoys *receiving* sadomaschochistic pleasures, then you will be guaranteed to regret your purchase of Fury. I also know that you all are smart enough to see past the few fake reviews of Fury and recognize them for what they are. Sometimes when someone wants a game to be really good, he can inadvertently close his mind to the reality that all the game is, and all the game will ever be, is a worthless piece of trash. Most people never have, and never will buy Fury. That is why there are very few players, and zero good feedback about the game from anyone, anywhere, other than a few hardcore Fury players. It is possible that once in a while someone will be suckered into buying the game based on one of those few fake reviews or fake votes thats artificially lift the score above 4/10. But no one likes feeling like a sucker by buying a crap, almost-dead, likely-soon-to-be-dead game. *You* don&apos;t wanna be the one guy suckered into buying the game and then finding out afterwards that there is hardly anyone else playing it, it doesn&apos;t run on your system in a playable state, there is barely any content in the game yet the little content that is there is crap, and the game has no future whatsoever. Do not let this happen to you, you know you are smarter than that. :) When you *don&apos;t* waste your money on Fury, the intelligence of humankind wins the day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fury/user-reviews?user_review_id=405861">Expand</a></span>

Horrible frame rate issues. The alternative &quot;run it in low render if you want to play&quot; is a cop-out excuse for not being able to code it right. Too many bugs. Too many bugs. Too many bugs. Very poor implementation of Unreal 3 engine. The programmers probably don&apos;t understand how to code with it properly...probably just graduated from Devry i guess...only thing that can explain all the lag, stutter and the myriad of graphical issues ranging from step clipping to texture loading. Environments are uninspired...half the objects like rocks and steps are floating off the actual terrain, round pillars have invisible square corners that stop you dead and require repeated mouse clicking to get moving agin. Horrible horrible spin till you vomit camera retargeting on ability use, collision detection that will make you scream when it stops you cold in your tracks on even a simple step when you should be able to run over them...incredibly annoying. Lagging into a game after 2 minutes to find you are dead...sitting in a que for 10 minutes to play a 2 minute game...who thought this crap up? In terms of game play, its a button masher plain and simple. Anybody who tries to tell you its skill based is trying to fluff their own ego and are confusing skill with slapping 4 keys and jumping around. The user community is trash too. They dog every review on the game because the rest of the world just doesnt understand Fury. heh. According to them every commercial review is biased or is giving Fury a negative rating because Auran didn&apos;t pay for advertising...kind of paranoid is you ask me. What they should be doing is reading the riot act to the devs for releasing a boring, depth lacking, bug ridden, lagtastic, resource pig of an uninspired Guild Wars pvp ripoff. What do you get when you take everything out of guild wars except the skills and 3 pvp arenas and then implement it as badly as possible? Fury. Ugly character design. A whole bunch of armor models...and a whole bunch of ugly ugly helmets...and no hide helm option. One of the worst skill management clutterflucks ever designed. Incredibly annoying interface. Horrible chat system. Jeez how did this thing every make it out of QC. This game is going to be history in 6 months. Servers will be shut down and nobody, not even the in denial fanboys like Tenet LotD who will do there best to pitch this travesty as the second coming of electronic battleship will be playing. This is a crap game. The Gamespot review is spot on. I would have given it a 3 but i am giving it a zero to counter the fanboys who come in here and give this game a 10 knowing full well this game is a disaster and doesn&apos;t deserve anything above 4 or even a 5 if you are being generous. Anyway, as evidenced by the incredibly low sales, non existant internet interest and super low in-game population, nobody is buying the manure Tenet and other 10 rating fanboys are trying to sell. Game buyers are too savey now adays. They know when a game is reviewed horribly and suddenly a bunch of 10s show up in the reader reviews that they are plants planted by devs or fanboys. btw, there were so many complaints and &quot;I Cant get this game to work&quot; threads in the tech help forums they shut them down and are now &quot;feeding all tech issues through their customer service&quot; so that you know, nobody knows that there are problems. Ofcourse if you have a problem with this game they just tell you its your computer/connection/imagination and that everyone else runs it fine. You know when they say &quot;reformat your hard drive and reinstall windows&quot; that they are hoping you give up and go away with your complaints.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fury/user-reviews?user_review_id=404533">Expand</a></span>

First do not listen to any of the reviews that give this game anything over a 5. Those 9s and 10s are from the fanboys on the Fury forums who are trying desperately to stem the negative press for this monstrosity of a half finished game. Listen, you work hard for your money, so don&apos;t throw it away on a thinly conceptualized game thats incomplete, poorly designed and is constantly making excuses for why it doesnt work the way it should. If you go to the Fury forums you will see the fanboys screaming constantly about how even wow had problems when it was released. The Hubris of comparing this turkey to World of Warcraft is beyond comprehension. Horrible interface with one of the most cluttered and ungainly skill selection designs ever made. 400 skills times 10 ranks of each giving you 4000 skills...right...in actuality those 400 skills are across 8 archetypes and the majority of them are rehashed recolored variants of each other with a good bulk of them being throw away skills you will never use. Limited game types...only three arenas currently and none of them are very interesting or have long lasting appeal. If you are not in a clan forget Vortex or Elimination as you will just spend your time getting ganked. And Bloodbath, the only viable solo arena is hardly ever enabled due to bugs, lack of players and a host of other issues. The game is a time sink but unlike WOW where you time sink and grind for gold gear etc, this game actively tries to sell you in game gold via the developers. They have no shame, first they rip you off for 50$ for the game, then they try and rip you off for another 50 or so to unlock all abilities, charge you a monthly fee if you want to have extra rolls on loot or run faster in the lobby (and the game consists of one big lobby when not in the limited arenas), and then they try and sell you gold to let you buy the ridiculously overpriced items in game or skill levels if you havent bought the UAA. Oh yes you can also pay hefty amounts of gold to color your hair - 25g for blue. The game is bug ridden, lag is constantly a problem, and unless you have a supercomputer you are going to find this game practically unplayable. The nimimum specs listed are really a joke. you wont play the game like that. And even a lot of people with high end systems still experience lag and everyone experiences the many many bugs in this game. They keep saying oh we are fixing it changes are coming etc, but i heard the same thing during the 2 months of beta testing and the game was pushed to release with a lot of the bugs in place. They continually fall back on &quot;well no game is perfect at release not even WOW.&quot; Well, i say, there is a limit to how many excuses you are allowed to make for why something is subpar and not worth purchasing. Look the fact of the matter is that this game which is based on the Unreal 3 engine is a resource hog, but unlike games such as BIOSHOCK which is also based on the Unreal 3 engine, this game is one of the worst implenetations of that engine imaginable. The graphics look horrible. The physics are choppy and highly suspect, the character animations are stale and jerky. And Lag only makes all of this even more annoying. You may wonder how the heck this game can use so much of your system resources but still look and play like crap...well...you are not alone in asking that question. Really had high hopes for this game, but its just a stale rip off of Guild Wars PVP, poorly designed, horribly implemented, and destined to end up in the bargain bin in 2 months and shut down in under a year. Its not complex, or skill based. Its a button mashing lag fest with Flavor of the Month builds dominating. The player base is horribly small and there is a reason...this game has turned a huge number of players off and has incredibly bad word of mouth on the street. Is all the bad press deserved? After betatesting this game for almost 2 months and playing it since release i can guarantee that its negative reputation and horrible owrd of mouth is very well deserved. If you just cant abide WOW any longer and you really want a fantasy pvp option, save your money for Warhammer or Age of Conan. If you waste your money on this you will only have yourself to blame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fury/user-reviews?user_review_id=403988">Expand</a></span>

I think I understand why the early reviewers gave this game such horribly bad ratings. Basically when this game first came out it was apparently a god-awful piece of crap. However after many numerous patches and updates the game has vastly improved. This game reminds me of Guild Wars minus the pve elements, and on top of that it has a WoW user interface. Being that this game was developed on the Unreal Tournament 3 engine things like knocking someone off a cliff are possible, and ragdoll physics as well can be very impressive. Basically as said previously Fury is an entirely pvp focused game, which for me is a very good thing. However I realize that players like myself are apparently in the minority and therefore I can understand why many people flat out hate what this game stands for. I tell it like it is though, and I must admit this game still has annoyances and needs polishing. (Auction house interface, abilities interface, etc.) Also, there is a small player base which is probably a detriment for an mmo. Even with all the cons, Fury has some of the best pvp I&apos;ve seen in an mmo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fury/user-reviews?user_review_id=411263">Expand</a></span>
