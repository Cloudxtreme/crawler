With strong guides to the game and an encouraging online community with high involvement by its developers, new players can benefit from the wealth of knowledge only if they are willing to learn. Once initiated and educated in the mechanics of the game, you will be sufficiently rewarded with a survival horror game that sells on the high replayability aspect of Multiplayer.
<br>
<br>If online co-op mulitplayer is your cup of tea, do yourself a favor. Give this game a look and buy it.
<br>
<br>I am a fan of survival horror and co-operative team-based games and will be explaining this review based on my experiences. The idea of The Red Solstice stems from the ficitonal future where humanity lost Earth to a deadly virus and now inhabits Mars.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>
<br>A top down shooter where players control a single marine at any given time, using keyboard for navigate, camera, skill and inventory management and mouse for aiming and shoot. A simple setup but works really well given the game operates in real-time mostly and with fast fingers on a keyboard, you&apos;ll find yourself in better control of the flow of game.
<br>
<br>The game utilises a countdown timer and wave system to signal incoming waves of enemies that spawns at specific timings. From the start of a game, weak enemies such as zombies would spawn and time progresses, the subsequent waves would feature a variety of dangerous enemies that are capable of single-handedly wiped out a team if they are not prepared.
<br>
<br>Generic survival horror mechanics such as scavenging for items, ammo control are also important to survive beyond the first 10 minutes of a game.
<br>
<br>Single Player
<br>
<br>Follows the event that the virus outbreak occurs on a colony named Tharsis, with Tyler Hunt and his team being sent in to investigate. Here an exclusive game mechanic called Tactical Mode slows down time in game by 90% (aka 1 sec in reality = 10 secs in-game) allowing you to assume control your squad of marines. Since it is single player, you are the commander of the team and its individuals at all times where you can switch to otherwise ai controlled followers in Tactical Mode to access their inventories, skills, etc.
<br>
<br>The overall campaign is based on set events that are in place over the maps that you play but you will decide how to accomplish them. A simple description would be a sandbox style where player can employ multiple approaches to the objectives.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer
<br>
<br>This segment continues where single player campaign ends and a squad of generic marines controlled by players are sent in to follow Tyler Hunt&apos;s footsteps. In this segment, player gain experience and rank up to unlock additional classes, skills and equipment to carry into battle.
<br>
<br>Players are also treated with the sandbox style of freedom in approaching objectives and the type of objectives and their locations are randomly generated so every other game feels different. On top of that there are additional game settings such as increasing drop rate of waves, shortening time between waves  that can be selected before the start of a game so players can test themselves in various ways.
<br>
<br>Here, communications between members and leaders are crucial to be effective in the game as you no longer have a say in what other players choose to do. (Eg. Fail to ask for healing, you&apos;re gonna have a bad time) While team leaders are able chart routes to take and issue simple commands, there is an unofficial team speak channel at present maintained by one of the veteran players so players can speak to one another instead of using the in game chat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-red-solstice/user-reviews?user_review_id=5377338">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is hard because you can get overwhelmed, its easy to mismanage time and ammo, and the smallest mistake can snowball into a death situation. What do I mean by this?
<br>
<br>*Its easy to get distracted by loot, or a room, and get split off and overwhelmed.
<br>*Things get crazy, and friendly fire blows up your teammates.
<br>
<br>The game is really fun, and the community seems decent. However, the game involves a lot of running around and can be quite hard.
<br>
<br>I  give it a 7 because its a great game, but I dont think EVERYONE is going to like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-red-solstice/user-reviews?user_review_id=5377697">Expand</a></span>

<br>Some things are done amazingly good, some not so much.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving it a solid 7, but if everything dev team promised is true, I will re-evaluate this review in 6 months time and raise or lower the score accordingly. Decent game with room for improvement.</span>

<br>If you&apos;re not sure about The Red Solstice, try it. You have Steam refunds now, so you can look at it like a demo. It&apos;s not an easy game, so it might not be for everyone. It is for me, I&apos;m sure of it. ;)

<br>P.S. The atnosphere in the game is amazing. And I think Hollywood horror movie amazing!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-red-solstice/user-reviews?user_review_id=5375735">Expand</a></span>

<br>Very active and responsive on forums, you can&apos;t often see dev team palying with their players, even organizing those events. Kudos to Ironward for being on of the coolest dev teams I&apos;ve ever seen. The game itself is very hard and for people like me, it took some time to get a hang of it, but nevertheless, this game is amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-red-solstice/user-reviews?user_review_id=5375724">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As for the game itself, it&apos;s challenging, even for hardcore players, at least until you get used to controls and micromanaging your squad. Tactical mode which acts like 90% slowed time is really useful in dynamic combat but it&apos;s not available in multiplayer which separates this game in two halves.
<br>
<br>Singleplayer is not too hard. You can pause the game, you can decide which marine will go where and what h will do. Story is decent and it slowly  leads you to multiplayer.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is happening after single player timeline so it&apos;s good to finish SP first, but MP is much, much harder. You can play it in Survival mode with bots on your side, or standard multiplayer with your friends. Word of advice - Get teamspeak, this is very tactical combat and if you&apos;re not perfectly organized your intestines will be scattered all around Mars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-red-solstice/user-reviews?user_review_id=5375765">Expand</a></span>

But once the new shiny luster wears a little the game is repetitive enough that you can play by a stopwatch it just takes a while to see it. Variety of primary and secondary weapons is flat, beyond underwhelming and just disappointing. And the locations of everything is varied but otherwise gameplay again... is just too repetitive. But these are just two minor insignificant problems, the community is the real problem. Or rather to be more specific... the lack of community is the problem. This game depends on a player base to be playable let alone enjoyable. And that is the one thing that this game is lacking, so as a result the wait times for matches on off peak hours is horrible.

<br>Do not get me wrong, the game can be some fun if you are in a good group, or have friends that play. But I have found that I am enjoying the company more then the game to the point that we could be playing anything and having just as much fun if not more. But if ever comes closer to 10 dollars, and you go in with at least 6 friends so you can play consistently. then I might recommend it  but only if you watched a few hours of gameplay. Its not good but its not bad either, its just meh. An eclectic title for a niche audience that either loves this title or is indifferent to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-red-solstice/user-reviews?user_review_id=5410567">Expand</a></span>

Negative reviews I&apos;ve heard so far are mainly due to hard difficulty, which is definately NOT a minus. The game has three mods, single player story, survival and multiplayer, plenty of content, scary atmosphere and good community.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving 8 to the game and 1 extra for kind and responsive devs.</span>
