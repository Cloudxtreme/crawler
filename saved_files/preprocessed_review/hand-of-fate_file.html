Its more something that you play for 1 round and look at what failed and try again, maybe adjust your deck. And its surprisingly addictive. Much of the game is luck but the combat is mostly skill. There are couple of times when a specific just would destroy me but after the third time you figure out how to fight against them.
<br>
<br>And while there is not a clear story, there are subtle hints of an over arching plot and the world which I find very interesting. Also each level complete with different restrictions and curses really made each play through unique.  A really awesome sword against the Rat court might have no place in a deck against the skeleton king.

I can&apos;t quite give it a 10, but it&apos;s already a very well done game that can be built upon with sequels.  It combines ARPG with deck-building, and adds in a rogue-like element.  They were smart to make the different genres of the game fairly simple, as it is the first time these genres have really been mixed this way.  And this game is definitely more than the sum of its parts.
<br>
<br>The Pros:
<br>-All parts of the game are well built, if not absolutely perfect.  You won&apos;t get the feeling that they just threw in one part of the game for filler.
<br>-Good voice acting.
<br>-A fairly good progression of power.
<br>
<br>The Cons:
<br>-A little bit too random.  This is something you can counteract by knowing each card well and building your deck accordingly, but this is probably the #1 complaint in this game.
<br>-The endgame doesn&apos;t scale very well, so the replayability goes down a good bit.  There&apos;s not much of a reason to repeat the story.  There is an endless dungeon, but it&apos;s fairly easy to get extremely powerful quickly, and then hit a wall later.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d say this is a well made, simple to play game, but with depth you will enjoy.  It&apos;s one that I&apos;ve recommended to my friends, and I don&apos;t recommend many games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5070184">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is a well crafted, generally aesthetically pleasing game that has obviously had some exceptionally artistic talent behind it.
<br>
<br>I find the cross of card game/3rd person scrapper to be a pretty decent mix and all told, playing the game is actually a pleasant experience that is both engaging in content and can be as rewarding as it is punishing. Expect the gameplay to get instantly harder beyond the second round if you win, because from that point on it does get difficult if you happen to be unlucky. Doesn&apos;t mean to say you shouldn&apos;t get it! That&apos;s part of the challenge of the game and for once it does a game justice to play things out as such!
<br>
<br>Even if your main style of preferred game is FPS or racing or some such, this is a good game for those wanting to try something different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5044904">Expand</a></span>

So</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Hand of Fate is a mix-up between a Card Game, a Tabletop and a 3rd Person ARPG in this particular order.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for pure action, pure story and choice driven games, or a complex deck building game, Hand of Fate is not for you.
<br>But if you enjoy all of the genres mentioned above, you will find a unique game providing just the right amount of everything packed together!
<br>
<br>So what is Hand of Fate about? You build different kinds of decks compiling different kinds of cards, items, encounters and so on. Depending which cards you choose the story you play will change, and your character progression does too. There are cards that will give you more benefits then others, and the beauty of it, is finding out what those cards actually do, because once you acquire them, the effect of those cards are unknown until you encounter them.
<br>This makes it exiting to progress and reveal every card on the game board. While doing so you have to manage your resources, food, health and gold. There are also little things like buffs, but I will let you find out about that on your own.
<br>
<br>Some encounters require you to fight monsters/bosses, which are fairly different encounters which require different tactics. This happens in the 3D 3rd Person ARPG style part of the Game. Don&apos;t expect to much complexity here. Its simple, yet its fun, much like Assassins Creed or the Batman games.
<br>The Endless Mode allows for multiple Playthroughs, which alter your adventure depending on the cards you choose.
<br>
<br>The overall difficulty of Hand of Fate is always fair, and never seemed to easy or to hard.
<br>
<br>All of this is packed and created with the Unity Engine. Which does a beautiful job of maintaining a modern and immersive look, yet its not &quot;next gen&quot; like AAA titles out there.
<br>
<br>You cannot expect much about the overall Story here, its about creating your own personal adventure by choosing different cards and unlocking more.
<br>The musics and overall sound/narration is well done, the card dealer is exceptionally voice over.
<br>
<br>Couldn&apos;t find any bugs so far. That doesn&apos;t happen very often!
<br>
<br>If i would have to rate the different components of this game, I would rate it:
<br>
<br>-Graphics: 8/10
<br>-Sound: 9/10
<br>-Balance: 8/10
<br>-Atmosphere: 10/10
<br>-Controls: 9/10
<br>-Size: 8/10
<br>-Design: 8/10
<br>-K.I for fights: 5/10
<br>-Story: 7/10
<br>
<br>Total of 8 rounded.
<br>
<br>Price of 20 $ atm for what it offers to its targeted audience only make Hand of Fade recommendable in my opinion. I was sceptic at first, but was presently surprised.
<br>
<br>Hope this helps people to decide whether to get it or not. I don&apos;t regret my decision so far. Doesn&apos;t happen very often lately ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5007539">Expand</a></span>

The core premise of the game is a RPG and CCG rolled up into one.  The RPG aspect stems from gaining abilities and equipment as you play and explore the card dungeon.  Each move/step you make on the board consumes one unit of food and restores a bit of health.  Without food, you lose health as you move each space.  The equipment you earn as you play upgrades your damage, increases your defense with armor, or unlocks abilities such as gold, food, or healing bonuses in somewhat typical RPG fashion.  At the end of each floor of the dungeon is either a boss, or a travel card that takes you to the next level and a fresh floor to traverse.
<br>
<br>This is where the CCG aspect takes over.  The dungeon floor is made up of individual cards from an event deck that you build, all placed face down.  No microtransactions here, as you advance through the various levels, you earn and collect tokens during events and boss fights which unlock new cards for you to use.  If you are not the deck building type, you can also select to have the computer automatically assemble the equipment and event decks that you need for each dungeon/boss run.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay, every move you make with your figure from one card to the next flips the card face up and triggers an event, either combat or non-combat.  The non-combat events can range from a multiple choice event with a &quot;four card monte&quot; mini game that decides if you pass or fail (sometimes epically), or travelers like merchants and healers where you can use earned gold to buy items from your equipment deck, or more food if needed.  Some of these events can be skipped if you don&apos;t feel like risking health, food, or gold for whatever reward may be in store.
<br>
<br>The combat events are the most straight-forward, and unfortunately where most of the faults lie.  Combat works very similar to the most recent Batman series of games, with green lines indicating an attacker can be countered by pushing &quot;Q&quot;, or red lines indicating the attack can&apos;t be countered and should be dodged by using the Space Bar to roll.  You also throw in ranged attackers as the game progresses with attacks that can be reflected or dodged.  The problem is that there isn&apos;t nearly the level of camera control and attack precision that you find in the Arkham series, you often find yourself rolling in the wrong direction and/or swinging at air.  With multiple ranged enemies, this can sometimes make the combat feel more frantic and frustrating.
<br>
<br>Your equipment also plays a roll in how combat works: no shield, no counter.  This makes the event deck building both a critical and fun piece as it sprinkles in the dynamic aspect of a rouge-like game, but does allow you to control more of the results as opposed to being completely random.  Before you think you can min/max your event deck to an easy victory though, the masked man across the table (Think D&amp;D Dungeon Master and Card Dealer) throws in some of his own cards to keep things interesting.
<br>
<br>Overall a very fun game with a good amount of replay value, slightly hampered by a less than stellar combat experience.  Combat flaws aside, I highly recommend picking up a copy of this RPG/CCG/Action Brawler/Rogue-like mashup game.

<br>
<br>At its core - the game is a game of choices. Choose your path, choose your events etc. .
<br>
<br>However - it is the choices that i have a problem with. Many of the choices are resolved by blindly picking one card out of a shuffled stack of 4 - which is fine - in a way... but the game pretends that there is kind of a choice to start with. Some game simulate the shuffling of cards so that a very quick eye actually has a chance tracking the correct card. Hand of Fate however does not give you that chance - so picking a card manually is rather random and henceforth redundant.
<br>
<br>The brawler part - the combat - is Batman Arkham style and quite well done ... but very simplified. That makes it short and fun at first - but does not offer much variety. The enemy AI is about on mmorpg levels ( meaning it is pathetic if you can call it AI at all ), the combat arenas - while visually varied enough - do not offer much in terms of making use of the environment ( with the exception of traps .. but there are no bottlenecks or other terrain features to really use )
<br>It would have been very beneficial for the combat to allow for more tactics and play styles ( like ranged, sneaked or melee )
<br>
<br>Then there are the trap dungeons which require the player to pass a dungeon of traps of increasingly higher difficulty - which is fun but turns more and more into a chore.
<br>
<br>On the bright side however - the game has a very good UI with its card style, great voice acting and overall - a very good design.
<br>I would describe it as a &quot;jack of all traits, master of none&quot; as it tries so many things - and actually does them fairly well.... .
<br>
<br>But is it worth the money / trying it out? - yes ... certainly... it is enjoyable and appeals to many players. It showcases very well how a &quot;tabletop&quot; game makes use of the capabilities of a PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5024690">Expand</a></span>

Hand Of Fate, does require quite a few plays through before you can really exploit the many layers this game has.

<br>
<br>But once you know whats going on, this is a very thought provoking experience which really got my imagination going.
<br>
<br>I had a moment while token hunting where I just walked past starving children because I had other plans for my whole sackload of food.
<br>
<br>Sounds horrible, buts its just a pretend card in a video game.
<br>The children arent real and yet, there is the games power.
<br>You are forced to make choices, to juggle your resources and risk all, for often the smallest gain.
<br>
<br>Its hard.
<br>And you are meant to die.
<br>And yet you come back, again and again.
<br>
<br>The more you win.
<br>The harder it gets!
<br>
<br>Dont expect a cake walk.
<br>This is a fight.
<br>Both using strategy,
<br>And your reflexes when the game goes into 3rd person battle mode.
<br>
<br>I look forward to seeing more reviews of this excellent game.

<br>
<br>It&apos;s a card game, based on luck and chance, but you can adjust the odds a bit, since you build your deck. This deck then provides you with the dungeonmap (randomly selected from your &apos;encounter&apos;-cards. You can get rewards and equipements from your deck as well. But it remains all chance and the dungeon might sometimes be quite annoying, and sometimes too easy.
<br>
<br>Combat is done via opponent picking (chance as well), but the combat itself is quite nice. Not really hard, but you can dodge and block like most games. Different enemies require different tactics, and you can sometimes make use of the traps on the field. Pretty nice. Big drawback of the combat is the camera. The freaking camera... You cannot control it, yet it makes you blind on some parts of the battlefield. Especially in so called &apos;trap-mazes&apos;, your view can be blocked in a way where you must move towards the camera, and therefor cannot see anything. Quite frustrating that camera-issues still exist in 2015.
<br>If the camera was tiltable/turnable it would recieve much higher grades, but it just makes the game seem too oldfashioned and unfinished.
<br>
<br>The good thing that stands out is the many variety of the game&apos;s dungeons. Since you make a deck which creates your dungeon, you can try different settings to get the most challenging, or most easy difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5006653">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m almost finishing (trying to get the dagger) and I will keep playing after that, because that endless mode really put some quality replay value.
<br>So, imo you should really give it a try, I totally recommend it!</span>

You play against an NPC in a game of cards but you are also the hero of a story controlled by those cards. The card decks that you, and the dealer, build control what equipment you end up with, what rewards you may win and what encounters you have. Some cards will give you a boon, others a curse.
<br>
<br>To play it is really quite simple. You build an equipment deck and an encounter deck, modified by the dealer. You draw a hand from the equipment deck and the dealer draws from the encounter deck. Your hand shows you what gear you are using, while the dealers hand shapes and populates the &#x2018;dungeon&#x2019; the hero traverses. Sometimes encounters involve interaction with NPCs, some where you have to make a choice and at other times you may end up in combat. Combat is where the game changes from a CCG to an action game. Throughout the game there will be instances requiring you to draw a card which may give you a reward, a power boost or a debuff of some kind.
<br>
<br>You have two resources to manage through the game. The first is Food, which is used whenever the hero moves to a new card, to recover Health and used in some encounters. The second is Gold, which is used to buy Food, equipment and also in some encounters. Don&#x2019;t run out of Food or you will starve to death. An ignoble way for a hero to snuff it.
<br>
<br>On the pro side of things, this game has a tremendous amount of replay value. Since each &#x2018;dungeon&#x2019; is randomly built each time you play, there is little chance you will get the same experience twice. In addition, being able to choose, most, of the cards that go into the encounter deck means you can influence the dungeon to the type of game you feel like having. RNG and the dealers additions to the deck ensure you cannot predict exactly what you&#x2019;ll get however.
<br>The game allows for strategic thinking as well. Loading your equipment deck with cards suited for the kind of encounter deck you&#x2019;re facing puts you in a better position to win. But again, RNG can (and does) mix things up.
<br>
<br>There are some cons to the game. A bad draw can result in your character suffering huge debuffs, turning easy encounters into true trials. This is even worse if the bad draw is early on, forcing you to play through the rest of that game with a handicap. On the flip side, some encounters, even Bosses, can be made trivial.
<br>Combat can become a bit dull after a while as you always have the same actions through the game. Some variety in combat style would be welcome here.
<br>
<br>Overall however, this game is great. The play is imaginative, the aesthetic is great to look at, the music suits it very well and the dealer is just the right mix of sardonic and smug that makes you want to beat him at his own game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5081004">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Bref, cet ersatz de jeu devient vite r&#xE9;p&#xE9;titif et d&#xE9;suet, d&apos;autant que les combats sont en temps r&#xE9;el et se r&#xE9;sument &#xE0; de pauvres &quot;tape-tape-tape&quot; sans aucun int&#xE9;r&#xEA;t dans quelques d&#xE9;cors b&#xE2;cl&#xE9;s et des graphismes 256 couleurs.

The random encounters are exactly like choose-your-own-adventure books, and I loved those books. Though you can get **** hard by RNG, that is what RNG is there for after all.
<br>
<br>Now, the downsides are abysmal load times that come up after every tiny thing happens in the game. It also seems extremely consolized, and the interface is buggy and inconsistent to use with a mouse. Sometimes clicking will do one thing, and sometimes something completely different. Even trying to just point the mouse at a card doesn&apos;t always work properly.
<br>The third person action bits are also not very fun. It&apos;s extremely simple, but still somehow feels buggy occasionally, like when an enemy slashes at the air from one side of the arena and still hits you, or when the counter button decides not to do anything. I think it would work better with some actual camera control, and more control over the character himself.
<br>
<br>My problems with the game could easily be fixed in a future patch, and if they are, I&apos;d bump my score up to a 7 or maybe even 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5020818">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphics: 10/10
<br>- Very well done considering this was made with the Unity Engine!
<br>- Framerates are better than the console versions
<br>
<br>Gameplay: 10/10
<br>- Original and Unique
<br>
<br>Story: 9/10
<br>- The dealer is your best friend and worst enemy, you never really know.
<br>
<br>Price: $20USD - Very fairly priced - this game almost feels like a AAA game.
<br>
<br>This game is already amazingly fun to play and I would have no issue paying 5-10 dollars for a decently sized expansion DLC.
<br>
<br>To all you Diablo fans and dungeon hunters - this game is a must! The card game aspect may seem boring but you will forget you&apos;re playing a card game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5041540">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve heard a lot of praise about the dealer and his interactions with the player, but ultimately I am not impressed. The dialogue gets boring quickly, and all he ever does is berate the player. This combined with RNG elements that hinder you 80% of the time and benefit you the other 20% make this game more frustrating than enjoyable. The diversity in the cards is boring. There is literally only one card in this entire game that does not have any backlash. Every other card in the game tries to screw you over, and deck building thus becomes irrelevant to the overall experience. The &quot;Arkham-style&quot; combat is broken, redundant, sometimes ridiculously easy and other times ridiculously difficult. I almost finished the game when I realized that it was an okay game, but not so good that it was even worth finishing. If I wanted this much RNG in a game I&apos;d go back to playing Diablo 3</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5117857">Expand</a></span>

I have never played anything that comes even close to this game. The best comparison is dungeons and dragons. You play on a board, where the entire board is made out of cards you can choose yourself. These cards are called &apos;encounters&apos;, and every encounter gives you multiple options to get past them. Most of them, chance. For instance, whenever you land on the encounter &apos;a wife&apos;s fury&apos; you run into an angry woman, whose husband is out, drinking. She asks you to confront him. You&apos;re being given the choice whether to do so, or let her deal with it. If you choose the latter, you can go on your way, but, you&apos;ll be given a curse.
<br>If you choose to confront him, you&apos;ll find out that her husband, is none other than one of the bosses in the game. Again, you&apos;ll be given two options. Either to threaten him, or to join his drinking game. Both of these options have a chance of succes, or failure. Whatever happens after that, you&apos;ll have to find out.
<br>
<br>Interesting enough, it&apos;s not just a boardgame. Whenever you encounter an enemy, you suddenly find yourself into an action-brawl area, where you have to fight them, similar to the batman series (attack/counter/stun buttons + special moves). Because of this, it never gets boring, and it doesn&apos;t all depend on luck.
<br>
<br>The game, however, has one huge issue. It is filled with bugs. Most of the bugs aren&apos;t all that noticable when you play the story mode, but in endless mode, the game mode you unlock after beating the story mode, is barely playable. The further you get, the harder it becomes to battle your way through not the game itself, but the bugs. As if the game itsn&apos;t challenging enough, it has to kill you in the cheapest way possible. Other bugs, however, are easily exploited and make the online scoreboard very unreliable.
<br>
<br>Almost any game I&apos;d rate with a 4 or 5 out of 10. It is one thing to have those bug in alpha/beta, but this game has been going for quite some time and it&apos;s ridiculous it&apos;s still in it. However, this game is something special. Despite the bugs, it still makes me want to play, over, and over again. No matter how  frustrated I become, because some cheap bug killed me, after an hour I want to play again. In bed, I can&apos;t help but think about the game, wanting to play.
<br>
<br>Overall, I rate this game 8 out of 10. I hope hand of fate 2 will be less of an bug fest, but for now, I&apos;ll enjoy being number 3 on the scoreboard without cheating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hand-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=6400636">Expand</a></span>

Has a lot of potential, but for me some annoying designs made it frustrating at the end. I feel it poorly prepares you for a big spike in difficulty at the end. Still worth a look.</span>
