The art is very pretty and simple so it can work even on older PCs and laptops. The concept is interesting but poorly executed. You can design your own star-ships with different weapons and attachments, but most need to be unlocked first and don&apos;t do much but perform slightly better than previous iterations. no huge weapon variety either it is mostly lasers, missiles and ion weapons. DLC races don&apos;t have much differences except cosmetic slight stat changes and a few unique weapons. During battles you can&apos;t really tell what is working and what isn&apos;t or what kind of weapons the enemy has. After battles there are charts you can look at but don&apos;t really explain much. It tells you your best and worst ships and weapons but doesn&apos;t go into much detail so it&apos;s kind of useless. Pretty much the only way to win is to just throw lots of cruisers and one or two frigates at the enemy but that doesn&apos;t get you much reward to improve your ships and still suffers massive casualties to an apparently inferior enemy fleet.. Also campaign mode is a paid DLC which seems kind of stupid to me.

The &quot;game&quot; is really more like a tweaker&apos;s battle simulation paradise, but I agree with many of the other comments here that it&apos;s difficult to to understand during battle what is working or what isn&apos;t  so a lot of the time I found my guessing what might work when I re-outfit and redeploy my ships.  I came to feel like I was often just experimenting and pressing &quot;go&quot; for the battle to see what would happen rather than having solid expectations that what I&apos;d done was an improvement or not.  So I&apos;d guess I&apos;d say the game could use a better user feedback mechanism so we&apos;d know what&apos;s working or not.  I enjoyed the time I put into the game to learn the dynamics (probably about 20 hours at this point), but even as I unlocked more stuff it seemed to increase the amount of tweaking possibilities instead of clarify what I was doing with my ship builds.
<br>
<br>That said, I did like the game, but I&apos;m just not drawn back to at this point which disappoints me.  It&apos;s an interesting battle simulator w/ nice graphics and humor.  Another plus for the game is a good community on the developer&apos;s website which is filled with tips for players wishing to improve their builds, tactics, and formations.  The game has it&apos;s frustrating moments  particularly ships getting all jammed up together  and my ability to find only limited use for certain entire classes of ships  like the frigate.  To a degree all the tweaking trying to get usable frigates derailed me from the game because I sortof played myself out trying to find decent uses for the ship  and it seems they are limited compared to larger cruisers.
<br>
<br>Be aware also that while new DLC is still being released  it can also limit the online aspects of the game for those that don&apos;t keep up with the DLC  it can be a two edged sword if you just want to try out the base version of the game first.
<br>
<br>So who should get this?  If you want a space battle simulator that let&apos;s you tweak tweak tweak your fleet  this is your game.  If this sounds like it could get to be a little bit &quot;samey&quot; over time  well, that&apos;s my feeling.  Fun while it lasted, but it just doesn&apos;t draw me back for more tweaking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gratuitous-space-battles/user-reviews?user_review_id=2934330">Expand</a></span>

The latter two difficulties need much more thought, but it tends to feel repetitive after a while. Lots of graphical and musical polish, with a sense of humor to boot. It&apos;s worth getting if you appreciate a Star Trek-styled Tower Defense game.</span>

Players set up their fleets from designing individual ships from a huge selection of subsystems to setting up strategies, formations and orders. Then all that is left is to push &apos;play&apos; and watch a magnificent space battle unfold on its own without the players&apos; control.</span>

Why i say this : 1.No Tactics are needed (*No* enemy AI) ,so the &quot;strategy&quot; always boils down to droppin one big ball of ships on one side of the battlefield and a cheap decoy on the other. 2. Design possibilities are pretty limited. First,all slots are assigned to one kind of item (weapons or Equipment). There is hardly ever a reason not to equip as many weapons as you can,and the weapons essentially only differ in being either antishield or antiarmor. The normal slots must usually be filled with the needed stuff (power stations,crew quarters,armor,shields,maybe 1 or more engines which dont make much difference in speed),which leaves even larger ships with few empty slots for specials. Ah yes,one can buy upgrades,which boils down to the same weapons firing a bit faster,the armor is a bit thicker,no game changers here. Then the game has no background story,no campaign,no immersion whatsoever. The Graphics are 2d but nice But this game gets very boring,very quickly. There is simply nothing to do,to experience or to control.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gratuitous-space-battles/user-reviews?user_review_id=739974">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s it. You are not allowed to participate in anything else. There are many unlockables and such, but this does very little to make the bare bones game enjoyable. There is no storyline, nor a campaign of any description. The game provides the player with so-called scenarios, and all that means is that the developers arranged the enemy ships in a grid. Once again, that&apos;s it. There is not much else besides that. You may also unlock a few other races, and each race has about a dozen &quot;scenarios&quot; (if I can even continue to refer to them as such). Each component that could be equipped for each of your ships has different descriptions , but they do not impact the overall performance of the ships in any significant way, nor do they alter the player&apos;s overall game play experience. Each and every time you go into battle, is almost a near perfect repetition of the last attempt, with very little variation, if any at all. Each of the races do not provide the player with true alternatives in order for them to actually be considered unique or different from each other. There is absolutely no action, nor climax in any of the battle instances you may go through as you play the game. It is like watching a limited and basic screen saver, over and over again, with very subtle differences each time. Even if you unlock all the hulls/components and implement them in ship design, there is barely any noticeable performance difference in the battles. It is as if nothing changes. In addition, the game does not inform nor hint at the effectiveness of any of the components you will have available to equip your ships. The AI is also comparable to that of a screen saver, in every describable way. There also appears to be no sound effects whatsoever, besides the ever repeating music. A representative from the developer named &quot;cliffski&quot; can be found in the Gratuitous Space Battles Steam forums being arrogant, pompous, and rude towards others who have a negative opinion about the game. At the time of this writing, the developers are asking for $20 for the game, and an additional $37 for six DLCs. There is basically very little content here, for an irregular and exorbitant amount of money. I have never come across such an exaggerated difference between content and pricing prior to this shameful release. This is completely unacceptable and despicable, and developers such as these should not be supported in any way, shape, or form. It is with releases such as Gratuitous Space Battles that we see proof of very low quality and very low content getting worse and worse. This game is comparable to adjusting the settings of a screen saver, then watching it run. There is very little actual game play to be found in Gratuitous Space Battles. If you like screen savers, you may want to give this displeasing, limited, uncreative, and meager attempt at a game a try. I hope you have a CRT monitor so that this glorified and expensive screen saver could actually become useful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gratuitous-space-battles/user-reviews?user_review_id=2293168">Expand</a></span>

There are a ton of space strategy games, but this one takes a completely fresh and (imho) fascinating approach by removing battle-control entirely and making it really a game of fleet design and real strategy, rather than frantic tactical mouse clicking. The real key to getting the most from the game is to go back after you have won and try to design the smallest, cheapest fleet possible, but which can still achieve victory. The game is a tinkerers heaven, and the frankly excellent graphics are just the icing on top.

There&apos;s a good variety of weapons, armor, shields, power plants, etc, to give you plenty of options, but not so many it get&apos;s overwhelming. Great replay value, I love trying out new ship designs and playing the online challenges. The only big letdown is the online play. One would think you pit your fleets against others in a live online game,, with allies or in a free-for all mode, one instead plays against fleets that other people have saved and uploaded online. While not horrible, it adds little to the game. A great bonus you rarely see, is a game with NO loading points, not even upon start-up, no unskippable cut scenes, and a game designer that not only listens to people&apos;s suggestions, but implements them in patches that actually add content, not just fix bugs (though it looks like this game will have an expansion pack coming out for it that will cost money.) You can go into the games official forums, there&apos;s a suggestion section, and you can see the game designer commenting on people&apos;s ideas. It&apos;s wonderful. Overall, a fantastic game, if you like this sort of thing. Totally worth the $20. I just hope it gets some great multiplayer action where several people battle at once.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gratuitous-space-battles/user-reviews?user_review_id=740138">Expand</a></span>

<br>The music gets repetitive very quickly and it would be nice to know why you lost sometimes. As another reviewer already mentioned the best feature would be if you could see what your enemy ships are doing. I think the mystery would be cool on the online portion  since if everyone could see each others ships it would be kinda lame. In single player mode, I don&apos;t see much reason to not have this info. Can&apos;t argue too much with a good price though (while it&apos;s on sale anyways.)
<br>
<br>The new races don&apos;t seem to add much of a difference to the battles which is a bit disappointing. It&apos;s understandable to make them balanced with each other but at the same time, they need to feel different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gratuitous-space-battles/user-reviews?user_review_id=2969341">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also the amount of tutorial-messages and information boxes mentioned by cell-gfx which seem to pop up randomly on the screen by clicking on any button in the menues. Some time passed until I finally saw the first &quot;battle&quot;  well, it is a battle, but during that one I may go into the kitchen, get some coffee or whatever because the battle itself is somewhat non-interactive  and, I apologize, that sucks!
<br>
<br>I like the graphics, though. It looks very nice to see all the details of the starships by zooming in like the turrets or missles or even the impacts on the hull.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gratuitous-space-battles/user-reviews?user_review_id=2967300">Expand</a></span>

It provides lots of tools to give feedback on this process  after-combat damage breakdown by ship and weapon and other things like that  but the process just doesn&apos;t feel that satisfying. The fights are glacially slow even on the highest speed, to the extent where I&apos;ve wanted to basically Alt-Tab and do something else and come back in 20 minutes when the game has decided if I&apos;ve won or not. Fleet maneuvers aren&apos;t fast paced enough to really be all that pretty, so after you&apos;ve seen one fight you&apos;ve more or less seen them all. In addition, while the battlefields have high-level strategic constraints such as &apos;shields don&apos;t work here&apos; they don&apos;t really have any tactical depth  which, since you can&apos;t actually control your ships and still have the run &apos;count&apos;, I suppose makes some sense.
<br>
<br>10x faster ship battles would bump my rating by 1 immediately. Building the game both around the player controlling the ships rather than just designing them and watching them blow each-other to bits would bump it another 1. At that point I think it&apos;d be a perfectly serviceable game  not a grand strategy game sprawling across the galaxy and requiring 10 hours to play, but something I&apos;d play when I just have 30 minutes to spare and a desire to refocus or relax a bit  something that has a charm in its own right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gratuitous-space-battles/user-reviews?user_review_id=3137862">Expand</a></span>
