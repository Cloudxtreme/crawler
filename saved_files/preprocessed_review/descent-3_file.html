Nothing else really has the same allure as the 6 degrees of freedom the Descent franchise is known for.<br><br>Back in the day, the graphics were amazing and they still hold up pretty well today. It doesn&apos;t strike as ugly, even being over 12 years old now. The sound track still sounds as futuristic as it did back then. After playing first person shooters (ground pounders!) for such a long time, going back to play the game is every bit as challenging as opening the box for the first time. The AI runs circles around your weapons, gets right up in your face at the worst of times, and runs for cover at the best of times. The controls are heavily configurable, and work fantastic with a wireless Xbox 360 controller.<br><br>The story in the Descent series was never blockbuster level, and while you probably still won&apos;t care much in the 3rd installment, at least there&apos;s some cut scenes to keep you vaguely interested. The level design and objectives are much, much more varied, having open outdoor areas and not having to destroy a reactor in every level (quite the opposite at one point).<br><br>Descent 3 (Aswell as I &amp; II) are part of gaming history. It sits you in the middle of a world where movement is completely unrestricted and doesn&apos;t ever let you go. It&apos;s a highly polished experience that holds up to the test of time!<br><br>Windows 7 best settings;<br><br>Patched to v1.4<br>Video mode: OpenGL (DirectX has issues with modern video cards)<br>Audio: Primary Sound Driver (OpenAL needs to be installed for 5.1)<br>Control: Mouse+Keyboard, USB Joystick (Recommended), 360 GamePad (Recommended)<br><br>Extra settings in launcher (Misc tab);<br>-width -height -aspect -z32bit<br>-bumped<br><br>Also since the engine is now relatively basic, feel free to jam on the anti-aliasing.

I often find myself thinking...  Descent. Now... one would ask Why Descent? Well, first off... it is a unique first person shooter with elements we shall not see again soon; at least until Interplay, revitalized, decides to make Descent 4. Why? I do not know. Only game I know with a similar system is Forsaken... which publications at the time reamed I do remember. Now though, Descent is a fun, action paced shooter that&apos;s great for anyone who wants an adrenaline fueled adventure. Story Junkies should check out another interplay product mind you... Planescape Torment. This isn&apos;t the game for them though. I love it thoroughly though and it both holds appeal today almost as much as back then.
