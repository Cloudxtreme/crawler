<br>
<br>I love the inventory system, incredible attention to detail, extremely challenging missions (quadruple your fun with co-op!), and destructible environments. It hasn&apos;t crashed or glitched on me yet, and it runs surprisingly well on my system with maxed settings (which look great).
<br>
<br>My expectations were definitely lowered by the game&apos;s price tag, and I hadn&apos;t heard any press about it. I was very impressed by the game and somewhat surprised at the cool reception it&apos;s received from critics. I suppose it&apos;s simply not a game you can play lightly, without thinking about every move you make. The single-player missions are like puzzles, and the tools you&apos;re given to work with sometimes feel woefully inadequate, and cunning tactics and innovative thinking will win sooner than brute force will. Due to the level of detail in control, I think this game would be very difficult to play with a large army.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/faces-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=71944">Expand</a></span>

What really seperates these two games is that FOW is far more complicated and difficult. You can take direct control of the soldiers and mount nearly all vehicles on the map,You can change from different types of ammo such as AP and HE, conbtrol different turrets on tanks and stationary weapons. Pick up objects from fallen soldiers and destroyed veichles. You cand (and must) even refuel and resupply ammo on the veichles you use. This all together sounds pretty impressive and cool doesn&apos;t it? Well, it may seem nice at first, but thios all together gets pretty too much when the battle begin. It&apos;s just too much and too chaotic and it gest terrible frustrating at times. The game is also a bit buggy witch unpolished control options and characters getting stuck outside the vehicles. Visually the game looks great witch nice physics and sharp textures, the draw distance could have been better, but the game is really system demanding som it&apos;s probably best to have it thisd way. Sound is great, but the tutorial guy gets a bit &quot;too much&quot;. + Fancy gameplay. + Good AI. + Great graphics. - Byggy control system. - Irritating tutorial. - System demanding. - Chaotic at times. A great game for hardcore RTS fans, too complex for some folks. Could have been more polished an round on the edges.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/faces-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=391632">Expand</a></span>

CoH beats this game ONLY in the fact that it has a solid single player campaign. If you have a PC to play CoH at high Res then this game should be no problem. On my &quot;aging&quot; Ti 4200 I was impressed be the levels of detail in the environment and units.</span>

Controls are lousy cause you cannot see which commands you are giving the soldiers. Most of the time they just crawl in front of a machinegun nest instead of throwing a grenade. On top of this, every action is totally prescribed. Avoid this, even when in a bargain bin.</span>

Missions may be less in number (only 9 actual missions), but they take much more time to complete. The last Allied mission (where you start in a flooded city and in the end you have to take out some artillery fortifications, took me like 6 hours...of INTENSE gameplay. And I add that I played it in tactics mode. Have to say anything else? One bullet from nowhere may just 1-shot your soldier. It is not funny at all. But this way the game is intense and makes you act fast and think fast at the same time. After 1 mission you will really need some rest. Unfortunately you cannot pause and issue orders in the same way as in S: HOWW2 which is something vital and the reason I rate it 9/10 and not 10/10.
<br>
<br>Graphics. Pretty cool. Camera fully rotating, fully zooming, nice animations and physics. The game was released in 2006 and for that period its graphics must have been stunning. The environment is realistic and detailed, fully destructible and takes you to the area where the actual battle took place. The figures move smoothly, spill blood, fall down or get launched by explosions very nicely. Physics is a strong aspect of this game. Even heavy tanks demolish buildings when they pass through them. I was in ISU-2 and was literally smashing everything on my pass. Fun times&#x2026;
<br>
<br>As I mentioned before, there are not many missions to play. Just 9 (3 for Soviet, 3 for Allies, 3 for Teutons). But you will need hours to complete just 1 mission, and after that you will need some rest&#x2026;it is intense, especially with tactics mode. And here I have to explain something about it. You will just die as easily as the enemy, so your mistakes will be punished even harsher. You rush towards machine gunners who are behind road blocks? In seconds all your squad will be empty red bars. You will have to throw grenades, take an indirect approach and then throw grenades again to make them get out of cover. This is what we mean &#x201C;tactics&#x201D;. So yeah you will have to use tactics even more than before. It will be too intense though and I sometimes got pissed that 1 random bullet could just kill my guy 1-shot. Many people say that AI is not smarter on tactics etc etc. I inform you that it might not be smarter (AI in 2006 was still something under development, so stop qq&#x2019;ing&#x2026;nowadays titles have even worse AI), but it will hit MUCH harder. And this is enough to make the game more challenging. The difficulty gap is obvious if you play both tactics and arcade.
<br>
<br>The AI thingy&#x2026;yeah it is not perfect, but still can make you feel desperate. It knows damn well how to come out from nowhere to **** you up. Enemy infantry waiting patiently hidden behind some obstacle for your tank to pass by and then throw an AT grenade (or even Panzershreck) at it from 2meters. Boom. And boom you are dead. You made the mistake not to support the tank with infantry! Since it is AI, it HAS to be overwhelming in such a game. It HAS to make you feel that the odds are impossible. This is how it becomes challenging. And I like it. I will always remember missions that made me play them for hours, and in the end I was sore. So, no matter how, the AI manages to make it tough. Do not expect some walk in the park.
<br>
<br>Again, this game, like its predecessors (S: HOWW2 and Silent Heroes) and its successors (Men Of War series) is made for HC gamers of this SPECIFIC style. Yes we like the micromanagement. Yes we like to start with 100 bullets and loot the rest 1000 from dead corpses. Yeah we like to see enemies 10 times our number to attack us and have to kill them all. And we damn adore not having to build bases to replenish our losses. Each soldier for us is something that must not die. Ever. In other games grenade is an ability with CD. Here, you can throw all your grenades one after another. Your only limit is how many you actually have in your inventory. Realistic? Yes. Fun? Even more. Sometimes though, the action is so fast that you do not have time to breathe and replenish ammo from bodies. But in general, if you are careful and not careless, you will not have such a problem. This game has the habit to make you walk at its pace, and not at YOUR pace. More challenges and we like them.

<br>If you are not ready for some owning from the AI, at least in the beginning when you will be getting acquainted with the changes from S: HOWW2 (if you have not played you should not read this review and not even try this game), do not try it. You WILL cry. It is one of the games I have played from start to end on tactics mode and I feel proud. Last allied mission. I had to take out some artillery defenses above a beach. It was some kind of fort with 2meter walls, narrow corridors WITHOUT ceiling. Instead of bashing my head in these corridors in front of some MG&#x2019;s, I took a soldier outside and he was throwing grenades above the 2-3m wall on the heads of the enemy soldiers inside. It was thinking that made it possible and not numbers and zerging like in other&#x2026;&#x201D;strategy&#x201D; games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/faces-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4107035">Expand</a></span>
