For 15$ you will get a complete game experience, an about 5-6 hour long singelplayer with a standard story but it`s still fun and it teaches you the basics of the game.<br><br>You will get a multiplayer that is full of memorable moments and adrenaline filled shootouts, but don`t confuse it with the ordinary &quot;run &amp; gun&quot; gameplay because this game is all about teamplay and tactics. The multiplayer battles got support for 32 players and the game mode is called Conquest. You battle for 4 control points and for dynamic objectives to win the match, it`s very much like the conquest mode in the Battlefield games but with more things happening (like dynamic objectives). The objectives can be to kill a VIP player or to kill a bunch of players, but it can also be about protecting things or attacking things like a transport. Then you got a mode called Swarm, it`s a co-op game type which you can play either by yourself with bots or with up to 3 friends, the objective is to protect a capture point from enemy AI soldiers for 15 minutes, this game mode is very fun indeed. It&#xC2;&#xB4;s like the survival mode in Left 4 Dead but with some nice tower defense added to spice all up. When you kill enemies you gain money both in Swarm and in Conquest and with that money you can buy vehicles and turrets, it`s a very important part of the game and makes it more tactical. All in all this is a great game which you should buy if your a fan of FPS games and for just 15$ dollars you aren`t exactly taking a big risk, and i bet you will like the game when you learnt the basics. I give this game 9/10 for it`s amazing price and simply because it`s a great game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606370">Expand</a></span>

I find myself getting cravings to play it, which is rare with FPS&apos;s these days.  The gameplay is intense and very easy to get wrapped up in, especially completing objectives alongside squadmates on Conquest.  Which beings me to my only major complaint, but I suppose it&apos;s true of most games in this ganre; the amount of people playing on any given server that actually want to capture the objectives and operate as a team will vary wildly.  Sometimes you get stuck with a team full of losers that think they can go it alone and rack up kills like they&apos;re playing CoD.  Fortunately, S8:P doesn&apos;t encourage that.  Think Unreal 2K4 combined with BF:2142.  An awesome experience that I wish had a larger fanbase filling servers.  I don&apos;t want to see this game die.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1637454">Expand</a></span>

The colors are bright, there are no long dark corridors that make all locations look the same. The other big reason to like this game is the way it presents it self. In Section 8 you are playing as a some sort of space marine who can fly using a jet pack while shooting enemies with a futuristic weapon. Simply badass! It doesn&apos;t only look great, it makes the gameplay seem different from other games, making the overall experience very entertaining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606145">Expand</a></span>

I spent about 3 hours this evening playing the conquest mode with only one hiccup, but that was Comcast&apos;s fault.  I really like that there doesn&apos;t seem to be even a single worthless weapon, and that even starting out fresh at level 1, if you&apos;re a more skilled player than someone else, you will kill them regardless of what equipment they&apos;ve unlocked.  It&apos;s always bothered me that FPS games as of late have all prescribed to the &quot;find or unlock the biggest insta-kill weapon with the least accuracy requirement and spam it&quot; methodology to firefights, and I&apos;m very pleased that this game does not do that.  It rewards teamwork, strategy, and creative deployable/orbit drop placement.  The lock-on feature, while present, is not overdone or overpowered, as you can only lock on to a person for a very short period of time, and there is a cooldown between uses of the lock-on feature, and you cannot be killed by hit-scan weapons (from a single person) during the amount of time that the lock-on actually holds.  Sniper rifles, rockets, etc which actually have a travel time will miss even while locked on if the person is actively trying to evade your weapons fire. Vehicles and the mechs are very tough to take out on foot, but since absolutely anyone can drop deployable turrets, they can easily be brought under control.<br>The environments and characters are pretty, but not overdone, and it seems Timegate actually figured out that a good game is good because its easy to pick up, fun to play, and hard to be great at.  There was one minor issue I did find with clipping while crouching, where sometimes (not very often) if you&apos;re in extremely jagged terrain you will get &quot;stuck&quot;, though all you have to do to free yourself is stand up and move.  All in all, if you like FPS games where actual skill matters more than what weapons you have and you enjoy a good firefight where target priority and tactics are important, you wont regret buying this (unless you don&apos;t understand system requirements and have an underpowered machine, and that is your fault, not the game&apos;s)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606167">Expand</a></span>

Well lets begin with this, The game is worth checking out for sci-fi shooter and is plenty of fun. the campaign is nothing new so far and there are only 3 online game modes. swarm is the best for me. basicly you and up to 3 other players guard one base against tons of enemies. the other modes are about the same. these are assult and conquest. Assult you either get all the bases or none. and you either guard or attack. the mode isnt too bad and can add a bit of variety to the crowded FPS genre. Then conquest is all the bases are neutral and you need to capture then. the problem? you always get stuck on the loosing side and its very difficult starting off... I have many problems with other players who are higher level. they a near impossible to kill without cheap tricks. anyway besides that they are adding more modes so Thats nice... Finally its time to talk about Character customization. Its great. you get 2 weapons of your choice from the basic pistol to rocket launcher,but thats not it, you then choose the ammo the effect shield or health more or medium damage. Then you get 2 items like mortars to healing tools. then armor and finaaly getting to add points to different perks. Overall you can create a character for just about any situation. So overall the game is great, but has little variety for now. Still great way to spend $15</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1616334">Expand</a></span>

Customization of armor and weapons allow you to fight on your own style FPS (Stealth, Sniper, Anti-Vehicle, etc.) Good Coops mode. Great single player mode, despite of lacking in map variety. Great animation and environment effect (Knife execution, Recovering Shield, Snow Storm etc.) Overall: Great game to have.</span>

Being jettisoned out of a dropship every respawn never seems to get old, and with the dynamic missions and how hectic battles can get no two matches are the same.  I also like the variety available for different playstyles, with the different customization options for loadouts and various ways you can spend the in match currency (turrets, giant mechs, supply depots, etc).  I would add that you shouldn&apos;t buy this game just for the singleplayer, as although it is improved over the first game it is nowhere near as entertaining as the multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606123">Expand</a></span>

Anyone who is giving this game lower than 8 (no pun intended) either didn&apos;t read the system specs for it (you know who you are) or didn&apos;t know what they were buying. Honestly, it&apos;s going to be huge, hectic, and you might be a bit confused if this is your first FPS multi with 32 ppl a server. It&apos;s a lot to take in, but for crying out loud this is a steal at $15 when so many games out there today are $50 - $60 with not much more going on for it than what S8:P is offering. Seriously. Me and 4 of my buddies can form a squad on a multiplayer server, hop on vent, and have a great time for a couple of hours. Oh, I did think of one thing bad to say about it, though I think that&apos;s not really it&apos;s fault: It&apos;s another GFWL. So, if you ain&apos;t a fan of that, more of the same with this. But otherwise, that&apos;s a UI issue that wasn&apos;t really the Dev team&apos;s choice, so I can&apos;t fault them for that. Graphics = 10, Sound = 10, Gameplay = 10, UI = 9, PRICE = 11, so Overall = 10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606814">Expand</a></span>

Yeah, the game looks and plays better than the original but it still doesn&apos;t go far enough to make me want to buy it again.  The gameplay lacks that &quot;I gotta do it&quot; feel.  Just feels rather plain, like a me-too version of every other FPS that is out there.</span>

The graphics are decent, but not particularly impressive.  The gameplay is where it really lacks.  The campaign is incredibly dull and uninspired.  I can&apos;t remember the last FPS game I played that I got so bored of I quit after several levels.  The weapons feel incredibly weak and bland; for a sci-fi game I expected something a little more interesting than the standard pistol, AR, Sniper, etc. and all of the weapons are very weak.  Even with the Auto Lock On mechanic it takes a ton of bullets to kill anything.  The drop in mechanic in MP quickly gets annoying due to AA preventing you from dropping on most areas of the map.  The deployable weapons are rather weak as well, which quickly made them more of nuisance to deploy than a benefit.  This game was not even worth $15.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1686998">Expand</a></span>

Since I can only &quot;play&quot; the load screen, I can only review that much of the game.  The load screen is pretty.  The &quot;Games For Windows Live Failed to Initialize&quot; crash, not so much.  Their forum hosts say that sometimes games won&apos;t work because of your configuration (i.e. their botched copy protection).  So basically, if there&apos;s a problem they&apos;re telling you tough luck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=2104409">Expand</a></span>

Apparently there is auto balancing in it, according to a robotic lady voice anyway, but I&apos;ve never seen a trace of it. Oh, and thanks to deployable anti aircraft structures they&apos;ve made a game where it&apos;s theoretically possible to make it&apos;s impossible to spawn.. anywhere!. Not seen it fully done yet but nearly on one game. And EMP grenades are OP to the point where everything else is pointless. Seriously, it&apos;s silly. Why put all those other items in when everyone is only kitting EMP grenades. Next time guys, get the public to playtest and not the developers. It&apos;s the only reason I can think of to end up with gaping holes into what would otherwise would be a solid 8/9 online FP shooter (Or even 10 considering the low price)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1607355">Expand</a></span>

The &apos;drop in&apos; system is great, it gives you an opportunity to play the game very tactically and is well designed. They also have a great selection on weapons, way more than I expected, every weapon possesses a potential ammo power, it powers up the specified weapon. However, it also powers it down in stats as well in return for the bonus (i.e, less AOE damage, in return for: damages enemy with fire over time). It is also well designed and consists in many attributes, just a bit too original. The maps in this game are also quite cool, they all have great places to spawn your turrets. Most of the maps are very small though, the design is unique. There are very, very few bad things with this game.. the only noticeable issue is the team balance, there practically is none, the games tend to be very hectic due to this. For $14.99 you simply cannot go wrong with Section 8: Prejudice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1727395">Expand</a></span>

Graphics looks really cool (Unreal 3 engine). Some very interesting sci-fi ideas: spawn=dropping from orbit, jet-pack, over-drive sprint, buying turrets and sensors to control the battlefield, mechs, tanks, etc. + tactical teamwork. Just being able to shoot and kill will not win games. Need to seriously think about cooperation, arrange spending, and counter the enemy&apos;s strength. + offline and bots. Every map and game mode is playable with decent bots offline and LAN. Single Player campaign is &quot;Meh&quot;, but it keeps you busy for few hours and serves as a tutorial for the game&apos;s basic mechanics. Finishing the story also unlocks a new armor. + customization/specialization. 7 kinds of basic weapons and other accessories, each with variants of different attributes for diverse playing style. Through careful choice of these equipment, and the upgrade points system, you can play as a two shot kill sniper, or repair specialist facilitating others. + price, $15 = Call of Duty 4 on sale at 50% off! THE BAD:- weapon imbalance. It&apos;s always an issue for new games, especially with so many choices. Developers are listening to the community for feedback. - uses GfWL, I&apos;ve had no problem myself, but heard it can be buggy. - small community. Unbelievably small group of players for such a good game. ~2-3 servers with good number of people at night for the Conquest Mode. (Which is exactly why we need more players!!! Try it!!!) - a number of bugs. Some fixed by latest patch, others are being worked on according to developers. - newcomers lose a lot at first. New players won&apos;t have access to all weapon choices, which are unlocked with more play. Understanding how to make choices on equipment, and how to finish random missions will be confusing at first. So yeah the game is not perfect, but TimeGate is hard at work to improve it. And even as it is right now, it&apos;s well worth its price.

Sad to say not long after its release there has been a MASSIVE drop in players which is really disappointing if your looking to play conquest or assault.... you can still get a good game of coop.</span>

Then I saw section 8 prejudice and read how they fixed some things. I was thinking they need alot more fixed then just SOMEthings. After buying it on sale I was blown away. The amount of content you get for this game for that price is amazing. Ive been playing the single player campaign and Ive been impressed. The game play is that of unreal tournament and tribes put together. The weapons and deployables all great and you wont be disappointed by AI. The game modes are alot of fun too, especially swarm in which you and 3 other players are to defend a sector at all costs from invaders, with a bunch of side missions during it. The game delivered and if your an action fps fan then do not hesitate. Another thing is not to trust game review sites such as IGN. They gave this game a low score because it doesnt have the flash of Call of duty or other generic shooters out there and in turn section 8 prej delivered alot more content then it ever did. The only reason I didnt give this game a 10 is because of GFWL. Once again they like to make inconvenient for pc players to have to sign in, activate the product with them just so they can make us believe its for &quot;security&quot;..right. Any way, Section 8 prejudice: Excellent buy</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724324">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Some of the greatest combat I&apos;ve seen in a while. INSANELY FUN. Definitely worth $15. Great campaign, but the multiplayer is the amazing part, it will provide at least 8 hours a week of fun. And the campaign has good dialog and humor. I think it&apos;s a great time, but there are a few things to count as a bad time.</span>

But, in fact, the game is a lot more static than it should, the sprint system is really bad. Somehow, this game has some level of customization, but most people will use similar sets of weapons and upgrades. The upgrades are too weak, while the base character too strong. In other words, you can&apos;t really tell if someone is using a fully defensive/fully offensive or mixed set of upgrades just by fighting him. They should make the character weaker and allow us to really upgrade it, add more upgrade points, resulting in a bigger degree of customization. The multiplayer side of the game is really good, an fps with some TD spice and play-time dynamic objectives (randomly generated, can be boring sometimes). The game can be really improved in the next versions, a better storyline for campaign and balances along with the problems stated above. It would get a 8.5, so, 9. Due to Windows live being mandatory, it&apos;ll be a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=2143461">Expand</a></span>

These consist of Conquest mode (where you hold control points for tickets and do DCMs for bonus tickets) and Assault mode (teams take turns defending 4 bases and the faster team to cap wins the map). Customization consists of 2 main weapons slots (shotguns, RLs, MGs, pistols, etc.), 2 off-hands (various tools and explosives), skin choices, and defense/offense loadouts. Each weapon also has unlocks for different ammo/explosion types so the customization is deep. You also get cash for objectives/kills/assists/etc. to airdrop in buildings and vehicles so your money management can change the flow of battle greatly. Don&apos;t let the GFWL scare you (it only manages Friends list &amp; achievements) and pick this up if you enjoy team-oriented FPSs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8-prejudice/user-reviews?user_review_id=2828439">Expand</a></span>

Yeah, the game looks and plays better than the original but it still doesn&apos;t go far enough to make me want to buy it again. The gameplay lacks that &quot;I gotta do it&quot; feel. Just feels rather plain, like a me-too version of every other FPS that is out there.</span>
