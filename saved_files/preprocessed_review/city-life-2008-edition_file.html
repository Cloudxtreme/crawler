It wasen&apos;t that bad.. but, it is worth the money now.. and i felt amazed when i played this game back in the time.. I recommend this game to everyone! i give it a 9/10, theres some bugs, like the Bus going to taxi and taxi going to bus.. And some stuff i don&apos;t get.. But else this is totaly fine.. If you would like more maps and building buy the 2008 Edition.. I don&apos;t like how the critics rated this low.. When this game is actuly very fun and good!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/city-life-2008-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3095770">Expand</a></span>
