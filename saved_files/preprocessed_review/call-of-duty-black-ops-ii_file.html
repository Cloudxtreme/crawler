The graphics in this day and age are down right embarrassing. Makes you appreciate what EA did for the PC community with BF3. The cinematic intro at the beginning&apos;s lip sync is way off &amp; the character models look deformed. This engine is on its last legs. I&apos;ve bought Call of Duty since 1 on the PC, skipped COD3 as I had no console. I&apos;ve always played the campaign through first then started the multiplayer. Black Ops II&apos;s campaign is something to avoid, It is just a Michael Bay movie, pumped with testosterone, then turned into a game. The characters are unlikable, story is utterly confusing that multiple times i&apos;ll get to the point where I&apos;m often wondering why I&apos;m in this location &amp; what am I doing. I&apos;m 4 missions in and haven&apos;t touched the game in weeks. Any other Call of Duty I would finish the campaign in less than a week, I doubt i&apos;ll play it again.
<br>Multiplayer is nothing new, though unless you have an SMG or something with rapid fire, you&apos;re going to have a bad time with the hid detection being off/completely different to any other COD. It&apos;s just black ops 1 re-skinned with more &quot;features&quot; or &quot;downgrades&quot; as I would call them, move along.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2823879">Expand</a></span>

Compared to the first Black Ops, this game is an incredible downgrade when comparing weapon balancing, movement, and overall game-play.  Aiming down the sights is virtually dead.  Every map, even ones that seem sniper friendly on the surface, all you need is a high fire rate sub-machine gun to mow players down.  And unless they are at quite a long distance, aiming is simply not necessary.  Players move unrealistically fast compared to previous installments, and even though maps are bigger on average than BO1, the speed and absolutely horrible re-spawn mechanics make the maps feel much smaller and simply more frustrating.  Map design itself is horrid and seemingly rushed with no consideration of play mechanics or strategy.  With BO1 and earlier CoD games every map seemed to have some advantage to picking the right weapon.  That is not the case by far with BO2.  As previously mentioned a fast firing sub-machine gun is all you need for every map every time.  The games outdated graphics engine is about 5 years old now and very much showing it&apos;s age.  Virtually &quot;cartoony&quot; at this point.  A sure sign that no effort went into this game from a design perspective.
<br>
<br>The &quot;dedicated servers&quot;, even though known to be owned and controlled by 3arc with no mods allowed, could be considered an outright lie to the consumers.  We see the same style game matching as with MW3.  The only upside is that ping/latency seems to be a tad bit better.  It&apos;s very difficult to tell but this could be the result of matches being hosted on &quot;dedicated servers&quot; as opposed to peer-to-peer.  It&apos;s also difficult to say if that&apos;s moving in the right direction.....because as PC games are concerned....true dedicated / player owned servers have always given us the best play experience.  That&apos;s because we get lower pings, a better social experience where you get to play with and befriend those on your favorite servers, but also the server admins can &quot;police&quot; a server and ban cheaters/hackers that circumvent the shoddy anti-cheat measures Valve and 3arc try to impose.  Sadly I must recommend to all skilled players to avoid this game completely....as it takes no skill to actually play.   The continued dumbing down caters to a common play-style that young children and pre/young teens enjoy..... which is spray, pray, and call people racist &amp; derogatory terms.  That may be present in all on-line games but when traditionally you would have older teens and young adults as the majority skilled player such occurrences, especially on a true dedicated server, were fairly uncommon.
<br>
<br>This player had high hopes for BO2.  Eagerly awaiting an improvement on BO1 for some fun, balanced, and skilled game-play.  Unfortunately what we receive is a dumbed down abomination of MW3.
<br>
<br>Between Activision&apos;s loss of touch with the gaming community and EA&apos;s continued poor quality renditions the market is prime for a new entry into this genre.  Someone, please save us.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2755501">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Only played single player campaign!
<br>Can&apos;t talk about multiplayer gameplay!
<br>
<br>-Cons: 1. Outdated graphics    2. Avarage AI    (Friendly NPCs are absolutely useless, enemy NPCs are too static etc.)    3. Avarage story and overlong cutscenes    4. Almost every character is a clich&#xE9;    (Evil Arabs, Africans and South Americans, badass US soldiers)    5. Imperfect Strike Force commands    6. Gameplay is too scripted    7. Maps are too small and overcrowded with NPCs
<br>
<br>Pros:  1. Weapon customization    2.Still better than MW3:Warfighter...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2754615">Expand</a></span>

Which lowers the score I give by 4 points. Also the option to preorder was removed before the 14th. So I think my score is valid and now knowing how bad and buggy the game is I feel like I&apos;m rating it too high.</span>

Good to see lean/peak is back to CoD. But worst of all is.... No dedicated servers! WTF?!!! Which means it is difficult to find a game for MP and/or will get disconnected when host leaves. Unacceptable!!! And you are at the mercy of Activi$ion. No way to kick chaters, mod a server (even within the game rules etc...). Last CoD purchase for me ever. Will probably revert to Cod 4 and even BO. CoD 4 remains the best to this day. Strange thing is I would have paid more for new versions of CoD. Or just new maps or enhancements of the versions already there. You lost me for good now, Activi$ion! I am a PC gamer! Edit: An update as it really bugs me: 12 player multiplayer? Are **** me Activi$ion?!!! And the lag encountered on matchmaking is really annoying. Some of the animation and models are v. cartooney compared with previous CoD&apos;s. Don&apos;t buy this **** Can&apos;t believe I am supporting an EA game, but if you have money to burn, buy BF3 or buy Red Orchestra 2, buy COD 4! Stay well away from this. We are PC gamers!  Edit #2: So I am not accused for criticising without trying it. After playing MP for 5 days, I can confirm CoD is dead. It took until all/most perks and addons were unlocked. Now almost every game is won by one or two guys running around with knives. There is no balance in the game anymore. There is no fun. You can blame it on my inexperience, but I am a decent player. I didn&apos;t think I would be playing for too long this sad excuse of a game, but to not last even a week.... I repeat! Don&apos;t buy this **** This is a poor console game - leave it to consoles. We are PC gamers!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2752678">Expand</a></span>

The game is possibly the biggest load of crap ever seen in modern games. Strangely this Call of Duty nonsense doesn&apos;t know how to stop and our majority of gamers and consumers are into nonsensical, repetitive, and worthless games. Clearly Treyarch doesn&apos;t appeal nor care towards players and only towards the money idiots throw at them. The game sadly lacks one of the useful features of gaming, dedicated servers. Without this how can you expect PC gamers to have any type of fun? With constant disconnections from servers and bad communities, I wonder how play this game. Not to mention how poorly coded and balanced this game is. Run and gun with a sub-machine gun, BIG **** WHOOPIE DO. Seriously, with a due respect, this game is not worth buying with It&apos;s same, non-changing gameplay with only meager, insignificant additions.
<br>
<br>How can other idiots, Yes idiots, commenting in Metacritic say people don&apos;t know what they are talking about this game score wise, anyway? Clearly, they have played it, hated it, and give their concerns to the community.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is NOT worth your time and especially your good money. The game lacks core FPS elements and will be a waste. If I ask one person who is so madly in love with this game, I bet you he or she cannot give me a clear, descriptive and good opinion about the game. The game is a piece of **** this is one of the most banwagoned game which sole purpose of the creators is not to create a fun genre, but one to only gain profit. If you have the mind to read all of this, I sincerely commend you for your actions. I am not being a hater, but clearly there are so many bad, and unfixed points of this game that makes it a complete disaster. Remember, Treyarch wants to only make money not matter how badly a person perceives it. Please make a difference by not being one of those idiots who say MW3 (when it came out) or did you get Black Ops 2?
<br>The gaming community today makes me sick to see these COD only gamers.
<br>
<br>P.S. I played throughtout the COD series, So I KNOW where I am coming from.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2761880">Expand</a></span>

This game is just a marketing trick of Acitivision, same thing as EA or Apple is doing... marketing crap for high prices. It was nothing but a waste of my time!

<br>Bodies have no weight, textures look like absolute garbage they are stretched and clipped on everything you can find.
<br>I wanted to get into this game I really did, but it was just disappointment after disappointment.
<br>You should pray all day and maybe maaaaaaaaay be you will get your money back from this spew of diarrhea dog console port.
<br>
<br>-When you knife people it seems to have no connectivity, their limbs just fly off to a cheesy blood effect that looks like After Effects Action Essentials blood.
<br>-The guns have the same exact sound for each shot, other games had at least 3.
<br>-The cast just jumps around left and right, none of the characters are memorable.
<br>-This is a direct console port to the PC, the graphics adjustments are so crippled you can&apos;t even adjust the model detail -_-. This game is playing in 480p or some terrible console quality.
<br>I would be able to tell if it was developed for PC, the text would be very high quality and clear like the other games but the text in this game looks like it was from a 4:3 800 x 600 monitor.
<br>-The main menu is sooooooo bad  it is set vertical, has no icons, why would they downgrade their main menu wtf, the first black ops menu was perfect, it was interactive with a bunch of fun secrets but this is just some crappy graphics guy just hitting his watch in the same exact spot.
<br>
<br>Ranging from framerate issues and limited graphics, to the inability to crouch only when pressing the crouch button, both toggle to crouch and hold to crouch have the same exact action WOW.
<br>The guns do not make any impact sounds, from the beggining of the campaign I was just bewildered at the fact that they had to add so much gore up the ass, from burning to brutal murders. It is so unnecessary and it detracts so much from the story I don&apos;t even know what the characters are even arguing about half the time.
<br>
<br>I have played Call of Duty since Call of Duty 2, my favorite one being Modern Warfare 1.
<br>I&apos;m glad Metacritic isn&apos;t paid off for it&apos;s reviews because this game really does deserve a 3.1.
<br>
<br>This game makes Soldier Front look like an 11 / 10.
<br>
<br>This is the summation of money hungry corporate pigs, movie licensed game, and paid reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2754663">Expand</a></span>

The core problem with this game is that there is virtually no map variety.  They&apos;ve added plenty of new weapons, perks, and killstreaks, but without maps to use them on, the additions are wasted.  I will start with the positives of this game.
<br>
<br>The rebalancing done to custom classes is superb.  Instead of taking only the most powerful of perks and addons (OMA/noob tube, anyone?), you are forced to decide whether you really want to forego a sidearm, attachments, or even tactical and lethal grenades if you want, for example, Marathan and Lightweight together.  This allows for some interesting combinations and are a vast improvement in terms of customizing classes to suit your gameplay style.  I love what they&apos;ve done with this.    There are now tons of killstreaks you can choose from, though I don&apos;t know the precise number.  There are many new additions to the weapon lineup, and the sound is the best I&apos;ve heard in a COD title to date.  The CQC design, IMO, is actually superb, even if that&apos;s all the maps offer.  The unfortunate thing as that&apos;s pretty much where the positives end.
<br>
<br>Every single map is the same, with different textures and environment.  Imagine playing COD with a randomized dungeon engine like Diablo 2&apos;s.  That&apos;s pretty much what BLOPS is, except I would probably prefer random layouts to the tired and uninspired designs of these maps.  Every level is a close quarters combat layout.  Every.single.one.  Did you enjoy maps like Overgrown, Derail, or Estate that offered a mix of wide open spaces, overwatch areas, and a bit of close quarters?  Well, then, don&apos;t buy this game, especially if you&apos;re a PC player, like I am.  The series has been going the way of the console for a long time now, and, sadly, even Halo offers more open space maps than this title.  That&apos;s depressing.
<br>
<br>So while there are loads of new weapons to choose from, you&apos;re pretty much pidgeonholed into picking sub-machine guns.  LMGs, sniper rifles, and even rifles are now just handicaps.  Aiming isn&apos;t even necessary anymore.  If all you desire is quick action and rapid fire spraying with little to no tactical consideration, then this title is perfect for you.  The graphics seem no better than any previous BLOPS/MW title, yet it does seem to run worse.  I&apos;ve run max settings on almost every COD title to date (with even older video cards), yet I&apos;ve actually had to lower a couple settings on this title just to prevent hiccups from actions like aiming down the sights.  I don&apos;t really notice an improvement in the graphics even on max settings.  I&apos;m sure some of the hiccups will be ironed out, though.
<br>
<br>The good thing is that BLOPS2 is a definite improvement over MW3.  I loved every single Modern Warfare title until that game.  It was a travesty.  I even loved BLOPS to a lesser degree.  But the bad thing is that the extremely poor map variety makes this game a chore to play.  I give it a 4 only because it&apos;s better than MW3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2757083">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well lets start by the &quot;Fake&quot;dedicated servers. Where is the dedicated server? I do not know? Neither will you, and the only indication of the quality of connection is hidden by some idiotic Ping Bars. We cant even play competitively or just hang around on our own servers, since you cannot rent them... that means no community forming in a specific server etc.
<br>
<br>This leads me to point 2. Console port again... What a shame, graphics from 2005? Really from a supposedly triple A game? Well we all knew that COD has not been up to par for years, peer 2 peer in MW2 etc. This game shows the same kind of symptoms, clearly a case of consolitus(A disease for PC). I warn you my fellow PC gamers, DO NOT BUY THIS! Stop supporting Activision. We need a new engine...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2755444">Expand</a></span>

Apart from the fact it&apos;s masked by a different setting and time.....nothing. it just feels like another average COD game. We all know this though, it&apos;s traditional every single year Activision churn out the same garbage for the younger audience so the consumers can invest a lot of their time and money for the franchise. Sure it&apos;s a fantastic business and marketing tactic that Activision can dictate this and they make a lot of money from it. But how can we stop this garbage being produced? Simple really just boycott the game and DON&apos;T buy it. However this is an impossible solution because the market is so huge for this type of game many of which will never be  convinced otherwise that they are being robbed blind plus the fact most people hate change and as long as they&apos;re comfortable with the same thing year in and year out Activision will take advantage of that and continue &quot;feeding the trolls&quot; so to speak. I have to give Treyarch some respect though at least they aren&apos;t afraid of changing the timeline of a cod game and they want to be a little more ambitious with it. However this just doesn&apos;t cut it enough, what we need is a fresh new IP and most certainly a more up to date and more advanced game engine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2754676">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is such a shameless ripoff to the previous that it&apos;s almost insulting to the gaming industry in general. The critic reviews are obviously paid reviews seeing as this game gets a 9 on average. In short this game doesn&apos;t do anything to revolutionize or even improve upon the existing FPS model. It doesn&apos;t even give you top notch graphics for the money you pay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2753118">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gunplay, colision detection is appaling, you don&apos;t need to be on target just in the general area, I&apos;ve been awarded headshots when I&apos;ve hit players in the chest and had kills that were around an arm length away from the body.
<br>Perks/Upgrades, really clunky and confusing (at first) some of the perks/upgrades are just not worth the bother.
<br>Graphics/engine, I know if a game has solid gameplay graphics should not be an issue but come on, no destructible scenery, falling off the edge of maps ? this is 2012 ffs. There should be slightly more realistic gun mechanics, pistol headshots across the map with no bullet drop ? Yeah right.. Also bullets will pass through walls made of metal but be stopped dead by walls made of wood, what gives ?
<br>Sound, seriously bad just seriously seriously bad.
<br>General stuff, just a really really disappointing game, you can get killed by something like a RCd or dragonfire and have no warning of it&apos; approach or time to get into cover or even any idea what you&apos;ve been killed by, hardcore mode isn&apos;t, switching to pistol when you&apos;ve clipped out is very slow,  a hell of a lot of camping spots and very little room for team based gameplay. A lot of people are saying buy BF3 it&apos;s better, yes this is true but BLops2 and BF3 are completely different games with different objective, no way could Blops2 be described as a &apos;realistic wargame&apos;, I&apos;d say buy MW1 or 2 better gameplay and a hell of a lot cheaper. There are some good points though, the maps are ok,  ummm thats about it really I&apos;m struggling to think of something else good....it&apos;s a bit like the Halo series, some great maps on there but horribly slow clunky junky spunky gameplay.
<br>
<br>To all those giving it 0 come on, be a bit objective at least very few games are worth 0.
<br>
<br>Just a few words about me. Been gaming since the days of Space Invaders and Scramble, played pretty much every platform and genre out there and remeber when games were a challenge and made you think, now my old old brain is so curdled all I can do is run around and shoot people, just as well really with depthless crap like MW3 and Blops2 around.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2752196">Expand</a></span>

Treyarch just doesn&apos;t do a good job in balancing mechanics, maps, physics, etc.  It feels odd and blah compared to Infinity Ward&apos;s design, it feels cheap.  My recommendations for a CoD game for multiplayer..MW1,MW2,MW3.

<br>Singleplayer review: Solid Call of Duty style, good plot twists, interesting characters and ton of action. (The start of campaing was very stupid so it took me 3 months to even start playing it)...Overall very good Cod campaing.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer: Same as BO1 and Mw series. I still rank MW2 as best multiplayer Cod to this date, in BO2 there are a lot of game modes...1-2 are good, rest are junk. There is no &quot;OMG WAR&quot; feeling to the game, unless you spawn into game where opponent has all 6 players aiming towards you&#xB4;r spawn and all the time sky is breaking with missiles...Spoils all fun, but it&#xB4;s war. I&#xB4;d hoped they would make larger maps, larger teams and much more action. Sadly in standard 6v6 it takes too long to find an enemy. Overall this game suck&#xB4;s when you compare it to releases done by same publisher. Atleast update the gameplay, graphics and atmosphere. Counter-Strike type games rock, because they are cheap, they got good perks and solid fanbase. Call of Duty delivers normal size maps, small teams and no action whatsoever. Perhaps it&#xB4;s time for me too look over fence and take a better look at Battlefield series, since Call of Duty has been downfall for very long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2969871">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I don&apos;t play COD for the campaign, so I cannot rate that.  Multiplayer is OK, but not as good as the first Black Ops.  The maps aren&apos;t as unique, although pretty decent.  No dedicated servers and not as much focus on Hardcore with different game types, which is the mode I like to play most.  I feel BO2 has reduced features compared to the first Black Ops.</span>

The campaign is as bad as ever but even bloody worse than the 360 with bugs that weren&apos;t in the 360 or even PS3 versions are less buggy and the zombies mode and multiplayer is bad because of no split-screen and online its totally for n00bs and no dedicated servers on a PC game WTF and i bloody payed &#xA3;40 for it</span>

<br>The singleplayer to be honest is pretty average. I liked how the game was non-linear and there were different endings. Although non-linear is kind of generous. It was basically kill or don&apos;t kill, but i feed a sense of satisfaction after getting the best possible ending.

<br>The multiplayer? Well the maps are good AND bad. The maps are good, as in good variety of colour and detail, but there are CRAPTONNES of camping spots. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s wrong with the COD community these days but they need to grow some balls and stop camping. The spawning is also  I can&apos;t tell you how many  times i got killed by someone spawning 5 metres behind me. Treyarch really need to pick up their  The hit detection is also bull****, either that or that all my guns are equipped with paper bullets, because i pump a whole clip into an enemy and they don&apos;t die, whereas they shoot one burst into me and I die. Most annoying feature in the game. I don&apos;t even think they have a system that checks whether you spawn next to an enemy, you just spawn somewhere near an ally and that&apos;s that. The weapon sounds are also terrible. When I shoot a gun I want it to sound like I&apos;m shooting a gun, not whatever sounds the &quot;futuristic&quot; guns sound like. Seriously is 10 years really going to make THAT much of a difference? Look at 2002 and 2012. I don&apos;t really think there was that much difference between warfare.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3587677">Expand</a></span>

This isn&apos;t a comment section this is revieve. No such things new. A cloack perk added to campaing (single player) Multiplayer is prety fun tought. Is it the best call of duty game? Absaloutly not.

It looks quite similar to the previous games. I decided to try Black Ops 2 while it was on free weekend on steam. I managed to get up to rank 34 quite easily (with double xp). There is not much of a challenge to be honest. The campaign was too short and boring</span>

<br>Now to be honest it&apos;s true, same thing since Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, same engine, several powerful guns, several useless guns, and the rest are just there. The story as normal is pointless to play unless if you want to perfect the game, at least this year you can influece said story and have a slightly different ending. Side-quest mode (AKA Zombies) is the same thing from Black Ops 1, only this time you can build stuff and that the characters are new, yet this time forgetable. I can say though that I enjoyed Mob of the Dead, finally providing a challenge to survive. Finally the thing that makes all of the cal of duty fans go crazy, the broken and useless multiplayer. I&apos;m actually pretty good at it (2.27 Kills to Death Ratio and a 1.21 Win to Loss Ratio) and I still do not enjoy myself when I play it, it&apos;s a torture to play even when you are good, somehow though this game keeps a massive fan boy following. I&apos;ve played both the console and PC editions and none of them are any different, and that&apos;s to be expected since Activision is too busy eiter working on another series of pointless and bad cash ins, or the next Call of Duty. My personal opinion, if you want a Call of Duty game, buy Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: World at War, together thay are half the price of Black Ops 2 and are both exceedingly better than this years rehash. And a Fun Fact, the graphics are actually worse than World at War somehow, go figure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3366693">Expand</a></span>

I have what I consider a fast laptop, and yet I had to update it as far as possible just for the game to run. And IF i manage to connect to a multi-player server, it&apos;s short-lived. Connection with this game is nigh on impossible and gives many numbers of errors for not connecting. Connection interrupted, lost connection to host, and you have been disconnected are the main messages I see. I wasted 60 dollars to buy a game that is unplayable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3464369">Expand</a></span>

The lame singleplayer with rubbish plot about cyberterrorists, the strike ops mode which was made only to be in the game. Zombies became silly and blunt with these new overtwist of plot and mechanics. Multiplayer introduced nothing new, except the bad &quot;pick-10&quot; and wildcards, imbalanced perks and weapons (which also sound like someone in the weapon is participating in the quick spitting competition, oh, and SMGs doesn&apos;t look to have recoil at all), etc. This list can be continued. Don&apos;t buy this game.

                                        <span>This game is repetitive  boring and is just another addition to the cod franchise  which is constructed by really repetitive games  The single player is not worth mentioning and the multiplayer is just boring  The dlc&apos;s are either crappy maps that nobody will remember or maps from black ops 1  which was one of the best call of duty games in my opinion</span>

                                        <span>Oh im just been informed this isn&apos;t just Black Ops with a texture pack. Surprising. The story is all over the place, there is no characterization, and everything is predictable. Level design is horrible and has you running through halls.  There are some changes in multiplayer which make it even less balanced. there is one change that is good, but it isn&apos;t worth 60 dollars.</span>

The game is split into three modes;
<br>Campaign
<br>Multi-player
<br>and Zombies
<br>
<br>The campaign gives you the role of playing as a person. I can&apos;t remember the protagonists name, because it&apos;s so bland. The story is pretty much the same as Modern Warfare 3, but somewhere down the line Treyarch went &quot;we need dem feels in the game, guys&quot; and added an extra story mechanic of the protagonists father was shot by his friend. And the actual story we were told about in E3 starts at the second to last level, which ruins the whole game. The Multi-Player is the same, with normal players stuck between TryHard&apos;s and Pro Snipers. And they have nearly ruined the only thing keeping the series alive, Zombies. This time the characters are forgettable, unlike their original counterparts who I still love as a zombie player. The gamemode only still lives thanks to its final DLC, Apocalypse, that brought back Dempsy, Roctoffen, Nickolai and Takeo, and adding a brilliant twist to the storyline. Overall the game is a forgettable mess, that I&apos;m giving a three to so Medal of Honor: Warfighter still has a lower score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3675496">Expand</a></span>

<br>There is a broken point perk system, as used in Treyarch&apos;s BO2, so if you&apos;re not a fan of that, then that might be a negative for you. Though, the same old 1 host advantage lobbies are being used once again, which can and will lead to laggy games, due to being forced to play against people probably not even close to your area.
<br>Graphics look nice, only if you max out all the settings. There&apos;s no in-game option to change field of view, there are mods available but there is uncertainty at the moment whether they are allowed without punishment/ban. All you get for audio options is a level bar to increase or decrease volume. Unlike BO1 &amp; BO2 where you have different audio presets, and can even lower down the volume of annoying voice overs and music.
<br>As I said, this is the same gameplay as the previous games, whether they were IW or Treyarch, and I still have fun with that. So why such a low score? Well, I suppose this might not be IW fault completely, but there is weak PC community for this game. On average, there are 8K players online, other times under 4K, on good days 18K, and 30K on a rare sunny day. I honestly don&apos;t know if those are average numbers for a call of duty game on PC, being that it is my first one on PC. Without dedicated servers, and the previous 6GB RAM requirement (now patched to 4GB), people probably decided to pass on this or just decided to move on to consoles (which average +400K players online), sadly. Cannot recommend, if ever, I would suggest wait till steam itself has a free to play weekend, maybe by then you could see it&apos;s same old same old, but without anybody to play with, at least in PC case.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3811028">Expand</a></span>

Before reinstalling I checked to make sure that the game was saved, and according to Activision the game is saved online. But after reinstalling my game I found that my rank had been reset to 0. I contacted customer support but would they not do anything about it. So basically I have been shafted by Activision. A well deserved 0 score from yet another player who had his stats reset for no reason. I am now certain that I am not the only one, and there are plenty of other reports of this happening. Also now I know that these reports are true. It&apos;s possible it happens to everyone who plays this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3933516">Expand</a></span>

<br>I also know that this is the absolute worst game I have played in the last decade...  maybe longer.
<br>
<br>Crap story, crap graphics and worse gameplay.  Lockups, freezing screens, slow - laggy cutscenes..  and speaking of cutscenes, how stupid can they get?  There&apos;s one that is nothing but blurry images and wastes a few minutes of your day every time it loads..  God-forbid you happen to save there and have to restart...  There should be a way to exit out of them at the very least as they do little to add to the story and a few don&apos;t need to be there at all.  The worst interaction with surrounding goods that I have ever seen.  Riding a horse is little different than flying a F38?  Really?
<br>
<br>I will never, ever, ever buy anything COD again.... ever.
<br>
<br>Ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612061">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I am not recommending you to try this game!</span>

Terrible frame-rate, stuttering that will happen nearly all the time, and overall, it looks like a complete mess. It&apos;s almost like Treyarch out-sourced the PC port. DO NOT BUY ON PC. If you own PS3/4 or 360/One, buy the game on that platform instead.</span>

That created an absolutely new idea and gave a game a new feel - a great schizophrenic experience when you play as a main hero, suffering from his broken sense of reality. Setting was also incredible - hard times all around, war is close to us, country leaders, great countries, everything worked well. I played all of CoD games, and Black Ops was an outstanding achievement - not just fun with a gun, but fun with a brain.
<br>
<br>So, when i heard new Black Ops is on the way i expected that another something incredible will be delivered. And, finally....
<br>It delivered but there&apos;s no nothing that can be described as &quot;delivered&quot;. It has some cloudy connections with first Black Ops, but connections are just meaningless extras - you can remove them and game will be okay with out them because, as i said, they are so cloudy so just don&apos;t make any sense. You&apos;ve got some storyline that too far from words &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;involving&quot; because storyline is way too artificial and make sense just in case you have no another new game to play (my case). Graphics-shmaphics are okay, not better than first part and sometimes looks worse than first part. Militaristic future is boring and repeatable although Afghanian mujaheddins armed with power of horses against some Soviet forces (sorry for a rhyme) are just ridicolous. Main hero is radiating brutality and postive way of thinking, but i didn&apos;t get anything interesting from a character, he&apos;s more like a robot that go down by scenario. Okay, there&apos;re some moments you&apos;ll find catchy but not too catchy to get you play again.
<br>
<br>Et cetere, et cetera, i can call many other silly stuff. Game isn&apos;t worth money they are asking for that, time isn&apos;t worth to spend playing, go get first part and be really happy if you didn&apos;t have a chance before.
<br>
<br>I gave 4 only for time i spent, but...in case another replica of that sort is on the way - i&apos;m not going to buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2803386">Expand</a></span>

Scripted events that don&apos;t let you control, bad ui, cut scenes you can&apos;t easily skip, etc etc. Just a million little things done wrong. Game play sucks too, if I wanted a strat game I would get a strat game. They try to turn a shooter into some type of strat game every other mission. Giant ball of suck!</span>

<br>4. Game is made easier and even more accessible then previous titles, DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY SKILL
<br>5. Price - $60 for a mod is too much
<br>
<br>They will keep making the same game over &amp; over again as long as there&apos;s enough fools to buy it. Next year we will get MW4 and it will be poor but it will probably still manage to get over $500 million in it&apos;s first week.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2774522">Expand</a></span>
