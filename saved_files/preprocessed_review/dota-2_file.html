<br>I have to praise it&apos;s item and stat system though. There are a of items with interesting actives. Also leads don&apos;t mean a lot, you can come back from anything and with buy-back unlike other MOBAs which have many games which are drawn out, boring, predictable, sometimes just a facepalm montage and tedious to play. This game has had tons of time and alterations so I doubt the balance is bad. I felt like I really wasn&apos;t giving it enough credit because I didn&apos;t enjoy it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5633295">Expand</a></span>

I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, I think bot of them are good) Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. I think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. Try it out, its free and badass!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3275323">Expand</a></span>

<br>Very nice looking
<br>Can be fun in some games
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Constantly after money for in-game purchases
<br>Does not fix bugs/glitches very often
<br>Bad community
<br>Competitive (Yes I put this in twice)
<br>Not very much updates
<br>The game can get VERY unbalanced with super strong heroes and super weak ones
<br>Honestly gets a bit boring after a while of playing it
<br>Does not meet the expectations they put out for themselves
<br>Very bad language barrier
<br>Very bad matchmaking (Finding matches suitable for you)
<br>It keeps getting worse over time
<br>Updates contain things that no one wants (I.e.: People ask for events but Dota 2 gives them hats)
<br>Never communicates with the community
<br>Does not update their websites
<br>
<br>Long story short: The games Cons weigh out their pros by a lot. If you wish to play an unbalanced game with people speaking Russian in an English server who are either too inexperienced for your level or have too much experience, then by all means download this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3692152">Expand</a></span>

<br>a year and a half ago this game did deserve a 10/10 score. everything was fine, bugs were fixed (slow but it was something), communication through blogs, the dev forum and social media, Heros were added at a semi regular basis (2-4 Heros in 3 months) and Icefrogs balance patch did kick in in a 6-9 months pattern.

<br>
<br>The only thing we have left is Icefrogs Balance patch. Valve doesnt communicate anymore, the bugfixing is so slow like never (fix 3 bugs and create 15 others) and we had 2 Heros in 8 Months (and we still need 10 to complete the pool).
<br>
<br>i dont really care for Diretide (or the greevling  at christmas) but these 2 Funmods where relaxing after some tough normal matches. but the fact that Valve doesnt communicate and doesnt work on DotA 2 anymore is unaceptable! yes Valve has its own way to work on projects but this half assed  we get now is just a big  YOU in the face to the Community! DotA 2 is the MOST played game on Steam with more than 5 times the players the second place has.
<br>
<br>tl;dr
<br>
<br>i wont recommend playing now! this game doesnt deserve a 10/10 or a 05/10 score... it deserves a -10/10 score. i never did think that i would say this but: League of Legends as it is now is by far the superior game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3694649">Expand</a></span>

The developing process has became really slow, but the worst thing is that they REFUSE to communicate with the community. I used to love everything Valve does, but nowadays it&apos;s just like they are a different company in a very negative way.</span>

However, the only reason I do not give a 10 is that this game still have some bugs and Valve has already released it. Those bugs do damage the game experience.</span>

<br>-The graphics are gorgeous.
<br>-Animations are almost perfect and natural like they&apos;re supposed to be.
<br>-The core mechanics are extremely well-made.
<br>-It&apos;s quite fun at times.
<br>Bad things:
<br>-The matchmaking is a horror. Before you queue up for a game you get to choose the region you want to play in and the language preference, but the game doesn&apos;t really respect that. Almost everyone that played this game already knows this, russians are everywhere, no matter where you play, it can be US, it can be Europe or Asia, russians are everywhere. Now I&apos;ve had some bad experience with these type of players even though I do not wish to generalize but when even the language preference gets ignored when you queue up for a game and you get a game full of russians where only 2 of them speak english.
<br>In my experience, russians are the worst players to have in your team. I am not generalizing here, I know there are exceptions, there are always exceptions but almost everytime I had a russian in my team he didn&apos;t even speak english or he didn&apos;t even try to communicate with his own team besides cursing and  I only wish that I won&apos;t deal with these kind of players in my future games but it&apos;s inevitable since Russia is the prime demographic for dota2 by population.
<br>-The community is toxic, no matter what you, no matter how you do it, the community will always be toxic. It&apos;s a competitive game, it&apos;s completely normal, but man, I&apos;ve encountered some type of players that are the worst human beings in this world. Now I&apos;m speaking about cursing your own teammates or stuff like that, when you try and help someone, or teach them a lesson that apparently they don&apos;t know, their ego inflates so much that he will no longer be a part of your team. Most of them will either leave, feed intentionally by walking right into the enemy and staying there until they kill him or just doing things that generally helps the enemy team more than it helps you (a.k.a. sending the courier into the enemy lines so it will die therefore we cannot transport items and the enemy team earns a bounty for killing our courier, OR even using special items like the force staff to push you into the enemy etc, the list is way too long). Meanwhile there ARE indeed consequences, leaving puts you into low priority for X ammount of time based on your total abandons or abandon spree and reporting players but that doesn&apos;t seem to be enough.
<br>-The reporting system is a spam and that&apos;s it. If someone does not like you, they&apos;ll report you for whatever reason. I don&apos;t know how the reporting system works but sometimes I get into low priority for nothing, literally nothing or nothing that I know about. Do people actually check the replay for every report submission sent? Because that would be way too hard for the devs to do considering it&apos;s players number and the devs number and/or admins.
<br>-The matchmaking is a forced 50%. This means that if you win 9 games in a row, you will lose 9 games in a row and not in the same way. For example today you win 4 times and lose 5 times, tomorrow you&apos;ll lose 3 more times and so on until your win/lose ratio ends up to a roughly 50%. This thing means nothing whatsoever. People who are playing competitive games usually have hopes or are actively practicing games so they could step in the pro scene. Now the way other games in this genre are doing is by adding a ranking system bronze, silver, diamond, cheese, bacon whatever etc that a player can be proud of and show to the team he wishes to enter or to know his current status as a player compared to others. What does the 50% win ratio prove? Absolutely nothing, you&apos;re the same as the other players, it doesn&apos;t matter that you stack with other players and you&apos;re on skype or whatever, you&apos;ll eventually end up with players better than you that will kick you back down and down from the very beggining. The matchmaking should add players of your current skill level so the match would be even. Most games I get are usually one sided stomps that don&apos;t even get to see the 30 minutes mark of the game, which is considered a very important part of the game since there are actually heroes that are good only after that 30 minute mark, also known as hard-carries.
<br>-This game used to have weekly updates with old heroes that needed to be ported into the game, cosmetics so the developers can actually earn money and general gameplay updates and bugfixes. They also used to make events during the obvious holidays of the year, well, most of the time. A year ago DotA2 had an event called Diretide during the Halloween that had a new gamemode added to the game that was Halloween inspired, The Greeviling for the christmas and so on and so forth, but this year, it seems like that has changed. DotA 2 didn&apos;t get any Halloween inspired event at all and in the past 3 months, the game had a single patch besides cosmetics patch.
<br>
<br>I am no longer buying cosmetics from the store until they decide to work on the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3693646">Expand</a></span>

If you play/played League of Legends, DOTA 2 will probably get you to start playing League of Legends again as it did for me.  While most people think the simplified stats make it easier, I find that it just means if your primary stat is intelligence, you&apos;re getting screwed late game.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Very in-depth for this type of game and the champion interaction is refreshing.
<br>- In-game graphics are a lot better than League of Legends and the client loads significantly faster.
<br>- Truly Free to play since you don&apos;t need to unlock champions with any game currency or what not.
<br>- In-game voice chat works well most of the time, although the sensitivity slider has been very buggy.
<br>- Made me appreciate League of Legends more.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Community is the worst since... well... ever...
<br>- The game has a ridiculously steep learning curve and is painful to climb.
<br>- Every champion is overpowered at first so that no thought has to be put into balancing, then late game anyone that relies on abilities gets the shaft since they don&apos;t scale with your stats.
<br>- Turrets hardly seem to do any damage and I&apos;ve seen turret dives at very early levels.
<br>- Losing gold upon death just means you are even further behind then before making the game quickly snowball in the winning team&apos;s favor.
<br>- Denying minions and turrets is also aggravating as heck when you are short on gold.
<br>- Only one map and one mode.
<br>- League of Legends has Runes and Masteries, while not very powerful alone, they do add a lot of customization that dota 2 needs since the only customization at the moment is purely aesthetic.
<br>- The camera sucks... period.  It never zooms back far enough so you end up having to take focus off of your character just to auto-attack.
<br>- Roaming the map is annoying at times since trees are misleading upon which you can walk through and which you can&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Overall:  If you played DOTA 1 and loved it, play DOTA 2.  If you have never played DOTA or even LoL, try League of Legends first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3397749">Expand</a></span>

I wish there was a 9.5). I&apos;ve dedicated over 1400 hours to this game, and probably more in it&apos;s original incarnation of DotA back on the Warcraft 3 engine. NOTE: I will list all the technical aspects first, then go through the bad and mixed after that, and the reasons I absolutely rate this game a 10 will be listed after.
<br>
<br>First off, the game itself is solid. It is mechanically and competitively balanced. There may be certain heroes that are currently favored in both high level public matches and in professional matches, but statistics show that win rates are pretty balanced at the 50% mark.
<br>
<br>Secondly, the aesthetics and graphics are pretty well done. It is clearly a step above the original DotA. However, design style in comparison to other DotA clones are strictly to a user&apos;s preference. I know people who love LoL&apos;s design over Dota2&apos;s and vice versa. The caveat is that these things SHOULD NOT matter. It might get some getting use to, but overall, it will not detract from the experience.
<br>
<br>Thirdly, the (may be) bad. This is true for every ARTS (or MOBA) game out there. There WILL be rude players out there. This is a game where every game counts. Since each match lasts for about 30 minutes to an hour each, a lot of people will only be able to play 1 to 2 games at a time. As such, they are emotionally invested to get the best experience of playing the game every time. Being so will encourage players to be extremely passionate about each match, so when there exists a player who is clearly not up to snuff, a visceral raging will most likely ensue. This leads me up to the next point:
<br>
<br>Fourthly, the mix: This is not a game you can play just play casually forever. This game has a learning curve for EVERY aspect of the game, i.e. heroes, item builds, map control, laning, jungle control, warding, etc. You will SUCK at the beginning. It is inevitable. Everyone who starts this game has to go through it. This is the source of what many people call &quot;Egoism&quot; among veteran players. All of us veterans had to go through periods of mediocrity to be where we are now. We invested hours and hours into not just playing the game, but reading about it outside the game. This means we did homework on reading hero guides, watching replays, looking for tips on ward positions, etc. We went through sort of a &quot;rite of initiation&quot; to attain the personal skill level we are at now. In order for ANYONE to play this game WELL, they&apos;d have to go through the same process over time. However, you will not go through this process alone which is illustrated in the next point.
<br>
<br>Fifthly, the good: The community as a whole is one of the BEST i&apos;ve ever been a part of. This may seem weird after I listed the third point. However, aside from the vicious minority, I&apos;ve largely felt that this is the multiplayer game with the least amount of &quot;a**holes&quot;. I&apos;ve also found that the people who regularly complained about the &quot;horrible&quot; community are also the ones who regularly berates others in game. A bad attitude always begets bad attitude from others. However, this is one community that also LOVES to help new players succeed. People regularly posts guides and videos to help new players out. You just have to search for them. There are alot of resources to be gain from youtube as well. And friends i have that had just started out regularly tells me about their experiences where their teammates and even their opponents would give them tips to perform better each time. It is always best to upfront about your level of expertise, especially if you&apos;re new. This will set your teammates expectations at the appropriate level from the beginning and they&apos;d be able to help you out when you need it. I&apos;ve even seen people offer to train new players.
<br>
<br>Sixth, The game itself has one of the most deepest design I have ever experienced in a game. You know that feeling that after 100 games of COD multiplayer, you&apos;d feel like there&apos;s nothing new anymore? I&apos;ve played this game (Dota2 and DotA) for 8 years and I&apos;m still learning something new and subtle everyday. What sets this game apart from the other ARTS games is the things you DONT see on the surface. Everything is manipulatable, which translates to the evolution of a large variety of strategies that continues to expand after so many years. Things like creep pulling, stacking, lane control, etc are little nuances that may seem irrelevant to the untrained eye, but as you evolve as a player, you&apos;d realize these little things help so much in the metagame. In extreme cases in high level play, a game can be said to be one from the moment you pick your heroes. This high level of strategic thinking is something other multiplayer games cannot achieve and is something is refined and evolved from community enacted plays over these years.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m running out of space to write more about this game. Just know this, this game is WORTH IT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3307610">Expand</a></span>

<br>On the other hand this game got horrible community full of nerds raging just about anything. If you  want to start plaing this game, or got friend who who wants to start play this game, get prepared for raging nerds. I really didnot seen so many ragin idiots in dota 1, well i guest its because it was Warcraft 3 mod, but this game got the worst community i ever seen. Even CoD community is great in compare to Dota 2 community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3313613">Expand</a></span>

So let me bring this up as a Dota2 ex DotA and HoN and LoL player.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re transitioning from league of legends, you don&apos;t have to worry about runes or stuff like that, since any imbalance caused by that is no trouble to us, secondly, you have ALL the heroes/champions. You can experiment without playing x amount of games for a 6300 IP champion, and doing that about 50 times  but you have to keep in mind that DotA has more advanced mechanics and is more punishing.
<br>
<br>If you are saying that this games changes you, it&apos;s not the game that changes you, it&apos;s yourself letting changed by the nature of the game, you become more competitive and forgetting that you are playing with other players.
<br>
<br>While I do admit DotA  has some minor issues as to the matchmaking system but it&apos;s not extremely easy to asses each player&apos;s skill and their improvement, it&apos;s never been done by machines with 100% success we have to be patient.
<br>F
<br>And lastly, please do not talk about the game if you didn&apos;t play it extensively and competitively, since some reviews say that vote of surrender IS a feature in dota 2 (it&apos;s not). Don&apos;t follow the ragers that critic everything just for the sake of being cynical.
<br>
<br>All in all this is a REALLY strong game with each hero being unique and strong in itself but keep in mind the advanced mechanics, and if you are new, try practicing with bots, they are pretty okay to start, read guides, don&apos;t assume you&apos;re the all knowing guy and  see you in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3280454">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are amazing too and the community has been quite helpful so far (even though some people say otherwise).

<br>I totally recommend this game to any MOBA fan.</span>

Very interesting heros and mechanics, nice graphics, nearly no bugs, big communitiy which brings new content. Personally I would like to have a vote-surrender system like in LoL, but I see that this is not the philosophy of DOTA2 and i totally accept it.</span>

<br>
<br>I have noticed in other reviews they talk of the trash talking community; ALL team games will have douche bags though dota compared to its counterparts is not as bad. You can easily mute unwanted language.
<br>
<br>This game is truly free to play. It&apos;s pay to look cool and some of the cosmetics you can purchase (or receive as drops after games) are truly  amazing! you also have a say of what will be sold in the store by voting on potential items in the steam workshop.
<br>
<br>all in all Dota 2 is a demanding game and you will suck at first. Keep with  it though and prepare for one of the gaming experiences.... oh and say goodbye to all other games!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3322041">Expand</a></span>

They constantly release patches which only contain hats, they don&apos;t even pay enough attention to the game to release annual holiday patches. For example they completely forgot about Halloween in Dota 2 while adding Halloween content in Tf2 and CS:GO. Overall the Dota game in Wc3 is a masterpiece but Dota 2 is a garbage can due to Valves apathetic development. They are only making this game to milk people for money by adding hats and tickets.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3689917">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ll just list everything great about this game:
<br>
<br>the aesthetics are great, the art and the graphics are gorgeous, the competition feel is big. The replay-ability of the game is infinite.
<br>
<br>Most importantly  it&apos;s free, so just install Steam and install it as soon as possible.</span>

<br>to me it satisfies my hunger for really great PVP orientated  RPG Fantasy type games... taht dont&apos; suck up all your life like World of Warcraft Arathi Basin etc etc.
<br>
<br>i have to admit i played this game since it was called Aeon of Strife... so i guess i dont&apos; have to worry about the learning curve.</span>

I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think it will help new comers. I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, I think bot of them are good) Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. I think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. Try it out, its free and badass!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3286274">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s right, Dota 2 is not like most other games and that&apos;s because it&apos;s very complex, so be patient, learn the mechanics and once it&apos;s in your system then you&apos;ll start having a hell lot of fun. I wouldn&apos;t recommend it if you&apos;re a casual gamer and can&apos;t be bothered to invest that time. If that&apos;s the case and you want to play a MOBA then that&apos;s where LoL comes in. If you already play LoL and want something more challenging and more rewarding then by all means try Dota 2. Plus it has way better graphics, great character customization and doesn&apos;t require any money to unlock heroes (which I find very frustrating in LoL). It is also more balanced imo. As for the community, well it&apos;s still a MOBA so don&apos;t expect too much, although it&apos;s not so bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3275168">Expand</a></span>

The down side to it&apos;s complexity is the super steep learning curve, and lack of anything really useful for learning in game.  There are a huge amount of characters and effective builds for them.  It can take quite a while memorize and become comfortable with all of it, but it&apos;s well worth the price.  Low ranking matches can be quite frustrating with how long a rounds are.  New and confused teammates will take out frustration on each other, but mid-high level players all have social skills and communicate effectively.  The low level community is one of the worst I have seen in a game, yet the high level community is one of the best.  Overall I think the game&apos;s complexity, and balance results in one of the best online multiplayer experiences you can get, but Free 2 Play isn&apos;t actually free as it will require a substantial time investment.  It&apos;s a brilliant and polished game on so many levels, but until Valve develops a more effective teaching method I don&apos;t think it deserves a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3303727">Expand</a></span>

I have played LoL, DOTA, DOTA 2 and some lesser known MOBAs and DOTA 2 is by far the best. In addition, it is F2P which is amazing. And unlike, LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to purchase a single hero, DOTA 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. In LoL as of the date of this post, it would cost $588 to unlock all heroes with real money. (15000RP/$100, total cost heroes 88185 RP. This calculation excludes bundles)
<br>
<br>Each character has a unique playstyle and skillset, and doesn&apos;t feel like a clone of another character or a cheap rip off. Every character plays a certain role well, and plays it uniquely. Playing well leads to great rewards, and playing poorly has severe consequences.
<br>
<br>There are issues with DOTA 2, the biggest being there is a huge learning curve and you are going to start out being bad if you don&apos;t have previous DOTA experience. Learning characters skills, what items do, and what you should be doing early mid and late game initially may be overwhelming. However, doing research and practicing eventually pay off as DOTA 2 is truly one of the most challenging and highest skill cap games available. Valve is also implementing (or has implemented) a tutorial, but there is no way the sheer amount of information needed is contained within it. But I&apos;m sure its a great place to start.
<br>
<br>Graphics are great. Gameplay is great. Servers seem lag free. Crashes are very rare. ITS FREE!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3279112">Expand</a></span>

<br>Negative:
<br>- horrible communities that focus only on &quot;winning&quot;, if you make a mistake/newbie then you&apos;ll get horrible f*** words. I pity new people who join the game. The game is no longer game for fun.
<br>- horrible matchmaking, you won&apos;t get matched with people similar with your skill. So the game will be very unbalanced for the player skills. You can play 8 games and get straight win because the enemies are too weak, and likewise.
<br>- reports are not thouroughly analyzed. Example: 4 party team  me (outsider). They died and kept feeding, I advice them with really polite and gentle words, they are pissed because they lose, they report, I get muted (because they&apos;re 4 people reports versus me alone).
<br>- too many pauses to wait people with horrible connections, 1 game minimum a 5-10 minutes pauses (of total 30-40 minutes of game play  30% of your time waiting people to reconnect)

Its true that its hard to master the game but Its very interesting and fun to master each hero. As you get to learn that each character is situational and not the same.

I know people can be a bit hostile, I am too, that is because in this game, if someone mess it up real hard, then you most likely lose the game. People have to know which role they are playing and play it at its best in order to win the game, but also, if you play perfectly but your team or some mates doesn&apos;t then you probably won&apos;t win the game, and if you are competitive like me, then you will get mad haha. But try it out, DotA has a matchmaking system so you will play with other people with the same skills as you probably, you will stand a chance there, and eventually get more skilled.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3285394">Expand</a></span>

If I were to laud two improvements, it would be the matchmaking system and the shop in the game.</span>

This free-to-play game will provide you hundreds and possibly thousands of hours of pure multiplayer bliss. Dota is a very complex game with an enormous learning curve, and you will need to dedicate your time and your attention to this game if you want to be good at it. Thankfully Valve has made really neat tutorial levels that will introduce you to the game. There are also dozens of guides online that will help you.
<br>
<br>The goal of the game is simple: destroy the enemy&apos;s main building: the Ancient. There are two sides competing. The Dire and The Radiant. Each side contains five players. Upon entering a matchmade game you will be placed on the either side. After that you will pick prompted to pick your hero, amongst a selection of literally 100+. You will then buy your starting items and head down the lane (called &quot;mid, &quot;bottom&quot; or &quot;top&quot;) that you choose. You will then look to kill enemy &quot;creeps&quot;, which are AI-controled monsters that periodically spawn from the base and head down each lane, and enemy heroes. Gradually you should look to destroy enemies&apos; towers, after you have become more powerful. After you have destroyed the enemies&apos; towers and their barracks, their Ancient will be exposed to attacks and you will be a able to destroy it.
<br>
<br>Dota contains almost limtless amount of ways you can play. The heroes, the roles they fill, the items, they are all so different, you are guaranteed to not get bored. From heroes that support their team like Crystal Maiden, to heroes who &quot;carry&quot; their team like Phantom Lancer, across assassins like Bounty Hunter, &quot;pushers&quot; like Nature&apos;s Prophet Dota will provide you a different experience every single match you play.
<br>
<br>As a free to play title it contains absolutely no ways for paying customers to have advantage over non-paying ones. All heroes will be available to you when you start playing. There are simply no buy-to-win elements in the game. What paying customers buy is cosmetic items, whose purpose is just to look pretty. This means you can choose from a collection of different sets of items to customize the way your favorite hero looks, and you can also buy different looks for your HUD and different voices for your annoucner. Did I mention this cosmetic items are available without paying money too? When you play a match of Dota, you are awarded experience and when you have enough experience you will level up, and as your reward you will get a cosmetic item. You can also trade your cosmetic items with other players, in case they have something you like.
<br>
<br>The amount of detail Valve has put in this game is astounishing. Every hero has their own theme, their story. The heroes are funny and always have an interesting line to say. Every hero has their own unique character. There are even rival heroes for example Lina and Crystal Maiden, two twin sisters, one who specializes in fire and other in ice. If they are playing against one another or are in the same team, they will say different lines to each other. Another example is Zeus who is a literal God, and will constantly make fun out the puny mortals he is pittied against. Anti-Mage, little to no surprise, has a quest to destroy all magic and will constistantly loathe magic users throught the game.
<br>
<br>Games are unpredictable. One team may be in the lead one moment, and then lose their advantage the next moment. This game punishes you harshly for making mistakes and rewards you greatly for making the right decision. Teamwork is the key to victory. You will need to communicate with your team and make plans together  if you want to win.
<br>
<br>The communtiy of this game is not the best, but it is to be expected of a free-to-play game available to everyone. You WILL run across players who will be angry at you one way or the other, and will maybe throw harsh words your way. My advice is just to report them (open up the scoreboard, click then name and then report) and move on. As you gain in skill you will gain in your victories, and when you gain victories you will be put to play against better people. The higher you go in MMR (which is the system game uses to determine your skill) the nicer people will become.
<br>
<br>You should definately this game a try, after all it is free to do so. But trust me, you will get hooked on this game and it will certianly take away a large portion of your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3289821">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Game is focused on gameplay but graphics are very decent.If you are coming from other games of this genre, it may take some time getting used to graphics.For those thinking that graphics are dark and wondering why,there is very good explanation.Terrain is dark so there is greater contrast between terrain and abillity particles(usually bright) so teamfights are more clear.Steam Workshop did a very good job making cosmetics for heroes, making heroes look even better.
<br>
<br>As for gameplay its a true skill based game.There are no bonuses you get by spending money and all heroes are playable from start.Game balance is almost perfect(Out of 96 available heroes on tournaments 96 are played at least once in last month).The most amazing thing about Dota 2 is amount of strategies you can play, synergies between heroes, lane combos you can play with friends.Even when you think that everything is hopeless and want to give up, with good timing and team coordiantion  you can turn around every game(that is why there is no surrender option in Dota 2).
<br>The best side of game is it&apos;s complexity and in same time it is the worst.There are lot of mechanics that are very important and that you have to know to be a decent player, but once you learn them you will find them very clever and fun.All heroes have strong ability kits and are fun to play.Heroes are very different with very different playstyle, even playing against some hereos require different playstyle.Some heroes are easier to play then others so you may find them stronger at beginning but as you advance as player and learn how to deal with them you will realise they are not that good.Although game is updated every week, there are only couple of balance patches a year.Many people dislike fact that there are 4-5 new heroes added each year, but development team philosophy is to add heroes not for the sake of adding, but to improve the game.
<br>
<br>As for community I must say its very complex.Some people will rage at you, blame you, even troll you.I think that is kinda expected from online F2P game, but as you play more games you will get bigger MMR(match make rating) and you will rarely see this kind of people.Since there is report system most of ragers and trolls are banned/muted.Many people will complain about community, but in reality community is much more mature and friendly then in other F2P multiplayer games.
<br>
<br>DotA/Dota 2 as an Esport is a game played at almost every Esport event.In my opinion its in Top 3 Esport(others are Starcraft and Counter-Strike) of all time.Biggest tournament is The International which gathers best teams of the world to compete for 2-3 million dollars prize pool.Dota 2 scene is constantly growing, and it is a game that is very fun to watch (You can even bet with Cosmetic items on some sites making watching games even more fun).Games are watchable through in-game Dota 2 TV that is most amazing spectator client i have ever seen.You can watch games through player&apos;s perspective that alows you to see every action of player you are watching (His Cursor ,Screen...),listen to your favorite commentators and there is option to see different  type of graphs and statistics available.
<br>
<br>It is highly recommended to play tutorial before playing against other players.Since at beginning you are matched with players who also created new account your first 10-20 games might be against DotA veteran or complete noobs,but it will get better after those ten game.Bad games can happen to everyone(even professional players have bad games from time to time), so If you play bad in some game and feed just say you are sorry and 99% of time team won&apos;t flame you.Watching guids helps a lot aswell (Purge and Merlini Recomended).There are even mini-guides created by community you can find ingame in top-left corner.Playing this kind of game with friends is much better.By the way if you don&apos;t know Russian you will learn a great deal of it (trust me :D).
<br>
<br>At the end Dota 2 is not the game you will play and master in couple of hours.Skillcap is enormous and even professional players can&apos;t play all heroes very well.Every game of Dota 2 is a new lesson that will improve you as a player.If you are looking for game to play without spending much time learing it ,this is not the game you are looking for.
<br>
<br>Note:Some reviews will bash this game,players and mechanics although they never played it before.Its  mostly because of rivalry betwen Dota 2 and LoL.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3287201">Expand</a></span>

To win you need to practice more and more but trust me, it will take days, months or even years to be a master player and that&apos;s mostly the goal of almost all Dota 2 players: compete to the top (for fun)!

This Game is complex  deep with varying heroes  abilities  items  item builds and interaction between each of the above said.
<br>
<br>My best advice to new players is stick to easy heroes like Lion  sniper  Earth Shaker  Ursa  Axe  lich  viper etc. Try to use in game guides .
<br>
<br>I have spent about 1100  hours and almost 1000 games played. Still i learn something new in this game.
<br>Knowledge is wealth in this game. The more you know about your hero  items  the better you can do in the game.
<br>
<br>If you do want to play other games in future  don`t play this game. Once you cross the &quot;critical line&quot; (about 20-30 matches)  i doubt you would rarely play any other game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3287451">Expand</a></span>

Why it&apos;s still in beta? There are still missing heroes from the original dota (heroes that have not been ported yet), there are several missing options in the option tab, you have to edit some cfg to change them, game is poorly optimized (memory leaks that force you to restart the it after 1 single game), there are graphical artefacts caused by the engine, matchmaking is a joke (they explain how mmr works but that only shows how an 1500 mmr player end up in same team with a 3000 mmr player something that is completly wrong), when a hero spawn the game freeze, if you alt+tab the game in win xp and try to get back you end up with a blank screen and only way to get back ingame is to end task dota 2, some heroes are overpowered big time and in the last 2-3 patches nothing has been done to adress this problem, drop system is badly implemented trools, flamers, feeders get legendary and mythical items while decent and good players barely get a rare from time to time, 3 posible reports  week is a bad joke for someone that play 5 games  day because on average he will have to report 1 player  game, mute system is badly implemented cause it cripples a team game cause the one muted is matched with unmuted players and he can&apos;t talk/answer to them, dispate the fact that the game has not implemented heroes from dota 2 valve works on cosmetics, extremely poor qualy hero graphic (abadon, omg extremely bad quality base graphic for this hero), no communication from devs part, devs refuse to listen comunity (take for example diretide 2013 there is a topic with more the 200 pages and no dev answered if there will be diretide 2013 or not, not that they answer to something), &quot;balance patches&quot; that don&apos;t balance anything but make some overpowered abilities even more stronger (aghanim buff for doom) and add useless things (aghanim for disruptor, disruptor is a support hero he will not get the farm for aghanim during an average game...). Those are the main reasons that make me score 2/10, it&apos;s so low because that&apos;s the score i gave to any game that is officialy released dispate the fact that it&apos;s in beta and has tones of problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3688596">Expand</a></span>

Juking around trees is easier and feels more natural, smooth animations allow for much easier last hitting, beautiful visual effects with the exception of a few hero models but the game is still treated like a beta by the devs so they&apos;re constantly working on improving things. The match making is a bit flawed at the moment but it will get fixed. The pay model is great as you have the hole game for FREE without having to buy anything which may give you even 1% advantage over the enemy which is great. Most of the cosmetics are great and those that are implemented and hated on by the community get removed(of course who bought them will keep them though). I can talk about a lot of things but I just wanted to cover a few things Dota2 has improved from Dota1. It&apos;s a very fun and challenging game which I recommend you try out(but first please play the tutorial).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3288611">Expand</a></span>

Korea w/ Starcraft. I really believe this. Valve has done a simply amazing job of bringing the game over into its own while retaining the character and solid mechanics of its WC3 counterpart. It&apos;s a highly challenging game that will immerse you for hours, the support of the pro scene is phenomenal, and the little holiday events that Valve puts on just ads to the charm of the game. The characters are well developed and feel unique not only in their gameplay styles, but also in their personalities. They do not feel static, but feel very alive, just like an RPG should. It&apos;s the perfect blend. If you&apos;re into games that are addicting, have high skill caps, e-sports, team play, and community, then definitely try DotA. The community CAN be a little brutal sometimes, but once you find some good, mature, and patient friends to play with, that&apos;s when this game really shines. Their matchmaking system would be my only complaint. They are still sorting it and are actively looking at ways to improve it, but it&apos;s really put a damper on the game since its launch. The temporary issues with MM aside, this game is an absolute masterpiece. What could you expect from Valve though? These guys are the new Blizzard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3295398">Expand</a></span>

This game has so many layers and layers of complexities and balances over the many years it has existed and the constant reworks and the amount of changes to maps and heroes, causing some to be removed from the game, but now it&apos;s pretty balanced with Frog just playing with the meta around. You can say the learning curve for dota is steep, but it starts to get worth it when you are able to play the game at a decent level, and even more when you conquer the steep mountain from an amateur to possibly a professional, not that I am one, I am still on that steep, steep curve but I can still enjoy dota :D. hope you enjoy this game.
<br>So far I have abt 1k dota 2 games, and I am still planning to play many more, hope to see you people there.

I have become perhaps a novice. I&apos;ve not even played all and definitely not learned all of the characters. There is one map I still discover new tricks on. Not to mention it is updated and patched once if not more weekly. The market thrives without giving any real benefit but cosmetics. The underground market with its own prices is so large that there are betting sites with items and money. People will pay thousands for the right items. Then you have all of the live feeds and tournaments. All of which you can watch from any perspective. I could go on forever about this game. This game requires forever to go into detal. This is the best game ever created. Bow to your new God.

Every year new game releases turn up in a cartwheel of hype, everyone buys them like no tomorrow or maybe not, but they do sell regardless. If you look back, you&apos;ve probably amassed a lot of games, completed a ton of those, but can you still name them all? Do you still play them? Were they worth the price tag? When I was a kid, I used to play a bunch of games like Populous, Dungeon Keeper, Theme Hospital, Beasts &amp; Bumpkins, Age of Empires, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Brood War, Command and Conquer: Red Alert, Heroes of Might and Magic III and a bunch of other games of the time. While I enjoyed them a lot, I eventually didn&apos;t get any kind of fresh feeling out of those. While I enjoyed them while they were new and some a bit longer than that, they sooner or later ran out of content. Playing the same things over and over again turned tedious. Newer games, say, Diablo III, gave me about 2 weeks worth of stuff (chest simulation) to do. Hype was massive, reviews were optimistic, but games nowadays tend to be released like that. They have eye candy, but they&apos;re really hollow in the end. I never returned to that game. I never returned to Guild Wars 2. I will never play Bioshock Infinite again. Won&apos;t be playing Darksiders II, won&apos;t be playing Fallout 3. Won&apos;t be playing Oblivion or Mass Effect. Now this game, it merely got a facelift, hence the number 2, in case you have never played the original user made map inside Warcraft III. I&apos;ve however stuck with it for 7-8 years now and I am not tired of it. I am not tired of it because I haven&apos;t got a set final goal or task. That&apos;s something most games have. They have a plot, chapters, maps or stages and when you&apos;re done with them, it is over. I was slightly hesitant to give a perfect 10, because that means perfection to me, but in all honesty, I have never played anything that has even come close to bringing as much joy, ordeal, satisfaction and gratification as this game, so I am going to give it that score. It has the right to get it from me. I got into the beta around October 2011. I have over 4000 hours played. Some has been just chatting, watching games and such, but I am nearing 3000 matches played regardless. I don&apos;t think a poor game can make anyone stick with it for that long. No mods yet besides some useless audio mods as jokes, but nothing that could keep you playing other games a bit longer. Just the original content. I don&apos;t even think the community is such a pain in the ass.
<br>At least 95% of all the people in the world are snap judgmental  that aren&apos;t afraid to step on you if they get any kind of benefit or gratification out of it, but that fact alone doesn&apos;t seem to make people want to quit life. It&apos;s a team game, thus you probably should have a team or any group of players to play this with, if you are sensitive to the opinions of strangers. It&apos;s a game that doesn&apos;t fit a casual gamer, the kind of person who plays Angry Birds, Bejeweled or some other time sink of the kind, but it is a fantastic game for people who really are vehemently into games, the kind of niche group that played games before they entered a market of people who need their hands held. I think reviewing games of this nature is a bit hard at the moment, because it&apos;s being compared to things where you can choose how easy you want the game to be on you. I think grading Dota is like grading ice hockey. To play, you actually need to know how to use skates, how, when and where to shoot, what doesn&apos;t work and such. If you have no talent or are in no shape or form and can&apos;t be bothered to gain any of that with sheer will, you&apos;re not going to progress. You can&apos;t progress by hitting OK, as the game is testing you and your abilities. Even bad players can enjoy it regardless. They just need to accept the fact that games of this kind won&apos;t unravel spontaneously before them. The game itself plays a minimal part as your margin for error is at least as big as the skill of your opponent is. The fact that losing and winning is completely up to human co-operation and wits is something that keeps me playing. Casual games can be fun for a while, but they lack something that is essential for longevity and that is intense competition, complex tactics and a desire for knowledge. I might be up for a match of Mario Party with some beer, but I wouldn&apos;t do that for months every day or every second day. Maybe the beer, but easy and simple things just get stale fast, as they don&apos;t stimulate your brain when they become clear. I&apos;ll gladly discuss this game with my friends with a pint, reminisce our big plays, horrible feeding games, make fun of each other for our horrible stats in some games, flaunt how we completely demolished some pro or some total  we&apos;ve all played with, think of good drafts, which pros are huge noobs and so on. Other games are just games to me. I am not into speed running or to any stuff of that sort, so they&apos;re just one-night stands to me. To me Dota is a hobby.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3286966">Expand</a></span>

<br>I can probably go on about how good it is for ages but ill skip to what brings it down. This is nothing to do with the game itself although allot of people blame the matchmaking system, it just the players and how they react to you. Everyone believes there a pro and that someone else is letting there team down. Valve have put allot of effort into trying to prevent people from &quot;flaming&quot; or just deliberately messing up the game with their system of reporting and low priority pools, and i think it works for i&apos;m pretty scared of leaving a game. People complain about being base camped but in my opinion that&apos;s one of the funny bits it easy to get kills and can you provide you with fun because you no longer care about loosing while the other team will hate having to take a death. So just go out and annoy them :).
<br>Another problem which cause me problems on Dota is some of the people playing it. There so insulting, blaming people for everything just because there loosing asking people to report you. Just ignore it have fun because most of the time there will be some nice people on the team who are just here to enjoy the game so enjoy the little things, from daring escapes to denies. because at the end of the day there going to be the one sat at there computer raging while your just enjoying this great experience valve provides. If it really bugs you get a friend with you and just make fun of them in your own private chat or something. Work on trying to annoy the other team than focusing on them, because loosing teaches you more than wining so don&apos;t get annoyed about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3291967">Expand</a></span>

<br>dota often has 7x less spectators than league of legends  that says a lot.
<br>most people in dota have 4-5 accounts for trading and queue skipping, this makes the game look bigger than it is. Theirs only 10% of people logged in who are actually playing in game, most idle in chat or trading.
<br>The best thing about dota is the graphics are great so i do hope dota wins but they need to support the casual community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3516947">Expand</a></span>

There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1. I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think it will help new comers.</span>

I was wrong. The players in this game are ridiculous. They talk like COD 8 year olds, but they are actually more around 15, a very terrible combination. However, on to the game, it is very fun. So many heroes ensure many different games. In other words, you can play one hero every time and still be a unique player. The learning curve is pretty ridiculous, but if you find a hero or two you really like you don&apos;t have learn too many powers or items.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dota-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3278099">Expand</a></span>
