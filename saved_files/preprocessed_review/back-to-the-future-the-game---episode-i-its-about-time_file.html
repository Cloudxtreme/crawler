The only problem some might have with the game is that those who buy it now are only getting 2-4 hours worth of gameplay. THE PRICE INCLUDES EVERY EPISODE! So you will get a notification whenever the second is available and be able to download it without any further cost.  Also, some might be turned-off by the point and click adventure format. Again; if you&apos;re not a die hard BTTF fan the game will probably underwhelm you. All that said, the story is excellent, and it is very rewarding to put together the actions to complete each task. The voice acting from Lloyd is great as expected and the Fox sound-a-like is outstanding. If you love the series and bought the new blu-ray (which will give you the first episode for free in Feb.) this is a perfect companion piece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/back-to-the-future-the-game---episode-i-its-about-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=1456975">Expand</a></span>

Story is ok (even if a little repetitive). I liked the characters and voice acting. Gameplay-wise it&apos;s a run-of-the-mill point and click adventure, no surprises. It&apos;s mildly entertaining, but  feels a bit too mechanical to me. Characters often lack context and motivation. Puzzles are hit and miss. All in all, the game is enjoyable if you have reasonable expectations.
<br>
<br>Now, what I want from a game like that is a lot of polish; solid, 100% frustration-free gameplay. Unfortunately it&apos;s not always the case. First, movement is screwed up. On occasion it feels like walking through a maze with invisible walls that you need to &quot;feel&quot; your way around. E.g., can&apos;t cross the street here, need to walk a bit to the left and cross there, although there is no visible obstacle of any kind. Why!? Camera adds to the confusion. Important locations can be hard to spot, because camera provides no clue. E.g., need to walk straight to the camera to suddenly find yourself in some alley that was completely invisible before. This is what I call &quot;frustrating&quot;. Shame on you, Telltale.
<br>
<br>On a few occasions I failed to figure out puzzles, not because they were too hard, but because I failed to trigger some arbitrary game event. Not good either.
<br>
<br>Also, why there are so many &quot;action&quot; sequences? I get it, it&apos;s an adventure. But they&apos;re all kinda samey and lack tension. Monkey Island had sword fights and they were fun. Action sequences - not so much.
<br>
<br>Overall, meh+. I still plan to try the 3rd episode. Should be ok. I am not terribly excited about it though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/back-to-the-future-the-game---episode-i-its-about-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=2557562">Expand</a></span>

The game only took me three hours to complete, which is very short compared to most games.  Out of a $50 game, people generally expect at least 20 hours.  So to only get three from a $25 game is a big let down.  However, since the release I have seen some stores price it at $20, which is a tad more reasonable.<br><br>My second complaint is that I&apos;m going to have to wait until near the end of next year to play part five, and the conclusion of this awesome game!

This is the same scheme they used for Sam and Max and Monkey Island.    Episode 1 will be available for individual purchase around the time Episode 2 comes out, probably for about $7-8.  Until then you can only pre-purchase the entire season, but it will save you money in the long run.<br><br>Now onto the game review:  Overall, a satisfying experience for Back to the Future fans, and fans of other TellTale games.  The puzzles take some thought but none are too difficult to solve on your own.  The built in hint system, if you choose to use it, gives enough info without giving it away.   I saw a few glitches pop-up but nothing serious (although I did here a report of one possible game breaking bug, so be sure to save on a regular basis)   All of the Back to the Future cliches are there-- ancestors of George McFly and Biff Tannen, a Manure incident, the clock tower/courthouse, as well as connections to some other side characters.    As for things that are missing - there&apos;s no explanation yet as to where Clara is (this is supposed to be 6 months after BttF III), and no one from Marty&apos;s mother&apos;s family has shown up yet, but that may come in a later episode.  Anyway, it&apos;s a fun casual game that you can play in one sitting if you have a few hours, or wait you can play it in short spurts.  If I had any wish for future episodes, its that they will be a little longer and have a few more challenging (but not insane) puzzles.  The one thing I&apos;ve always found lacking in Telltale games is multiple ways to get to the same point, sometimes with different endings as a result (See King&apos;s Quest 5 for a game that did this really well), but they are one of the very few companies keeping the adventure game genre alive so I still love them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/back-to-the-future-the-game---episode-i-its-about-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=1469141">Expand</a></span>

Now, the game isn&apos;t perfect, obviously. The episode is short (it took me only a little under 2 hours) and the puzzles aren&apos;t challenging, that&apos;s a shame coming from Telltale. My second complaint is that the setting you&apos;re in feels very stale. Maybe it&apos;s just the time period, but it bored me. The voice work in this game is fantastic, and a special nod to Christopher Lloyd and AJ LoCasio for their stellar performances. If you&apos;re a telltale fan, you&apos;ll love it for the (light) gameplay. If you&apos;re a Back to the Future fan, you&apos;ll play it for the story that continues the saga without causing any time paradoxes. If you&apos;re a fan of both...well, you&apos;re in for a treat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/back-to-the-future-the-game---episode-i-its-about-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=1460883">Expand</a></span>

The explanations doc brown gives are classic back to the future. The voice acting for Marty is amazing. I laughed more than a few times, and there is one particular scene in which I actually thought I experienced something truly original in a gaming experience that stretches back to the early 80&apos;s I won&apos;t give anything away but it has something to so with making something.<br><br>It&apos;s a very easy game as far as the puzzles, however I truly had fun with it and was only disappointed in the length, FAR too short! I was finished under 2 hours but man what a good time!

The interface leaves a little to be desired as sometimes getting where you want to go can be less than perfect, but these minor annoyances are more than made up for by the game&apos;s intelligent puzzles and genuinely entertaining story.<br><br>In fact the story feels much like the movie, but with a completely original plot that introduces some new characters (such as a young Emmitt Brown) and of course old favourites like George McFly and the Tannens.<br><br>Probably my favourite aspect of the game, though, is how accurate the model of the Delorean is.

When I went back and tried to do anything other than what the &quot;correct&quot;(and, frankly, stupidly obvious) solution was to these badly-made puzzles, the game hit me with a vague &quot;I can&apos;t do that with that&quot; dialog.  There are points when things happen in the story for no reason, they&apos;re just triggered by entirely unrelated and arbitrary triggers.  There are times when entire sections of the game world are cut off from you for no reason, including one point where an invisible wall is put up in front of an OPEN FENCE that you&apos;re normally allowed to walk through.  You don&apos;t PLAY this game, you watch a badly-animated movie and then click on something to continue.<br><br>Insipid and intellectually insulting, don&apos;t bother with this piece of garbage.

Very enjoyable, but short and somewhat disjointed. I want to play the second episode now, for the story, but also in the hope that it gets even better.

Gameplay is NOT the core, its a simple point and click adventure, the fun is meant in the figuring out the situations and following the plot. I really liked the movie, and this little game did not disappoint, it has the feeling and humor of it.</span>

There were no notable performance issues that i experienced. Voice acting was very good i thought, the actor sounded very much like Marty, i wasnt as impressed with the graphics styles though</span>

I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game to anybody that hasn&apos;t seen or doesn&apos;t like the movies though. The game is not very challenging, especially when you have a hint system that doesn&apos;t punish you in any way. There&apos;s also a number of problems with the game engine, since every now and then the screen freezes for a second, and I know that I am not the only one with this problem. That problem doesn&apos;t break the game though, but can be a little annoying at times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/back-to-the-future-the-game---episode-i-its-about-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=3226150">Expand</a></span>

Having grown up on the movies, I loved just playing around in the world. A lot of the graphics and puzzles are really engaging, at the end of the day the game feels like it was put together on something of a tight budget and that shows in the levels/settings (which get re-used over and over with touch ups as you travel back and forth in time). Now balance that with the fact that Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Emmett Brown?

The story, which should be the star of the game, is often confusing and always uninteresting. It continually drags and you will have no interest in seeing what happens next. The biggest problem, however, is that the game just isn&apos;t that fun. It has a couple spots, brief spots, where you want to play. Other than that, the game is just a complete drag.
