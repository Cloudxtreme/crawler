They kept that a secret for as long as possible and while they said Clementine was going to be back, when asked if she was going to be playable too they were always very vague up until the game was released. Smart from their part, because Clem is only playable for less than 10 minutes in 2 episodes and obviously, fans weren&apos;t happy. And she&apos;s only playable in flashbacks too, and speaking of which,are the most obnoxious thing Telltale has ever done to date. Dealing with Season 2&apos;s endings in a 5 minute flashback by killing off the remaining characters in the most terrible way possible, making the endings completely useless and basically sh*t on everyone&apos;s choices. They didn&apos;t even put any effort in trying to make Kenny, Edith and Jane LOOK like their former selves in season 2. Their models look absolutely terrible and it&apos;s honestly insulting to the fans that they thought those flashbacks were good enough to put on the game.
<br>
<br>But anyway, Telltale decided that it was best to throw away 2 seasons of investment and character development by pushing Clementine aside in favor of a random dude with a family that we are suddenly supposed to care about. TWD honestly became all about Clementine to me. In season 1 we have to protect her and teach her how to survive, in season 2 we get to play as her and shape her to be the character we want. In the meantime we watch her grow, both physically and mentally and in season 3 we get to see her become a young woman. So many opportunities right there. I honestly thought that we were going to get to play as her until she grows to be an adult. Not a lot of games do that, where you get to follow a character and watch them grow and adapt to a new world. Why Telltale decided to get rid of that is beyond me. Bringing a new established character that has been surviving in the apocalypse for 4 years with his family just doesn&apos;t work for me. Javier&apos;s intentions are all about protecting his family, but why should I care for them? I didn&apos;t get to develop these bonds between the characters and it certainly doesn&apos;t help when they are as bland and generic as Gabe and Kate are. The typical &quot;bad stepmother&quot; that has a bad attitude and doesn&apos;t know how to raise kids and that was abused by the husband. The stereotypical moody teenage boy who whines about trivial things 4 years into the apocalypse. That&apos;s another thing that bugs me about this family. They are completely oblivious and innocent, which is just not believable. They run into a trailer full of supplies and a bed and they aren&apos;t smart enough to put two and two together and come to the conclusion that someone lives there? Am I supposed to believe this family never run into bad people in 4 years?? That and the stupid sh*t they do, like running in an open field in the middle of a gunfire. That&apos;s bad writing, it makes your characters look stupid and not relatable.
<br>
<br>So far the side characters are just there, doesn&apos;t seem like they have a story and mind of their own. You meet Eleanor and talk to her for 1 minute and suddenly she wants to help you escape when you were involved in a murder. I mean, are you serious?? Then Javier is the reason why Prescott falls and for some reason Tripp is your best bud now and follows you unconditionally. Again, what?? I guess that&apos;s the problem with introducing new characters at the beginning of every season and then proceed to kill them all off only to do the same thing again in the next season. You basically have no time to develop a believable relationship with these characters. And it doesn&apos;t help when the hubs (which were a great way to stop and breath for a while and get to talk to the characters and get to know them a bit) are utter bullsh*t in this game. Season 2 suffered from this too. Only good old season 1 did this right. It&apos;s beyond me why Telltale dropped that. It probably also doesn&apos;t help when the episodes are so freaking short that you barely have time to do anything... and on top of that you lie to the fans saying &quot;oh my god you guys episode 1 was so big we had to split it in two!&quot; and then each part turns out to be 1 hour long. Oh, ok, so having a 2 hour episode was such a bad thing? Specially when we waited 3 years for a freaking new season, you honestly couldn&apos;t give something back to your fans? And you&apos;d think we would have 4 more episodes after this since this was supposed to be episode 1 split in two but nope, we&apos;ll be getting one less episode, so only 3 more. Lol Just terrible.
<br>
<br>Overall, the first two episodes felt rushed, too much action and too little character interaction and development. Half of the season is almost gone and the events from the two episodes happened in less than a day! This is season 2 all over again where the entire season happened in the span of like one week. As I see it, a New Frontier should be a standalone game and Season 3 should follow Clem again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier/user-reviews?user_review_id=7036325">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you have any respect for Clementine or Lee, don&apos;t buy this game. It destroys everything from the past 2 seasons.
<br>
<br>This is an insult and a betrayal to all fans.</span>

<br>New characters, same problems.
<br>A new frontier is an interactive choose your own adventure type game featuring 5 episodes...
<br>Here you play as both a new character former baseball player Javier Garcia as well as continue the story of Season 1 and 2s Clementine
<br>at first I was a little sad that we weren&#x2019;t playing primarily as clementine this time around... But I grew to love playing as Javier and trying to take care of his family&#x2026;
<br>As you start out with just your niece, nephew, and brother&#x2019;s wife&#x2026;
<br>And as you&#x2019;d expect things happen to make this 7 hour journey to the games end, not the smoothest walk through the park&#x2026;
<br>The game does carry over choices from the past walking dead games, or allows you to choose before the game starts as it does continue the clementine story...
<br>I was just a little disappointed with how they handled my season 2 ending... and how they wrote Kenny out of my story&#x2026;
<br>it felt extremely unimpactful for being the only person I&#x2019;ve had by my side as clementine from the beginning&#x2026;
<br>the departure felt rush and left me feeling no emotion&#x2026;
<br>In fact the game for the most part is dealing with moody teenagers and a complicated relationship&#x2026;
<br>Things do get emotional, and tears did shed&#x2026;
<br>I just wish some of the emotional moments were drug out a little longer or that certain moments that should&#x2019;ve been emotional felt more than just a quick bump to get over and then onto the next thing&#x2026;
<br>As far as performance and gameplay goes..
<br>These games are best when you&#x2019;re making decisions&#x2026;
<br>Changing the path your characters go down and how everyone in the story reacts to you...
<br>I felt I deserved everything that came my way, and there were definitely hard choices to make here&#x2026;
<br>But there are the typical telltale performance issues&#x2026;
<br>As the game crashed on me within the first 20 minutes of playing causing me to restart from the beginning&#x2026;
<br>But thankfully the other 4 episodes ran perfectly&#x2026;
<br>There are the occasional boring adventure type section where you have to interact with the world...
<br>These moments are never fun and really feel like they&#x2019;re there just to be there... completely unnecessary//
<br>But the most annoying thing gameplay wise are the occasional point and aim quick time events&#x2026;
<br>You never have any indication of what you should actually be aiming at, or what you should be trying to do in that situation.. And the curser is always off in an awkward position so it never feels natural...
<br>Which can lead to many trial and error moments&#x2026; made worse by the fact that there&#x2019;s sometimes a brief cut scene before these moments that you have to watch through just to try again &#x2026;
<br>And design and setting wise... you do a lot of spending your time in settlements.. Which definitely gets boring&#x2026;
<br>the variety like the first season had is missing... episodes no longer feel like unique chunks within the story&#x2026;
<br>A New Frontier is a good experience&#x2026;
<br>But it&#x2019;s just good&#x2026;
<br>A bit boring at times, but will still punch you in the guts with some feels&#x2026;
<br>I Give The Walking Dead: A New Frontier a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier/user-reviews?user_review_id=7333565">Expand</a></span>

This season doesn&apos;t even come close to the first season. Even the second season is way up high compared to this. Moreover, decisions made in the first and seconds seasons don&apos;t change anything at all - well, except for scripted 2-3 min cutscenes put somewhere between main story to make old fans happy - I&apos;m not happy as these cutscenes do nothing but kill older characters to compensate the complicated ending of the second season. I&apos;m disappointed and hopefully they will stop releasing this series soon as it&apos;s coming close to Ubisoft&apos;s approach of re-releasing same things that nobody wants with a new wrapping. I don&apos;t understand how some people can call this a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Seems like these people are completely blind and never played the first season. I&apos;d rather see The Wolf Among Us Season 2 with characters we like, don&apos;t come up with more Javiers, please, Telltale. 3/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier/user-reviews?user_review_id=7333302">Expand</a></span>

Incredibly short episodes with a lot of non-influential dialogues-fillers. Characters are stereotypes without a distinct background and motivation. Very weak continuation of the worthy first seasons.</span>

<br>It&apos;s one clich&#xE9; after the other, forced dialogue and one-dimensional characters. Hence it lacks all the heart that made Walking Dead season one and two such masterpieces. Even though it&apos;s the best yet in terms of aesthetics, Telltale must have assigned a new team of writers and director for this third season. It now feels, I&apos;m sad to say, like an ugly walking dead they shouldn&apos;t have allowed to attack us like this.

<br>Short 60 minute episodes (and the awful story makes it even worse), Clementine is playable for 5 minutes per ep, false advertisting pre-release, this is Javier&apos;s story for whatever **** reason even though we never asked for this and just wanted a GOOD continuation of Clementine&apos;s story (but this is an ABYSMAL continuation - this shouldn&apos;t even be called S3), The story is awful, and Clem is just a side character shoe-horned in when she was pretty much the main character for the previous two seasons. This isn&apos;t Clem&apos;s story, this is Javier&apos;s story - so this shouldn&apos;t even have Clem in it if Telltale wants to tell Javier&apos;s story so badly because she&apos;s just shoe-horned in and a side character. All the false advertising pre-release doesn&apos;t help either. Her being in every bloody advertisement also doesn&apos;t help. We played as Clementine in Season 2 and shaped our Clementine, and now Clementine is a supporting character again plus her personality doesn&apos;t change at all depending on your choices last season. Easy choices and deaths don&apos;t affect you because there is not enough character development and the game just pushes you forwards without any chance to talk to characters like in Season 1 (and even S2). This review would be too long if I talked about every issue, but SOME of the main issues are up there. SOME of the main issues. S2 choices don&apos;t **** matter for ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier/user-reviews?user_review_id=7205868">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Long(ish) Version:
<br>I am okay with S1/S2 choices not really mattering. Somehow, they HAVE to get all the players on a similar path, I don&apos;t see them designing X full-grown TWD games so that &apos;every choice mattered&apos;. This,  game however, is frankly insulting. I really don&apos;t understand how one can write such drivel. 90% of Dialogue choices are horrible - gamewise and writingwise - and I feel like TTG is laughing in my face when I choose an answer that SEEMS to convey something whilst turning out to be something else entirely. As others have said before me, the main character is a very bland &apos;feelgood&apos; hero most of the time, but I suppose that is kind of necessary in these games. The game mechanics leave something to be disired, but didn&apos;t change since S1 so I can&apos;t really complain too much.
<br>What I can and will complain about how 9 out of 10 characters are horribly, horribly written, (clich&#xE9;s following clich&#xE9;s...) behave in ways that are incomprahensibly stupid or are just... I don&apos;t know. How the vast majority of characters is supposed to have survived 4 (!) years in this world is beyond me. Mind blowing things like eg. &quot;Jesus&quot; (here&apos;s another cliche) bursting through his ziplocks and kund-fu-killing zombies left and right out of NOWHERE doesn&apos;t even get talked about, even if you decided he was to be &apos;held&apos; since you don&apos;t know who he is (and the game doesn&apos;t even find it necessary to give you any option to find out) just gets ignored, meh, let&apos;s walk along as if we were best friends all along.
<br>This was but one little example, you can find such things by the minute like: Clem carrying baby A &quot;Zombie magnet&quot; J with her whilst on the run and alone. Everyone being a perfect shot. Hiding bodies, but not giving a damn about the 3x3 ft puddle of blood. Arms and munition being VERY abundand (as opposed to JUST AFTER THE OUTBREAK), all medical equipment that is used to full effect not being sterile in any way etc etc etc.
<br>
<br>Clementine is an ok character, but that does not redeem this episode as TTG had 2 whole seasons buildup.
<br>
<br>And the worst thing is, very very little will change since people who were invested in S1/S2 will probably buy this, as did I. TTG seem to go the way of EA and building a series and then putting less and less effort into it as people will still go for it - selling the IP and not the game itself. Because if this was the first TWD game.... I don&apos;t think people would buy it&apos;s successor(s).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier/user-reviews?user_review_id=7548858">Expand</a></span>

There just wasn&apos;t quite enough of it, the episodes are much shorter now, compared to both season one and season two, a full playthrough only took 8 hours, had this been season one it would have been 10+ hours.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a Telltale game so I have to take about performance, for the most part it was actually solid apart from episode one which had severe stuttering about 50% of the time, but every episode after ran perfectly at a buttery smooth 60fps with no sign of stutter. I should also note I crashed to desktop twice during my playthrough. Overall it ran considerably better than Batman.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier/user-reviews?user_review_id=7386899">Expand</a></span>

Javi cant match up as character to Lee or Clem, but there&apos;s few nice side characters who make up for it and its more interesting seeing how your relationships develop with them thruout the episodes depending on your choices, something that was missing in previous seasons. 2 or 3 episodes felt very short and again i feel there&apos;s not enough game sequences where you can explore, it feels more like cutscene after cutscene more than ever in Telltale game. Game felt the most satisfying when Clem was on screen and Javi&apos;s family backstory segments felt like weaker part of the game. Overall still a quite decent story.
<br>
<br>Shamefully game doesnt run that well even on medium settings i was struggling at times to execute some of the QTEs due to horrid frame rate, there were couple of times game froze on a certain scene to load the next one which looked bizzare, still the game is a lot more playable than abysmally optimized Batman series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier/user-reviews?user_review_id=7389186">Expand</a></span>
