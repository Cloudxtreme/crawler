But they, first of all, NEVER ANSWER SUPPORT REQUESTS, like it was in WRC series, too. Althought they send me 8 letters about game release. And, second, in this final version nothing changed: you absolutly cannot play with  wheel. At each launch game  set new random keys, never wheel and pedals work. It simply unbelieveable. In WRC there were also great problems with wheel, but there at least it was possible to go.

<br>
<br>Word of warning - if you set the track detail too high, your frame rate WILL suffer. So keep that **** down low.
<br>
<br>The graphics on the bikes are ace -the customization options, though limited, are there - which is a nice little touch - but it could do with a little more in that department. I don&apos;t want, for instance, a bike with 111 being the only number I can have on it  - I would have liked to have seen options to customize the farings instead of just having the minimal manufacturer&apos;s obligatory model vinyl on it.
<br>
<br>The bikes in general look pretty damn good. Nice attention to detail - well researched, the history of Honda, for instance, is an interesting read and you can read all about it - if you wanted to - on this game - along with probably the history of Ducati, my personal favourite the British Triumph (I always liked the Daytona), and so on and so forth.
<br>
<br>The career is okay, it&apos;s nothing to write home about. It seems a little limited in courses and course options, but despite that, it is still a fairly reasonable collection of courses to be getting on with.
<br>The only problem I&apos;d have with this is with the drag racing. It just doesn&apos;t seem to fit this game all that well, and to be honest, it looks like they tore a page out of the Need For Speed series with that old gem.
<br>
<br>Camera views in racing are actually fairly decent - although not being able to see the wing mirrors on straights without having to get to an upright position on the bike you&apos;re on is a bit of a pain in the butt.
<br>It would have been nice to have the same views available in replay as well as during the race though.
<br>The music for this game is arguably the best thing about the game - whoever is responsible for it is a friggin&apos; chillout genius, some of the music on the menu screens is so relaxing and &apos;out there&apos; that it knocked my four month old daughter out for several hours. Anyone who can put music together that sends my kid off to sleep for hours on end gets my vote. So good stuff on that one.
<br>Failing that, it&apos;s not actually all that bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ride/user-reviews?user_review_id=5123200">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately you can tell this game was made on a low budget. I have been looking forward to game like this to be released for years ever since Riding Spirit was released back in the day of the PS2 (which was also very ropey) Ride doesnt have the same amount of bikes that Riding Spirit had, the latter mentioned game had bikes of the 400cc class and many more rather special bikes that you just dont see in Ride. The graphics are nothing special although the bike models are`nt too bad. I must point out the sound too.....ive no idea what the dev team had been listening to when they made the sound for this game but i can certainly say it wasnt the engine of a bike....they sound terrible, imagine an angry wasp trapped in a jam jar and you wont be too far away.
<br>The handling characteristics of the bikes dont feel any different to any of the other bikes. for example, i started out on the street triple and later bought a 2005 CBR 1000, these are two very different bikes but they felt exactly the same to control, albeit the CBR is obviously much faster.
<br>
<br>The other thing that annoyed me was how easy it is to upgrade and buy new bikes, within 3 races id fully upgraded the street triple and after 6 (i think) races i managed to buy the CBR1000 and also pretty much managed to upgrade it to the max. Once you have a 1000cc bike in the game, you really dont need to buy anything else other than for different class race/championship. I feel like ive completed the game already over 2 nights.
<br>Another annoying aspect of the game is the loading screens. From selecting a race to partake in i think you have about 3-4 loading screens to go through before your actually on track.
<br>all in all a pretty poor game and could of been a real gem, as it is it feels totally unfinished, with bugs galore. i cant set my controller up properly as it doesnt allow me to map some buttons for braking for example. sometimes after i finish setting up the controller it doesnt save them at all.
<br>for those that just want a bike arcade game then it might be great...for others like me its a real disappointment</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ride/user-reviews?user_review_id=5227992">Expand</a></span>

If your a fan of bikes then this is a must have in your collection. A few minor flaws but its said that this game is no longer in the list of fixes, which this pc game &quot;Ride&quot; needs.
