The game could be good, but it just has so many issues with it that it kills any enjoyment out of the game.  Basic elements of good software design are devoid in this disaster of a game. Buttons don&apos;t work. Unmovable  UI elements that do nothing but block useful buttons. Loading screens are missing. For example, when I first started the campaign all I saw was a black screen. I thought the game had locked up, in reality, it was just loading but there was nothing to indicate that, that was going on. The same can be said for resuming a campaign. If you click load and select your file, it won&apos;t tell you its loading, you just sit there and wait. The campaign/tutorial is terrible. I can build things that I can&apos;t do anything with. Some areas of the tutorial leave you left wondering what to do. Ships get stuck in orbit during combat. You can&apos;t move ships when you have unmovable objects like repair bays selected. Acknowledgements seem to be hit or miss, leaving you wondering if you clicked the right button. Overall, I&apos;d avoid this game because its not worth $40. This is a bargain bin game at best. Don&apos;t waste your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563237">Expand</a></span>

Mission objectives hanging off the screen so they cant be read. That is just a very few of the issues. On top of everything, hundreds of people are requesting refunds and Kalypso is completely ignoring them, despite members of the company posting on the thread during the weekend not a single person was responded to asking for the very reasonable request of a refund. The product is broken and as such refund requests should be honored. It is time developers stop releasing unfinished products for consumers to beta test and bug fix at their own cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563220">Expand</a></span>

How can they release a game in this state ??? they don&apos;t know that they are going to kill all the future sales !! after so negative reception even if they fix the issues they won&apos;t be able to recover for releasing an unfinishes game.</span>

Response from the developers was the golden slap in the face.  They claim that the horrendous bugs were a surprise to them.  No refunds issued and even after a couple patches, the game is still broken.  I tried out combat in a skirmish game.  It was a 30-minute bore fest watching two ships sit in place and shoot each other to death, which took an incredibly long time.  Resolving combat (exiting combat mode) is broken.  I was told to &quot;self-destruct&quot; my remaining ship in order to finally exit combat mode.  What a joke.  Graphics are far from stunning.  Fonts are too small.  The GUI is atrocious.  The game is slow and boring.  The camera interface clunky.  The map continuously scrolls randomly and the only way to fix it is to reload the game.  Load/save processes are slow if they even work at all.  CTDs are running rampant.  Be careful on the Kalypso forums.  The moderators are banning people for voicing their own opinions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563262">Expand</a></span>

<br>A waste of money and time.  Game is very buggy, has missing features, unpolished, campaign is a joke with no instructions, publishers outright lied on forums, crashes every 2 turns.

<br>It is amazing that they decided to sell this game for $40.  Game is a scam!</span>

There are multiple slots for AI skirmish but you can only add 1. what??? Multiplayer crashes after few min. Save games corrupt. Campaign crashes after a few min. The advanced graphics is &quot;choose your resolution&quot;. The Interface is clunky and hard to use. If anyone is familiar with the 4x space genre then you will know that legend of pegasus has just killed any faith gamers have in it, especially with blind preorders. This game cost 39.99 for preorder and is in a pre-alpha stage on release. Sword of the stars II did the same thing and cost about the same. Do yourself all a favor and get the indie-esque Endless space for 19.99, or a AAA title game Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion instead. Even the Galactici Civilizations 2 bundle for 5 dollars is way better. Developers and publishers, stop releasing pre-alphas and charging us over 40 bucks for the privilege. There is so much work that needs to be done to get this even PLAYABLE, and beyond that to be ENJOYABLE, weekend patches for the next 12-24 weeks I fear will still not fix this. Do not just take my opinion, one of the largest threads at this games official forums is entitled &quot;Refund Request&quot; here: http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=15831 . Instead of refunds they will be giving a &quot;compensation&quot; which is anyone&apos;s guess, but most likely a small DLC for a broken game. What a shame I really love the 4x space genre but these releases are destroying gamers faith in it :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563123">Expand</a></span>

<br>You can play campaign with broken UI and hidden&#xFEFF; beyond the side of the screen mission objectives or you can start skirmish mode with one broken AI.Multiplayer doesn&apos;t work from release till now.Game crashes every 10-30 minutes.They fixed save/load system with the third patch, so you now you can load your game(on release the game just crashes).AI is awfull, UI is awfull, tutorial is awfull, some buttons does nothing and have no description, 30 minutes scout fights, Tech tree is a joke full of 1% armor/damage/shield upgradesNo graphic options on release except changing the resolution, with third patch they added fullscreen&apos;windowed, Vsync and Antialiasing options.Terramorphing isn&apos;t working.Sometimes units disobey commands.Early game is&#xFEFF; end turn bashing game.And more of that.Music is good though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563236">Expand</a></span>

Expect patches for things like &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;balance&quot; sometime next year. As it stands, Legends of Pegasus is a terrible crashfest. It lacks basic functionality--save and load are broken. There is no &quot;40 hour single-player campaign&quot;: events aren&apos;t fully scripted and the campaign was released in an unfinished state. There isn&apos;t &quot;an amazing, dynamic tech tree&quot;: like the single-player campaign, it seems like they haven&apos;t finished programming tech yet. Multiplayer is simply broken and doesn&apos;t work. Skirmish mode (player vs AI) is pointless because there is no AI. The enemy just sits there and waits to die. Hardware and software incompatibility is so bad that Kalypso has actually told people to uninstall their firewalls in order to play. The &quot;stunning 3d graphics&quot; do not appear with most mainstream video cards. Note that the guy who rated this 7 did not review this game. He previewed what he game could be if the devs fulfill all of their promises after 6+ months of patches. It&apos;s true that this game might be better in a year but it is unfair to give a review score based on fortune telling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563308">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It started with the account sign-up.  This is not uncommon, but I have no clue why they required me to sign up for an account for a mostly single player game.  I tolerate other games with this requirement, but I never like it.  Especially when the game is part of an established always-on network, like Steam.  For me, the game has a lot of bugs and glitches. I ran into recoverable freezes at several points, including adjusting the volume.  Several camera keys just didn&apos;t work at some points and basic polish was lacking.  For example, Esc opens the menu but no key closes it.  Basic feedback on actions is nonexistent. I tried repairing ships several times but nothing ever happened.  Each time, the unit confirmation sound played and nothing ever happened - I still don&apos;t know why.
<br>
<br>While on the subject of the unit confirmation noises, these have to be the worst part of the game.  The confirmation and acknowledgement sounds seem to be pieced together from various sound bytes to sound like military chatter.  It sounds terrible because each sound byte is said in a different yet still monotonous tone.   The chatter is also constant in a battle.  Cries of &quot;Shield stress levels are very high!&quot; abound, even when shields all seems pretty relaxed.
<br>
<br>The game play is very slow paced.  I spent 60-70 turns just hitting the End Turn key before I even got to some basic story.  I realize that 4X games tend to be on the slow side but there is usually lots to see and do while you wait for things to pick up.  LoP has very little in the way of management and information screens to browse and tweak.
<br>
<br>This was touted as Sins of a Solar Empire but with a single player campaign and story.  The intro was a black background with voice-over and text.  I really would have liked to see THAT game.  The game just kind of dumps you into a situation with little background and starts into the first few missions.  After almost an hour of game play, I saw some proper story sequences.  The dramatic tension of the entire story went down the toilet for me when they demanded I build a shopping mall before establishing any sort of defenses or governance for my beleaguered colony.  Aliens may be attacking but there is this awesome sale at the outlet!
<br>
<br>Maybe things speed up later on, maybe the story gets better, maybe I am being harsh because I was very much anticipating a good 4X game with ship customization.  I know that with other 4X games like Sins and Homeworld, I was into them from the start.  I didn&apos;t feel like I had wasted my money.  So buy this one at your own risk.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563126">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The publisher then has the nerve to say they were SURPRISED by the &quot;rough launch&quot; on their official forums. ANYONE who plays this for more than 5 minutes would be able to see this so I don&apos;t believe their story about being surprised. Hell, on the &quot;New Game&quot; screen, there is a blatant spelling error (&quot;Please select a fraction&quot; instead of faction) which just tells you that they did a pretty poor job of QA and testing on this game.
<br>
<br>Instead of doing right by their customers and offering refunds, they say they&apos;re going to offer some unstated &quot;compensation&quot; and they say they&apos;re going to be working on getting the game to a playable state. I estimate 6-9 months before this is really playable and it&apos;s a shame because it could have been a really good game.
<br>
<br>Kalypso has lost me as a customer going forward and I&apos;m never ordering a game again unless I see some actual gameplay videos (which had been withheld on this title -- I wonder why?).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2567935">Expand</a></span>

Within minutes of booting this POS on steam I had a sinking feel that I just got myself a clunker. It took me about 5 minutes just to launch the campaign because of the **** UI -- stuff that a QA team of one dude should be able to catch.
<br>
<br>The tutorial writing was clearly written by somebody who either speaks English as a second language or was never proof read. Take this gem for example:
<br>
<br>&quot;The currently for research available technologies are shown in the middle of the screen.&quot;
<br>
<br>There are many more such examples.
<br>
<br>Now, part of me feels bad for panning this game as it was clearly made by a very small development team, probably newbie game developers, and maybe even students. For that, its an impressive work, especially considering its potential (I was impressed by the demo video, game description, and the screenshots). But the thing that pisses me off is that I paid $40 bucks for this. I mean, it was a &quot;featured&quot; item on the Steam store tonight. I mistakenly trusted Steam to feature *GOOD* (or at least functional) games on the featured list. My mistake and one that I won&apos;t make again. My only hope is that I&apos;ll be able to dissuade others from making the same mistake by writing a review (one of my few) and that Steam will give me a refund. I&apos;ve never asked for one, but I think I will now and spend that $40 bucks on a different game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2567498">Expand</a></span>

<br>Crashes, lockups, gui errors, camera control, &quot;plot&quot; stoppers.. this one has it all.  Never in some 20+ years of gaming have I ever been a part of something that is so broken.
<br>My recommendation?  DO NOT BUY.. and I would suggest never to purchased through Steam / Kalypso as well they have 0 interest in refunding money for a broken product.
<br>Be warned kids.. this game and the companies that peddled it are not worth your hard earned money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2564935">Expand</a></span>

But for a moment say the game is stable and look outside of the bugs. The graphics are okay but everything is just mashed together poorly. The GUI is a wreck, half the UI is cut off in places and in other places it doesn&apos;t tell you what something does. A pet rock is smarter than the AI, multiplayer is completely broken, and there is poor performance on top of the line gaming machines that doesn&apos;t make sense at all. On top of that it&apos;s like they took everything from every major 4X space game, pushed it into this one but did it extremely poorly. It has great potential however at this point the game needs a massive overhaul before it can even get there and I don&apos;t think it can recover as its far far worse than SotS2 was on launch.

I never experienced something like this before. It&apos;s unstable, incomplete and fails to live up to it&apos;s promises given in the advertisement. It&apos;s not even worthy of the term &quot;Game&quot; in the current state and I&apos;m doubting if it ever will. They still have to fix a lot, so many things actually they might as well start from scratch. This title has been pulled from lots of retailer stores after the word came out of it&apos;s abysmal quality. Amazon even considers to cancel any future cooperation with this game&apos;s publisher. Unbelievably, it&apos;s still on sale for full price on Steam though. Hence a warning; don&apos;t even think about it. Do yourself a favor and pick up another nice 4x title like &quot;Sins of a solar empire&quot; or &quot;Endless space&quot;.

<br>-many features promised in teaser or preview videos in the internet (all official ones) are teasing things, which are NOT in the game
<br>-multiplayer consists of crashs, out of syncs, not loadings savegames &amp; it is not possible to finish a MP-Game at the moment, it is going to crash within the first rounds
<br>-no tooltips which explain, what something actually does
<br>-no explanation of how the game mechanics work, why do i need culture? How much culture do i need and what/how many do i need to build of sth. to maintain a specific state?
<br>-many buildings are doing nothing at the moment
<br>-awkward UI, which is one of the badest i have ever seen
<br>-there may be 2000 techs in the tech tree, but 99% of them a superfluous like gain 1% damage or sth. similar
<br>-within combats not moving ships are attacking not moving ships, that&apos;s boring like hell
<br>-the game is bloody unfinished &amp; was never ever tested or played before
<br>-save-game system of the early 80s, loading savegames is not always working
<br>-campaign may be 40h long, due to the plot stoppers &amp; bugs - like the techtree you are wasting most of your time with boring stuff and clicking &quot;end turn&quot; or wait for the real time fight to end, because not moving ships fire on other non-moving ships for several minutes &amp; nothing is happening ....
<br>
<br>There were already several patches, which improved the game a little bit, but it is still FAR away from playable or fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2573563">Expand</a></span>

This game is a beta, you have to pay for! Some even say it is only an Alpha, even after the two patches.

<br>This game is a beta, you have to pay for! Some even say it is only an Alpha, even after the two patches.
<br>
<br>On the pro side there are some pretty good ideas. It is quite complex and there is a lot to do.
<br>
<br>The graphics aren&apos;t that good, but that is not the main issue. I could live with the graphics.
<br>
<br>The game is unplayable because of:
<br>
<br>- CTDs all the time
<br>- controls are lousy at least (sometimes your ships won&apos;t obey your commands or get stuck or you can&apos;t click on them)
<br>- you can&apos;t cancel combat and you are stuck in the middle of it
<br>- ships get stuck in warp
<br>- not enough info/tooltips
<br>- no end turn report (&quot;Construction ready&quot; - um where? what is ready?)
<br>- no animated movement of your ships in the stratetic view (ships just &quot;beam&quot; to their destination)
<br>- camera movement is terrible!
<br>- etc. etc. etc.
<br>
<br>Do yourself a favour and burn your money instead...that would be more fun, than playing this game..seriously! Have a look in the forums or at amazon.de...devastating reviews! :(
<br>
<br>I would say the game MIGHT be playable in 8-10 month from now, right now it looks like a scam from the publisher and nothing to do with the amazing preview videos we all saw...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563453">Expand</a></span>

It has good potential and perhaps, after a lot of patching, it will be a good game. If you like 4x games in general, you will probably like this game - eventually. If you haven&apos;t got it yet, don&apos;t. Wait a few months for it to be patched. Don&apos;t think too much on the current reviews. Some people are going to downrate it because they feel like they didn&apos;t get their money&apos;s worth and are angry. That&apos;s the risk of buying a game that had such little *real* information made available about it before release. However, you SHOULD be able to expect a game to be in a reasonably playable state when it&apos;s made available for sale. This game is not in such a state. Also be suspicious of anyone who gives it a high positive review within the first month or two because they are going to be lying to you. A game that crashes frequently and randomly (every 10-15 minutes at times), has broken/shoddy AI, and a half complete interface is NOT an excellent game in such a state. That&apos;s just a cold, hard, fact.
<br>
<br>So like I said, give it time and come back later. For now, it is not a smart purchase. If they keep up with the patching, it will eventually be worth your time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563829">Expand</a></span>

A mechanic that has created many popular games in recent years.  The ship design feature allows for many configurations and customization.  The tech trees for research seem diverse and many, allowing for many technological progression options.  Planetary interaction is simple and straightforward; and economics aren&apos;t bogged down with too many minute details to track.
<br>
<br>That said, at the moment the game seems to be an &quot;unofficial&quot; alpha release, that was simply labeled as a completed game.  Considering that one of their first patches included the ability to load saved games, it seems painfully clear that almost no play-testing, if indeed any, had been conducted.  It crashes constantly at intervals that can almost be predicted to the second. It lacks even the basic user interface options found in all modern games(such as the ability to navigate the map using the arrow keys).  The multiplayer barely works at all(good luck trying to play a skirmish with more than one AI opponent).  This is disappointing from the publisher that was behind Tropico 3.  It looks like they&apos;ve let their QA slip considerably.
<br>
<br>Check back with this game some time late next year, and they might even have it out of &quot;beta&quot; by then!
<br>
<br>Personally, I have learned my lesson and will never pre-order another Kalypso or NovaCore game ever again.  I suggest that any fortunate enough not to have bought this game yet continue to hold off for many months, and check related forums thoroughly to make sure a playable version has been released.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2564169">Expand</a></span>

After the debacle of SotS2&apos;s launch, I did not think a company would be willing to launch a 4X game in a pre-alpha state to paying customers for at least a few years. Make no mistake, Legends of Pegasus is beautiful, but awful. It is ridden with a number of elementary bugs, such as the Y key not being bound to the letter &apos;Y&apos; in text boxes. The skirmish AI does not function, literally, as in it does not attempt to expand, or build ships. You cannot set more than one AI in a game. The campaign is dodgily built and relies on lazy scripted enemy spawns to give the nonexistant AI something to do.
<br>
<br>Enemy ships for example, appear next to your ships via strategic moves, and make no attempt to maneuver in tactical combat, merely approach, all-stop and fire their guns until they die. They universally attack the closest vessel or target regardless of threat or durability, and do not attempt to pursue fleeing ships that are critically damaged if they can simply switch targets to a closer enemy. Whole tech trees don&apos;t function at all. Expanded habitats hold zero people.
<br>
<br>Mining ships have placeholder names...
<br>
<br>The list goes on. Novacore claims they can fix the game in a few days of patches, but anyone who understands programming knows that code this rotten will take months to repair, if it can be repaired at all. This game has potential, but I stress that prospective buyers wait at least 6 months before checking the state of the game, because I do not believe Novacore (As this is their first game) has the capital or the clout to survive a launch this terrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2564478">Expand</a></span>

Im sorry but that is such a load of **** Im sick of games being released half assed. It seems to be happening more and more these days and people like yourself defend this **** Or maybe you work for Kalypso seeing you just gave it a 10. Really a 10 out of 10, and your positive comment is &quot;I believe they will fix the problems and I am looking forward to seeing where they go with this&quot;. If thats a 10 what do you give a 1 or 2? Yeah you might say I havent contributed anything to reviewing it ,but pretty much the 18 or so people who scored it three or below pretty much sums it up with the comments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563703">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t even say anything for the horrid release of SOTSII only because I like SOTS I. But my patience have really worn thin over the course of waiting for SOTSII being playable. This is the second 4x game that I bought that is really non-playable. First off this game is pre-alpha, it is nowhere near complete. The UI buttons, some research tree names are all filled with placeholder names. Second, after I finish downloading and installing the game, there is a black screen, only after 30 minutes did I figure you need to alt tab out then alt tab back in in order to see anything. After playing for about 1 hr, I had 2 CTD&apos;s, 8 freezes in which I had to reboot my computer and 4 microsoft errors. Lastly, there is no to load a save, so in order to play further you would have to start all over.
<br>
<br>P.S. Do not by this game at this time.. You have been warned. Steam and Kalypso do not give refunds. If anyone is feeling vindictive, they would put in a lawsuit for fraud and misrepresentation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563739">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are also a far-cry from what I was expecting (they wouldn&apos;t be out of place from one of the later X-Com games), especially the planetary construction view.
<br>
<br>The biggest issue I&apos;ve had with it so far is the fact that you need an active internet connection to even start a single player game.  Which thanks to issues with my Killer 2100 network card meant it took me a couple of days to work out what was affecting it.  I&apos;ve had to resort to using my motherboard&apos;s on-board NIC to get the game running.
<br>
<br>In closing: Don&apos;t rule out this game yet, give it several months an hopefully it&apos;ll be in better shape.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563892">Expand</a></span>

Then, suddenly, Summer of 2012,  It was released in a less-than-playable state with non-existent support. Complaints from people who had paid for the game in good faith were everywhere. Players were discussing how to approach getting their money refunded. In October of 2012 the developers filed for Bankruptcy. I haven&apos;t seen a really decent explanation of why LoP was released before it was ready although many claim that&apos;s how Kalypso does business. Others say publishers are pushing developers into premature release of their games. Some sites were still taking orders for LoP at the time that Novacore announced its insolvency which is, IMHO, inexcusable. The only reason why some people were spared is bc players posted warnings not to buy the game.   More than a few people reported that they were denied refunds due to game time logged even though they were not able to actually play the game. This calls into question the ethics of charging players for games not yet published. Aren&apos;t beta players really assisting developers in identifying problems needing to be solved? Shouldn&apos;t there be some kind of reward offered to the people who play pre-release games? How fair is it to charge people who participate in beta testing the full price for the game when they are the ones assuming the risk that the game might flop?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legends-of-pegasus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3032117">Expand</a></span>
