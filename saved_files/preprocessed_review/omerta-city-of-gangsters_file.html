There isn&apos;t much to build or manage and they make up for it by just making you start over for every mission. I really wish there was more of a persistent world thing going on.  It&apos;s pretty simple and easy to learn but it is lacking a lot of depth which makes it mind numbingly boring after a while if you are a strategy game fan. One gripe I have is about unique weapons. Maybe I accidentally skipped something but I haven&apos;t found a single one yet and I&apos;ve done a bunch of missions that say I get one in those missions. I end up buying most of the property on the map before I move on too, so I don&apos;t know. Would be okay if this was a 19.99 game instead of a 39.99 game. It just doesn&apos;t have much lasting appeal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2929162">Expand</a></span>

Sandbox has the same problem it gets boring so quickly you dont really have any competition in the sandbox you just expand your criminal business without any challenge. There might be cops on your tail but you can just bribe them over and over again. The combat system is kinda nice although you might rage when you are standing right next to your enemy and shooting him with sniper rifle and still missing the shot. The good thing in the game is the graphics and atmosphere. It really looks and feels like 1920 Atlanta but that still doest make up the lousy singleplayer and sandbox mode.

It&apos;s just so, so, so bad. The key skill required on the part of players is patience. &quot;Just wait a bit and everything will be alright&quot; might occasionally be considered useful life advice, but it&apos;s hardly a solid basis around which to design a game. Do something stunningly obvious, wait a bit, do something else stunningly obvious, wait a bit, occasionally indulge in some outrageously shallow XCOM-style combat that was clearly slammed together in a couple of weeks... and that&apos;s it. I mean, I understand the desire of games companies to appeal to those of a less hardcore persuasion, but Omerta sets the decision making bar so low that it represents a trip hazard to gerbils!
<br>
<br>In short, this is an absolute turd. Don&apos;t even touch it if it&apos;s free. Use your bandwidth for something more interesting and challenging, such as watching foreign language infomercials for cleaning products based on lemon juice that shift even the toughest stains without damaging the environment or representing a hazard to children and animals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2960969">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I found multiplayer to be not up to par, the combat system felt oddly bugged, favoring the A.I. in some situations. Also, the thing which bugs me most, and perhaps many other people too, was the price tag of this game.
<br>
<br>&#xA3;30-40 for a game which had a play time of around 6-7 hours (before boredom kicks in), along with repetitive gameplay and features rehashed from other games (specifically FREE flash games), Omerta just didn&apos;t cut it for me.
<br>
<br>Overall, although it was initially a blast, it quickly deteriorated, and it has been a while since I have even looked at it in my Steam library.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=3090489">Expand</a></span>

This game could have been great IF the developers would work out the details, but what we have instead is a lifeless, boring  and unfinished strategy game. The game is way too easy, there is no real competition with the AI. Maps are too small and you lose every progress once you reach a new zone. They should have create one huge map with plenty of thing to do...The story is cliched, and I wish they would focused more on the sandbox mode. AI in close combat mode is dumb. Enemy NPC&apos;s only tactic is to run towards you and shoot. I hate that I can not choose the clothes of my gangsters (and they look like amateurs with their basic clothes, I want to wear black suits), they go everywhere on foot (amateurish when the boss is running from one end of the map to the other), equipment management and weapon purchases are illogical...Overall not a good game, not worth the full price. Maybe for less money it could have been acceptable, but this is not a complete, polished game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2940488">Expand</a></span>

<br>The co-op is non-existent, you don&apos;t play the real campaign, you play a couple of the crappy combat missions, this is a monstrously cynical ploy in itself.

<br>The main campaign is brutally simple and while it looks nice in parts it suffers from loads of really lazy elements, such as gangsters just running around to do jobs, the completely passive enemies, and the staggeringly small size of the maps.

<br>Really there is just nothing to this game to justify the price or anybody&apos;s time.

<br>Now, those complaints still persist with me. This game&apos;s &quot;takeover&quot; gameplay is extremely tedious, imo, and I still feel that this is an overpriced game for its content. However, giving the game a second chance after its free update, I found myself enjoying the game much more. The strategic combat, story and theme are all pretty refreshing and earn the game a higher score than 3/10.
<br>Specific Cons: Missions and map takeover becomes extremely tedious and drawn out. Game is overpriced. Would be a 8/10 if it were approximately 20 bucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=3144666">Expand</a></span>

Dev says it was developed for consoles primarily as of the writing of this review the game isnt on consoles yet.  That means the PC version is some weird beta version that lacks features like being able to play it.  Also there are no enemies which is weird.</span>

Well, this game falls to the latter category  it&apos;s bad.
<br>
<br>The first thing that struck me is that the combat which was introduced as an important element is just a bunch of scripted events, where enemies are randomly dumped onto the area and the same fight can go completely different if you just restart it. The combat mechanics? Mixed feelings here  you have options to use covers but those seem to have little to none impact on the fight. Also, the percentage of hit chance is a failure  it makes you happy to hit 3 times in a row at 10% but when you miss 3 times at 95%, then something just feels wrong. Best avoid combat whenever you have the option to do so, as it&apos;s not a good experience.
<br>
<br>The economic part is just too damn easy, and that&apos;s all there is to say about that. Sure, the system with taking over buildings and redoing them to your needs is nice, but there is no challenge to it as everything is scripted and any combat where you might loose something happens once-twice in a mission. So unless you waste your starting money on stuff that doesn&apos;t generate income, you&apos;ve basically won.
<br>
<br>All in all, this game is not terrible like some people here write about it. It&apos;s &quot;just&quot; bad  a bunch of nice ideas were executed in a poor way, the game feels like it was made for a tablet of sorts, and the difficulty level is just a laugh. If you can get it for 10 euro, go for it as it has some nice parts that can keep you playing for a while  anything higher than that is too much and you&apos;ll waste money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2954418">Expand</a></span>

<br>Kalypso has taken the hopes of gamers for a good gangster game, and crushed what little was left of their credibility along with those hopes.
<br>No amount of patching (doubtful Kalypsoy will even make any) or the numerous amounts of expensive DLC (that will no doubt follow) will ever justify the price charged or the lost credibility.

Oh I forgot Arcana does. He wants an easy peasy strategy rpg game. Well 99% want a challenging game and this one doesn&apos;t do it. Get Mob Rule or Gangsters they are much better games,</span>

Boring, repetitive, bland, imbalanced and extremely overpriced, Omerta: City of Gangsters should be stayed away from as far as possible unless the price drops to around 2-10$. Combat is decent in its core, much like the new X-Com but still manages to be despicable with corner-shooting pixel-calculating AI&apos;s, luck-based hit system, random deployments, shooting through walls and far too easy. The rest of the games involves around managing and expanding your business in the 1920&apos;s america which is probably one of the most fun concepts I&apos;ve ever heard about but it is FAR too easy and next to impossible to lose unless you&apos;ve been force-fed lead while growing up. Even on hard because there&apos;s next to no random events in sandbox, the campaign is one long sticky scripts that tugs you out of the RTS experience as soon as you start to establish yourself (the most fun part) just to force-feed you a generic story through 2d cutscenes. Me giving this one an 1 is generous due to me being a sucker for these kinds of games, but If you actually bought this for 40+ Euro, get a refund ASAP.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2932032">Expand</a></span>

Consequently, my score of 10 corresponds to the version I have recently bought (and the only one I have played), which was enhanced by the major end-of-May patch.
<br>
<br>I only played the first mission of the Campaign, which is a first of many tutorial missions. After that, I experimented with various sandbox-mode setups.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not an action-game tactical fighter. Consequently, I do not mind if the A.I. adversaries are too easy to defeat in the turn-based combat encounters. Those do not happen often, and I find them fun, even though they do not constitute difficult challenges.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not a financial wizard, either. Consequently, I do not mind if the game&apos;s economic simulation of a criminal enterprise lacks &quot;realism&quot; and deep challenge. There is just enough pseudo-realism and economic interactions to represent a decent simulation challenge.
<br>
<br>What I am is a RPG player. I enjoy to design PCs (human-controlled Player Characters) and to play-act them according to their positive and negative limitations. In the sandbox mode, the game shines if it is played with such a RPG-style mindset.
<br>
<br>If you play it with a strategic and/or tactical &quot;wargame&quot; mindset,  you will feel underwhelmed.
<br>
<br>Playing in a huge window, on my 1920x1200-resolution desktop, with 8x AA, after having tinkered with my video &quot;Catalyst Control&quot; settings, the game looks great  crisp and clean.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m having a lot of fun. I will certainly pay full-price if more DLCs or expansions are offered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=3247668">Expand</a></span>

Going into this game I noticed a few disturbing trends.
<br>
<br>First the staff was telling us not to expect to much on the forums that it would be a different game than what we want.....Not a good sign. So after I bought the game I noticed the game&apos;s single player mode had some nice additions but sandbox is where everything is at, right?
<br>
<br>Sadly I learned the best part of the game is the music.
<br>
<br>Here are my Pros and Cons of this game.
<br>
<br>+ Great Music
<br>
<br>+ Looks great
<br>
<br>+ Perks
<br>
<br>+ Missions to sell vice items
<br>
<br>- No matter what you name your main character you will always be &quot;Boss Deanglo&quot;
<br>
<br>- sandbox is very limited
<br>
<br>- When in a tight spot your criminals in a battle have to wait for everyone to flee to escape. So my criminals are angels now?
<br>
<br>- You really can&apos;t edit much and there is no real opposing AI Factions in Sandbox building and trying to take over space.  The Combat sucks
<br>
<br>- No real world editor The best part of this game is single player. Honestly skip the game or wait till the price drops unless the DLC is free it is not worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2942573">Expand</a></span>

It has an x-com style combat system (though not nearly as extensive in terms of variability and combat options). The meta game gets a bit redundant over time, though the recent additions of sandbox mode and other small improvements has increased re-playability somewhat.</span>

However, that being said it&apos;s an enjoyable game with a number of great features.  The music, setting and overall concept are fun and well thought out, there are just a few problems in execution.  I do wish there was more extensive Co-op options.</span>

It is an old school style turn-based game, with specific perks and powers available to each character upon leveling up. If you don&apos;t like turn based combat, do not get this game, you will hate it. To be completely honest, the single player campaign is hard to get through. I&apos;ve only done about two missions and I have yet to go back because it feels very vanilla and bland. You can buy businesses, do in-mission missions, and upgrade your home on each map that you play. I suppose the single player is most disappointing in that it had a lot of potential but has either been squandered or watered down to where it&apos;s a chore to get through. Where the game DOES excel in my opinion is the multiplayer. You chose four heroes, can completely customize any of them with any weapon, and can level them up to make them more powerful in combat using &quot;money&quot; earned while playing CO-OP or verses. One draw-back is there is little, if any, tier-based pvp combat, so new folks are often paired with older ones who have a much more advanced party, and an inevitable slaughter ensues. If you want to play multiplayer though, clear time on your schedules. Though both are fun in their own right, PVP takes roughly 15-30 minutes and COOP takes 45-60 minutes. All in all, a decent game and a good buy, particularly if it goes on sale. In fact, I would recommend waiting until it does so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2931731">Expand</a></span>

I am sure there will be expac DLC stuff to maybe get other towns or more stuff to do. The camagne starts off basically you come to america as a european trying to live the american dream. You slowly build up a crew an then finally take on some of the crime syndicates to eventually create your own. I am enjoying the game but there are so lack luster areas. The combat is not like I was truely expecting its more so sim style then true RTS turn base. Cause you can simple auto play battle like if you were playing a game like King Arthur the role playing wargame but with alot less options...heh. characters can have different guns/weapons they use or specialize in an the RPG element is okay. I have to say overall the game should of been released at a price point of 29.99 not 39.99 but least i got 15% off via steam prepurchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2928922">Expand</a></span>

You got a great theme (for all Mafia/ prohibition lovers out there), descent battle choice (turn-based at last!) and an expectation that the mix won&apos;t fail you (as the price is high). Unfortunately the game feels unfinished... My main concerns lay in the absolutely lack of info/report regarding what your premises produce (in terms of &quot;products&quot; and like/fear rating) or what your joints or construction sites sell (again for both aspects). You should also be able to see the benefits received by upgraded buildings in this report. The battle is nice but missed shots when you are literally next to an enemy is a fail... As the game has something that gets me hooked and wanna finish it, I will not bury it but I&apos;d suggest the developer to implement the changes (that I am sure had in mind but not the time to implement) and give content free of charge to all those that bought the game at full price. A re-pricing at 15-19 is mandatory and please add the option to be able to chat with your opponent/ co-player!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=2939461">Expand</a></span>

From the makers of Tropico you really expected something good. Instead what you got was a poorly build economic background which took time to set up, but once you had it working money because useless almost. The combat was the only thing that was interesting, but even that became very repetitive and predictable. The game was very short with levels pretty easy to complete.
<br>
<br>The storyline could of done with extending and more levels put in. The makers are now releasing expansion packs on a regular basis, but at &#xA3;3.49+ a go you would really think these would be free as the game just lacked the content to begin with.
<br>Although the game was fun to play you quickly go in a routine on each level and it became boring quite quickly. It&apos;s a shame as the game had all the potential to be fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=3145820">Expand</a></span>

You can be both liked and feared by the city, both are necessary for the best possible experience. Like rating means the city will respect you more, and be willing to coordinate with you. Fear rating means the city will fear you, and will sell you things for cheaper pricers and will give in to your threats.

This game especially isn&apos;t worth anything over $20, it&apos;s crazy to think that this was a $60 game. It just isn&apos;t there it feels like a browser game honestly. Sandbox mode is horrible, you&apos;re best off just sandboxing in the campaign - because in sandbox mode, even though you may have everything set to easy some how the rival gang takes over the city within minutes and it&apos;s a pain to expand as they already have everything and the minute you establish something they take it over. A little more customization would&apos;ve been nice as well on your character.
<br>
<br>If it had more content, larger map and just an overall enhancement to everything this game would be great. The soundtrack is awesome as is the setting, gameplay and even the combat is pretty well done once you get the hang of it. It is a fun game to casually relax and play, works at your own pace and is pretty laid back with relaxing music to jive to so it is initially fun but after awhile you&apos;ll start to see how much it lacks and what it could&apos;ve been then it just makes you sad and want to stop playing. Hell even the voice acting is amazing and so are the graphics, honestly it&apos;s probably some of the best voice acting I&apos;ve heard.
<br>
<br>Not recommended unless you get this game for under $10 or free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=5934242">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Story gameplay is decent. Multiplayer and Sandbox is not.
<br>-Repetitive gameplay structure, luckily there are different objectives that fit lore for each story mission.
<br>It is repetitious that for each mission the most basic objective of Earning Money has to be rebuilt from scratch. There are around 30 such story missions, therefore, 30 times doing roughly the same thing. Should include a system where an Empire can be created and a portion of revenue can be drawn from other districts.
<br>-All perks gained by Leveling Up only pertains to combat.
<br>-Very little strategy in combat. Combat is boring.
<br>-No loot system in combat section. Ex1: During bank heist, there is no option to grab any of the mountain of gold bricks.
<br>Ex2: During an enemy&apos;s business Raid there is no option to crack the safe.
<br>-During these combat sections, characters should wear a mask.
<br>-There is no Stealth capacity in the combat sections! This game forces you to murder scores of cops, but the heat meter only raises +1 by one point.
<br>-Loading times. There is a Load for every Save and AutoSave.
<br>+Can skip all the logo screens at startup.
<br>+Music adds a cultural atmosphere.
<br>+Each Character has a unique voice actor adding a semblance of personality to static portraits.
<br>
<br>Overall, there could have been a lot more strategy implemented in both the overworld and combat sections. The result seems too &quot;Gamified&quot;. There should have been an empire management component added to the mission select screen. Playing games such as GTA, one can&apos;t help but get tired of being &quot;sheep&quot; that moves on behalf of somebody else&apos;s whim. Games such as this are refreshing and I look forward to any new releases in this mob boss genre of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/omerta-city-of-gangsters/user-reviews?user_review_id=7453212">Expand</a></span>
