Gameplay-wise it is reminiscent of Panzer General and all the clones that were spawned from it.  I.e. it is a populist wargame for the masses.  It differs from Panzer General in that it&apos;s more of a tactical level game.  So you have hexes that infantry can enter, but vehicles cannot, and fire ranges are generally quite long for a wargame.
<br>
<br>The graphics are not special, which is IMO forgivable in such a wargame. I did like the explosions and weapons effects, but the terrain is the weak-point, being quite bleh, unintuitive, and doesn&apos;t fit the isometric units. The UI on the other hand is undeniably primitive, which is less forgivable.  There&apos;s only a limited number of tooltips and a number of game mechanics aren&apos;t explained.  Morale seems to be simply the colour of the strength of a unit, with presumably red = bad?  I&apos;m not sure, and reading the fine manual is not very illuminating.  Keyboard shortcuts are more or less trial-and-error (they are not listed in the manual). I noticed issues, for example minefields can attack adjacent unit (with a strength 0 attack) even though they have a range of 0 (with a strength 60 attack).
<br>
<br>The tutorial campaign is pretty dull and doesn&apos;t really function as a tutorial, which sort of begs, what&apos;s the point?  Also the narrative is dull and nonsensical, and there appears to be only limited event scripting in the engine. You can only play as Imperial Guard, which is an obvious shortcoming of a game set in a diverse universe.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a general shortcoming in that most units have a 2-3 range attacks, but there&apos;s no zone-of-control extending out this far.  Hence replacements can be ordered to bring a unit that is in-contact with the enemy back up to full strength.  Sorry game designers, but this is really bad game design that just leads to silly &apos;tank-and-heal&apos; tactics that have no place in a wargame. There&apos;s no limit to the number of command units, so hey, make all your infantry company commanders and never have morale issues. The most OP arrangement I&apos;ve found so far is some mix of screening tanks and scouts to find targets / tank for a bunch of artillery, with 1-2 infantry for capping control points, which makes for a dull game.  Basically Panzer General was always a rock-paper-scissors game between panzers-artillery-infantry or air defence-fighters-bombers, etc.  Here there&apos;s just artillery, blowing away everything. There&apos;s no logistics or supply mechanics either, that I can see. So it&apos;s basically just a matter of timing your mashing of the replacements button and mowing through legions of enemy units.  Overall one has bought a tactical-level wargame that has the depth of an RTS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-armageddon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4774270">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Very good conversion of the Panzer Corps series into Wh40k universe. There are the traditional elements of core force which gains experience and carries on from scenario to scenario in the campaign. Units are divided to different groups (infantry, vehicles, tanks, artillery, air etc) each of which have tens of different units that you can upgrade as the campaign progress.
<br>
<br>New things (apart from the setting and units) are that each unit can have multiple weapons with different stats. Also attack usually lead to counterattack, which gives more weight to attack range (no counterattack if target is out of range). Units have health and are very varied on how many individuals there are in the unit (the unit strength counter). For example goblins can have as much as 40 unit strength when tanks usually have 5.
<br>
<br>Game feels much more fluid than Panzer Corps and the graphics have been improved a bit. Very enjoyable gameplay experience so far.
<br>
<br>Minor complaints come from some missing UI elements. What is morale? How many points does reinforcement of unit take? How far can a unit see (there is no unit stat to tell this)?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-armageddon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4772920">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics and sound are very weak, not up to standers of modern times, but I was willing to cut it some slack due to low production value.
<br>The game will give you a half-baked story - nut much, standard Warhammer-filler, but enough to give a sense of accomplishment, and a chance to have a custom army, which is great, as nits will get experience, and a steady upgrade in combat effectiveness during the campaign.
<br>Many units got implemented, but after a while it becomes comical to have 10 versions of the same tank, only with slight differences in weaponry. Would have been better to have less, but more different selections. It&apos;s easy to get lost in all the weapon stats this way. Still, the units give a good feel for the xenos-purging, and the levels are usually quite interesting, with some good objectives behind them. It&apos;s easy to get pulled in, and just keep pushing, till the end.
<br>
<br>But there are some serious flaws here as well, that dragged down the experience.
<br>First: no point in playing it in lower, than experienced: the AI is lacking, and the lower the setting, the more apparent it becomes. It is so weak in fact - and some units, like snipers and arty are so overpowered, that the only way of giving a challenge was to restrict turn-counters in punitively low number. Most the time it&apos;s a mad dash against the clock, and not against the enemy.
<br>Also, you will build your army from points given to you, but there are no relation between your actual achievements during missions, and the points you are given, plus there is a terrible lack of UI, that would give you the amount to - say - replenishment cost, and stuff. Also, refilling happens instantly, even in the middle of melee. Weird.
<br>I had troubles with the rules of engagement. Units in melee just moved back, or shot at my other units without any annoyance from the troops, who were supposedly fighting them, so you can&apos;t tie down ranged infantry.
<br>Morale seemed to drop without any good reason - just by fighting, you can wear down your most trusted units. I never realised, that an assault terminator squad could become lethargic from killing everything in sight. Guess the easy victory makes everything hollow...
<br>Also had trouble with player profiles: if you want to replay an older mission, hope to have a save from it, since you can&apos;t just start it from the main menu. You can start certain acts of the story - 3 of them -, but then you have to make due with units, handed to you by the game, so it&apos;s basically just a skirmish battle. I found the advertisement to be misleading: it states you can play as the IG, the Salamanders, the Ultramarines, or Orks, but that is a gross overstatement. You can start skirmishes as the orks, and that&apos;s it. In campaing however, you are locked as IG, but after act 2, you can buy just Astartes as well. Except the Salamanders, who are just thrown in at the very end of the game, so there is no way for playing as them. Such a same.
<br>Taking all this into consideration, the lack of polish, the weird rules of melee, the lack of Astartes-focused campaign, I still enjoyed the game enough, to play through it. If you like the Warhammer universe - and you skipped Rites of War ten years prior - than by all means, take up this game.

They took one of the most famous battle - first battle for armageddon and made out of it mediocre strategy at best with dull story (I just wonder how is that possible since there is beautiful fluff already in existence for years).
<br>Graphic/UI/sound: would be mediocre for panzer general some 10 years ago, today is absolutely horrid. You have static pictures of units, when you order a move you watch them &quot;glide&quot; across screen. It&apos;s really awful to see a dreadnought gliding across map. Music is repetitive and uninspiring, and sound effects basic at best. Terrain is also very badly drawn, you barely recognize where is rough terrain, where you can climb a hill etc.
<br>Story: What have they done here? You could have a best story ever in strategy gaming, but you made a dull and boring experience about events in first war for armageddon. Komissar Yarik just pops out of nowhere, tells you to begin training, then after some time he comes back with 1 one and a claw, explaining in one half sentence that he battled some ghazgul thrakka. You will get captain tycho at one point, nobody even mentions him. Arrival of space marine chapters is like in a story, but if you aren&apos;t a hardcore fan of warhammer 40k universe, you will wander what&apos;s even happening at all times, that&apos;s how bad story is implemented. You will, for example,  wonder why majority of maps are bland wasteland.
<br>Strategy: Again, would be good 10 years ago, now it&apos;s not acceptable. For example, flyers cannot pass over buildings nor can enter elevated terrain. They must go like land vehicles. At least they can fly over water. Walkers and dreadnoughts cannot pass through buildings either. There is plenty of units which are nicely implemented, but there is no real reason to have anything else except titans (firepower) and terminator (taking objectives).  If they implemented some restriction (army composition comes to mind) this would be very good, this way its boring.
<br>At least there is room for some heavy modding, so some of this atrocity can be repaired in time.
<br>And the price!!!! omg! Buy this only if you&apos;re hardcore fan of warhammer 40k AND panzer general type of games AND if you really really really don&apos;t care about graphic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-armageddon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4789370">Expand</a></span>

<br>I haven&apos;t got the linguistic skills to write a awesome review like all the people before me, but here&apos;s my two pennies worth.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m a bit of a warhammer 40k fanboy and I have been waiting for a TBS ever since Final liberation (which is still awesome and arguably the best warhammer TBS there is). I was so hyped when I heard the first rumors about a new warhammer TBS 1 year ago and have been waiting for it like no tomorrow. When I heard slitherine was making it I was even more psyched, because they have insane amount of experience to make deep TBS games. Unfortunately I have to say I&apos;m pretty disappointed with the result.
<br>
<br>&quot;Story&quot;, if you can call it that is bland to say the least. The choices you have to make in the storyline seem to make no difference and there is no 40k feel in the dialogue. It&apos;s almost as they have been just piling up one-liners from 40k universe.
<br>
<br>The units have no depth. The only real difference between units seems to be movement range, shooting radius, unit composition and weapon type. I still can&apos;t get over the fact that flying units can&apos;t cross cliffs nor fly over ground units. They also have **** view range unlike a sentinel walker. Scouting vehicles are almost completely redundant because you can only move once and they can&apos;t take much punishment when they have to park next to 3 ork units. Every time you attack you have to unleash all your weapons on one target which makes no sense (unless you want to make the game reaaaaally easy to play).
<br>
<br>These to say a few things that bug me about this game. A really basic TBS game with a bit of warhammer 40k flavor, but sadly a huge flob. And certainly not worth the 35&#x20AC; that it costs at the moment.
<br>
<br>I get the feeling this game was rushed and made more ipad in mind than pc gamers. I got two words for the devs: Final Liberation. Many great ideas for game mechanics (thought the UI on armageddon does remind me of something I&apos;ve seen before *wink wink*)
<br>
<br>If someone actually read this, cheerio mate and let the waiting commence on Final liberation 2 ;)
<br>
<br>Ps: Can you imagine what we would get if Chaos gate and Final liberation had babies!

<br>I have a lot of pleasure playing this game. Too bad, i cant give it 10/10 - the game price is 20$, for that price it should be better. I mean, more video-movies, more cool wh40k pictures, more description on units and wh40k concepts (some would say &quot;better animation and graphic&quot; but i totally dont care about dat). Maybe there will be some addon about third Armageddon war were they will improve this game a bit, but at the moment 9/10. It deserves 8/10 actually, but i add this 1 point for return me like in 6-7 years in the past when i was the kid :)

<br>Unlike Panzer general, you rarely get requisition(money) after mission- you&apos;re too busy to recover each unit&apos;s loss from previous mission especially expensive units.
<br>So, if a certain  mission is to hold 3 victory hexes, then just stay on a safe spot and just defend endless enemies. When I first played this game, remembering Panzer general and rushed deep in enemy teritory and lost units.
<br>There&apos;s a plenty of units so sometimes confused which unit to buy but answer is simple: More expensive,more bette.
<br>There&apos;re soem mediocre bullshxx units which seems cheap but goon in attack, but always check initiative should be higher thatn enemy unit.
<br>In my case, 3 vultures 2 infantries and one sentinel and rest is tanks and artilleries.
