<br>1)Looking good on UE4.
<br>2)Looks atmospheric (Kill all humans)
<br>3)Lil boring on gameplay part
<br>But still it&apos;s a freaking good game to satisfy inner monster and one of its kind.
<br>7.5/10</span>

I left unsatisfied on both fronts. Let me be perfectly clear here: this game should not be rated AO, and I&apos;m partially convinced they kept the rating for commercial reasons. It&apos;s the only reason anyone is talking about this. If you are considering buying Hatred for the violence, don&apos;t. Seriously, get POSTAL 2 or a GTA game instead. POSTAL is about a hundred times more violent, GTA plays about ten times better, and they&apos;re both more interesting and well-constructed video games.
<br>For a game whose main draw is senseless violence, killing and edginess, the violence is shockingly dull. Executions consist of shooting someone, stabbing them in the head, etc. What the hell? Seriously, your average Assassin&apos;s Creed game is more brutal than this. The game fails at a sense of violent catharsis due mainly to how dull the presentation is. You&apos;ll be shooting droves of repeated character models, who senselessly run back and forth towards and away from you. Even mowing down a crowd is left unsatisfying due to the baffling decision to require a reload on your weapon every three seconds. Lines are repeated again and again, and by the fifth time you hear the same voice yell &quot;Aiie! Why are you doing this?&quot; you&apos;ll start asking yourself the same question.
<br>In any case, you&apos;ll be shooting more cops, SWAT teams, and soldiers than anything. If you don&apos;t choose the easiest difficulty, be ready to restart the mission more than once after endlessly respawning law enforcement kill you at every angle with assault rifles, most of which are off-screen as you try hopelessly to roll into a building or execute someone for health. The worst part of restarting a mission is doing the objectives over, the objectives being to kill X amount of civilians. In my opinion, this is an extremely poor design decision. It turns what&apos;s supposed to be the fun euphoria of violent spree-killing into a chore, a chore that you will repeat each time you&apos;re gunned down by infinitely respawning police. I found myself ignoring civilians completely and just securing spawn points, running past cops and screaming citizens to further the gameplay goals. While I emptied out a coffee shop for the third time I reminded myself this was supposed to be the good part.  To be honest, watching a youtube video for about 10-20 minutes will give you the same experience. There&apos;s not much when it comes to player agency, things like how to approach a situation or even what weapon to use are more or less pointless.
<br>That said, the game does have parts where you can see potential. The destructible environments are surprisingly satisfying, and since corpses don&apos;t seem to disappear, you&apos;ll get nice bloody piles going, with blood spattering the walls, which feels more like what the game should be going for.
<br>While it&apos;s a bit silly to review a game like this based on writing, the main character and the tone are at least worth mentioning. The Hatred Guy is a humorless kind of guy, just from the trailer you know what you&apos;re going to get. I did enjoy how over the top some of his lines were, giggling whenever he spat out an angry **** after popping someone in the head. Everyone runs around wearing those stupid looking quilted jackets, track suits, and trenchcoats in this game, you can practically taste the European development. The bleak art style is at least notable, though it can become a point of frustration when you lose your crosshair amidst bleach-white pavement, or fail to see a soldier against a wall. It&apos;s not enough of a problem to detract from the gameplay, however.
<br>All in all, I appreciate that this game is the first to be rated AO and allowed on Steam, and I feel that for the industry in general it&apos;s important that games like these are made available and developers don&apos;t feel the need to &quot;pull their punches&quot; when it comes to the kind of game they want to make. Today Hatred, tomorrow we can have sexual themes in our games without getting all upset. Maybe. In any event, this game is perhaps not the best argument for being more lenient towards game content, but it&apos;s still here. I wouldn&apos;t recommend a purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5293072">Expand</a></span>

The developer Destructive Creations touts Hatred as &#x201C;an isometric shooter with disturbing atmosphere of mass killing, where the player takes the role of a cold blood antagonist, who is full of hatred for humanity&#x201D;.
<br>
<br>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a horror, but here YOU are the villain.&#x201D;
<br>
<br>As you can see, the trailer revels in the antagonist&#x2019;s massacre of civilians with much enthusiasm, and you would be forgiven for being reminded of Manhunt or Postal.
<br>
<br>The game does deal with quite a graphic and dark theme and it&#x2019;s not for everyone, so for this review I am going to attempt to leave my morality at the door.
<br>
<br>I played Hatred using my preferred weapon of choice &#x2013; a keyboard and mouse. Control wise, the game is pretty much what you would expect from an isometric view. W,A,S,D moves the player while the aiming reticule is provided by the mouse. Aiming in itself can be a little &#x201C;hit and miss&#x201D; (stop it) and this is mostly down to the camera. A fair few times I am being shot at from off screen with rather good accuracy. The player can combat this by aiming, which zooms the camera out slightly, however I found this to be a hindrance in some of the more hectic engagements as my aim is thrown off.
<br>
<br>The actual combat isn&#x2019;t ground breaking but in itself feels solid, most of your civilian targets will attempt to flee and you will literally gun them down from behind and watch them fall to the floor. The police and eventually soldiers are much more aggressive towards you but do have a tendency to funnel towards you allowing you to dispatch them as they turn corners or move up. Occasionally they do flank you, or as I&#x2019;ve also found some civilians will pick up dropped weapons and shoot you, something our protagonist certainly deserves.
<br>
<br>Other than the camera throwing you off when you aim, combat appears to have 2 other oddities. Firstly targets stood right next to you can have the reticule on their face and you will still miss and secondly crouching appears to mitigate a lot of damage in that the AI seems to miss a hell of a lot more.

<br>While some may be rating it low on theme alone.  The cruel fact of the matter is this can is not fun.  Or  if it starts fun like it did for me, that fun runs out really quickly when you find that the core mechanics of the game are just broken.
<br>
<br>In fact, the only &apos;positive&apos; reviews I can find are ones that are variations of &quot;Hatred is really good game,i don&apos;t care about controversy,i simply want to violently kill people in video games...&quot;,  and just like some hate it only because of content, for other all it takes is the theme to  make it, &quot;is good game.&quot;
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t misunderstand, I like challenge, Challenge is fun,  and in the beginning I saw a lot of correlation between this game and the old-school challenge of  arcade games such as Defender and Asteroids, like those games all you have to do is destroy x number of things, and like those games it is easier said then done.  Unlike those games,  they require skill and you never feel like you where robed when you loss, when you failed it was your fault;  HOWEVER when you fail in Hatred (and you will, a lot,) past the first three times you just run guns ablaze into a crowed of armed police, it never feels like it was your fault you lost.
<br>
<br>The AI in this game is some of the worst I have ever seen,  I understand, A* path-finding can be a challenge and standard way-point navigation can be time consuming, or impossible if you have destructible environments, but it really truly feels like the developer spent almost no time into figuring it out.  Almost all the AI spends their time running up against walls.
<br>
<br>Most death will happen when you have to hunt down the police because they can&apos;t get to you and you have to kill x number of them to move on;  You end up getting shot down before they even get on screen.  even when you extend your field of view by aiming any AI with a gun can shoot you from any distance if hey have a clear line of site.
<br>
<br>Also, Aiming is a joke.  You don&apos;t so much aim in Hatred as you pick a general direction to spray bullets in.
<br>The biggest issue with aiming is that while every level of this game has multiple levels, you are unable to shoot down or up just perfectly horizontal.  You will die many times, because the police are bulked up outside a building you are in, the stupid AI not able to find it&apos;s way in but grinding up against the walls as if they could pass by osmosis, and you have this great big window that does you no good because you can&apos;t shoot down at them, and so you go down the stairs they can shoot your feet seconds before you are level with then so you can shoot back, aaaaaaannnnnd dead again, without even being able to get one shot off.
<br>
<br>Every level starts out fun, but after grinding it 10 times to only die over and over again over things you have no control over,or ever feeling like you had any chance, then it stops being fun and you no longer even want to try.  Difficult is one thing, but if you had a rulet wheel on the side of the screen that killed you every time it hits red you might not get the point of trying.
<br>
<br>The novelty of the gruesome executions and shooting random people like asteroids in Asteroids wears off quickly as there is no challenge in it,  even asteroids made a challenge of just blowing things up.  While getting in a fire fight with the police is no fun ALSO because there is no challenge it it, you can&apos;t use strategy because the AI just acts randomly with no rime or reason so you can&apos;t plan or strategies.
<br>You can&apos;t take cover because the AI is to stupid to come after you in cover, and when you try to creep up to where they are you get shot down before you have any chance of shooting back.

<br>There isn&apos;t much story in the game. But I found it interesting to ponder what kind of events have caused the Hatred guy&apos;s milk spill over so badly.

<br>
<br>The sadistic nature of the character isn&apos;t explained. No backstory, no character development.
<br>
<br>I found the gameplay bland and repetitive and entirely lacking in innovation. And the forced media attention through its controvery didn&apos;t make me very receptive: this is the equivalent of a straggling wannabe-star&apos;s sex tape. Famous by all means possible.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t finish the game. A lot more could have been made out of it.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t understand why so many claim that this game is the next Postal. That&apos;s just wrong. Postal&apos;s message was: the game is only as violent as the player is. It was very much possible to play Postal without decapitating people or urinating in their mouthes. Postal cleverly exposed its critics hyprocrisy, because the game was only horrific and controversial if the player played it that way. Hatred is completely different: it is entirely impossible to progress without playing sadistically. There is no clever message in Hatred.

<br>It was a waste of time in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5355723">Expand</a></span>

That being said, the game in a technical sense is awful. The optimization is almost non-existent, running at a locked 60 fps in very confined areas (the only ones being the tutorial and train level), and struggling to hit 30 fps anywhere else, regardless if the game is maxed out or on the lowest settings possible. With a computer that can run Battlefield 4 on Ultra settings without the game ever dipping below 60 fps, needless to say this game should not be running so poorly. In terms of graphics, they&apos;re above average I&apos;d say, and I do find the art direction where the only things that are colored are the things that involve death and destruction very nice, even if it does get a bit harsh on the eyes (although it would be easier to look at if the game ran properly). The gameplay itself is very bare-bones if not feeling very meaty, with the standard 3 weapon, 3 grenade layout, however I did find it fun in the later levels when the game had actual objectives, as the killing of innocent people gets old and boring on its own, similar to the way messing about in Grand Theft Auto gets old without actual objectives. The game itself is extremely challenging once the army starts coming after you, even on Easy, which the game kindly rewards you with the &quot;Wuss&quot; achievement for completing the game on said difficulty, that being said, once the game started throwing gallons of high-health high-damage enemies at you, I found it to become more about frantic strategy, trying not to run out of ammo by running over the corpses of the enemies you&apos;ve killed in turn running out into open fire, trying to regain health by mashing Q over everyone you&apos;ve killed in hopes that you&apos;ll get a lucky execution, trying to find proper cover when you&apos;re surrounded; I found it all pretty entertaining, if not very frustrating at times when the REG (Random Execution Generator) was not on your side. In terms of sound design, the soundtrack and sound effects (mission get, mission complete, etc.) were outstanding, and very fitting to the game&apos;s content. The gun and explosion sounds are okay, although they could have been better off with a bit more punch and bass; they do get the job done though. All-in-all this is a bit less than solid game, but I did have fun with it. Beside the ending sucking and not being nearly as over-dramatic as I&apos;d hope (why didn&apos;t you end up exploding the entire planet?), and beside unfortunately not getting anything special like maybe a colored mode, or free roam mode after completing the game, I did have fun with Hatred, and had a few good laughs at how ridiculous this parody-game was. I would probably wait for the game to go on sale if you&apos;re considering purchasing it though, because with it&apos;s length and lack of content personally I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth the $20 price mark, but the satisfying gunplay, movement and sense of panic justify this being a good game.
<br>
<br>P.S. Never ever drive in this game, the car physics are basically broken they&apos;re so glitchy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5301140">Expand</a></span>

Duke Nukem Forever levels of disappointment, the blood is non existent, the violence is T level rating at best, the language is shockingly low. This feels like it was watered down five times over before release.
<br>
<br>Besides the shockingly low levels of blood and language the camera angles leave the player blinded with no direction leaving you to get lost several times per level. The fact that there is no color adds to the confusion of direction and at times gives you a headache. The only way to find your way is the radar, without it, this would be unplayable.  I&apos;ve said it before and I&apos;ll say it again, this type of set up must be in Third or First Person, top downs are for RTS.
<br>
<br>The hit detection is really bad, part of that is the set up makes the player forget about the cross-hair and it ends up blending in with the screen, another reason why a non color game is not a good idea. Sure it adds atmosphere, but this is not a game for atmosphere nor should it be. The executions are not as violent as shown in the trailers. We&apos;ve seen people being stabbed and shot before, give us something new, something different, something that will make us go &quot;OH GOD WHAT THE F%#*?&quot;
<br>
<br>The difficulty pushed me to my breaking point. Swarms of Police, SWAT, and Military bombard you with fire in all directions making escape impossible. To make matters worse, you only have a limited number of respawns before you must restart the entire level. Level 5 is what broke me, for almost 90 minutes of continues attempt to complete this level I am done, I can take no more of the swarms of unfair Military and Swat that fill you with holes before you can even attempt to fire.
<br>
<br>For a debut release Hatred is below sub-par. For almost seven months I followed the progression of this and it lead up to a product that causes more stresses than enjoyment. I have faith that D.C. will fix a lot, if not all, of these problems as they are a company that listens to their players, until then take a peek at playthroughs or even try it at a friends house but for now stay away from this little bundle of disappointment.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ Optional side missions that grant an extra respawn on completion
<br>+ Dark villain voice action is spot on
<br>+ Concept
<br>+ Soundtrack
<br>+ Great destructive system to buildings
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- No color makes cross-hairs blend in (even when changing to a bright color)
<br>- Confusing camera and almost no visibility for player
<br>- T rated levels of blood and below par M rated levels of language
<br>- Executions are not brutal
<br>- Difficulty even on Easy is stupid hard on some levels</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5294762">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Soldier of Fortune 2 came out in 2002 and to this day is much more shocking and disturbing than Hatred. It has features that would do well in a game made to be shocking, like a first person perspective, deformable meshes allowing different parts of the skull to be blown away, bleeding from injuries, intestines spilling from within. This game features no schools, no children, nothing truely disgusting or abhorrent or awful. It is just a game. Just a boring, trite game that sadly does not live up to it&apos;s aspirations or promises.
<br>
<br>How can a game with a pulled out isometric perspective to remove the player from the violence mayhem possibly have an impact?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5296561">Expand</a></span>

At full price; I struggle to recommend this game especially as the gameplay becomes repetitive and samey very quickly.
<br>
<br>The game is largely a frenzied isometric twin stick shooter that looks exceptional with a gritty noire backdrop and solid visuals. The gameplay mechanics operate very well but everything becomes somewhat tedious after an hour as you&apos;re essentially just shooting anybody and everybody in the same mundane fashion and performing the same executions over and over. The game is short and the levels look far too similar.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also a very challenging title which isn&apos;t really a negative but the difficulty can often frustrate and if you fail a level at any time; you have to go back to the start of it. You can however earn a respawn token depending on secondary objectives which is mainly down to performing a certain amount of executions - this however is a bit of a chore and most of the time you&apos;d rather just restart than try to earn a respawn as the execution cutsenes look the same and just kill the flow.
<br>
<br>Overall; Hatred is a very impressively looking title that lacks any real substance. The gameplay mechanics are fantastic but the lack of depth and the bland structure leave the product lacking. It&apos;ll only take a few hours to finish but you may even be bored long before then. If you are interested in the game and are willing to spend the asking price; by all means give it a try but with the Steam Sale around the corner; interested parties may want to hold on to their money for something else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5291091">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game itself has a specific art-style that reminds me a little of Frank Miller comics converted to movies. Especially Sin City with its Noir tone, black and white aesthetics and only very selected splutters of bright colour.
<br>
<br>It does fit the game - and while the performance seems not to be fully optimal - it runs good enough.
<br>
<br>But beyond all the media scandal about it - what is that game actually about?
<br>
<br>It is a twin stick shooter with very little story and immersion. The cheese in the dialogue might be humor or just bad writing. The AI is about as good as any twin stick shooter from over a decade ago. There is little variety in gameplay and had that game not focused so much on being such a scandalous title with its semi serious aesthetics ... it would be one twin stick shooter among countless - probably forgotten in less than half a year.
<br>
<br>So from what i have seen - the game needs to make people angry about its content - it literally requires the media to make a fuss about it - because without all the fuss ... it has very little to offer. I daresay many people will only try this game out because &quot;it is so wrong...&quot;.
<br>
<br>In terms of more objective carnage .... GTA V probably is much more distressing and disturbing. After all ... in Hatred you need to kill people to make a progress. In GTA - you tend to cause carnage just for fun - it does not help you in your mission - in fact it usually rather makes things harder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5292636">Expand</a></span>

<br>The camera/controls are atrocious. Running around in spots that are pitch black, and running into unseen scenery gets really annoying when getting shot at.

It didn&apos;t even reach the level of postal 2, which was released 12 years ago. This game is completely failure, because it can&apos;t offer nothing but violence,and even with that it can&apos;t cope.</span>

You heard about this game by an article or a video accompanied by the words &quot;A new massacre simulating and super offensive game is in development&quot; or something in the lines of it. To be honest, I&apos;ve seen worse. The most gruesome thing that happens is when you blow someone&apos;s head off with a shotgun. The main protagonist has NO backstory, NO character and NO personality. He doesn&apos;t even have a name. The people in this game are basically there just to be killed. They might as well be dummies for you to shoot.
<br>The game itself is decent. But there are some flaws that make it pretty hard to recommend. Most of the time you will be shot by enemies that are off-screen, the execution animations will get boring pretty fast, cars can and will one-hit kill you, and on top of that cars take 3-4 shots to ignite.
<br>The missions, while fun and open, are repetitive. It&apos;s basically the same &quot;Kill X people&quot; thing over and over in different areas. Also, when you die, two things will happen:
<br>1: If you have respawn tokens, you will respawn close to where you were killed and all your progress in the mission will be saved
<br>2: If you don&apos;t have respawn tokens, you will start the mission all over again.
<br>How do you get respawn tokens? By completing side missions. Most of them are pretty easy and simple.
<br>One last thing. This game is not being offensive to pass a message, or even just for the sake of being offensive. It&apos;s offensive so it can get free advertisement. Rockstar did it with GTA too. I&apos;m not saying that it&apos;s bad, im just pointing it out
<br>Overall, if you can look past all the flaws, it&apos;s a fun and enjoyable game. Probably even worth a seven or an eight if all the flaws are fixed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5326417">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The selection of weaponry is semi-decent and the driving mechanic was relatively entertaining in the early game but became practically useless as time went on as they are easily destroyed.
<br>
<br>In terms of performance this game is not the best. With occasional frame drops and glitching building pieces it could certainly do with some optimisation.
<br>
<br>The game provided an average experience and was enjoyable for a few hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5303528">Expand</a></span>

<br>No pros. I give 2/10. 1 for actually working, 1 for the OK graphics and the credits music. Not my style of score but good to hear.
<br>Now the cons.
<br>1 AO rating??? What for? The Postal games or Manhunt(1) were not AO and this do? Those games were violent as this or even much more. Except those were highly enjoyable. Hatred is practically Postal(1) with modern graphics and broken game mechanics, and extremly boring as well. Maybe the several kind of death? Absolutely no! Shots and headshots, some kicking, THAT&#x2019;S ALL! Play Squishy the Pig or (poor) Eryi&#x2019;s action for wide variety of deaths. Or Manhunt of course.
<br>2) Graphics are OK, as it&#x2019;s the good old UE3. But the annoying under-contrasted black-white filter does not help. The idea is ok, but it&#x2019;s somehow not works. Those night levels and the default white cross-hair made me insane. Many times simply lost the cross-hair, and took 10-20 seconds to find it again. Many time happened that i even did not see people on screen. Night levels and black suited civilians are fun to distinguish!
<br>3) Music is OK, and fortunately it&#x2019;s not played ingame, that would be atrocious. The sounds, however terrible. Weapon sounds are like toy weapons. No dynamics at all. Human cries and shouts are extremly repetitive, and after 10 minutes you&#x2019;d better mute. It&#x2019;s not fun to hear the same monologues 20 times in a row.
<br>4) The weapons themselves are weak, inaccurate and unsatisfying. Even poor civilians need 2-3 bullets, but SWATs and soldiers swallow 1-2 full clips!!!! before they die. I&#x2019;ve found the basic pistol to be the most usefull wep as it&#x2019;s the most accurate (later why). The shotgun is absolutely useless in your hands. Melee range only, good on civilians, but against any other it&#x2019;s a suicide. A soldier needs like 3 very close shotgun shots to die, and of course he will shot you in the time you do it. You will loose 50-75% (on easy) of your life in the progress, and there is nothing you can do to avoid. Of course in the hand of foe the shotgun is more than deadly (later why).
<br>5) Enemies shooting from outside of the screen. This is a joke! Any who enjoys this must be mentally deceased. And when i say outside i mean FAR outside, without any indications where the damage is coming from. The minuscule radar is your only source of information, but that&#x2019;s just useless, beacuse it&#x2019;s so small, and many times showing inaccurate positions. There is this right-click far-view mode, but that&#x2019;s painfull to use, and must be exactly know where you wanna look (and shoot) at. Cannot be used for searching as it&#x2019;s so fast and twitchy, that you&#x2019;ll soon puke on the monitor.
<br>6) Of course the enemies accuracy is godly even from 2 screens away using shotguns. Your best choice to fight back from that distance is the pistol because of its accuracy. Don&#x2019;t forget the whole game is about aimbot hitscans, so you cannot do too much to avoid damage, it&#x2019;s all calculated by a random generator and it&#x2019;s not on your side! Even easy is a joke. There is actually two ways to lessen the generator output. First the avoid move, good only for escaping, or the simple crouch. Crouch is fair as it lessens the damage to a level where you won&#x2019;t die in 3 seconds and you can even shoot back. All good until a shotgunner comes in and sprinkle the area. Hurray!
<br>7) The game cheats as hell.There is no way to play hide and seek. Everyone (even civilians) see you through walls. No sneak attacks of any sort. If there is a pixel wide clear view between you and the foe they shoot. They shoot always first. A-L-W-A-Y-S! Funny, eh?
<br>8) There is no way to tell from the animations when someone is dying or simply hit and will recover soon. Somehow funny to see it on civilians, that after some death agony they cry and run away. But it&#x2019;s more than deadly with the gunned crowd, when one is starting to shoot you from behind after you left him assuming he is dead.
<br>9) Healing is only possible through executions. Who to be executed is again a random generator output. Sounds fun in an AO game! Well it&#x2019;s not! Tell me how to heal yourself when 7 SWATs around you, shooting precisely at you. Even with crouching your life decreasing fast, and when crouching you move like a slug, no way to escape or go to an &#x2019;executable&#x2019;. Even if you somehow reach one (the generator loved you) and the timeframe is still on till it&#x2019;s executable, so you push the button. . .and die. As execute animation done standing still, so no crouching bonus. Nuff.
<br>10) After a while i reached a level (still easy difficulty, don&#x2019;t forget!) where in every minute 1-2 new car coming in with full squads of policemen and SWATs, INFINITELY. This is where i ragequit this abomination.
<br>11)Oh yes, DO NOT USE CARS! They are impossible to steer, and if been shot, it will explode in 3 seconds and you&#x2019;ll die with it.

<br>The Police came and showed their worst behavior, starting shooting and not even trying to talk to me. So I started defending myself by throwing my grenade. ...Things then kinda escalated.
<br>But I hope you see it was not my fault. I guess police brutality is indeed a thing we all need to talk more about. The US police did kill 464 people in 2015...

<br>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth the 20$, probably not even 5.

<br>
<br>The controls, especially the few times you are in vehicles, are a bit awkward at first.  After you get used to them, it doesn&apos;t play bad at all.  I would recommend playing with a gamepad for this one, though, as moving with the keyboard is really awkward.  Since the game is isometric, you have to hit W and D to move up/right, instead of W to go up/right, which should have been an option.  Also, when using the mouse to aim, the camera moves around a LOT more, which can be disorienting.
<br>
<br>The graphics are great and stylized, and I&apos;ve only rarely seen any slowdown.  Lots of physics effects and the environments are destructible.  You can for instance drive a car through someone&apos;s house, and then blow the car up, and watch the walls and bodies fly!  This is complemented by the fire effects which shine in full color out of the black and white background.
<br>
<br>Be warned, this game has an oldschool setup when it comes to the difficulty.  If you die, you have to restart the level over.  You earn respawn points by completing objectives, which helps, but they don&apos;t carry over to the next level.  This game isn&apos;t for rage quitters or people who want their hand held throughout the game.  It&apos;s what I call NES hard.  I&apos;m currently playing through it on easy just to get a feel for the game, and it&apos;s still a challenge, especially the second stage.  Once I complete the game, I&apos;ll definitely give Hard and Extreme difficulty a try.
<br>
<br>I currently have put two hours into the game, and it&apos;s damn fun, and a good challenge.  It&apos;s not the deepest game, for sure, and I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s not super long, but for $20, I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth it.  With Hard and Extreme difficulty modes, I&apos;ll definitely get my money&apos;s worth.  As of now, I&apos;d give it an 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5292818">Expand</a></span>

However it&apos;s way too over hyped as expected. Also they made the game way harder then should be because every time you die, unless you have a re spawn token you have to restart the whole level. Using cars is pointless because they explode within 5 seconds of someone shooting them.</span>

It&apos;s the embodiment of pure carnage, leaving none alive in its indifference to sex, race or belief. Years have passed since any stress-relieving really brutal game was made (Mortal Kombat doesn&apos;t count to this pool due to its frustrating situations), but the time has finally come for gamers to slay the innocent once more.
<br>
<br>Graphics in this game are really good - apart from a few bugs the game looks great with its grim black and white theme. This makes red blood and gore look even better! You can call me a psycho, but I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m not the only one who thinks that way. In terms of optimization however, things look a bit worse - even a pretty decent computer might have no more than 30 frames per second and Hatred is no Crysis, you know. Apart from that, it&apos;s cool.
<br>
<br>Hearing the sounds of people screaming and begging for mercy was a pure joy for my ears. The sound of guns and explosions is decent and a silent dark music creeping near your tympanum makes the feeling of the game even better. One thing that&apos;s missing is Dope&apos;s &quot;Die **** Die&quot; during some stages, but I guess that would ruin the whole atmosphere.
<br>
<br>When it comes to gameplay, well, it can get a pretty repetitive at times, but the locations change and some new ideas are put into each chapter, so it&apos;s not that bad. And it&apos;s all about killing people and there is a limited number of ways you can finish them using shotguns, smgs, knives, grenades and a few other things.
<br>
<br>The mechanics is good - you can hide behind walls and obstacles, light up explosive barrels, flank your enemies, so the tactical part is quite okay. There is one more cool thing, though - you regenerate life only by finishing your prey - how evil is that?
<br>
<br>Our main character is a psychopath in the very essence of this word. He treats humanity as a disease that has to be cured, one way or another. His quotes are awesome and you can really feel like if you&apos;re a part of a glorious mission of purging the Earth of human scum. Some of his quotes are a reference to Postal, so additional flavor points for that!
<br>
<br>All in all, the polish studio did a very good job fulfilling the demand for a gruesome and relaxing game. Hatred, in spite of some of its minor flaws, is what the community of gamers needed for a pretty long time. And don&apos;t tell me it&apos;s not politically correct: &quot;Please don&apos;t think I&apos;m a bigot, I kill races equally...&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5291241">Expand</a></span>

Hopefully this is the only game Destructive Creations make, because now their future is done for.</span>

<br>
<br>You can say.. yes, its &quot;just a game&quot; but cant we say that about every video game? How about MineCraft where its banned in a country and keeping people from playing MineCraft because its &quot;too violent&quot;, imagine if they played this game. That whole country would see the Game Industry in a wrong way. But real talk, the only reason why this game is so popular is being of the Media and how Twitch (a livestream service) banned Adult Only games.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game has no storyline and you literally do the same thing over and over again (which is killing people). It will cause people to get bored of the game and ask for a refund. The only thing decent about this game is the destruction you can do to buildings (like blowing up walls and buildings) and thats pretty much it. Driving is horrible, animations are horrible and the game settings/menus are pretty dull. They should have sold this on HumbleBundle rather than Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5291838">Expand</a></span>

Same moves over and over again. if psycho means shootin people in their heads and stabin their stomach.. than all shooter games must be banned. Cuz theres nothing more in this game.
<br>
<br>if u want mindless shooter game with same moves than buy it.</span>

Played 10 minutes of this cow dung. Movement with WASD keys is a total joke, so is this entire game. Thanks for NOTHING. Note to devs: Wake up, it&apos;s 2015.</span>

As expected, this is a shallow top-down shooter that offers nothing that hasn&apos;t already been done hundreds of times before, and hundreds of times better than this. It relies on shock-value and the media to drive sales, and it seems that&apos;s worked for it.</span>

<br>Everyone that&apos;s playing this, or has experienced what this game has been through, should remember this as a legend; even though the game were definitely not what it should&apos;ve been, the history of these controversy around this game, as this is an indeed impressive release for a game that got so much controversy.

<br>I want a game that just like a horror movie can repulse me , but still hold my attention ..
<br>this game is sick and repulsive but still interesting ..
<br>overall the game may change the way you look at all other shooters by pulling back the thin veil of hypocrisy will view shooting games with .
<br>the same critics condemning this game will give the tell tale walking dead game a 10 because you know .. Zombies are ok to smash and crush and run over .  even though it&apos;s the same graphical animation or worse.
<br>If Hatred was a zombie shooter nobody would have said anything , so I applaud them for going the route they did and hopefully if it&apos;s successful enough adult only content will start be profitable and we can get a lot better written games and characters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5294326">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics are pretty good, not ugly and not gorgeous, just what you would expect. The black and white filter make things a bit hard to see something. The physics is probably the best thing about this game. The destruction engine when you throw explosives around it impressive. The objectives are rather simple (kill x people, kill people here), but still have some events. Game length is 7levels, which is acceptable. The biggest challenge of the game is managing your ammunitions (always short) and managing when to reload (that shotgun is too slow).
<br>
<br>People rating 0 because they think the game have nothing except controversy factor obviously did not play it. The shooting mechanism works perfectly, the cars are impresive in their handling. There&apos;s no apparent bugs and the performances/optimization is extremely good.
<br>
<br>Just edited my review after completing the game, the last few levels have an very good challenge and are very fun to play. The ending credit songs is awesome and just got them two extra points. Buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5295371">Expand</a></span>

<br>its an amazing game for killing people and would definitely recommend it if you enjoy killing people in video games.</span>

<br>Clearly enjoying this game doesn&apos;t make you a psycho, but I think anyone who enjoys it and thinks it&apos;s a good game should get their head checked. The game is bland, controls are sub-par. Maps are uninspired and awkward to navigate. Weapons are inexcusably limited in a game about a rampage. The game is only 4 -5 hours long. The price is way too high, it&apos;s worth around 6-7 bucks. Just say no.

If you like games where you just go around mindlessly killing tons of people, there are tons of better games to play than this. Take your pick of any FPS, Grand Theft Auto series, shoot-em-up, or anything else involving killing massive amounts of enemies. The $20 price tag may be slightly welcoming, but trust me, it&apos;s not worth it. This game is frustratingly hard (and unfair) at times, has no clever or witty dialogue (they assume it&apos;s clever), and next to no gameplay outside of shoot, shoot, shoot. It gets boring after awhile, trust me.
<br>
<br>Only reason it doesn&apos;t get a 0 is because the physics engine is actually kind of neat. You can blow up parts of buildings with explosives, and the lighting on fire and police sirens are quite nice, but outside of that, everything else is pretty blah. Again, this game sold purely based on its controversy (what they were hoping) and the gameplay was very botched because they probably expected it to sell well based on its extensive hype and media coverage (that they didn&apos;t even need to pay for!). For a first game from a brand new company, it&apos;s okay, but after hearing non-stop outcry over boycotting this game, I expected a lot better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5291483">Expand</a></span>

All we&apos;re left with is this guy with no motivation but BLOOOOOOOOOOOD) you just half a really bad, clunky pseudo-game that&apos;s a poorer attempt at hiding it&apos;s ideology than most Christian video games.

Because to be honest this Game is clearly not out there to be taken seriously, and the bulk of the enjoyment doesn&apos;t come simply from the game play. This game is a protest against the Political correct content police which has seen the toning down (and dumbing down) of many game franchises. This much like the original GTA has capitalized upon braking the cultural and societal norm. This game reminded me of all the awesome OTT 1980&apos;s exploitation films and horror films such as Maniac cop The toxic avenger and of course Brain dead/Dead alive 1992. This Game is out there to be as OTT as possible and to cause as much hilarity as possible. Charging an election rally with a flamethrower is original and hilarious. This game is clear it is detached from reality from how ridiculous it is, there is no moral this game doesn&apos;t give a crap whether you like it or not and packs some refreshing challenge to it too. Takes me back to the days of the megadrive when some games such as splatterhouse were only there to convey violence. Games today hold you hand too much and are too easy, more games are being tailored to be children friendly (likely as allot of games purchases are made by parents) And the days of the badguys being introduced by murdering an unarmed family including children are gone (fallout2) . Furthermore many games have removed the capacity to make evil choices and force you along the path of good, whilst i prefer choice (which Hatred does not provide) it is nice to have an antithesis to the games which are attempting to remain successful by avoiding taboo subjects.    Finally Hatred isn&apos;t a great game but for my enjoyment it didn&apos;t need to be, if you go into a game with as ridiculous a name/marketing campaign as this expecting something of A quality then you have missed the enjoyment of this game. Some of the antagonists quotes are truely hilarious in thier OTT delivery.

<br>There are some compelling gameplay additions and amusing moments if you can stand to play this game to it&apos;s bitter end (I had a few chuckles, but very few), but none of which are compelling enough to recommend doing so.
<br>The controls are pretty bad overall, keyboard or controller and more or less take away from the moderately passable gameplay to where it is generally more frustrating than fun. I don&apos;t have any particular opinion about the themes in the game, certainly there are more violent games but I don&apos;t really think what is here is all that significant.
<br>The game itself isn&apos;t particularly great and if you are trying to sell a game on violence and headlines alone, the violence itself isn&apos;t very shocking either (no melee weapons, dismemberment or children) so some respects it&apos;s odd they held back when it&apos;s really the only merits on which this game is selling. Regardless of why you came to play this, you will probably leave disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5298132">Expand</a></span>

No story. Repetitive as hell. Empty soulless uninteresting protagonist. Everything taken up to eleven doesn&apos;t make a game insanely enjoyable, it just hits Poe&apos;s law at high speed. The poor poor innocents could be whatever you imagine them to be&#x2014;pack of gums, stupid running bunch of pixels&#x2026;&#x2014;because they&apos;re as empty as the protagonist. If you want to be thrilled with the killing of innocents, you have to make the player feel that they&apos;re innocents and don&apos;t deserve to die in pain. But here&#x2026; Well, without story, that&apos;s hard to pull off. Anyway. Two points: one for graphs, one for bollocks&#x2014;too bad it&apos;s not enough nowadays, huh? If I wanted to get off on killing virtual innocents, I&apos;d actually play anything but Hatred.

<br>
<br>Yes, buying a game to &quot;stick it&quot; to those that generated controversy over nothing might feel good, but all you&apos;re really doing is giving money to people who didn&apos;t make a game worth paying money for - by &quot;sticking it&quot; to one group, you&apos;re sticking it to yourself. A more rational response would be to accept that this game is much ado about nothing, and look for something else to play - namely, &quot;Abuse&quot; from 1995.  It&apos;s free, and it&apos;s better than this game in every way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hatred/user-reviews?user_review_id=5291222">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t understand the hate over it, it probably comes from people who didn&apos;t make it to at least level 4, where things get pretty hardcore. Or it might come from people who didn&apos;t even played the game. I highly recommend this game.</span>

<br>Then this little game comes along, and causes an uproar due to its violent nature. How is this possible you may ask?
<br>Cause of context. Instead of trying to justify the homicide, this title embraces the spirit of a psychopath-terrorist-shooter and outright demands you to kill and mutilate the innocent.
<br>Rather than doing that tongue and cheek as a harmless joke it remains straight faced and absolutely mean spirited till the very end.
<br>
<br>Now a lot of people have been asking me what I personally think of it, and now that I have played it through till the end on the &quot;Extreme&quot; difficulty setting, I can give you that opinion.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m going to say right off the bat that I had a lot of fun playing through the game, albeit a very short experience (5-7 hours depending on how much you die) the killing and slaughtering of the masses remains fun and challenging while appealing to my sadistic nature.
<br>
<br>A good control system, highly customizable to my liking, made it very accessible to get into.
<br>
<br>The visuals are very stylish, not to mention quite well done on a technical level for such a small team. It has cool looking destruction, some fantastic looking explosions and other great effects. While the whole game is in a gritty black and white, the police lights, blood, fire and other visual flares are in color, giving it that &quot;Sin City&quot; style. Which I personally find quite appealing.
<br>Lots of cold dark black, make the presentation fittingly somber to embrace the sinister theme. From the flaming skulls in the pause menu right down to the customizable &quot;Skull&quot; cross-hair, the game really roles with the aesthetics of hate. All under-toned by a nicely haunting ambient soundtrack, guaranteed to make you feel uncomfortable.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is also pretty solid, however the main protagonist, or should I say &quot;antagonist&quot; sounds like a caricature of the school shooter stereotype which makes the game very comedic. I&apos;m not sure if that was intentional or not, but some of the one liners and monologues are so juvenile that I&apos;m guessing they knew what they were doing.
<br>Slitting a woman&apos;s throat while saying &quot;you reek of weakness you **** is so straight forward, that its funny in a dark **** up sort of way. While burning down an entire party, only to comment with &quot;Birds of a Feather, Die Together!&quot; is like something a child would wright on his math book, thinking hes a badass bastard.
<br>
<br>tumblr_ndjmpr6D0R1szg5leo2_500
<br>
<br>Even the game-play makes sure to embrace the hate! The health system cleverly makes sure to go out of its way to be sadistic, cause the only way to get your health back, is to wound someone and brutally execute them while they are whimpering in agony. Cause of that you end up running away from fights
<br>just to desperately look for innocent pedestrians so you can &quot;feed&quot; yourself back to health from the antagonists sadistic gratification. The game even says &quot;Youre not a hero, don&apos;t hesitate to run from battles and regain your strength.&quot;
<br>
<br>But even though it controls well, there are many problems with Hatred. Sound and visual glitches, weird collisions with walls and objects, horrible vehicle physics that make it an absolute chore to drive any vehicle are just some of them.
<br>When you face masses of enemies that fight back and you try to melee them or shoot em up close there can be some very clumsy behavior, not to mention absolutely horrible AI. The executions are very clumsily &quot;executed&quot; as-well making the game behave weirdly, like people running into you or awkwardly aiming a gun at your head waiting till the victim is finished off.
<br>
<br>Another massive problem I have with the game is that once you beat it, there&apos;s nothing else to do, there are no extra modes to make you want to go on another killing spree, its just over, and all that there&apos;s left to do is try and get some of the achievments you may have missed, which I personally never cared about in any games. If you compare Hatred to other titles that allow you to go on killing sprees, such as GTA 5, Postal 2 or Prototype, Hatred feels very limited in the ways you can go about it. However I got to take in consideration that those games were all done by bigger studios which had more experience making games.
<br>
<br>While Hatred was exactly what I thought it would be, it didn&apos;t let me down in that aspect. But its not a game I could recommend to anybody looking for a solid title to sink a lot of time into.
<br>Clumsy, shallow, short, yet fun and delightfully dark. A modern, more sinister Postal.
<br>If I look at it as an art piece conveying the emotion &quot;Hatred&quot; I would give it an A plus, cause it is by far the most mean spirited, darkest video game I have ever played. The hate its getting from gamers, critics and other groups alike proves my point.
