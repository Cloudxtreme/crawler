As for multiplayer, the only scenario where you would find enough players with enough time to play a &apos;round&apos; of this would be in a mental institutions&apos; common room. This expansion is basically a patch that people pay for, which means, yes, vanilla HOI 3 is actually worse.

However, with the Semper Fi Patch, the game is finally playable, though excruciatingly difficult to play due to a non-existent game manual that covers nothing about the game mechanics. Worst still is a broken Supply System which is still the biggest problem that Paradox Interactive has finally admitted to try to fix in the next Expansion called &quot;For the Motherland&quot;. Therefore to finally enjoy the game in all it&apos;s complexity, one simply has to wait till the next expansion. By then, Hearts of Iron II and the semper fi expansion will costt a buck on steam. If you can&apos;t wait for your WW2 Grand Strategy Fix, buy it now, grin and bear with the atrocious and poorly designed Supply system and have a lol at the &apos;historical gameplay&apos;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iii-semper-fi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1616081">Expand</a></span>

I was disappointed with the lack of depth offered in Civ  V and had someone recommend I check out Hearts of Iron. The learning curve is very steep (Took me about 4-5 Hours before I was able to feel like I had any control) however once you figure out the basics you&apos;re in for a treat. This game is a micro-managers dream come true.</span>

<br>
<br>2. Game-mechanics are somewhat booring. Rather limited options for doing anything, and unless you know the tricks you&apos;ll be doing absolutely nothing the first half of the game.
<br>
<br>3. This game is drudgery galore. It&apos;s main game-mechanic consist of organizing your troops into a proper chain of command. Doing this is about as time-consuming as in real life. A cluncky and unintuitive interface makes this chore into your own personal hell.
<br>
<br>4. HoI3 is spent waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never does.
<br>
<br>5. You have to go online to learn how to play the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iii-semper-fi/user-reviews?user_review_id=5045305">Expand</a></span>

<br>Cons: Worse music than Hearts of Iron II: Armageddon; the AI for the game is quite dumb, very much worse than it was in Hearts of Iron II; game has a much reduced scope from Hearts of Iron II: Armageddon; idiotic &quot;neutrality system&quot;; super-long loading screens; a huge amount of problems with realism and history in the game; the huge amount of tiny provinces destroys the performance and fun of the game; the good graphics destroy the framerate and make the game seem to go by ten times slower than Hearts of Iron II; feels like a huge unnecessary waste of resources to have a 3D graphics engine for what is essentially a 2D board game; game is so so bloated that it cannot run on older computers which could run Hearts of Iron II very well; this so-called expansion is a glorified, paid patch for a broken game.
<br>
<br>Score Breakdown: Graphics 7/10, Sound Effects and Music 3/10, Realism 2/10, Game Stability 1/10, Gameplay 1/10, Loading Screens and Frame Rate 1/10, Replay Value 0/10, Game Publisher&apos;s Ethics -100/10, Total Score 0/10
<br>
<br>Conclusion: Overall a huge step backwards from its prequel Hearts of Iron II: Armageddon. Instead of playing Hearts of Iron III or any of the Hearts of Iron III expansions, buy Hearts of Iron II: Doomsday with the Armageddon expansion and perhaps try the game Darkest Hour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iii-semper-fi/user-reviews?user_review_id=4490982">Expand</a></span>
