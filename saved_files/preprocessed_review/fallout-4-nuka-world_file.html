It&apos;s not horrible, but it&apos;s just so much collecting and finding things. While that&apos;s not a bad thing the process of gathering just felt dull in comparison to the rest of the game.</span>

Iam really sad that there is almost no story and quests are just pure Sh**. Dont buy it for 20 Bucks, not worth it even for the fans of the series like me.</span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_6708509"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Story: 0/10. It&apos;s the most unimaginative and forgettable plot Bethesda has come up with so far. Plot is incredibly unbelievable and dull, and there is not a single likable character in it. What&apos;s particularly awkward is that even the voice acting for the main character feels ingenuine and fake- probably because vanilla Fallout 4 built you up to be this settlement helping hero, and then this expansion suddenly makes you into a kingpin who can only make bad karma decisions. What happened to your main character in between the events of Fallout 4 and Nuka World? A psychotic break?? Whats strange about this DLC is that Bethesda actually did a decent job with Far Harbor in terms of storytelling and roleplaying: Far Harbor was a step forward away from the disaster vanilla Fallout 4 was, in that it introduced three unique and interesting factions, a great story, and the ability to make impactful decisions that lead to a variety of endings. Nuka World is like...twenty steps backward into the original Fallout 4, not only reproducing everything we hated about the game, but doing it even worse: in Nuka World we have three factions....that are all pretty much the same. There basically is no storyline. And there&apos;s only two endings. The &quot;bad&quot; ending is the one that actually plays through the expansion where you roleplay the raider, and no matter what decisions you make, the end result is the same. The &quot;good&quot; ending is actually completed in 10 minutes.
<br>
<br>Innovation: 1/10. Literally almost nothing is new about this game. All the &quot;new&quot; enemies are just reskins/retexures of existing enemies of vanilla Fallout 4...When I saw the retextured deathclaw I vowed to never support the developers responsible for this horrible expansion and the vanilla game. Even the ideas aren&apos;t new: the &quot;gauntlet&quot; is something we&apos;ve actually found before in the &quot;Maze House&quot; easter egg of vanilla Fallout 4.... The only thing that is kind of new is the ability to make raider outposts and attack your own settlements... no one asked for it.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: -1/10. The new gameplay that is introduced is the ability to lead an assault onto your own settlements. The mechanics behind it are so underdeveloped and cumbersome that just like vanilla Fallout 4, no one really wants to bother with it. The quests are also the absolute WORST quests Bethesda has ever released. The repeatable quests for caps is just &quot;kill or enslave&quot; this same no-name NPC in Diamond City, in the same room. An example of another quest is to roam around this big area scavenger-hunting for 20 of the same item... It&apos;s just boring busy work, and it doesn&apos;t feel like a fun game, it feels like a dumb chore.
<br>
<br>Overall: 0 + 1 + -1 = 0</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-nuka-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=6708509">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In short: the general setting sounds intriguing (wont spoil so just in general): you get to know raiders from the inside, may get to decide some fates and have some slavery elements. basically stuff a lot of players missed in vanilla Fallout 4. and all this in a setting of &quot;nuka world&quot; an eintertainment park that remembers somewhat of Westworld (if you remember the SciFi Flic, or read about the new series)
<br>
<br>ok, so whats wrong with it than.
<br>
<br>well it&#xB4;s like they set up some interns to take care of the DLC. While the general surrounding (ie the amusement park) can and does deliver (10/10), the Quests (lets not forget this is an RPG were playing) are super dull (0/10) and are totally senseless and break any immersion.
<br>Its like you downloaded some user mod where the guy decided to shove of 203497829384702938 robots or mobs up your throat because he found out how to spawn or place mobs.
<br>really. thats basically it. go clear one zillion mobs. doesnt make sense that you got plasma equipped &quot;entertainment park&quot; star ships ? well ye, who cares. lets just break any immersion. they didnt even bothered giving any explaination. it makes no sense. it plays extremly boring. its a chore.
<br>
<br>the quests that let you work on your reputation are also super repetitive and the &quot;slavery&quot; options deliver less than any alpha mod on nexus. less would have been so much more.
<br>less **** more story and more thought through mechanics.
<br>
<br>what you have here is basically some shooter clone where on every step something &quot;exciting&quot; explodes, spawns, shoots and whatnot. bs man. mayb you should have told your interns that they arent working on a COD clone.
<br>
<br>if youre into rpg.. avoid. like totally. my $0.02.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-nuka-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=6713291">Expand</a></span>

The three raider factions are all interesting, each having a unique perk available depending on how you treat them. The new companion is decent, with a very cliche background, his perk makes up for his personality and it&apos;s pretty easy to get if you have him with you while you take the park.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;ve put a solid 15 hours in on this dlc and still have areas to explore and quests to finish. I give it a 8.75/10 as a whole and give the theme park itself 10/10 wish that place was real.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-nuka-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=6677952">Expand</a></span>

I really liked the idea of a theme park so I gave it a go, I found it quite fun.
<br>
<br>The Dlc has the same game mechanics, same maze like design and the bullet sponges got more sponge like, but the main story elements were intriguing and the general game play was still all about freedom to explore.
<br>
<br>This dlc fallows a story arc close to the raiders that inhabit the park, there goal is to take over the rest of the park, so I promptly killed all the raiders and still cleared the park; there was plenty to do without siding with the evil raiders. Each part of the park felt unique and immersive, I thoroughly enjoyed the space roller coaster area( big dark underground roller coaster through a battle zone).
<br>
<br>As far as Fallout 4 DLC goes, this one feels less empty and more adventuresome than far harbor, although far harbors intro was one of the better Ive seen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-nuka-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=6701064">Expand</a></span>

Anyway, Nuka-World is actually a pretty neat little pack and is actually pretty quality DLC that rivals some in 3 and New Vegas. The story is quite linear and not quite as good as other packs, but there is definitely a lot of content to explore. New legendary power armor sets and some nice new weapons for sure! Loved the Fun House and Nuka-Galaxy coaster as well. Thought those were really fun. The raider settlements are pretty cool, though, they can mess up relations with other characters so I&apos;d do them at my own risk or maybe on another save file, but they&apos;re completely optional. Overall I have been pleased with this. Put about 30 hours into this DLC doing the quests and exploring and still haven&apos;t gotten everything yet.

                                        <span>It is a very original dlc that differs a lot from what we have seen so far, all mapping is well recreated in addition to being quite extensive and the story makes sense. And no, it&apos;s not just about completing a mission and that&apos;s it. There is a lot of background behind this downloadable content.</span>
