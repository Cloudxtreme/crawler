From the perspective of a reboot from a great series this is certainly a nice breath of fresh air and there is a lot great things that has been put into this game: The environments and visuals are some of the best I&apos;ve seen in a 3rd person game let a lone an action game for current generation technology. The combat system and mechanics are a joy to play and are free flowing and easy to control, the AI is pretty smart and react accordingly to their surroundings, character development is actually quite good considering a lot of people are saying they&apos;re 2 dimensional it&apos;s still a good story/plot all in all. These are some of the great things this game ha to offer. However I do feel that this game is missing something, it&apos;s missing the Indianna Jones style tomb/booby traps explorations we all grew to love in a Tomb Raider game. Don&apos;t get me wrong this game has tombs, it has exploration but it just doesn&apos;t quite feel the same and that brings me back to my point as a 3rd person action/adventure game this concept would be fine but as it&apos;s Tomb Raider I really crave this and that&apos;s why I will give Crystal Dynamics the benefit of the doubt and hope they add these important features for any forthcoming sequels. All in all a decent game and deserves a respectable score, however if you&apos;re looking for the true Tomb Raider feel you may be left slightly dissapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=2996235">Expand</a></span>

Awesome graphics, awesome dinamic, and I think the best was the sound, that was marvelous. People that are giving yellow scores is the &quot;Uncharted&quot; fans. Altought I have to say I love Uncharted series, there&apos;s no match to Lara Croft and this games just raised the bars that Uncharted brought. They&apos;re just jealous. At some points I got goosebumps playing the game. Well, if you have any doubt, don&apos;t waste your time, play this game now. There&apos;s no way you can regret.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=2990251">Expand</a></span>

Deeper than Uncharted, multiple routes to take through quests, and a level up system similar to Far Cry. It is a combo game that doesn&apos;t fail in anyway except for the lack of puzzles. Add some serious Tomb Raider puzzles and this may have been the best in the series. As it is, I&apos;m on a second playthrough already. They did a great job of making you feel that no matter how skilled you play the game, Lara may not actually succeed at her goals. Pros:
<br>TressFX hair.
<br>The island is the star.
<br>Great pacing to the story and to Lara&apos;s development as a character.
<br>Nice job of making the player feel that they may not succeed at their mission until the last second. Cons:
<br>Massive performance drop with TressFX hair on (don&apos;t use this on anything but a top Intel chip processor and AMD 6970+ or NVIDIA GFX 660ti  card, it killed every other set up I used).
<br>No puzzles (well they exist, but are short and very easy).
<br>Water could be better and Lara can&apos;t swim.
<br>Freedom of movement around the island comes very late in the story at which point you don&apos;t care about exploring any more. PC controls are not as smooth as the controller, again making the PC feel like an afterthought. Many people complain of crashes, but I had a smooth experience. Final Judgment:
<br>It is worth the $50 only if you like replaying games. It is short and a one time play for people only interested in the story. My first playthrough was about 8 hours and I completed 84% of the collectibles and challenges. Maybe a 6 hour game if you plow through the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=2998023">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics are sensational (I&apos;m running a gtx680), the hair effects look amazing most of the time, but they have their glitches and screw ups (like the effects disappearing for a second and her hair looking bland during intense cut scenes, it could be a driver thing or something they could patch). As mentioned the story is thrilling and keeps you wanting more, the side quests are worthwhile and brings back old Lara memories. The gameplay is solid, the free running reminds me of assassins creed mixed with old school lara. The bow is great, the guns can feel a bit clunky at times but still suits fine considering she wouldn&apos;t be a gun expert. Point blank confrontations with enemies are awkward at first but goes nicely with the story, but once you adapt and learn abilities it works out great and flows greatly.
<br>
<br>Overall a true underdog for me and a very nice recreation of Lara. Good job crystal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=2981911">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay has depth and combat has a visceral feel. The controls are simple and do not get in the way of the action or story. The graphics and sound are state-of-the-art and rival anything seen and heard in other games released in the last year. Do yourself a favor and upgrade your computer. The Ultimate graphics setting is absolutely beautiful.
<br>
<br>The UI is excellent and highly polished and most importantly functional. The new collection and achievement systems encourage you to explore the island. They also have the added advantage of giving you experience and items which in turn can be used to add skills and upgrade weapons.
<br>
<br>A definite Game Of The Year contender.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=2989170">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Trying to gather the collectibles spread around the map may distract you from the game&apos;s main selling point: it&apos;s character development and the interaction with the environment, but those menial exploration tasks can be left to after the endgame  the completionist in me wanted to ditch the sense of urgency and collect everything on the first play-through, but that spoils the mood.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is solid, the graphics are stunning and Lara&apos;s character is unbelievably well done, but the rest of the crew is unmemorable to say the best, sometimes falling into &quot;I wish friendly-fire could be turned off&quot; territory. The narrative is very common place (again, not a bad thing), but the action feels... unnatural (too much killing, even if &quot;justified&quot;).
<br>
<br>The difficult is set very, very low: the (environmental) puzzles are okay, but ammo is pretty much infinite, making fragility the only problem for Lara, but again no complaints here: dying over and over again has always been a selling point for this franchise (really!).
<br>
<br>In this reboot we don&apos;t have huge, over-the-top and out-of-this-world Tombs, neither did we get underwater sequences (in fact, on my gameplay Lara drowned at least a dozen times) but yes  this is solid environment and survival exploration with the most loved female explorer ever. This game truly turns Lara&apos;s character into all that she is know  even a dose of sex appeal is there, when she isn&apos;t mass murdering entire armies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=2990800">Expand</a></span>

Controls are very fluid and smooth with a keyboard/mouse. Some people hate QTEs, so if you hate &apos;em, too bad. This game has them. I think they&apos;re a perfectly fine gameplay mechanic. I don&apos;t mind.
<br>
<br>Combat is, like the controls, fluid and smooth. I&apos;m shocked, considering Crystal Dynamics has largely made...well...games far inferior to this in the past. :/
<br>
<br>Very cinematic gameplay that is a mixture of Uncharted/Assassin&apos;s Creed. The optional &quot;Tombs&quot; have, so far, been relatively easy. I was always a fan of the Tomb Raider stories/lore, but never a fan of the puzzle-based gameplay in the previous games, and while there&apos;s some small element of puzzles in the main game, it&apos;s definitely more of an action/adventure than an environment puzzle. Which I think is great.
<br>
<br>The story, and character evolution of Laura, so far, has also been great. It&apos;s audacious to say this only three hours in, but I can already see this being in the conversation for end-of-year awards when November/December rolls around.
<br>
<br>Just fantastic presentation, solidly smooth gameplay, and far more likable Laura now that she isn&apos;t wearing hotpants with Double D cups. I&apos;ll hold off on a 10 until I actually finish. ;D About the only thing I can think of at this point that would make me lower my score later is if they end it on a cliffhanger.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=2981212">Expand</a></span>

<br>Leave them as an option if people want it that way but there should have been an option to skip as an instant death over and over again for not pressing a button on a controller or a key on a keyboard within a millisecond is pretty cheap.

And Tomb Raider Linear and scripted? I wonder why that is? Maybe because it is a game where the story is supposed to be linear because it is a prequel to how Lara Croft became a BAMF, This game is meant to have a tighter grip on the beginning of the game because rather than going through stupid slow boring tutorials that we all hate the game actually teaches you while going through Adrenaline filled action. The game is supposed to be a linear game and just because it is linear doesn&apos;t mean that&apos;s a bad thing. Before you judge this game correctly and accurately with a real review don&apos;t rage at it. From what I have played through the game is awesome and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=2981721">Expand</a></span>

Sadly it was anything but 8/10 worthy. The start of the game is just about the only reason this game scored a 4 from me, as it really kicked off to great satisfaction. At the start it really feels like Lara is completely down and out and quite literally fighting for her life. Things like having to search for food and shivering until the fire was complete was extremely nice touches. Then it just started to go downhill, and it didn&apos;t stop. I came into the game expecting a Action/Adventure/Puzzle/Platformer and what I got was a ACTION focused, semi-adventure with minor Platforming elements and a couple of crappy puzzles. The story was interesting but sadly the writing team completely ruined any intrigue the story had. Poorly timed cutscene interaction combined with strings of conversations which felt like they came straight out of &apos;Short story writing for dummies&apos;, ultimately made for boring character interaction and a few chuckles at strange conversation flow. Characters were extremely cliched but thankfully so few of them get any sort of development that you don&apos;t have to cringe to much at watching them become fully evolved walking Cliches. Lara&apos;s development is less &apos;Girl to Hardened Survivor&apos; and more, &apos;Is this girl stupid, why would she ever want to go on an exploration ever again?&apos; There was extremely few puzzles and they were all ridiculously easy. Tombs where the puzzles were, however, extremely gorgeous and it&apos;s probably worth going inside for a look but then not even bothering to do the puzzle. Platforming was there but extremely watered down. There was a moment where I was jumping around little rocky cliffs and I found a way to reach the ground, however upon landing on the ground from a tiny jump I died. I had hit a &apos;DeadZone&apos;, which frankly is a disgusting thing to have in a game and it really made me think twice before bothering to try any interesting platforming for the rest of the game because there was probably not going to be anything there or a deadzone. However I did continue trying and every platform stage is very &apos;hand-holdy&apos;, you never really get a chance to just jump around, you always have to use your tools and because of this just about any place you&apos;d reach by platforming was extremely spelled out and the game practically guided you in bright yellow. The Graphics weren&apos;t anything to be overly proud of, if anything a bit below average for a 2013 AAA title (Probably slightly worse then Deus Ex  Human Revolution and a little better then Mass Effect 3). Artstyle was probably akin to Mass Effect 3, very sort of standard video game, slightly cartoony realism. The opening Cinematic was fairly meh, not even close to the quality of the Openings to say; Deus Ex: HR, Witcher 2 etc. Cutscenes were well done but the Camera got a little funky from time to time and of course QTE (Quick Time Events) were just rife throughout which really detracted from them. On that matter the QTE&apos;s were a massive annoyance, having to use them for something as simple as a &apos;Stealth Kill&apos; was just absurd, and then having to use them in practically every aspect of the game was just over the top. My final point, and this is where I&apos;ll sum up as well, is that simply it&apos;s sad when you play a game labeled as a; Action/Adventure/Platformer and the most polished and fun part of the game is the standard boring &apos;Call of Duty&apos; style shooting elements. Based off how the game started I was expecting Alot of Adventure, Alot of Platforming and a bit of Action and then about 25% of the way through it just started to deteriorate rapidly and turned into a full on Action game with some basic Platforming. The final 50-60% of the game just felt like I was running from one scripted shooting encounter to the next, it didn&apos;t even feel like an adventure. It feels like they&apos;ve tried to do what alot of Video Games lately are doing and attract the Call of Duty/Battlefield market. Which clearly has worked for them considering all the rave reviews from the same people who praise those lame shooters, but for someone like me who hasn&apos;t experienced a proper good Action/Adventure/Platformer since Donkey Kong 64, I was once again extremely let down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3008698">Expand</a></span>

The combat is repetitive, headshots basically line themselves up and you can dodge the ai&apos;s attacks damn near blindfolded. The gore is over the top and the plot feels shaky. Overall it feels less like a genuine exploration platformer and more like one of the old FMV games on the original Playstation in the mid to late 90&apos;s. What we need is a Tomb Raider that goes back to the series roots  that is, actual *Tomb Raiding* large expansive tombs, small and confined tombs, traps that try to kill you at every turn and require actual dexterity to evade, and jumps that require forethought, practice and flawless execution in order to progress. This game is not that, it&apos;s basically snuff-porn for people who like their victims filthy and drenched in gore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3021589">Expand</a></span>

Follow your only path and do only what game tells you to. You&apos;re too stupid to decide. If you like games which take your hand and lead from point A to B all the time, you&apos;ll like this. Otherwise, prepare for a nightmare. And BTW, story is average. I don&apos;t play games for SFX. Ignore this game, if you truly love freedom.

I just want to control the character myself, Is that too much to ask nowadays? If I want good story, I go and watch a movie or read a book. Why do devs have to put this linear cinematic push a button garbage into video games?</span>

<br>-Voice acting is good.
<br>Thats it for everything good about this game. Now for the con&apos;s:
<br>-Even though Lara is a great character, almost every other character is boring and 2-dimensional. You don&apos;t feel any connection with any of them.
<br>-Way too many cut scenes! Especially at the beginning of the game. Also, there are some sections which severely restrict the player&apos;s control. This isn&apos;t fun.
<br>-The dreaded quick-time event. There are also too many of them, and they appear when you least think. You never know if it will be a cut scene, or a random quick-time event. They aren&apos;t built into the combat system very well either. The only time I ever died was to this atrocity of a gameplay mechanic. Also, did I mention they aren&apos;t fun?
<br>-The so-called &quot;platforming&quot; is ridiculously easy. This is the one area they could have went crazy with, but they decided to play it safe and make it so easy even a toddler could beat it.
<br>-Hand-holding gameplay. Are you lost? Just use your &apos;survival instincts&apos; to point you the direction you need to go. You seriously don&apos;t even need this because the areas are smaller than they look, and the game is mostly linear. You miss all your shots on the wolf pack thats about to eat you alive? Don&apos;t worry, we will toss some QTEs your way so you don&apos;t die right away. Regenerating health? Check. Frequent checkpoints? Check. Lackluster AI? Check.
<br>-Simplistic puzzle elements. Once in while, you get puzzles. Needless to say, most of them require little to no thinking on your part. There usually only a few elements to the puzzle, and even if you get stuck, you can use your &apos;survival instincts&apos; to help you point out the elements.
<br>-Music is forgettable. I don&apos;t think I need to explain this further.
<br>-Story is average.
<br>-Lack of varied weaponry. You got your bow, pistol, and shotgun. Thats it, unless you want to count the axe that you use to pry open doors among other things.
<br>-Multiplayer mode... I don&apos;t even want to get into this. Tomb Raider has always been a single player game.
<br>
<br>tl;dr version:
<br>Overall, this game is just too generic. It looks pretty, but thats about it. I am disappointed in how it turned out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3001495">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphically  very pretty.
<br>Nice to see an incarnation of Tomb Raider where Lara Croft&apos;s  haven&apos;t grown by a cup size between releases and not look like silicon implants.
<br>Better story line (but only just).
<br>Nixxes have made this a half-decent port from console.
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>
<br>Typical consoletard linear gameplay.
<br>Short  probably less than 15 hours gameplay.</span>

Negatives: The amount of stuff you &apos;have&apos; to pick up is insane and most of it makes no sense. Relics, mushrooms, gps cache&apos;s etc. All of this is just dumb, the only things actually worth picking up is the documents, because they add to the story and character development, other than that you just get an xp bonus.
<br>
<br>I would have liked to have the survival aspect of the game more thoroughly pronounced, I like that you have to salvage stuff to create your/upgrade your makeshift weapons, but they should have gone a bit further on that note if you ask me. Hopefully they will do that in the next game.
<br>I would have loved to see less QTE&apos;s aswell, or at least make them more apparent as to what you are supposed to do during the QTE, there was one where all it said was hit the button (not which one) when the circle blinks, and I have a keyboard, so there are lots of buttons to press. Anyway that would go down as a bug and something you can accept, since you will forget it later on.
<br>Also, stop with the achievement announcements and &quot;model unlocked&quot; stuff that happens almost constantly, it takes away from being completely gripped by the game. I would have been completely swallowed by it had these things not happened.
<br>A last negative is that the nVidia drivers for the game were horrible, which was both part crystal dynamics and nvidias fault, even if the game is &quot;made for AMD&quot; it makes no sense to have it so horribly optimized as it was for nvidia cards at launch. Crash to desktop, insane fps drops, weird gpu usage etc. This has all been fixed, but still, it should not have happened in the first place.
<br>
<br>My verdict is a 9/10, the issues I have listed are, for me, enough to drag it down a point, but no further... This is a masterpiece, and 2013 has shown to be a great year, so far, for gaming, if you ask me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3068705">Expand</a></span>

<br>Buy it, buy it, buy it! Fun, enthralling storyline and gameplay. Worth your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3525568">Expand</a></span>

The visuals are great and the animations are nice and fluid. The environments are nicely designed and quite varied. The game also sounds great with enjoyable voice acting and the production values of the game is overall quite nice.
<br>
<br>I personally really enjoyed the setting of the game and i liked the way the handled the story and character interactions. The shooting and jumping in the game is quite satisfying and i thought that it was varied enough for its appeal to last throughout the game. There are some annoying quicktime events here and there and the game is from time to time very much scripted and linear. But they do pull this off reasonably well and i found myself not hating the scripted nature of some of its gameplay.
<br>
<br>But the game do also have some areas with more freedom which is a nice change of pace. The jumping puzzles in the game have taken a back seat for the shooting stuff and stylished jumping sequences. Personally i didnt mind since i am not a big fan of jumping puzzles but i do believe its worth mentioning. There is also a whole less tomb raiding than you would expect from a Tomb raider game. The tombs in the game are however quite enjoyable even though the puzzles aren&apos;t all that challenging.
<br>
<br>The action in the game is quite enjoyable and i enjoyed that you could tackle different situations in a number of ways. The upgrade system is also a nice touch with unluckable silencers and stuff like that. The bow is also a fun weapon to use and it very much fits the setting of the game. One complaint i do have on the combat is the enemy variety. The humanoid enemies are varied enough but i believe that the game really would benefit from having more animal-based enemies. It would also really fit the setting to have stuff like big bears or some water based enemy in the game.
<br>
<br>And while we are on the topic of the wild life. I do think that it is sad that the developers didn&apos;t expand on the hunting and gathering options in the game. That would have been a ton of fun and fitted the games setting. I did however enjoy the different collectibles a great deal.
<br>
<br>Tomb Raider is to sum it up a pretty good game. It hardly reinvents the wheel and the scripted nature of the game and the way its quite action oriented may piss some people of. The game do however contain a quite good and meaty campaign and its definitely worth picking up if you are looking for a fun around 10 hour long campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3196929">Expand</a></span>

The combat is solid and the visuals are amazing. Lara looks and sounds great. The quick time events are annoying as ever, but they are few and far between.

<br>The graphics on PC are stunning, amazing. And they support the great atmosphere created by music and story, which is greatly great. The gameplay contains all the classical elements from the original Tomb Raider&apos;s. But they&apos;re obviously modified. Combat is great! Even if the AI isn&apos;t too smart, it still works well. The auto-cover system works very well too! The exploration is something really amazing: the hubs are really big! And the documents and the relics are really a lot! Also, the documents are super duper interesting. They tell you a lot about Yamatai&apos;s story and they&apos;re well written. In case you didn&apos;t know, Yamatai is the island where the game takes place. Following only the story path, you&apos;ll have a great and cinematic experience, but, I really tip you to collect everything to understand more about the history and then enjoy more the events in the game (at least on your first playthrough). There are a lot of emotional scenes in the game. The supporting cast (for the example the Endurance&apos;s crew) is amazingly done! I don&apos;t know why some people say that the secondary characters are not well made... they are well made! But... you have to collect their documents to understand more about them and to know them better. Now let&apos;s talk about the QTEs... well, even if I&apos;m not a big fan of QTEs, they didn&apos;t bother me at all in the game. They were also good in some scenes. Also the ending is pretty epic. And iconic. I really love how Lara grows in the game. And there we come to an important piece: the skills upgrades and the gear upgrades. They are amazing. Maybe the gear upgrades are better done than the skills&apos; ones... they&apos;re all great though! Well, what must I say now? Oh, eh, the atmosphere is really intense and very scary at some points in the game... Really scary. Love it! I also think that the game is pretty scripted. But not too much... because you can still face the situations in different ways... Well, I&apos;m done. 10 out of 10. Amazing game. Congrats Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3018482">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay, story, graphics are the best i ever seen in a Tomb Raider game EVER, Crystal Dynamics really did a great job. My only issues with the game that i had was that the other characters are really nothing worth even remembering, but the story is very well told and there&apos;s plenty to do in the game, to finding treasure to finding secret tombs and upgrading all your skills. This game made me proud of the franchise and have new hope that Lara Croft will never die but only get better for future Tomb Raider games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3039159">Expand</a></span>

Stunning visuals, great sound/voice acting, intense story and gameplay that will leave you incredibly satisfied with your purchase. One thing that stands out in my opinion is the level design. The way the game directs you, leaves you options and controls your reactions to certain situations is just amazing. I think that is great considering many people worried about this game looking to action/adventure shoot-em-up than the creative level-designs from the previous games. I&apos;m glad to say that everything is balanced fantastically, and just the right amount of optional completion. There are a few problems with the PC drivers, but a couple of patches later fix this almost fully. The aging consoles bring this game down too much and with my rig running this on ultimate setting at a comfortable 60fps it&apos;s hard to say that you should play it on anything else. The PC version is the way to go and even the keyboard and mouse feel more comfortable than the controller.

I am a rare breed where I can&apos;t finish a game let alone get 30 minutes into one. This game wasn&apos;t one that let me sink my teeth right in off the bat. Once I got into knowing where Lara&apos;s character was going I just had to know what happened next. The presentation to this game was nothing but amazing. Not since Max Payne 3 has a game made me connect to the character and feel as if my actions were truly controlling and manipulating what is next for her. At first the gameplay does seem quite forced and boring. Hunt this, QTE... I really didn&apos;t care for it. But once you break the first sequence of events you&apos;re in for quite a thrilling experience. Lara is acted by the lovely Camilla Luddington. Initially I played this game purely because of her, she has yet to be discovered in Hollywood and this may have been what I thought was her chance to really prove her skill. I couldn&apos;t have been more correct. She was everything that I could want in a character that was the face of gaming for quite a few years, yet she made it her own and created someone which feels as if there was someone like Lara.

<br>I am done with making this out to be the best game ever. But it is the game of the year thus far. 9.4/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3031908">Expand</a></span>

This re-imagining exists as sort of a Secret Origins for Lara Croft, showing how she went from the inquisitive skeptical college graduate and archaeologist to hardened survivor and intrepid explorer and eponymous Tomb Raider. I&apos;m no expert on the character as I&apos;ve never been that huge a fan of the series, while the idea was always appealing it never lured me in beyond, also I was a Nintendo Kid growing up, so if you&apos;re looking for a review that compares this tomb raider to the rest of the series disregard much of this. Tomb Raider begins with a Naive, innocent Lara going through hell, as the game progresses, Lara becomes more and more injured, and degraded, as she struggles to survive and overcome challenges. As a result of this characterization and graphic suffering and desperation, from the voice acting, to the animation, to the dirt and wounds and tearing of clothing,  Lara&apos;s trial by fire feels almost uncomfortably real and I loved every minute of it. Every challenge she overcomes, she reacts to realistically and becomes stronger. She evolves into the character that became so iconic. Lara is fully 3 dimension and this is wholly her story. Speaking of story, the game employs a storytelling method of Lara&apos;s natural curiosity getting the better of her, even through all she&apos;s suffering through and being challenged with to uncover the secrets of the island she&apos;s crashed on.  By finding old documents, the journals of long dead inhabitants of the islands, her crewmates, her own internal monologues at campfires, and through uncovering lost tombs and relics scattered throughout the island, you discover the secrets and revelations of the islands dark past yourself. This game is very much like playing an Indiana Jones movie mixed with some survival horror and cult shocker.  The gameplay is smooth and feels visceral and rewarding, you feel real danger, and there are genuine thrills, additionally, failure is rewarded with a gruesome and not for the feint of heart death sequence that would push the squeamish to do better, further amping up the survival factor (though a sadistic player may try to fail each one once just to see all the many death animations and there are a lot of them) The combat however is typical of the genre, cover based with much more desperation involve, regenerating health returns but without a health bar or any track of it, the slightest mix up can get you killed, but there is usally a chance to get to cover and survive. that is what this game is all about. Survival. armed with bow and arrow, climbing axe, pistol,and later more brutal weapons, Lara gets downright savage in this game toward the end with her own killing animations.  You gain experience for finding relics, killing, hunting, finding collectibles and story objectives which are used to buy skills, higher level skills are only unlocked after unlocking a number of prequisite skills to gain access to another tier, weapons can be upgraded to a point at which you must find parts to upgrade to another tier of of weapon (a makeshift bow becomes a recurve bow, et cetera) The game places emphasis on using your head, enviroment, surroundings and stealth to your advantage, you have a dedicated &apos;scramble&apos; button to avoid or minimize damage in combat, that while effective is not guaranteed to work. Standing out of cover to take your time is frustrating though, as it opens you up, but the aiming is sluggish (and you must be aiming to fire) and the enemies move quickly and almost non stop, even when you&apos;re still unnoticed, while realistic, can be irritating as it makes carefully timing your shots less effective and more dangerous than frantically spraying bullets in combat and hoping you kill it. perhaps this adds a dose of realism? I dont think so.
<br>
<br>The few flaws this game has is the fact that I feel it overuses quick time events somewhat, while I like them and think they enhance cut scenes by making them more &quot;gamey&quot; they are something of a crutch. I dislike how easy the platforming is sometimes and how linear the game can be, but the puzzles are often interesting, yet still simple while I would prefer more complex ones, they are there but too few. There are elements of metroidvania gameplay here I appreciate (areas and bonuses are locked until you get a certain piece of equipment, at which point you can return to the area) also, the combat has too much emphasis on gunning down your opponents later in game and it&apos;s much much more difficult to remain stealthy and precise. it becomes too easy to simply mow down enemies with various guns late game. While satisfying the first chance you get to do this, it hurts the overall experience. But overall, the negatives aren&apos;t enough to weigh down such a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3019278">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game changes that.  I find myself enjoying every minute of the game from the visuals, sound, challenges and the storyline as well.  The idea of this being how Lara became who she is now is shown in an accurate and interesting way.  Tress FX from AMD on the PC versions is actually a huge addition to the game.  I mocked the idea of someone animating hair because, let&apos;s be honest, it&apos;s just hair.  However, to see it in action it actually does add detail and realism to the game itself.  If you have any desire to play a Tomb Raider game, do not pass this one up.  This one is definitely one of the best of 2013 so far.
<br>
<br>Pros: Visuals are outstanding (Tress FX).  Storytelling is great.  Combat is entertaining and the cover system just &apos;works&apos; even though it&apos;s not complex.
<br>
<br>Cons: nVidia drivers aren&apos;t optimized for this just yet so on Ultra there will be some slow down on high end PC&apos;s.  And....nothing else?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3011678">Expand</a></span>

I play all types of games, and this has been one of my favorite ones lately.  I would give this a 10, but the multiplayer shouldn&apos;t be there, it&apos;s more of a thing to do after you have done 100% completion on hardest setting.  I played through the entire game on normal with 80% completion when I was done, and man did I have fun.  The people who complain about QTE&apos;s must be jaded to the fun that they can be, and how it keeps you honest around every corner by making sure you got your hand on the buttons or you could be roflstomped.  Tomb Raider is back, and making an attempt to freshen up what had gotten to be a stale shooter with puzzles.  Some people hate change, but in my opinion, without the overhaul that SE did with this franchise, Lara would be done.  I can honestly say that I felt attached to Lara in this game unlike any previous titles, and the secondary characters had some dimension, but you have to read all of the journals and hear all of the really well done vocal/voice work to understand them deeper than just &quot;Lara and friends&quot;.  The graphics are well done, with the exception of some shadow glitches in certain foliage on PC (hoping it&apos;s a small patch fix.) I was impressed overall by the quality and consistency, there was even a graphic setting for her hair which when turned on, made it render what seems like each strand of hair and not a solid seeming hair.  The action has you going non stop from place to place, there is always something to do, and finding all of the weapon upgrades is key to having the most fun out of this game.  I would recommend this game to my friends and family, I thought it was very well done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3013710">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also, as pc user it has to be noted that it is the best conversion I&apos;ve ever saw. I have an old acer laptop with just a 540M but still I&apos;m able to play at normal-high settings with incredible graphics and very smooth.

<br>The cons are the stupid perk system and the story, it is a bit short. I do recommend you to not skip the puzzle and secondary quests, they are very nice and &quot;old tomb raider&quot; style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3014373">Expand</a></span>

<br>The multiplayer is not so fantastic, well, planting traps is cool but, i don&apos;t see anything more in the multiplayer, is a little boring i can talk!
<br>Well, but the game is GREAT, is the best Lara Croft game I&apos;ve ever played, deserves a 9!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3014598">Expand</a></span>

I give it a 9 because it could have been a little more challenging. It took me 26 hours to complete the game with a 100% score on all sectors and upgrades/skills.</span>

With the option bonus of puzzle tombs and for the collectors plenty to find and explore. I thoroughly enjoyed the game, so far best of 2013. Tons of fun, and hope they make another!

After playing this reboot I can honestly say its one the best games ive played in a long long while. Very atmospheric, visuals are amazing in ultra and gameplay is so smooth and seemless. Makes me want to carry on playing to get to the 100% completion!</span>

I was always Fan of Tomb Rider and i really was afraid that they will ruin with this new installment reboot. I was wrong. The Graphics are breathtaking  The story telling is one of the best today and the mechanics are platform is still there. They Manage to make a Game that although feels like a movie which is not a bad thing it offers a entertainment that most games are not. The platform from all games is still here  the shooting is fun and the new Upgrade mechanics are really nice new additions. The only problem with this Title was the Quick Time Events. Although they really did a awesome job and thats how QTE should be in a Game. In most cases (In PC mostly) you didn&apos;t know what button to press in order to complete it. But other than that this game is a Fine example of how a QTE should be created  The Wolf scene at the start was amazing.
<br>
<br>I recommend this title to every Fan  old and new of Lara Croft.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3043935">Expand</a></span>

Dynamic and exciting storyline drives players to spend time or Lara Croft and her first adventure. The art was beautiful even on low settings of the game. Controls and combat were really smooth especially when Lara Croft jumps from a hanging rope to climb the white rocks. There were a few areas that needed to be improved such as quick-time events that caught the player in such a sudden. Or notify that the action button of E and F are being used as a quick time event button. Other than that Tomb Raider can allow players to discover more tombs and secret areas if the player chooses to stay off the storyline. The levels in the game can be very linear sometimes but that does not defeat the purpose of the game. Crystal Dynamics did a wonderful job and this game could have chosen the 59.99 price range but chooses not to was a smart move. This game is worth the money and players are suggested to buy this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3044591">Expand</a></span>

Its on my GOTY list with Bioshock Infinite and Dead Space 3 (Yes DS3, deal with it.) I never like Tomb Raider, but this reboot got it down just right. Its a great new twist on the series and i want to see a sequel. The only problems this game has is the the quicktime events ruin your experience sometimes. Youll be watching a cutscene only for a the game to throw a &quot;hit the e key&quot; at you and make you die. On top of that, you have little time to react and if you hit the wrong one you die. It sometimes becomes a game of simon says as you try to remember the pattern of whats coming up next because youll die every time. Other than that its great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3148592">Expand</a></span>

Not so much choosing of you own. Just follow the path. All the escapes and collapsing runs a stunning work and setup. But its just to controlled and as the player i feel like i have no control. Then i would have liked to see more advance puzzle. And not so easy a way to find all the treasures that just pups up on the map and gps track on them. The treasures also feels like something completely unnecessary in the game. But but.. As i give this game a score on 9 just say that the overall off the game still works totally awesome. I just see a lot of things that would make this game epic. It really have a lot off potential. So i look forward to the next chapter in Lara crofts life..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3046792">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So basically, yes this game is somewhat like the Uncharted series, and that is a very GOOD thing. It&apos;s still Lara Croft, it&apos;s still Tomb Raider, and the types of puzzles we use to see in previous TR games are still to be found, except there&apos;s a lot more action, more story, more characters, more immersion, more of all that makes a game good.
<br>
<br>Wrexmer is complaining about cut scenes and quick time events. I must say, both of these elements were extremely well done in this game, blending in well with the action and context, they are not disruptive at all. I can imagine some people have an absolute dislike for cut scenes and quicktime events, fine, but if that&apos;s not your personal case, then I say, you will love the cutscenes and quicktime events. As a matter of fact, in my opinion, this game has THE VERY BEST quicktime event implementation I have ever seen. So there.
<br>
<br>There really is nothing negative I could say about this game. It could have been longer, but only because it is so excellent  you can never have too much excellent gaming, right? I clock my playthrough on medium difficulty at 14 hours, which is very decent.

<br>Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this game, it is a SPLENDID release, and for once, fully worth the full retail/launch price of $49.99. I almost feel guilty getting it on special for $12.49. Yes, it&apos;s that good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3561370">Expand</a></span>

I never played any of the previous games and really had no intention to but this one was available for free as a member of Playstation Plus so figured I would give it shot.  This best comparison point would be the Uncharted series (which I love) and I think this game was highly influenced by those titles but they pulled it off pretty well.  There are some mind blowing action sequences on par with the best of those in Uncharted.
<br>
<br>The environments are beautifully rendered and definitely one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game - the island is just super fun to explore and there are plenty of extras to find.  There are some role playing elements to the game and I felt that the skill system worked pretty well and most of the choices were actually useful or just plain cool to see in action.
<br>
<br>The story was engrossing but the character dialogue and voice acting seemed a little off (at least compared to Naughty Dog games) but it&apos;s still probably better than average.  The one thing that seemed a little flat in this game was the combat - it gets a little boring at times and was too repetitive.  The emphasis was clearly on other aspects of the game and I wouldn&apos;t call this a hardcore shooter so that&apos;s understandable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=4124132">Expand</a></span>

Thus, only Lara&apos;s character is properly developed, but not any other supporting characters. TLOU is way more magical as it gets you fully immersed in the relationship between Ellie &amp; Joel. Lara is just Lara. I think we need Lara to start having a serious relationship with someone else, explore caves together &amp; go into battle together. Its more fun with &quot;friends&quot;, even if they&apos;re AI bots. Other than this lonely feel to this game, the rest of the game is simply brilliant! Loved the highs &amp; lows of the game. Decent length &amp; a good story (unlike the ultra-short piece of crap called BF4). I&apos;m glad the puzzles have been toned down, to keep the story moving. Those who like puzzles can always explore the optional caves. I prefer the main quests to enjoy the story on 1st playthrough. Well, looking forward to Tomb Raider 2!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3785547">Expand</a></span>

The powerful shots has sent the wild board&apos;s eyeballs out flying like a shotgun&apos;s pellets - into another 2 soldiers&apos; mouth as they dropped their gob open at hearing the explosion! The 2 solders are choking on the eyeballs (obstructed throat). I used a handgun and making a single shot to their heads as they pukes or choking about ... a puzzle game huh?! Let your imagination run wild, but sure couldn&apos;t see why a grenade can&apos;t kill a wild board with a direct shot to it&apos;s trunk! Game bugs?! So shall never download games on this planet, really hate FADE like copy-protections! Go to hell with CodeMaster the sh!t masters!

And it worked. Really well.
<br>
<br>I was reminded of Batman Arkham Asylum when playing this game, and though there is a free roaming aspect to it, the world feels much more contained than other &quot;open-world&quot; games. The puzzles and &apos;&apos;tombs&apos;&apos; in the game are really quite easy, with most areas only requiring you to complete one or two challenges before allowing you to progress. It is very likely that this was done to keep the action flowing and eliminate any chance of player frustration. That being said, I would have liked to see longer and more challenging puzzles in the &quot;optional&quot; tombs.There seems never to be any downtime in the story, and there is always an important quest calling to keep the player moving. Large parts of the game are scripted, but it feels more like you&apos;re playing a Lara Croft action movie rather than visiting a Tomb Raider theme park.
<br>The single player took me about 15 hours to 100% on hard, meaning that its not a terribly LONG game, but it it does have some replay value in terms of game play. The combat, plat-forming, and stealth are all implemented extremely well, including a really convenient &quot;survivor mode&quot; which cuts out a lot of the BS that a game like this can contain (enemies detecting you for no reason, trying to climb on things that aren&apos;t interact-able, etc). The animations are great, as well as the context based rag doll and cover systems. Lara moves like a jungle cat while crouching, dodging, and rolling to avoid and take down enemies. Kill moves and cinematics feature the tried and true quick-time-event method, where you press one or two buttons to perform actions.
<br>While the single player is an excellent game all around and I&apos;m really excited for a sequel, the multi player suffers from Max Payne 3 syndrome. There are no dedicated servers, leading to laggy player-created lobbies and eventually meaning a shorter shelf life. The controls don&apos;t translate too well and the action feels wobbly. Players sometimes warp around and kill you before you see them, and its WAY to easy to spawn camp the enemy team (or get spawn camped). All and all, Crystal Dynamics did what they set out to do; reboot an old and beloved action adventure series in a whole new way. The multi player may seem tacked on, and will likely only survive for a month or two, but the Single Player experience will excite and amp up players for the future of this (not so) brand new Series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3055194">Expand</a></span>

<br>[Released] by Square Enix and ported to PC by Nixxies: yeah Nixxies did good work and you should enjoy it. Nixxies did however screw one thing up: Remapping primary key bindings is possible but the alternative secondary key bindings just screw up and then screwed up the on screen instructions. Tolerable but just plain poor programming on somebodies part&#x2026; NB: This is not a game breaker and should not affect your decision to buy this game because this game really is Fantastic, I just wanted Square Enix and Nixxies to know that this looks bad for them. I enjoyed every second of this game otherwise.
<br>
<br>[DRM] Steam only, thank goodness there is no GamesForWindowsLive / Origin / Uplay on this title, I did not have to create an alternative account. [Story] is a prequel to all the Lara Croft adventures&#x2026;young Lara Croft, a little more helpless, a little more emotional, and sometimes a little too whiny. Character dialogue is immature especially with NPCs, who wrote this balloney? [Saves] Automatic saves as they should be. Perfect. Manual saves as usual.
<br>
<br>[Bugs] None that I am aware of&#x2026;.except the key binding fudge. Digital fudge.

<br>[Graphics] Default settings were to heavy on the post processing&#x2026;. Even though my PC was flipping 60 FPS the depth of field effects and other sh*t was too much. I cut back a lot of the effects and it looked great; sometimes Less is More, and this was it.

<br>Like pathfinding and puzzle-solving to gain access to... you know... tombs? You probably want to buy something else.
<br>Very pretty game with some nicely designed big maps, but gameplay is uninspired at best, and annoying as hell at worst. Combat and movement is laggy while the camera jerks around wildly. Very linear in many sections, and the hand-holding for the console kiddies (despite being a very rated M game) is blatant. Tacked-on terrible multiplayer is worth nothing. Single-player campaign has little to no replay value.
<br>It&apos;s amazing how much good content manages to shine through this though, and ultimately it&apos;s a mildly entertaining diversion - for those that can stomach its glaring problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=4448644">Expand</a></span>

Lara took my gaming cherry in her first outing on PS1 and as such will always be my first true love,and there are some nice nods to the original in this reboot (First &quot;kill&quot; is some wolves which will ring some bells for those who remember TR1). Two big pluses about this incarnation of Tomb Raider (seriously... don&apos;t even go there) are Lara and the Island itself. This is the story of a young womans right of  passage, and Lara&apos;s strengths, weaknesses
<br>and inexperience both physically and emotionally are explored in such a way that fleshes out a gaming Icon in a very human way,with the Island a perfect counter point, at times deadly and threatening and other time beautiful and nurturing. For these two things alone this is a Must Buy.
<br>I feel and share the pain of those unhappy with QTE,  and the lack of the joy of discovery and puzzle solving that made TR1 such a success. After the first 30 minutes you feel like screaming &quot;I WANNA PLAY TOO!!!&quot; as you are lead from one cut scene to another but bear with it.  As you gain more skill and gear upgrades the game gets better and better and you will be rewarded with your patience.
<br>If you are looking for a new-gen upgrade of the Old Tomb Raider I fear you are going to be disappointed, but for old times sake I urge you to embrace the New Tomb Raider.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3038213">Expand</a></span>

This new game has so many of those moments i&apos;ve really just luved it all the way. The game really captures the emotions of being alone in a very dangerous place. Lara is scared and desperate changing to determined and resolute. the change is a journey that the player really connects with during the game.
<br>
<br>The game is quite linear, but you can revisit old spots to complete achievements. This really lets you take the game at your own pace. Some of the set scenes you just need to repeat until you figure the strat out, but luckily the game saves you to the very start of that set scene (so you don&apos;t need to repeat the lead up to the event).
<br>
<br>so basically,
<br>i luved the story
<br>luved the connection with the character
<br>luved the intensity and pace of the game
<br>--&gt; get it!
<br>PS quite intense, graphic and violent  not for kids.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3152195">Expand</a></span>

To start, the story, setting art quality and everything is absolutely astounding. The Pros: The graphics, The graphics are amazing and the game is well coded as the game run perfectly smooth under the right settings with 60+ FPS constantly. The sound effects and voice acting are really well done. I also loved the 3rd person shooting exspereince. The cover system, wall hugging, (Which work way better then most dedicated shooter games with this mechanic) including all the other animations really add to the obvious hard work that was put into this game. I mean, everything visually and the audio were all well done and really add to the immersion. The story is fantastic and I found myself looking in every corner to find all the artifacts to learn more. I also loved the slight RPG element of ranking up Lara&apos;s powers and tweaking out her weapons was a nice touch! I haven&apos;t had this much fun in a mostly single player game since Metro 2033 in 2010! I also loved how this game rewards exploring the island rather then other games that kinda steer you to powering through the level without any consideration for games details. Also unlike most games made these days that are so heavily flawed with bugs and glitches, this game had near to none and was extremely stable! During my 20 hours of game(Which is a lot of content and is totaly worth the price) I only have one game crash. I could go on and on, but to wrap this up; the reason this game did not get a 10 is as follow. Cons: What I did not like that was throughout the entire game was the abundance of ammo and the games overall difficulty. In a survival game I expected ammo to be scarce, particularly for fire arms. But, what I found was i was constantly full on ammo 90% of the time in the game. I found myself trying to waste ammo rather then hording it simple because there was so much laying around and on enemies. Also was the games difficulty, I started and played the game on HARD. The combat is pretty easy, unless you do something really stupid as run out in the open; you really can&apos;t die. The puzzles are really simple and easy to figure out, Tombs I expected were to be hard and dangerous mini-dungeons, but in reality each of the tombs were hardly deadly at all save maybe a few falls with no enemies guarding the treasures. So over all the game was actually pretty easy, also weapons are extremely accurate even at long ranges such as with the Bow or the Handgun. My last thing was the game did emphasize on exploration and you can explore A LOT of key land marks in the game, almost every prop was explorable, but at the same time you do have invisible walls. I was hoping for a more open world environment to explore rather then almost every level being set in some type of canyon, small basin, narrow passage or every environment where you constantly have walls on both sides or a bottomless canyon. Besides those things, this game is flawless and a must buy must play. You will not be disappointed! This game surely is fun and totally worth the price!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3151259">Expand</a></span>

In most of the games cutscenes are this little rewards for progress in the game. Not here - it&apos;s like watching worst Hollywood action movie. I have no idea how they spend so much money/time to develop this game and there&apos;s clearly a lot of good in there and they can&apos;t hire 1 guy with decent writing skills. About midway point in the game I found myself just rushing through it just to get it over with - something I never do. Another thing (but minor in comparison) is stealth mechanics - very undeveloped and it&apos;s a shame because there was so much potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=6132487">Expand</a></span>

Crystal Dynamics seem to have learned that because Tomb Raider used to be a game that could be played by everyone, especially children. With the insane amount of blood, point blank execution finishers and explicit depictions of Lara&apos;s body parts being pierced and cut off by various environmental hazards this game is the first Tomb Raider that clearly deserves a &quot;Mature&quot; (18+) ESRB rating. Even with the acknowledgment that the game&apos;s sole purpose is to explain Lara&apos;s transformation from an innocent, young and inexperienced girl to someone who could actually pull a trigger on another human being there is no justification for turning her into a blood-thirsty killing machine. So, what should we expect in the game&apos;s sequel? Tactical nuclear strikes and kill streaks?
<br>
<br>That being said Tomb Raider is a rather enjoyable game. The environments are simply amazing especially on higher graphics settings which have a tendency of making the player stop for a moment and simply enjoy the view. Its clearly visible that game designers spent a lot of time polishing small details which add up to the immersion factor. The audio component is sadly a mixed bag. While some of the voice actors did a really god job the extremely forced accent of Lara Croft (played by Camilla Luddington) is simply annoying. Compared to Judith Gibbins and Keeley Hawes, which voice-acted Croft before, Luddington simply sounds forced and unnatural. The soundtrack also leaves much to desire because compared to, lets say, masterpieces from the &quot;Underworld&quot; OST like &quot;Thor&apos;s Room&quot; or themes played during Thailand levels the new Tomb Raider soundtrack sounds simply bland and uninspiring clearly trying only to promote the new main theme. Controls feel okay but there are times when they are clearly too vivid and unpredictable resulting in a lot of unintentional deaths. Combined with the fact that Lara now does a lot of things by herself like crouching (there is no dedicated control for crouch) and reducing her speed when traversing stuff like narrow passages and tombs (there is no dedicated control for sprint)... Well it can be pretty annoying to say the least.
<br>
<br>Now we come to the most problematic stuff about the game  cinematics and QTE (quick time events). This game is choke full of both! There can hardly pass more than a minute or two in the game without being forced to watch a cinematic or bash the controls like crazy to finish a QTE. At one time I even managed to count FOUR successive cinematics which followed each other! QTEs are a tale for themselves. It really boggles my mind how could anyone ever come to the conclusion that they would be a good way of immersing players into the gameplay. Having a ton of split-second QTEs is probably not a problem on consoles where every button has a specific color so its easier to follow them but when you get less than a second to read stuff like &quot;Press RMOUSE  LMOUSE repeatedly&quot; on a PC then that&apos;s a real problem.
<br>
<br>There is also something to be said about the very anti-climatic ending but venturing onto that ground would probably mean divulging a lot of spoilers so I&apos;ll just leave it be. Tomb Raider is a very good game which could have been a lot better if some of the mainstream gaming elements were left out. I just hope that for the inevitable sequel developers decide to tone down those elements and simply get more in touch with the spirit of the previous games by expanding on adventure and exploring. From me personally Tomb Raider gets an 8/10 with a note of letting a lot of things simply slide.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3835864">Expand</a></span>

If you are a fan of the series then it is worth a buy.  If you&apos;re a fan of the Uncharted games then this is worth a buy as well.  Oh and it is a satisfying length as well.  Many games now are just too short.  With this one running roughly 13  14 hours I can say I got my money&apos;s worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3034169">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Far me though, the real star of the game was indeed Lara. She does suffer from a bit of the narrative disconnect between her not wanting to kill and her killing LOTS of bad guys, but more importantly she was quite possibly the most relatable action protagonist I&apos;ve played. She successfully walks the fine line between fear and courage, meaning that she puts plenty of emotion into her actions without coming off as being whiny or a crybaby. And towards the end, you do get a great sense of her becoming a real badass.
<br>
<br>There are a few flaws as always though. I would have preferred there to be more challenging puzzles. And the supporting cast, well certainly not annoying at all, is not fairly interesting.
<br>
<br>With all this in mind, Lara Craft is back. And she&apos;s more alive than ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3151618">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are four distinct types of thing that go on in the game:
<br>
<br>-puzzles
<br>-fighting
<br>-frantic action scenes
<br>-cut scenes The puzzles are fun but a bit simplistic. You won&apos;t be stuck for particularly long with these things  none of them require more than a couple of steps and most are pretty straightforward to figure out.
<br>
<br>The fighting isn&apos;t great  enemies are as lethal as a hippie feather duster and have heads the size of flying saucers, but the combat sequences are short enough that it doesn&apos;t get in the way of main gameplay.
<br>
<br>The action scenes are great  buildings collapsing all around you whilst dodging flying dbris pretty regularly, but again not so much as to get samey.
<br>
<br>The cut scenes tell a good story, although I did get a bit fed up with occasionally having to randomly press a button at a specific point for little apparent reason.
<br>
<br>Not perfect then, but an enjoyable little romp. Well worth 20 quid anyway; I had fun with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3032972">Expand</a></span>

Interesting story, fine combat mechanics, exciting adventures! The game has much to do even after the main story. Revisiting areas with new gears and find collectibles. Watching how Lara change and grow throughout the game is also very intriguing. Buy it.</span>

<br>And here&apos;s some unpolished thoughts:
<br>
<br>Puzzle-wise it&apos;s lacking in scale and coherence--understandably because it&apos;s now in semi-open world format, which means open world travel &gt; tomb/confined spaces &gt; open world travel. And this actually hurts the immersion you get from tackling long series of great looking puzzles in a grand tomb/ place alone which defined TR. Interestingly, Assassin&apos;s Creed&apos;s large tombs had given that same kind of immersion to me.
<br>
<br>Social aspect is strong, but i just don&apos;t know was it helping or hurting the game because solemn exploration and comrade-helping is somewhat contradictory in nature, and either needs a lot of time and content to be memorable. There were too many different characters, and the focus on each of them was scattered and short-lived (except Sam), not allowing any deep memorable connection to develop.
<br>
<br>The extras (hidden stuff, journals, artifacts) again were overambitious in that they were all trying to cue the player towards various of lore/ side story that would be interesting, but were not quite resolved.
<br>
<br>Enemy placement was unbelievable at times, like spawning from a cave entrance behind which you&apos;ll discover afterwards that it&apos;s a slide &gt; jump &gt; cling wall place
<br>
<br>It&apos;s still a good game in that It has good graphics, focused back story, detailed character movements, fluid combat system, and a solid chunk of non-repeated scripted interactive scenes. But again everyone knows that focusing the game&apos;s development resources on these things takes it away from other things (in this case, actual playable puzzles and interactive time between characters).
<br>
<br>To be fair, given the scope/ experimental stuff they did to the game, this TR could only be seen as a prequel (if there will be any sequel since SE thought they didn&apos;t sell enough)
<br>
<br>From a player&apos;s perspective the game is totally worth it, but critically, it&apos;s an experimental TR that misplaced too much of its resources in things that did not define the franchise. The end product is another modern AAA title that doesn&apos;t stand out an awful lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=4073640">Expand</a></span>

<br>(2) The platforming is a lot of fun.  It&apos;s not perfect, and generally a bit too easy, but still enjoyable.
<br>(3) The combat is very good.  I&apos;m not a great fan of third-person shooters, but this is a very polished example and genuinely fun,
<br>(4) Plenty of collectibles/side tasks to keep you busy while you&apos;re making your way through the story.
<br>(5) Terrific visuals; looks really nice on max settings.
<br>(6) Stable!  I played the patched version through twice to full completion and I never had a single problem.  Even TressFX worked fine on my nVidia card.
<br>
<br>After first beating it with 100% completion, I found myself immediately replaying it, which says how good it is.  In a nutshell, there is very little wrong with it.  Sure, a few of the QTEs are annoying, but there really aren&apos;t many of them (less than a dozen in the entire game) and they break up the routine a bit.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a surprisingly polished and enjoyable effort.  Good job!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3519016">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s basically a reboot and even being a fan of the series, thought this was much, much better than it&apos;s predecessors.

<br>
<br>The trailers and early gameplay is shameful. It appears as though this is a linear game and very heavy on QTE&apos;s.
<br>
<br>While this is true for the first part of the game (~1 hour) this is done to great effect and since this is a reboot, allows for the development of the character. You truly see Lara shine  even her voice actor&apos;s better than the last.
<br>
<br>Now I don&apos;t generally like reboots but I can see taking the franchise in a different direction was actually the best idea anyone could roll with. This is a more dark (not &quot;dark knight&quot; dark but more serious in tone and for the first time  A TOMB RAIDER GAME WITH BLOOD AND BRUTAL DEATH SCENES).
<br>
<br>It&apos;s more of an RPG and campfires help to serve as Hubs  which you can explore and look for caves or &quot;tombs&quot;, upgrade your character with a similar system of killing animals for XP (like Far Cry 3) and travel to other parts of the world. The game&apos;s huge and the campaign is ~20 hours, and then you can free roam. The only DLC I&apos;d recommend is getting a few of the SINGLEPLAYER skins, MP map pack(s) and the tomb dlc. The others can be either earned in the game (skills) or are not that great.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s music is surprisingly good and easily beats the last. There&apos;s a lot of drama and it&apos;s quite gripping. The graphics are sensational and it&apos;s ported by Nixxes (the same guys that did Hitman: Absolution and made the Deus Ex: Human Revolution ports). Extensive graphics options, lots of tweaking and PC friendly controls. Although there are button prompts, this game immerses you so well  there&apos;s nothing to really flaw.
<br>
<br>Well  actually, there is. The voice actors  while Lara and her enemies are great, the rest of her crew isn&apos;t quite &quot;there&quot; yet. They don&apos;t sound mediocre but they don&apos;t sound great either. They&apos;ve got some accents and for the most part  they&apos;re fine. You still care about them but all the same  when you hear Lara&apos;s voice  you&apos;re like... why can&apos;t the others have voices on the same level?
<br>
<br>There&apos;s tons of bonuses and I really liked upgrading my character. Lots of these upgrades were useful and tricks you learned. You really feel like you&apos;re playing with an inexperienced Lara. They&apos;ve changed the story  but again, better. She&apos;s still English but the Croft Manor and such isn&apos;t here. Nor are there vehicles to drive  lol. This doesn&apos;t matter  this game is easily the pinnacle and the top of the Tomb Raider franchise. Fans and non-fans will get appealed, and no fan can deny how great this game is. They don&apos;t sexualise her either and the game tends to be mature (most of the time). Still  most players will look at her butt most of the time as she&apos;s crawling or climbing. Speaking of which  all the movements are motion capped (like the last game  Underworld) and again  helps with the immersion.
<br>
<br>In some respects  it&apos;s similar to Uncharted but it&apos;s still distinctly a Tomb Raider game. In some ways, it&apos;s better than Uncharted and if you never got to play Uncharted or wanted to (due to not having a PS3 or access)  this game will do the job. It&apos;s slick, accessible and incredibly fun to play  all while holding the Tomb Raider name high and making great efforts to be a cinematic adventure.
<br>
<br>The cinematics aren&apos;t too long or boring  and they&apos;re frequent at the beginning, they help to explain a lot as well as build up the rest of the game. Combat&apos;s revamped too and while it can be repetitive at the beginning if you don&apos;t do main missions and stick to side-quests... the new tricks and vast amount of unlocks, serve to make combat that comes later  less harder than it appears to be and far more fun to dish out finishers and sneak around. There&apos;s different play styles too and you&apos;re rewarded as such. It felt like Batman: Arkham Asylum at times, which is not a bad thing and they integrated cover really well. The focus is on exploring but combat doesn&apos;t feel as cheapily tacked on as past games and it&apos;s far better for this 3rd person... type of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3417513">Expand</a></span>

Tomb Raider is one of those titles. It is an artistic achievement. The graphics, level design and sound effects make the overall experience better than the average movie. The gameplay is so fluid you feel like you are Laura, there is no awkwardness found in other titles such as assassin&apos;s creed. The character constantly does exactly what you want it to. Everything is realistic  except of course the rambo style survivability which is to be expected in any entertaining title. It seems nobody has ever complained about your character being overpowered to survive onslaughts in any title for the past 100 years yet now that the main character is a girl it&apos;s an issue. I couldn&apos;t stop from beginning to end, and it was better made than Uncharted, and simply superior in many ways, namely controls, story, and environmental effects. There are however some good issues raised by some of the more critical reviews, for example the fact that the game is now more linear than a classic tomb raider game. To this I respond, there are two ways to make a great game, do something different or do like the rest but make it better. The second approach was taken. And still, being a classic tomb raider fan, it&apos;s in my book without a doubt the best tomb raider game yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3155336">Expand</a></span>

The plot reminds of Far Cry 3 (I am aware that they were developed simultaneously) a story of setting the character, &quot;a survivor is born&quot;, and of Uncharted (yeah, one can&apos;t avoid comparing TR to this action-adventure golden standard) adventuring in mythic lands with supernatural stuff closer to the end. A point where Tomb Raider loses to the mentioned Uncharted series are the secondary characters they aren&apos;t near as likeable as in the latter, and mostly worse written the only character you actually get to like is the one that&apos;s given sufficient screen time Conrad Roth. I actually felt sorry for the old warrior. The game&apos;s overall tone is gritty and dark, and that&apos;s what makes the plot quite inconsistent with the gameplay Lara whines and moans a lot (damn frequently the game actually sounds like a porno), cries over her dead comrades and after making her first kill in the cutscenes, but then the gameplay leads you to brutally murder dozens of random people. The gameplay itself is fun, killing (especially with the bow) feel satisfying, puzzles are short but well-made and actually require you to think and action setpieces are gripping. The campaign is structured as Batman: Arkham Asylum, so it isn&apos;t exactly open-world, but you may revisit the deserted locations to finish collecting stuff only you won&apos;t really want to do it after the main storyline. As for multiplayer, it&apos;s quite bland, a poor version of Uncharted&apos;s. To sum up, Tomb Raider is not exactly a gem, it doesn&apos;t bring anything new to the genre, but nevertheless it&apos;s a potent game and a great set-up for the future games (And boy, will there be sequels)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3045736">Expand</a></span>

<br>I played the first tomb raider game and I enjoyed it a lot as a kid.  The puzzles were challenging at the time and the gameplay was fun.  Hearing and seeing the T-Rex for the first time was just an awesome feeling.
<br>
<br>Going into Tomb Raider 2013 my expectations were kind of high.  I&apos;ve played a lot of games since the first Tomb Raider including sequels that were somewhat underwhelming.  I think the team brought Lara Croft into the new age of gaming very nicely.  The story was done very well and while it was somewhat predictable, they played the mystical stuff out well like the world wasn&apos;t naturally filled with ancient Japanese goddesses.  Also, getting to know young Lara and watching her grow into someone more familiar was great.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve played any of the Uncharted series then the gameplay might seem pretty derivative but in a good way.  It was a pretty familiar formula of some light platforming, shooting, and puzzles thrown in here and there.  All were done well enough and have a good amount of polish, however I would have liked to see more tombs and varying levels of difficulty in the puzzles.  I know mass market games of today play to the slightly more casual gamer, but in the age of the internet, people that had issues with puzzles could have just looked them up.  Also, since the tombs were separate from the story anyways, some really long and challenging tombs would have been awesome.  I would have really liked a side story that maybe tied all of the tombs together or just had a tomb that took longer than 5 minutes to get through.  Also, quicktime events are starting to get old, especially when they&apos;re overused and I think this game was slightly guilty of quicktime overuse.  It didnt ruin the game experience by any means but sometimes these events just take you out of the game more than anything.
<br>
<br>The game pacing was done really well too.  I felt that you unlocked things at a good rate and the story kept moving along well.  At one point I thought the game was nearly over only to find out that I was just passed the half way point.  At about 9-10 hours the game was still a bit short but if they had tried to make the story longer, I think I would have become uninterested in it.  This is where I think the opportunity to make longer and bigger tombs with higher difficulties could have added to the gameplay while not forwarding the story or trying to overextend it.  Also, I should point out that I only completed 71% of the game when I beat the story so you could probably get a few more hours at least if you are really looking for everything.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is worth mentioning I guess.  It does seem like tacked on and I found it somewhat absurd that there are so many DLC purchases for maps and skins in multiplayer considering how shallow it felt.  It wasnt horrible and I did enjoy the time I spent with it, but from what I played, I didnt see anything so new or exciting.  If you really enjoyed the game I&apos;m sure you could spend a few hours in multiplayer as well.
<br>
<br>Overall I had a lot of fun going back to the franchise after so long and I have to say, Lara is hotter than ever.  I&apos;m really excited at the prospects for a sequel to this game but my expectations are going to be much higher.  If they released a sequel with another good story, updated and improved upon innovative gameplay, added even hours worth of tombs to raid with more rewarding treasures, and even if they got fresh with multiplayer by adding some coop tombs to raid filled with baddies to fight together as well as puzzles that required teamwork and rewarded you nice treasures, that game would be an easy 10/10.
<br>
<br>This game deserves a 8.7 for just the enjoyment level.  Its not the deepest gameplay but the story grips you from the start and develops very nicely.  Its not without fault and I really expected more tombs with difficult puzzles but in the end I had fun and thats what counts for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3306230">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m disappointed only with the puzzles mostly are too easy!! The voices are very well played, sound and music very good!</span>

Like reading a good book for the first time, I wanted to keep going to find out where it all ends.  The Tomb Raider series has always dabbled in the supernatural and this one is no different.  Instead of some South or Central American ruin, this franchise prequel take us to the Asian version of the Bermuda Triangle (the Dragon&apos;s Triangle in the game) south of Japan.  The scenery is beautiful and the environment is a bit reminiscent of the Lingshan Islands from Crysis.  The controls functioned well, although there were times where they inevitably ran into a problem or two.  Most of the functionality of the game (i.e. scenery, controls, story) was solid, making Tomb Raider a huge hit from Crystal Dynamics.  This was a great telling of how young Lara Croft goes from young archaeologist fresh out of college to a hardened survivor.  However, I do have some complaints about some of the game&apos;s features that are pretty much never needed in an action game: quick-time events and button mashers.  The quick-time events, while some are to be expected, are kind of unnecessary.  It&apos;s understandable that they&apos;re meant to simulate reflexes, but they&apos;re always done exactly the same way.  Just when you&apos;re ready to sit back and watch a cutscene, a quick-time event appears.  And usually paired with these QTEs comes the frustrating button-mash events.  I have yet to see a need for button mashing in an action game.  The reason why I think button-mashers are the worst feature for any action game is because they feel out of place, not to mention the irritation at mashing your best just to fail.  A prime example of this is towards the beginning when Lara is wrestling with a large wolf.  The first thing you have to do is to mash the left and right buttons to push it off.  I&apos;ve died at least *eight times* mashing like crazy only to have the wolf chomp on Lara&apos;s throat and kill her.  Then after a couple QTE prompts, you have to mash the E key to repeatedly stab the wolf with an arrow; if you don&apos;t, the wolf bites Lara&apos;s neck and she dies (same death scene if you fail the first button-mashing event).  The times when I had to mash buttons during a life-or-death scene really pissed me off the most during the course of the game.  Another thing that doesn&apos;t make sense is the end boss.  More often than not, it&apos;s some guy that somehow never gets shot until the final battle, and even then he takes hits like he&apos;s no stranger to getting shot and stabbed in vital areas of the body, and even then it takes *forever* for him to die.  I can understand him taking about five or six bullets and not dying right away, but tanking at least twelve while he&apos;s casually loading shotgun is just ridiculous and unrealistic.  Aside from all of these problems, as well as some other minor glitches, the game was a good experience and one that I&apos;d certainly recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3025317">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay itself lost most common things of TR from before, no big (interesting) puzzles here, or complicated acrobatics. You get more freedom, upgradable items and abilities instead. Storyline is quite simple, you can feel like prophet after gaining some game progress. However that&apos;s an colorful story that will be remembered after game is complete.

                                        <span>Tomb Raider has always been a rather unbelievable series. I thought it was going to change with this one, but apparently Lara is invincible and no amount of falling can kill her. Apart from that this is a brilliant game that made me wince multiple times at just how surprisingly brutal it is. Very good game, but also very short.</span>

I&apos;ve never done this before but I felt like this game deserved it. First of all, I was never really into the older Tomb Raider games and my review is focused only on the game how i experienced it. I&apos;m not going to name everything that this game offers but I&apos;ll write down my general Impressions and things that I think are worth mentioning. The Gameplay, which is in my opinion one of the most important parts of a game, is outstandingly good. The combat, the exploration, the search for items and collectables and the skill based passages are top notch. The combat is very intense and responding, the collecting of items and exploration is rewarding and the platforming aswell as the few puzzles loosen the overall progression through the game. All these different contents are not only very well executed but also extremly well paced. Coming to the presentation which is one of the games most notable features. The balance between smooth and relaxing parts such as exploring/collecting and tense parts such as the combat and various environmental destruction, weather and quick time events was overall very well done what makes the game feel very diversified. The plot is well presented and the voice acting (at least in the german version) is pretty good aswell. The plot itself might be a little bit predictable sometimes but the player will forget these flaws very fast because of the astonishing presentation which is never overdone. The different parts of the island are pretty much open but small and limited. In order to visit parts of the island you&apos;ve already discovered, you can have a rest at various bonfires which will let you teleport to other bonfires. The progression through the game is generally very linear but you are able to go to places you visited before any time you want and for example collect things you&apos;ve missed. The character development is a major part and is very immersive. Through the course of the game, the main character Lara goes through different changes and the player really feels with the her (at least I did). The other characters stay a little bit shallow and are not nearly as interesting as the protagonist itself. They&apos;re more like a help to get Lara&apos;s development throughout the happenings of the game apparent and interesting to experience. The atmosphere is very dense and let&apos;s the player forget his or her surroundings. While I&apos;m playing this game I really get lost in it and can nearly scent the different smells of the environment. The new Tomb Raider is one of the most immersive games I&apos;ve ever played and the excellent audio really adds to this. The creak of the old wood in the wind, the ripple of the rain, the crackling of the fire. The soundscape aswell as the beautiful soundtrack is extremely well done and surrounds the player with a living and breathing environment. The visuals really add to this. The technical part, so the engine is pretty nice to look at and the game is very well optimized. What really amazed me is the beautiful art direction. The color palette and the ex- and interiors are wonderfully crafted and especially the exteriors are packed with tons and tons of details that feel very natural and hand made. There are some flaws here and there like the confusing and not easy to use, the quick time events sometimes feel a little bit wasted and the characters, besides Lara Croft, are not very interesting. All these little flaws are not really notable while looking at the game as a whole but they&apos;re worth mentioning. All in all this is one of the best games I played in a very long time and the best action adventure I&apos;ve ever experienced.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3051308">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3121741"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I personally gave this game an 8.6 out of 10 (rounds up to 9) because it was extremely well done and reboots the series in an incredibly entertaining and refreshing way. The Lara Croft we are given in this game is not the same raider of tombs from the mid 90s that we knew and loved she is an inexperienced and younger version who has never ventured into a tomb and this is her first journey. By the end she becomes the Lara Croft that we know and love from the 90s but in an updated and pretty epic way. The very last moment of combat even pays homage to the dual pistol wielding protagonist we remember from our first adventure so long ago. I wish there were bears, I wish there were bats, I love that there are wolves but I definitely wish there were more throwback moments than there are, if only to satisfy the fans of the original series who took the time to play this version.
<br>
<br>The music is fitting for the time you hear it but isn&apos;t very memorable afterwards. The voice acting, especially for Lara is extremely well done, which is something I am very glad to finally be saying about more and more games these days. The combat is very well done when it allows you to do your thing but when quick time events are necessary to defeat particular enemies it gets a bit annoying and some of those events are slightly bugged so it sometimes takes a few tries which only adds to the annoyance factor. Sadly the game is very easy (even on hard difficulty), puzzles are not complex or in depth, you can easily get all upgrades, the game pretty much holds your hand the entire way but that ultimately detracts very little from a game that does a beautiful job of rebooting a series that many including myself feared might be dead after being run into the ground by so many terrible sequels.
<br>
<br>The characters other than Lara are unfortunately not very well developed throughout the game, with the exception of your main enemy. Through the journals you pick up over the course of the game you learn bits of information that you would not otherwise know even from Lara&apos;s friends/companions. However the only journals that shed any light on much of anything are those from your enemy, and there are a few others that have nothing to do with your group that add to the overall story of the game in a very interesting way. The reason I did not lower my score much for this is because her friends really do not matter in the long run. They are amusing at times but the majority of the narrative takes place without them and Lara is really the only character we are meant to care about.
<br>
<br>The island is beautifully crafted and I have not seen any version that does the game justice that is not on a PC with the graphics completely juiced. There are moments that I caught myself just running around and looking at the environments and smiling because they looked absolutely gorgeous on my PC. Even the particularly gruesome deaths that you cause look rather traumatizing at some points and they should as shooting people in the face with an arrow is not a pretty thing.
<br>
<br>One of the defining moments in the game is Lara&apos;s first kill and this is cut a bit short mostly because the game does not have several hours to let you recover from this but it still feels important and it should as the character will never be the same again. After this she slowly turns into the female version of Nathan Drake, which is kind of funny because Nathan Drake was highly influenced by the original Lara Croft but that link has no negative impact on the game as Uncharted is a great series itself and not taking that into account would have been a mistake that I am glad was not made. By the end her transition is very satisfying and very enjoyable to experience. While there are likely no life altering moments about this game that make anybody want to run out and become a game developer it is an extremely well crafted game that any fan of the original series should play as it reboots the entire thing in such a refreshing way that there will almost definitely be sequels to look forward to in the near future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider/user-reviews?user_review_id=3121741">Expand</a></span>

Looking through my list of 100+ games on Steam so far, I can&apos;t recall a game where I invested more effort in a short time to play it through and find every bit of a puzzle.
<br>To sum it up  well where shall I begin? The Story? The Gameplay? The Riddles? The Action-Sequences? Maybe the In-Game Cutscenes???? They are just all phenomenal!!!
