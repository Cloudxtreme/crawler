You go around gathering resources to craft items, build, feed yourself, and make sure you don&apos;t go insane. The insanity meter is interesting because if forces you to do different things otherwise crazy things happen. Death is permanent, so if you die you have to start a new game. For a game that&apos;s supposed to be a time-waster and meant to be played multiple times, it progresses very slowly, and I find that a big issue. I can put in a few hours, finally feel like I&apos;m getting somewhere, and then just like that I can die from monsters or something, and that makes the game feel tedious. If the game started off with some items, like a pick ax, and progressed faster, it would be much better. I would much prefer playing something like FTL which makes me feel like I&apos;m getting a lot more done after playing a short period of time, and I don&apos;t mind starting a new game with FTL. This game suffers from that long grind that I&apos;m not a big fan of. It&apos;s still worth checking out, but keep in mind of it&apos;s pacing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3151215">Expand</a></span>

Playing the game non-stop is not recommended; it may get too boring too fast, let this game be a break from other ones, and enjoy the experience as long as it lasts.</span>

It&apos;s fun the first couple of playthroughs when you don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on and you&apos;re just exploring, but once you become a bit more familiar with it every playthrough is a 6 hour long grind to craft all the things you need, which can (and will) end abruptly by something just popping up and 2-shotting you. The grind turns from &quot;tedious&quot; to &quot;completely unbearable&quot; when you are trying to keep several pigs around so you can actually attempt to kill something. Let me put it this way, if you think this is &quot;OMG SO HAERDCORE AND CHALLANGING&quot;, you are retarded, plain and simple. If you want a challenging game, go play the old Xcom games, this is not challenging, just repetitive and cheap, both in concept and execution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3155444">Expand</a></span>

<br>A simple, random generated arcade-ish clicking game in a line of: run around  try to stay alive  die randomly  restart from scratch  go again. Without any story, sense or even tutorial.
<br>You run around very basic, random generated islands, grinding various resources by clicking on objects like trees and rocks. Then you can create various tools out of resource so you can grind more. Rinse, repeat.
<br>With lack of any idea about what you should do and what to avoid, with no Save functionality, the game start to get very frustrating very soon, while also quite boring from repetition.
<br>People used to create this kind of simple games in Flash for free and there are still plenty of them available on the web if you so desire.
<br>The only new thing with this one is that somebody is not ashamed to charge $15 for it, and the only special thing about it is the hype that seem to surround it. Plus a self-proclaimed deep design philosophy explained by author(s?). I only found user un-friendlines though.
<br>The game is really not worth the price, no matter what the hype tells you.
<br>You can check 15minutes  demo for free on Google Chrome web store and greatly advice it before buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3213541">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The few hours of this game is fantastic.  The art style is beautiful and unique.  A dark, bleak Tim Burton-esque cartoony look.  The music is quirky and gets you in the mood.  You are placed in the middle of a survival scenario with a short cinematic and no guidance with interesting looking objects to interact with.  You are given absolutely no information on the mechanics of the game.  There are three meters, health, hunger and sanity, but these are not explained.  You are given a menu on the left of objects you can craft and the materials required, which are not many to start with.
<br>
<br>The game is a survival simulator with heavy emphasis on exploration and crafting.  Dying is permanent which is made very obvious at the beginning of the game.  You will probably die immediately the first night not being told that not having a campfire leads to instant death.  Most people will probably die of starvation at some point, they will die when they have their first monster battle without armor, and they will die at the completely arbitrary hound attack that occurs several hours into a playthrough.  You lose everything when you die.  The early game consists of picking twigs, berries, grass, and collecting wood.  You can also dig up grass and saplings to start to cobble a base together.  This is time consuming (partially because the animation of picking something which you have to do OVER AND OVER again is somewhat lengthy) and has to be repeated every time you die.  You begin to fear death, to the point where you don&apos;t want to interact with anything that isn&apos;t obviously safe.  Now the developer&apos;s recommend is to not read the online wiki to preserve mystery.  But if death is SO harsh that I don&apos;t even want to experiment, is that fun?
<br>
<br>Anyways I finally cave and look up the wiki.  There is A LOT to the mechanics of this game.  You will not be able to figure it out on your own because it is not really intuitive.  I had to read the wiki for hours to get a handle on it.  The in game descriptions of objects you can craft are laughably vague.
<br>
<br>Combat is not fun, it is mainly just clicking an enemy over and over, but you are so easily overwhelmed by more than one enemy or a moderately strong enemy that the main strategy is using hit and run tactics, which isn&apos;t very gratifying.  You can&apos;t wear armor and a backpack at the same time, so you have to switch rapidly into armor whenever you have an encounter.  The one ranged weapon in the game I managed to build was the boomerang, which has limited uses and DAMAGES you on the way back if you don&apos;t &quot;catch&quot; it, which involves hitting the space key which may or may not work.  This is not explained anywhere in the game, you have to look that up online.
<br>
<br>The game is very tedious.   There wasn&apos;t time to explore, nor any great desire to as none of the advanced crafting objects seem like they would make alleviate any of the busy work.  You can build a better backpack, but that would slow you down.  You could make better armor, but that would slow you down.
<br>
<br>Finally I discovered that there is an active modding community.  GREAT!  It seems to address a lot of these issues.  You can add separate slots for backpacks and amulets.  Increase the stack size.  Tweak the rate food spoils and how hungry you get.  Increase the speed of harvesting grass and saplings.  Resurrect at your campsite upon death.  Increase the container size.  Prevent tools and armor from degrading.  This removes A LOT of the tedium from the game, and leaves you free to explore.  What you discover however once the busy work is removed is there isn&apos;t much else to do.  Building the advanced objects are not particularly useful or fun.  The combat still is not too much fun.  There just isn&apos;t any real goal.
<br>
<br>There is an adventure mode that you have to discover in the game that involves finding various objects in special challenging levels that I think complement the game better, but it doesn&apos;t solve a lot of the fundamental issues.
<br>
<br>I want this game to be awesome, but it just feels unbalanced and directionless.  I find the lack of in game information detracts from the experience.  The perma-death and difficulty by obfuscation is enraging and discourages exploration and experimentation.  The game has conflicting goals, basically requiring you to set up a base but urging you to explore and be mobile.  The crafting and base construction is not rewarding because there is little room for creativity, as most bases will probably look the same between users.
<br>
<br>Perhaps with further updates and more mods this game will become more balanced, fun, and rewarding.  But it&apos;s hard to recommend at the moment.  It&apos;s for sure fun and addicting for a few hours.  Ultimately it is a frustrating and incomplete experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3383246">Expand</a></span>

Hand drawn graphics and art are appreciative and unique. The survival style goal means the main goal of the game. And the music are exceptionally nice. However the extremely repetitive gameplay may meet some people to a boring, expensive game. Your first run may occupy you for hours with excellent survival thoughts and worrying time decisions. But somehow Don&apos;t Starve just doesn&apos;t do the deal. It may be another inspiration from Minecraft. But it just doesn&apos;t give the same freedom or feel, nor does its title. Don&apos;t Starve incorporates unique art and music but lacks gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3282955">Expand</a></span>

However, when the awe of the blast and colors dissipates you see what you are truly left with.  Unfortunately, the fun of the games survival mechanic quickly turns into a horrible grind more frustrating and boring than even the most aggravating MMORPG.
<br>But this is not to take away from some of the games better points.  Though the beginning of the game can eventually become a boring grind, especially if you die a lot, if you&#x2019;re able to continue past the first winter you are golden and able to explore as much as you want.  The biomes are beautifully done in the games unique art style, and almost seems to call for you to find out what is hiding around every corner.
<br>I loved the survival mechanic of eating, and that they added a very rarely seen mental aspect to the game that added a number of levels to the difficulty and the fun.  I also liked the crafting system in the game and that for most of the tech all you needed was a science machine and the proper ingredients.  And with the supplies you have gathered always at risk of going bad you find yourself constantly trying to improve the longevity of your provisions.
<br>The monsters, in the beginning, can be somewhat bland and boring, with spiders, the occasional wolf, and the beefalo wandering around, but with some searching and a little bit of luck you can stumble across some of the more interesting creatures in the game.  I found that some of my favorites were the clockwork creatures, but only because I needed their guts in order to make my refrigerator.
<br>The combat is fairly simple in Don&#x2019;t Starve, just click and kill.  You do need to watch you distance from the larger enemies, because they don&#x2019;t become stunned when attacking and they hit for massive damage, but for the most part they are all killable with a range of effort.  There are a few ranged weapons, but they really don&#x2019;t warrant much mentioning
<br>But is the game as a whole a good game?
<br>Yes it is.  It&#x2019;s the type of game that you can play when everything else had bored you and you want a challenge.  It&#x2019;s a welcome breath of fresh air and a look away from the perpetual easy mode that has plagued most games in recent years, and though the game can become quite the grind at certain points you cannot resist its unique charm and allure.
<br>This game gets a 6.  It&#x2019;s a Decent game and fun to play when you&#x2019;re bored, but not something that you should really be killing to get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3140076">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well, there are many big name games that you can finish in one day, so one week of fun is pretty ok. I would recommend this game to everybody. Even players who don&apos;t like Minecraft or Terraria. This game is  less special, more suited for any gamer. But at the end, it&apos;s a game that won&apos;t last like those other 2</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123285">Expand</a></span>

At the end it is about Wilderness Survival, which is a very interesting topic on its own, but Klei Entertainment added their own flavour which makes this game so great.

I have logged well over 200 hours into this game and some of my best times were in the beginning when i had no idea what was coming next.  The Developers are incredible.  They put out over 6 months of content for free after the game was released.  There will also be DLC in the future.  This game has permadeath.  If you cannot get over that fact, then this game is probably not for you.  You WILL die.  You WILL lose everything.  That being said, that is my favorite aspect of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3732703">Expand</a></span>

I would call it a unique, rouge like, top down, survival game. Every time you die, you come back more knowledgable of what can kill and hurt you. You collect things, craft things, and build things. I think the people who gave the game low ratings didn&apos;t explore the game enough. There are a bunch of different things you can do, such as befriending pig armies, digging up graves to find small things you can give to the pig king who will give you gold, hatching baby tallbirds, finding mandrakes, hunting the elephant-mouse thing, and surviving winter. I just named some things that take well over a few hours to do. Either the people who gave this game bad ratings didn&apos;t explore the game enough, or didn&apos;t play the game long enough. The winter takes a whole lot of (in-game) days to appear, giving you time to build up resources. The art-style makes the game even more magnificent, looking like a Tim Burton-ish design. This game deserves at least a 90, if not more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3746432">Expand</a></span>

Luckily the game is so absorbing I didn&apos;t notice.
<br>
<br>Seriously, this game is that good. The music and graphics work together seamlessly to draw you into the bleak and desolate world. It&apos;s like playing through someone&apos;s waking nightmare as they stumble from one terrifying incident to another, just when things begin to seem settled something is sure to rattle your bones and leave you scrambling.
<br>
<br>The gameplay may seem simple, but it&apos;s in that simplicity that it holds its charm. What might seem easy as first can quickly begin to seem like an enormous task as the burdens of living in the harsh land snowball onto your character and you can&apos;t keep up.
<br>
<br>The perma-death feature of the game can make death a traumatizing experience as the character you&apos;ve so lovingly built up and kept alive for so long has now found it&apos;s way to a lonely grave, at the same time it leaves your mind whirring as the cog&apos;s and gizmos in your head try to learn from your last play through so that you can survive longer in your next.
<br>
<br>The re-playability is huge, there&apos;s always something to learn or do better the next time through. On top of that if you decide you&apos;d prefer things a bit different from time to time there&apos;s always a huge selection of mods available for the game that offer a wide selection of features. Things as simple as adding in a new playable character based on the Heavy from Team Fortress 2 or changing the rules of how the game work can really spice up the gameplay.
<br>
<br>So, really give this game a go if you&apos;re into moody, strategic, action packed games that leave you twitching at every movement on the screen. It&apos;s my top pick of the year!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3877373">Expand</a></span>

You firstly have to gain a way to get food hence the name &quot;Don&apos;t Starve&quot; then after a few days monsters also known as hounds will ambush you constantly between 7  10 days. There are numerous mobs in the wild which are useful and some deadly. An example of this often occurs in Winter when a very large monster will attack you which you must prepare for. Not only does he hit hard, he drains your sanity  another thing you have to upkeep  then after you kill him hallucinations can attack. Winter is brutal as you can freeze to death and cannot stray too far from your camp, however, there are alternatives to this such as getting a winter hat or &apos;Heat Stone&apos;.
<br>
<br>The story is fairly linear and is more of a challenge but has a good twist but you need to find the area to progress with the story. It gives you insanely hard challenges such as unlimited night time, where you must bring a torch wherever you go making it hard to do certain things.
<br>
<br>Overall I think Don&apos;t Starve is a great game which I play casually. The only downfall of this game is that they don&apos;t add co-op/ multiplier which could further increase the games popularity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3152058">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s pretty hard and you need to spend some time reading Wiki to understand what actually happening  but it&apos;s absolutely worth it. Also, this game inherits one of the main principles of roguelikes: losing is really fun, so you will rather laugh at ridiculousness of your death than get frustrated.
<br>DS is highly customizable, so if you find it too hard you can always increase amount of food, resources etc.
<br>So, let&apos;s make a conclusion: this game has great gameplay, brilliant artstyle and atmosphere, offers real challenge, but is relaxing and welcoming to novice at the same time. Must have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3122379">Expand</a></span>

The best game I&apos;ve played in quite some time. If you go into the game expecting an easy casual game experience you will be shell-shocked. Don&apos;t starve is harsh and unforgiving and you can die quickly. Which is a great thing for a survival game, in my opinion.
<br>
<br>Your first character is a scientist named Wilson, but you can unlock other characters, each with a signature perk.  You are throw into a world knowing little and with nothing. You must forage, hunt, farm, fish, and trap your food.  As you explore you&apos;ll encounter a number of different enemies and you&apos;ll have periodic raids on you camp by hounds. The raiding hounds increase in strength as time goes on. Additionally, you&apos;ll encounter various boss type enemies.
<br>
<br>I said you start knowing little.  You can and must research various things to survive in this hostile world. You have to gather resources to research various items, which will require you to push your exploration far from your base. And there are some interesting things to research. Some more &quot;magic&quot; in nature (though &quot;magic&quot; plays mostly a minor role, don&apos;t expect to be a &quot;wizard&quot; in the game.
<br>
<br>Great graphic style, great game play, and great re-playability.  A 10 in my book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3135198">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is really great and loads of fun. It has a unique art style and developers who really care about the quality of the game, and who are actively involved in the fairly large community that has appeared since the game went into beta last year.
<br>
<br>The game also has mods that can be found on the forums, and a lot of the game files are in plain-text Lua scripts so if there&apos;s something in the game that turns you off you can probably change it. But don&apos;t do stuff like &quot;I can now craft a Nightmare Sword with a twig&quot; or &quot;rabbits no longer run from me&quot; or you&apos;ll get bored from the easiness.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is pretty addictive, and if you like Terraria or Minecraft you should feel right at home in this game. Not too say it&apos;s similar to those two games: it&apos;s worlds apart. And about worlds, you can customize your randomly-generated world in Don&apos;t Starve to make it easier (or harder). Can&apos;t find enough food in the early game? Add more berries and carrots. Hounds just too much for you? You can get rid of them. Being able to customize your world is, in my opinion, a really bright idea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3122381">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I only continued in hopes that it would eventually get better but it remained boring. I played about 14 hours of the game, it never got better. It got &#x2018;different,&#x2019; but still &#x2018;boring different&#x2019;. Even after collecting half a dozen pigs in my man-pig army. The game wasn&#x2019;t bad or poorly designed as a whole, it was simply boring. Grinding stuff the majority of the time is incredibly boring. I&#x2019;d seriously rather just watch my cat groom herself for an hour in the same spot, over and over and over again. Games like Terraria and Mine Craft are fun when grinding, you can literally shape the world around you while you grind for stuff and even use the world to interact with on some level in real-time to fight or block off enemies. All of these great aspects you can&apos;t do in this game. It takes far more investment to get to any of these aspects and the pacing doesn&#x2019;t allow for this in real-time because you&#x2019;d die while trying to build anything.
<br>
<br>I see the charm in their style and how this game paces itself with items and animations, I like that and it is interesting. But it doesn&#x2019;t make up for a boring game which just becomes frustratingly difficult when they punish you every time you die. This is not an effective way to hook players in for more, difficulty does not equal fun. Mechanics equal fun, fun and engaging game mechanics. Yes games 15 even 20 years ago games were very difficult and unforgiving but because of their crude graphics and controls they needed fundamentally strong game mechanics. That they were difficult was an aspect of arcade gaming crossing over into consoles. Terraria is a great example of this because the game has little if any story at all, it is paced purely off the players choices and actions.  The designers for Don&#x2019;t Starve would benefit greatly from reading some books on game theory or taking a few courses for learning about game mechanics etc. Don&#x2019;t bother wasting your time on this boring game, unless you&#x2019;re into clicking stuff pointlessly for hours with no story at all and collecting imaginary digital shrubs, grass, rocks, etc. Or unless they come out with a seriously significant update that changes a major aspect of this game as a whole.
<br>
<br>I can&#x2019;t even begin to really describe to you how boring this game is, and I&#x2019;ve play over a thousand hours on various grinding games. This takes the cake.
<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>Charming Consistent Visual Style
<br>Animations and Sounds
<br>Simple UI and Menus
<br>Intuitive Controls
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>Extremely Boring
<br>Horribly Unforgiving
<br>Too linear for its Genre for an Adventure is lacks story  for Simulation it lacks interactions.
<br>If if they mean simulation as in a farm simulator... then yeah, move along and get Farm Simulator 2013, at least that game knows what it is. I can easily imagine Farm Simulator 2013 being 1000x more fun than this game.
<br>The UI for building and researching stuff could be a lot better; any means of finding out about the game you&#x2019;d have to refer to a wiki site--and the developers don&apos;t want you to do that.
<br>And for an indie game as boring as this is, and charging more than 5 dollars with a serious face should be a crime, unless all the money is going to the sound and art guys then I support that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3344567">Expand</a></span>

First of all, the begging of the game essentially consists of you running around the wilderness to find a gold nugget for your Science Machine, which could take anywhere from 30 seconds to almost an hour of in-game time. After that you build a base, and gather materials, and you don&apos;t really have any goal to it all. From what I&apos;ve read in the update logs, there is some sort of actual story mode, but I have not been able to access it yet. I would normally give a game a free pass for still being in-development, but it clearly states that Don&apos;t Starve has had a full release but is still being updated. Speaking of apparently being a &quot;full release,&quot; I cannot access fullscreen mode until I go to the .ini files. Running a game in windowed mode is an immediate immersion breaker imo, which was rather disappointing, considering I didn&apos;t know I could fix this for the first couple of hours. In the end, I suppose Don&apos;t Starve is a decent enough survival game, but Terraria and Minecraft are both far better options at the moment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3175095">Expand</a></span>

The next step gets me excited, for every 10 or so days you will get attacked and there are dangers that lurk with every place you go to. Also with the new underground area with giant rabbits, trying to kill you for revenge from their lost brothers (the regular rabbits you killed) and the harder bosses like the spider queen and the forest guardian, but i just think this game is one of the best i have ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3174943">Expand</a></span>

You basically keep doing the same thing over and over and over and if you&apos;re lucky you get to find useful thing (to build tools that help you to do that same thing again) and if you&apos;re not you die (and then you have to start it all from the very beginning).

<br>
<br>I bought this game in Beta and played it ever since. Sorry for saying this but it is almost like where Minecraft began in playing the game and adding content while you play whilst still keeping you griped in the game. I highly recommend this game and you can pick this game up for around &#xA3;10 on steam.

The world you find yourself in is populated by a large cast of strange monsters and creatures, many of which you will either need to tame or kill to survive. Random worlds and an adventure mode add further to the replayability and monthly updates add significant amounts of new content to the game if you somehow manage to exhaust what the game comes with now. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Minecraft (But wished it was harder), Terraria (But wanted more survival elements) or Fallout New Vegas Hardcore Mode (But wanted more threat of actually starving).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3169867">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>That being said, the people that are calling it repetitive or grind like probably didn&apos;t play this game&apos;s adventure mode (which is very challenging and often nerve wrecking) and stayed in sandbox. Sandbox mode is only to really get you adequate with the game&apos;s mechanics and such but after you get use to that and things become less dire, adventure mode is where you go for a challenge.
<br>
<br>It is a good game and definitively worth the price tag. While it does have some cosmetic things in it  it&apos;s mainly about survival. i&apos;ve spent 120 hours on it so i&apos;ve definitively got my monies worth. also you can adjust the difficulty in sandbox mode to make it even more challenging for yourself~</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3135973">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t wait for the future updates. It doesn&apos;t seem to get old and is very original in term of gameplay and survival games. Really an amazing deal for its $15 price.</span>

You play as Wilson, a Gentleman Scientist who has been trapped by a demon and transported to a mysterious wilderness world. Wilson must learn to exploit his environment to its inhabitants if he ever hopes to escape and find his way back home. Enter a strange and unexplored world full of strange creatures, dangers, and surprises. Gather resources to craft items and structures that match your survival style. Play your way as you unravel the mysteries of this strange land.&#x201D;
<br>
<br>It was a normal day, I logged onto steam to do my daily dose of gaming as I noticed a window pop open that said &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Starve  Coming soon&#x201D;. As the name intrigued me I clicked it to take a look at what this could be, another game similar to Minecraft maybe? The trailer revealed to me that it had similar concepts to Minecraft as the main point was to survive but this looked a little more intense and more hard-core. This got my attention fast and I purchased it as soon as I could and got access to the Beta as the game was not fully released yet. Magnificent.
<br>
<br>When you spawn into the game you straight away get shown the very neat looks of a similar style to a lot of Tim Burton Films which fit this game perfectly as it has a very sinister atmosphere to the game especially at night. The main idea of the game is great and has a lot of potential and can keep you needing to play it for a few days but I do feel it lacks on the entertainment side of things. I say this because the amount that you play it will depend on the type of player that you are, if you rely on the game to give you constant action and fun it will not do that for you. This is because you will need to learn what kills you and then when you replay after you die it is just preventing the way you died before which in the end boils down to preparing for winter by stockpiling food over and over until you fail at something. Although I say this I am the type of player that loves this and plays most games for the whole stockpile element to them, which Don&#x2019;t Starve is perfect for giving this to me. Even if this doesn&apos;t interest you for the same reason as me it will still defiantly keep you occupied for days and be 100% worth the money as it is only &#xA3;11.99.
<br>
<br>Don&#x2019;t starves &#x2018;Dark side&#x2019; shows when you get to night for the first time and instantly die when you don&#x2019;t make a fire, which shows you straight away that it&#x2019;s going to need research or trial and error to survive in don&#x2019;t starve. As well as the threat of needing a fire as night falls you also need to take care of your sanity, keep well fed and also stay away from terrifying wolves and unusual eye creatures. When you first find out any of this stuff it is a thrill and keeps you intrigued to find out what happens if you defeat what killed you. &#x201C;What could get me next time?&#x201D; Don&#x2019;t starve reveals some of its sinister side when your sanity lowers and you start seeing creatures and figures that render you speechless the first time you see them, even creepy hands that lower the flame in your fire at night.
<br>
<br>Overall I would say that Don&#x2019;t starve is well worth the amount that you pay for if not more. It is the ultimate survival experience and brings loads of fun along with its unique art style and sinister game play. Don&#x2019;t Starve is undeniably a solid 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3126515">Expand</a></span>

You really learn through your first couple times, what it takes to survive and each subsequent time you learn from your mistakes, (not building any winter clothing that first winter, getting  and attacking a tier 3 spider nest). For people that are new to survival games, or hadn&apos;t played one in what seems like forever, this is a good place to start. The unique visuals to the game are another strong point, with all the different characters, tools, monsters and world. Each character has their strong suit (like Wilson, who can grow a beard which acts as protection in winter or Wolfgang who hits like a tank). Overall, it&apos;s a game worth exploring and getting better at. It gives me great motivation when I&apos;ve seen screenshots of people at day 500...and just getting through a week is pretty challenging.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3122676">Expand</a></span>

Almost every time I have died it was due to a combination of a couple of mistakes I have made, and each death is a learning experience.  It takes a bit of thought to manage your health, hunger, sanity, and in the winter, freezing meters (although the freezing meter is not shown).  As someone who bought into the beta I have put over 60 hours into this game already, and I feel it is a really good way to spend 12-15 dollars, especially if you enjoy rogue-like games, and are open to the idea that you will by dying and restarting from scratch fairly often.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3128541">Expand</a></span>

I bought this game at half price on a whim back when the beta started and have very much enjoyed the experience. As others have said, even though the game inevitably becomes a bit dull (as all games do), the &quot;hours of entertainment per dollar&quot; value can&apos;t be beat and the great artwork is worth the price of admission alone.
<br>
<br>The game is a point-and-click, top-down-view &quot;survival&quot; title, where you are dropped into an enchanted forest world that hates you and wants you to die. The world is randomly generated based on parameters you select (think Age of Empires) and changes with every new game. You must explore, gather raw materials, and fight critters in order to manage hunger, health and &quot;sanity&quot; levels. As the days go on, you construct equipment and establish base structures of increasing complexity, which are all needed to take on the increasingly difficult monsters and environmental challenges the game throws at you. Death is permanent and makes you plan your actions very carefully, yet there is a useful late-game mechanic that lets you make an effigy of yourself out of meat, wood, and hair (not making that up) that will revive you after a particularly unlucky encounter with a sinister Eyeclops or blowgun-toting-kilt-wearing-walrus (also not making that up).
<br>
<br>The feeling of progression is wonderful as the game plays out. You go from foraging for berries and mushrooms to harvesting corn from farm plots to make tasty fish tacos. You go from a measly campfire to a roaring fire pit, surrounded by stone walls and chests of loot. And while you begin the game running from spiders and fending them off with a pointy stick, you can come back for vengeance later with a shadow sword constructed of pure nightmares and an army of friendly pig-men. Also, you&apos;ve given the pig-men top hats, because it&apos;s important to look dapper.
<br>
<br>Artistically, the game is very unique and incredibly weird, with a style that makes all the characters and props look like living pencil and charcoal drawings. The theme is playful and cartoony while having very sinister undertones. Think Alice in Wonderland and Nightmare Before Christmas, with a dose of Lovecraft thrown in when your sanity dips and you start to go nuts. In 40+ hours of play, I haven&apos;t stopped smiling at how goofy the berry-stealing Gobbler is or how the noble Beefalo herds stare at you blankly when you walk by. And the shadowy hand that slowly reaches out of the darkness to snuff out your camp fire (with the background sound of a broken jack-in-the-box) is just straight-up disturbing.
<br>
<br>Speaking of campfires, the day/night cycle this game has is one of the best implemented I&apos;ve seen in a video game. There is a day/dusk/night rotation (as well as a summer/winter/rainstorm mechanic) that greatly influences how the world and the player behave. Rabbits frolic during the day, creepy/crawly things come out at dusk, and straying from a light source for even a few seconds at night causes an unseen horror to straight-up murder you. Even when you&apos;re far into a game with an established, well-stocked campsite, you&apos;re still just a castaway huddled next to a fire, gnawing on a rabbit bone, trying not to go crazy.
<br>
<br>Which brings me to my last point concerning difficulty. At some point, the game stops ramping up challenges so quickly and just starts to just cycle them. It&apos;s then when players begin to complain of boredom. &quot;I&apos;ve survived 100 days and now the game is boooring!&quot; Well, boredom only comes from security and security is only achieved from a fully-explored map and campsite bursting with supplies and gadgets. There&apos;s always the option of stuffing a few things in a sack and jumping through the Teleportato (not a typo) to generate a whole new, unmapped, dangerous world. I&apos;ve done this several times and the thrill of mapping out a new island hasn&apos;t gotten old.
<br>
<br>Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;m off to eat a sack full of mushrooms and beat an angry, walking pine tree to death with a bat made out of ham, all while tripping my ass off and hallucinating rabbits with beards.

Mouse cursor activated tooltips give you most of the information you need (e.g. what you need to build things) and beyond that, the game is about experimentation.  And it is fun to explore.  Don&apos;t Starve is one of those games where you will die several times before you make progress, but that&apos;s part of the fun in my opinion.  Provided you are willing to learn from your mistakes, this is a very enjoyable game.  The game&apos;s soundtrack is fantastic as well.  9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3299469">Expand</a></span>

The game constantly forces you to put yourself out there and prepare for a world thats only purpose is to kill you. If you die, then you die. No retries. (Well there are some ways you can come back.) I&apos;ve played the game since its alpha release and I&apos;m glad to say that I got to see it grow into a full immersive game. Complete with world customization and constructable objects/buildings. The world and the soundtrack that goes along with it is a perfect fit. The art style the game has seems like a Tim Burton style with a little less creepy. It fits well with the game.
<br>
<br>The survival game now also has a story with recent updates. I won&apos;t spoil anything but even though it may just seem like another survival game the story is actually very compelling and actually makes sense why you are where you are.
<br>
<br>TL;DR
<br>
<br>Dont Starve is an awesome survival game. Buy it. Lose many hours of your life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3260403">Expand</a></span>

The fact that there is no indication on what can harm you just encourages the slow-paced survival mentality as the game continues to throw curveballs at you that you&apos;d never expect.

Borrowing heavily from the survival and crafting mechanics of the likes of minecraft, this wonderfully stylized game manages to carve a niche of its own in a genre that is starting to get a little crowded.</span>

Personally i didn&apos;t complete the adventure mode yet but i plan to, to unlock the last characters and the best part of this game is that almost (if not) every month, Klei Entertainment release a new update with new and useful stuff and now mods are supported. There was only some disappointing things:
<br>1. Combat  I didn&apos;t like the combat, the monsters just destroyed me, and i know that i didn&apos;t played that much to get great equipment but anyway, the enemies where to strong for me;
<br>2. Adventure mode  I don&apos;t like the way it was done, not being able to carry your equipment through the worlds but i guess that raise the difficulty and challenge and the portal to travel between the worlds that need to be found and sometimes can&apos;t be found because your generated world is stupid and confusing.
<br>
<br>But overall the survival aspects, the hunger and the design of the game are awesome and deserve a 8. Maybe in some months i would give it a 9 if we get even better updates and i&apos;m really hopping for multiplayer that was a big disappointment for me that the game didn&apos;t had one. I&apos;m hoping the PS4 version brings one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3276077">Expand</a></span>

This game is far from perfect, but it&apos;s really adorable and entertaining. Almost every 2 week there&apos;s a new update that adds features, objects, world animals and also characters. I think that in a year this game will get 1 more point if they add a multiplayer mode for 2 players.</span>

This being said, it is an inherently &quot;grind&quot; heavy game and most of your time will be spent performing repetitive tasks (or dying). Oddly enough of the hundreds of deaths I have experienced in this game I have yet to in fact Starve...so at least I followed the core imperative.
<br>
<br>Once you have clawed your way to a position of security and there are no concerns for food, safety, or resources the game does start to feel a little dull and without challenge. Admittedly there are options within the game world generation phase that can make the game hellishly difficult, but even then the sense of accomplishment you first felt, on finally prototyping that item or figure out how to deal with that obstacle, never quite returns.
<br>
<br>All in all a great game to play and I find myself often returning to it for an hour or two every once and a while but it lacks end-game motivation. Certainly happy that i bought it and certainly would encourage anybody who enjoys a little grind in their lives to buy it too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3639286">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>From my lives i died to wild bees trying to sack their hive, I ate wrong mushroom killing myself, I was killed by beefaloo when desperately trying to kill it to eat something or i&apos;d die, i was eaten by wild dogs that came in the night to kill me, wild treant smacked me down when i burned half of the forest, I got lost in the dark and was killed by some demon, later I went insane and was killed by the shadow etc. etc. etc...
<br>
<br>Its difficult, I keep dying but so far its still fun and I&apos;m getting better. I heard rumors the winter is coming soon so now when I mastered staying alive in the summer I try to stockpile some food. Dunno if its going to be enough though. Because you never know what can happen next in this game :)
<br>
<br>Worth the money for sure, and btw the visuals and animations are awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3954978">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t Starve has a very memorable artstyle and very distinct playable characters that aren&apos;t difficult to remember. This game throws you in the middle of no where, where you are expected to make use of your environment in ways almost no other survival game does; in order to survive.
<br>
<br>This game literally goes down to the roots, where twigs, plants, and grass are all very useful resources that you have to rely on in order to survive. Almost nothing is useless, and a lot of it is essential. You can catch animals using traps, catch insects using nets, and even slaughter mutants and monsters. There are many different types of enemies as well, to the point where you&apos;ll stumble upon enemies you&apos;ve never seen before and have no idea how they will react to your presence, let-alone what loot they carry and what benefits you gain for defeating them. That is real survival. The survival aspect of this game goes incredibly in-depth, there&apos;s just so much to it.
<br>
<br>Once you die, you&apos;re dead for good. Your save gets deleted and you have to start over. But have no fear, the game rewards you depending on how many days you survive by giving you experience points. These experience points are built toward unlocking new characters, which all have unique attributes that make the game play differently.
<br>
<br>Although it&apos;s a little difficult, Don&apos;t Starve is an incredible survival game. If survival games are your cup of tea, this game is a must-have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3684991">Expand</a></span>

So here is my experience.
<br>After playing almost 48 hours of the game (not in one go) i am still really enjoying Don&apos;t Starve. The art style is , yes fantastic for the genre and the gameplay mechanics are simple but yet satisfying. You start off in the middle of know where, on a large map of various biomes. The aim is to craft and survive the various threats in the game. Starvation, annual attacks from beasts, insanity, the darkness, flood, lightning, karma and other various things in the game can all kill you at any point, the game truly makes you feel vulnerable but does add in few ways to feel safe with friendly mobs and respawn points. Yes it is permadeath, but the game saves at points so you don&apos;t have to play until you die. You can craft respawn items to revive yourself and there are endless amounts of items you can craft which i haven&apos;t even touched half of them yet and i have played for hours and hours! After reaching day 100 i was still finding new parts of the game, survival and adventure mode exist with the main goal to escape the world. This game does have a story!
<br>Yes you could say it gets repetitive in cycles due to summer, winter and secret seasons but patience and and open mind is always a good thing in video games.
<br>Overall i think this game is fantastic and a great new fresh breath of air from other games in the new survival/crafting genre. Would definitely recommend and without a doubt is worth the price.
<br>P.S The new DLC is amazing! But i review that on the page</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4106253">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game art is ridiculous for survival type of the game, everything is gray and unrealistic. The music is ok but other sounds are annoying.

Don&apos;t Starve is a great &quot;night cap&quot; game; something you can play for a few in-game days, gathering mats, exploring for monster camps, or just trying to not starve. It&apos;s pretty relaxing (at least until winter) just gathering mats, unlocking new recipes and creating new tools to help you explore. With seven characters, each with their own personality and advantages, there is tons of replay value with every enormous randomly generated map (or one customized by you) providing new challenges. The most frustrating element isn&apos;t the randomization for once; I feel that the permadeath is unnecessary and Don&apos;t Starve would benefit more from a checkpoint system.
<br>
<br>Overall this is worth the asking price if you enjoyed Minecraft or Terraria and are looking for a deeper, more difficult single player experience in the survival genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3238527">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the game lacks any sort of significant hook to keep players coming back. After only a few games of Don&apos;t Starve I found myself extremely bored with the title as the game lacks addictive qualities.
<br>
<br>You spend your time in the game picking up resources which are then crafted into tools for survival. This crafting system *could* have been the addictive hook for the game if recipes were kept a mystery ala Minecraft, but you can see all of the components needed for each craftable.
<br>
<br>Each game is spent collecting resources and crafting with no other gameplay elements to speak of. It quickly becomes monotonous and tedious.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t Starve is missing that one last element to make it a fun and engaging game. Multiplayer capabilities, recipe discoveries, end game goals, terrain sculpting, any of these might give it that extra bit of flavor and make the endeavor seem less pointless.
<br>
<br>As it stands the game is just too bland and narrow in scope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3181836">Expand</a></span>

<br>While mining and building are in the game they&apos;re not all that useful as you&apos;ll spend most of your time searching for resources to help you survive rather than creating walls as they can be a waste of resources that you needed to make into a trap or something.

Don&apos;t Starve seemed like an interesting concept, but not anything particularly new. It seemed to draw on elements of Minecraft, Terraria, and other survival based &quot;Create your own adventure&quot; sort of games. The problem with Don&apos;t Starve isn&apos;t that the game is really badly made or anything  it looks fine and I didn&apos;t encounter any errors or glitches. The problem is the game becomes boring really quick. After I managed to survive for awhile I kept exploring and just didn&apos;t find anything but more of what I already had. You can craft better items and some can be helpful, but generally they just serve to help you do the same things over and over again quicker. I think the other reviewers were playing a different game, the crafting system in this game was very boring and uninspired. Literally the ingredients needed are listed and the crafted items generally either do the same things faster or they provide information that&apos;s not really that helpful. I found rocks to be very sparse compared to other resources in the game which required very lengthy expeditions to find new rock after all the relatively local rock was mined. While I didn&apos;t get bored of Minecraft until some time after I played it, same with Terraria  I was bored of Don&apos;t Starve very quickly. It just felt tedious and boring. Parts of Minecraft and Terraria felt like this too, but they had their rewarding accomplishments. Don&apos;t Starve feels like a game that exists just to exist. When I inevitably died from lack of enough resources derived from rocks, I just had no real drive to try again. If you enjoy really repetitive games, you might like Don&apos;t Starve but I got bored with this one so quickly I got a refund while it was still a pre-order. I&apos;m giving this game a decent score because it&apos;s not broken, it&apos;s just not that much fun. The game feels too limited about what you can build or do, so it really seems to lack the fun value of a Terraria or Minecraft kind of game. I love survival games, but this one just lacked any real interesting elements to it. Minecraft and Terraria may not be survival games at their core but they had more enjoyable survival elements than Don&apos;t Starve by far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123237">Expand</a></span>

And, one, last, very important thing: DON&apos;T STARVE!
<br>
<br>This game is awesome ^_^ Sandbox, strategy, rpg, with monsters and magic.  It is a game of exploration, and survival.  If you turn it into a game of grind, then I think you&apos;re doing it wrong.  Of course stockpiling for Winter is a big part of the game, but you must move around the world (and far away from whatever home you create for yourself) in order to progress.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3154625">Expand</a></span>

If this game had a decent art style I&apos;d be playing it right now, but something about the scribble-doodle art style just doesn&apos;t lend itself well towards a game that you&apos;re supposed to play again and again. An adventure game? sure. But the gameplay just can&apos;t make up for the fact that I feel like I&apos;m playing a papercraft game with art consisting of 15 bucks thrown at deviantart commissions from tim burton fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3245511">Expand</a></span>

Survival elements seem too harsh at first, but seems easy once you&apos;ve started figuring things out. (if you&apos;re having trouble, look up recipes for the crock pot). Insofar as that, I&apos;d say the game is immersively complex without being complex to the point where you give up.
<br>
<br>The game is full of variety, and the massive dev updates (instead of spitting out garbage DLC) makes you want to buy the game multiple times just because you know you short-changed the dev by only paying what was asked. The art style is excellent, though the fake 3D engine has obvious drawbacks. Enemy variety and drops are particularly excellent. Even though common enemies drop the same items almost every time, those enemies&apos; drops are needed for progression in crafting and survival in general.
<br>
<br>Every single mechanic flows exceptionally well together, unlike anything I&apos;ve before seen in a game. There&apos;s never a time when I said &quot;why&apos;s this mechanic or item even in the game?&quot; (well, okay  except the pumpkin jack-o-lantern  that was relatively useless?) I played this game with my wife at the same time, and we both loved it. We swapped stories about what does what, and how to interact with in-game objects in a new way.
<br>
<br>This game should be an example for game developers in maintaining a sense of wonder by not revealing everything to the player right away. It&apos;s very similar to Binding of Isaac in this way  or Nethack, along with many other roguelikes. There&apos;s just a TON of content, without any of it being forced on you, so unlike the many linear games AAA releases bring.
<br>
<br>As others say, the game does eventually get &quot;old&quot; once there are fewer new things coming up on you. The dev updates are wonderful, but if you&apos;ve already explored the vast majority of the game, adding 2-5% more content isn&apos;t really enough. It&apos;s the same with mods and the modding community. Modding is &quot;semi-supported&quot; (maybe more like &quot;barely tolerated&quot;), and there are some good ones which enhance gameplay, but there are no decent overhauls, which is unfortunate. I look forward to playing the game again in a year or so, knowing there will definitely be enough content for me to jump back in and enjoy myself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171566">Expand</a></span>

It has some really simple, but stylish graphics (reminds me of some kind of Tim Burton drawings), The day/ night cycle and lighting effects are also right. The animation of the characters are very fluid. The camera is from a top down view with a slight perspective, it can be rotated by 45 degrees, but the objects and characters are both stylish 2D sprites. In overall, it looks good and artistic!
<br>
<br>The gameplay is extremely challenging and fun at the same time, however, sometimes it can be boring, so you should have some breaks sometimes. In the game itself, you start in nowhere with your selected character. Each characters have different perks (more health, bigger stomach, longer beard(!), and other special abilities), but you can start only with one. You need to progress in the game to unlock other characters.You need to collect things, combine them into tools, food, equipment, and also you need to fight against monsters and animals and against your own sanity! Character can become insane and he/she will hallucinate and the mental attacks can become physical attacks, it can kill you.
<br>
<br>Sound effects are cool, the music is also good too. I&apos;m not good at describing sounds, so I don&apos;t go in-depth.
<br>
<br>Replayablity is great. The world is random generated, and can give the player new challenge all the time. Also, there is an adventure mode, which is accessible through a portal from the normal game mode. Also, the game is frequently updated, so the developers fixes bugs and puts new contents in it. The latest update has caves too, which is a really cool feature. It simply deserves a 9 of 10. It&apos;s fresh, interesting, and challenging, but not recommended for casual gamers. Of you like challenging survival games, this is for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3192177">Expand</a></span>

I highly recommend studying the wiki for a bit to get you going at a faster pace! So far, I can&#x2019;t stop playing it! As long as the flow of content updates keeps coming I think this game has great potential. For those of you who liked Terarria, Minecraft, Diablo, and a dark sense of humor, BUY THIS!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3149344">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game really revolves around collecting basic ingredients and crafting them into survival gear/items.  You are going to want to collect food RIGHT away, you will get hungry fast.  You are going to want to cook this food with fire.  You are also going to want to build tools like axes, pickaxes, etc and harvest quite a bit of raw materials.  Then you are going to want to build science machines in order to build better tools/survival gear/weapons.
<br>
<br>Combat is fairly basic, click and run is the general tactic.  I really think this is a wiki friendly game despite spoilers.  You should learn about what items you want and how to craft them by searching a wiki.
<br>
<br>This is really a fun game that I&apos;ve been playing since January.  The Devs have released a ton of content and fixes since then and continue to update once a month or so.  I&apos;m only marking it down 2 pts for its grindy nature after a while.  Really its worth a look and WAY better than most major label games, especially for $12</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dont-starve/user-reviews?user_review_id=3242582">Expand</a></span>

<br>You have 4 important game keys to watch out
<br>1.Sanity  The most important you must see forever beacuse sometimes you dont know if a petal is poisonous or a mushroom.When you have sanity  5 to 25,monster spawn surround you even if it day or night,they kill you
<br>2.Time  this is the second important thing to see on your screen if you dont build any campfire or any pit fire you will get killed by monster or natural monsters(spiders...)
<br>3.food bar  i think you know it
<br>4.Health this is the third important thing.
<br>The game art style is great,the background music is great,the AI is not too bad  but not too good,the game itself is great.
