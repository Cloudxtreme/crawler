It will take some hours to master the basics but after that you don&apos;t really do anything else. It&apos;s still fun, especially the battle of Kursk or defending in Normandy, or the Polish missions, but it could have used more missions with more variability, more nations, more weapons and so on. The game offers something good and realistic, just not enough of it to make it a great game. Imagine if it offered all of the nations involved in World War 2, or at least those in Europe, and scenarios for every one of them. A campaign similar to that of World in Conflict might have also work. As stated before, a good game, regardless of the things it lacks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/theatre-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=5788964">Expand</a></span>
