                                        <span>Very disapointing compared to the original. Forged Alliance had the perfect level of complexity, and SupCom2 is dumbed-down thinned-out shell of a game intended for a completely different audience than the original. It&apos;s a sequel in name only.
<br>
<br>While the storyline in the original isn&apos;t exactly an award-winner, SupCom2&apos;s is one-dimensional, trite, and doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense.</span>

Economy model was changed and this is what used to set supcom apart love it or hate it, I&apos;d wait till this is under 20$ to pick it up as it feels like 1/2 of the original game.</span>

Instead of the large fights of  1000&apos;s of units over maps that can take hours to just explore, you are left with a unit cap and smaller maps to try and encourage you to finish fights faster. The tech tree and controls of the original were done away with for a much simpler and easier to understand system that seems to try and bridge to gap between keyboard and control however you are left with a system that while easier to control on the console leaves the computer feeling like a children&apos;s game with few options. What is ever worse is the tech tree. Instead of progressively stronger tech units and structures that require you build the lower tech version first. You are left with a single tech level except you have a tech tree you &quot;research&quot; with research points. You don&apos;t get progressively stronger units or structures but rather just improve the old. Also the research points are from research buildings that with only a handful will allow you to get all the tech within the first 5 minutes of the game.<br><br>This game is a perfect example of Developers Simplifying games so that the console with a controller can play them while forcing the computer to play the console version. You are left with a game that neither console nor computer gamer enjoy. Hopefully the Supreme commander 3 will go to the computer users again which paid for the first one rather than alienating 2 groups of gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1608651">Expand</a></span>

If you own the previous game Supreme Commander Forged Alliance your probable going to be disappointed. The Ideal the new version of the games are always superior in map size, strategy, variety of units and structures is clearly wrong with Supreme Commander 2. ***Pros. Ai works a little better then Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. Has some neat technologies like Flow field path finding (movement of units), Noah unit-cannon. The game runs fast and smooth, even for a very low end computer. The maps, units, structures look more real, even though it has a cartoonish look to it. It seems like I am always either scratching or losing a disk, with Steam all my software is in one spot. Makes moving my games to my next computer easy. There&apos;s a lot more patches with Supreme Commander 2, and with Steam it updates automatically. ***Cons: The Game seems to be dumb down, the maps are very small. **Maps. The largest multiplayer maps in Supreme Commander 2 is only a little bit larger than the smallest size multiplayer maps in Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. By comparing what you can build in both version, Supreme Commander 2 maps size are 5, 10 km maps( the useable space is less because they put a lot of scenery in it.) , compared to Forged Alliance maps size are 5,10,20,40,81 km maps. Total multiplayer maps in Supreme Commander 2 is 26 maps(no users made maps though) compared to Forged Alliance 56 maps, plus many more users made for it. Some of the maps do have certain unique look to them though. Some Supreme Commander 2 maps were taken from Forged alliance, but they are small, detail is ok to bad, and you are very limited what you can build on them! How the game was made, there probably won&apos;t be any new maps. **Economy. The game still has economy, but doesn&apos;t serve any real purpose anymore because the mass and energy you create goes into imaginary unlimited storage unit. Energy you use isn&apos;t the same like it was in forged alliance. For instance, shields you build taps its energy from a imaginary energy source. The energy you get from the power generators is like another form of mass, its only used to build things. In Forged Alliance has real touch of a economy, what things need power, where are the mass extractors. Where do I put the Mass Storage and Energy Storage units. **Unit variety. The number of units and structures types have been reduced. In Supreme Commander 2 you no longer have Spy planes, Engineering Station, Air Staging Facility, Stealth Field Generators, Tactical missile defense, mass storage and energy storage units, Mass Fabrication Station that creates mass slowly. In Supreme Commander 2 you have only one type of Power Generators, mass convertors that create mass by pressing certain keys you can transfer some of your energy into mass at one time. New to Supreme Commander 2 is the Research Station, I think is a bad idea. In very short period of time you can have everything unlocked in the tech tree. **Game Play. Mine hunting is gone. Even turning off the mass convertors at the begging of the game, it&apos;s like stretch out your main base, the maps are to small! Finding more mines and protecting them was part of the fun, gone now. You only have one type of shield now, it has a small shield area and it doesn&apos;t use any power now. Shields no longer fail, unlike Forged alliance if a power generator gets blown up. Maps are so small and so few, there is no longer any sneak attacks and only a choke point where you focus all your attacks. There is no real strategy any more, just build your main base and start building units. Even though I think the AI has been improved over Forged Alliance, the AI in Forged alliance is more difficult because the units, structures, maps are more complex and how you collect mass and energy. I heard that the creator of this game wanted to simplify the economy, but shields, large guns, nothing requires energy to operate, really? Forged Alliance Mod Manager has a option that determines how the resources are collected even one where resources mean nothing, amongst other things. You could have put a Mod Manager in Supreme Commander 2 , did you really think that would make things to confusing, really! ** Suggestions to the THQ/Square Enix. If you can&apos;t bring back big maps and a true drain-system economy to Supreme Commander 2, It would be nice if you would do something like a DLC pack for Forged Alliance. Even though the modding community did a good job making maps, mods, and made a great Ai for this game. They don&apos;t have the understanding in changing the source code and making use of a multi-core processor. Supreme Commander 2 should have been made for a PC and then make another version for the gaming console boxes with changes you think is necessary for it.When Supreme Commander 3 comes out, I am going to do a lot research first, I am not going to be fooled again!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1460913">Expand</a></span>

The whole game has been completely dumbed down, all those nice features whom I have come to like since Total Annihilation have been removed for the sake of making it more mainstream. Would not buy.</span>

Everything good and innovative about Supreme Commander and its excellent expansion Forged Alliance has been removed, leaving a poor standard RTS clone reminiscent of 1992&apos;s Dune II, but with a worse UI. The innovative and realistic economy system in SupCom has been replaced by the arcade-style, unrealistic system used by most other games. The UI has been dumbed down with many features and settings removed, leading to more tedious clicking. SupCom 1 and FA may have been ahead of their time, in that the largest maps required a powerful PC to play; but then again that made it future proof. This version requires less computing power to play, simply because it is a simple, dumb game with way fewer units and a reduced scale and ambition. Magic in SupCom2: SupCom2 features mystical forces of magic that instantaneously transmute your existing units into having an extra gun, or air defense, or other upgrades, no matter how far away they are from your base. These magical forces are not explained in the manual. The &quot;research centers&quot; producing the bizarre and unrealistic &quot;research points&quot; are somehow related to these magical effects, but oddly you can spend lots of time obtaining research points (i.e., &quot;researching&quot;) without specifying *what* you&apos;re researching... Then later, you select an upgrade and magically, time shifts backwards and you were actually researching that upgrade the entire time. That form of magic in SupCom2 I&apos;ll call &quot;temporal magic.&quot; The upgrade is then instantaneously applied to all existing units, apparently by The Force, midiclorians, invisible and infinite-speed upgrade drones, or perhaps simply &quot;upgrade magic.&quot; Supreme Commander was an excellent and ground breaking game; Supreme Commander 2 has almost nothing in common with it and doesn&apos;t deserve the SupCom name. It simply has no depth, no learning curve, no room for error or growth, and absolutely isn&apos;t fun to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746294">Expand</a></span>

The story they hyped so much is total shit and seems like it was written by a firstgrader and the voice acting is ridicolous. The Gameplay is slow and feels like every other strategy game out there. It doesn&apos;t have the unique feel of the original SupCom. The Experimentals, which could change the outcome of the game in SupCom 1, are nothing special. A few standard tanks can destroy one. You don&apos;t have to pay attention to your economy anymore. Three or four energy generators already produce more energy than you&apos;ll ever need. The research mechanic could have made the game very interesting. But you can just spam Research Centers (which are very cheap to build) and after a short time you have enough research points to research EVERYTHING. The only redeeming feature of this game is the Strategic Zoom it inherited from the original SupCom.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746206">Expand</a></span>

Where in SC1, mass converters just created mass if you had enough power. I can also understand making the maps a bit smaller, but now they&apos;re too small. Really congested simply makes your battles look larger, not that they really are larger. And the experimentals are total crap. They cost almost nothing, and they&apos;re quality is what you paid for. Experimentals were super expensive in SC1 but when you saw one walking towards your base, you knew that stuff was about to get real ugly real fast. These exps might as well be made of aluminum and fire plastic projectiles. Total garbage, I guess the idea was to overrun a base with a large group of experimentals.<br><br>I&apos;d normally give an RTS of this quality a 7/10 rating, but because I was so disappointed in the retrogression from a game I truly loved, this gets a 4/10. Robbed me of my hopes, and backstabbed all your fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1402930">Expand</a></span>

I saw the new graphics and hoped it would be like the original only updated and advancing the story/new units/concepts. (age of empires approach). What I got was a simplified version with less concepts, strategies, and units. in trying to reach those who found the game too complicated, they  made it outright dumb. small maps, small armies, and a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE campaign. most fights were rock-paper-scissors style, which was left behind for good reason with most developers. Experimental units are no longer awesome, they are now slightly impressive. That all being said, everything does look way cooler with graphics upgrade, but then you get to see how bad they made the game clearer...<br>hopefully they make a third but learn from this mistake.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1712578">Expand</a></span>

All the luster of the first game is gone and in its place is a dull plastic coating. This is not Supreme Commander 2, this is a hideous knock-off. Or worse yet: &quot;Supreme Commander: Children&apos;s Edition&quot;.</span>

                                        <span> Could be a good game on its own. But it is very toned back from origional SupCom. The graphics quality is polished, but overall &apos;meh&apos;. Leading to difficulties distinguishing units and buildings. The maps are significantly smaller. The units have less &apos;wow&apos; to them. And overall the game feels like a step in the wrong direction. I&apos;m sad I payed for it.</span>

Make sure you try the free demo before buying, as it will give you a good idea of what you can expect. This game is an *extremely* simplified version of the original SupCom, and differs from it in many ways. The traits that made SupCom a unique and epic game are all but gone, and what is left is a fairly generic RTS which would likely only hold a person&apos;s attention for a short time. If you&apos;re looking for a simple, non-challenging RTS, then give this a try. If you want something as epic as the original SupCom, my advice would be to look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746253">Expand</a></span>

This game topped my expectations and was a great buy. 9/10 because like generals the units didn&apos;t start moving the INSTANT you told them to.

I&apos;m glad I did, because I hated the two campaign levels the demo offered. I don&apos;t need to play any more to make a verdict. The graphics might be a bit better, interesting experimental units are plentiful, and the research tree is an interesting idea, but that is about all the pros. They completely messed up almost all of the good things about Sup-Com and Sup-Com FA. This game might be enjoyable for someone who hasn&apos;t played the first two games, but veterans of the prequels will find themselves turning back to the originals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1714107">Expand</a></span>

This game strips away complex strategies of base building and army structuring in favor of simple engagements of math.  You generate energy, and harvest mass, in order to build your base and construct units.  A third resource, research, generates slowly over time (or quicker with research facilities) and can be used to upgrade the effectiveness of your structures, units, or even unlock new ones.  In short, Supreme Commander 2 has taken away all of the elements that made Supreme Commander unique, and replaced them with... nothing.
<br>
<br>It would be unfair to review a title that considers itself the continuation of a prior game, without comparing it to it&apos;s predecessor.  Supreme Commander 2 is a weaker strategy game in almost every aspect compared to the original Supreme Commander.  There are fewer units, it demands less strategy and brain power, the maps are incredibly small, and all units feel expendable.  The game quickly becomes throwing as much crap at your enemy as you can, as quickly as you can, however you can.  Supreme Commander required you to measure your attacking plans and balance your units against theirs.
<br>
<br>Supreme Commander 2 is Supreme Commander Lite.  The battles are intense, but short, and lack any feeling of worth.  The maps are beautiful, but incredibly tiny.  And your arsenal is extremely limited and one dimensional.
<br>
<br>This game is not worth purchasing if you enjoyed the original, what a disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2879265">Expand</a></span>

It certainly was in the original - and much loved - supreme commander. The difficulty, for some, is that while the game looks the same, the economy itself is inherently different. http://teachergamer.blogspot.com/2011/04/supreme-commander-2-review.html<br><br>For starters, unlike the original it is difficult to run short of mass and energy - the two resources needed to power the production of units. This is coupled with the emphasis on upgrading a few core units, rather than producing, and memorising, a plethora of the-same-but-a-bit-different tanks. I still remember now an old friend telling me, during a mutliplayer of medieval total war, that he intended to build his army from as many different, and obscure, troop types as possible, thus as to ensure that I didn&apos;t have a clue what I was fighting, or how to counteract it. Such beardiness has been devastated in Supreme Commander 2. Instead what you have is an engaging game that allows the easy(ier) building of experimentals - skyscraper robots capable of destroying an army single-handed. Their names are as ridiculous as their power - King Kriptor, for one!<br><br>Admittedly, if you had dedicated a substantial amount of time to perfecting your build orders to the second, then this game will frustrate you. If you had an inherent knowledge of how the dozens of different basic units counteracted each other, then this game will feel like an imposter. Indeed, the smaller maps (often strangely cramped due to extra scenary) will tone down the epic feeling for those expert at the original. For me, though, it is perfect. Having stalled on the tutorial for several months, I managed to give the game a morning. In those few hours, I had won skirmishes will all the sides (which feel, and look, genuinely different), unlocked all the experimental units and progressed in the campaign. I have tried some multiplayer, and enjoyed the epicness of it all (something served by an incredible soundtrack.) For those on PC, this game has also regularly dropped to &#xC2;&#xA3;2.50, which is a farcical price. You simply must own this game for that amount of money. Very incisive descriptions of why the game feels &apos;broken&apos; to the experts of the original exist, but suffice to say that if, like me, you play many different genres, this is a wonderful addition that allows you 20-60mins of intensely satisfying RTS at a time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1568464">Expand</a></span>

It does get boring when you become one of the best in the world at it, but until then the game is amazing. Maybe if ididnt play it as much as i did i would give it a 9, but this game is simply too epic on many levels!</span>

Extremely limited number of units and base defenses make no sense for a game series that prided itself on an interesting variety of weapons choices. New economy requires the presence of the resources in order to even queue up units and structures. This actually creates more production micromanagement issues as factories pause and builder units cannot be tasked with building out a whole base at one time. I found myself constantly having to deal with stalled engineers in the middle of a hole in my defenses or a screen of fighters that has dwindled down to nothing from a paused factory. This means less time thinking strategically about combat! Smaller map size and lower unit cap removes that epic feel of the first two games. The relative lack of defensive power also renders many of the experimental units less useful as a tool to wreak havoc among your enemies and a reason for them to focus significant firepower to stop them. This trend to dumb down content to please a broader audience/more markets is something we have seen all too often: Deus Ex I =&gt; II, F.E.A.R. (first trilogy) =&gt; F.E.A.R. II, and much of the missing character development options and story in games like Mass Effect 2. Broadcast media seems to slowly be learning their lesson as more creative, interesting and &quot;no apologies&quot; programming does well on cable channels while the networks struggle to keep a shrinking audience with fare designed to draw the most eyeballs in the shortest time. Rarely are shows that are even slightly outside the box given the chance to develop their characters and grow an audience. The game publishing industry should take a hint and give players who are sticking to their PCs an interesting, and creative experience that stimulates more than the adrenaline gland and actually makes us use our brain. Leave the rest to the consoles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746301">Expand</a></span>

If, however, you are looking for a worthy successor to Supreme Commander, you best look elsewhere. Unfortunately Supreme Commander 2 has as much to do with Supreme Commander as Operation Flashpoint does with Unreal Tournament. They&apos;re both RTS games... and that&apos;s it. Pretty much everything else is significantly different. The pace, the economy, the units, the map size, etc. All of it. It is nothing like Supreme Commander. It&apos;s VERY unit focused with very little base-building. The pace is much higher, the maps and weapon ranges smaller. Experimentals are much cheaper relative to normal units and much weaker. The economy is now a Red Alert-style buy-before-you-build economy instead of a buy-as-you-build economy and is not infinitely expandable as there are no mass fabricators. There are no more tech-levels, all units and buildings are of the same tech-level. Instead they get stronger and better by spending research-points that affect all units/buildings of one type on the battlefield instantaneously and all units/buildings produced from then on. What you end up with is an RTS game that is focused on creating a short intense experience based on units. Which is much closer to Command &amp; Conquer and Starcraft then Supreme Commander. Conclusion: If they had called it Robot Wars instead of Supreme Commander 2 it wouldn&apos;t be bad at all, but they didn&apos;t. They made a game that was supposed to be a successor, but ended up having nothing to do with what came before. To all the reviewers saying Supreme Commander 2 has made a change for the better: You obviously don&apos;t understand that there are people out there that didn&apos;t think 99% of the game was flawed and had to change. Just because you like C&amp;C/Starcraft-style RTS games doesn&apos;t mean the entire world does. 95% Of the changes aren&apos;t &quot;changes for the better&quot;, they are just changes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746273">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>&gt;The graphics are less dull than the ones in SC1 and FA
<br>&gt;When destroying aircraft over water, the wreckage of the planes sink to the bottom and leave wreckage on the sea floor. Same with boats. In SC1 and FA, too much bullets hitting a plane midair makes it disappear while if they hit the water they just generally disappear. Boats in FA and SC1 sink straight through the floor (Which I found really annoying).
<br>Now to the cons.
<br>&gt;Experimentals are absolutely pathetic. In the original games, building an experimental was something to be celebrated. The Megalith II and Soul Ripper II are absolutely weak compared to their stronger ancestors.
<br>&gt;Nukes are also pathetic. In the original games, they were game changers, being able to end an entire army with the launching of a bunch of nukes at a base. In SC2, they are generally pea bombs.
<br>&gt;The maps are far tinier than the originals. For example, Seton&apos;s Clutch was a big map in FA and SC1, but has become incredibly tiny in SC2.
<br>&gt;In the originals, you had the ability to create MASSIVE armies and spam them. In SC2, that has been taken away from you since they lowered the max unit capacity from 1000 to 500.
<br>
<br>In all, SC2 is a good game for beginners, but if it is a challenge you want, get Forged Alliance, that is much more complex and strategic than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1911610">Expand</a></span>

The Ai is really bad.  Depending on the **** level..either the Computer players are really easy, or brutally tough.  I found a cheap exploit in the game where you rush tech to Heavy Gunships and then you tear apart the enemy bases.  My friends saw me doing this...so when I got bored of it because I knew it was boring and cheap..they started doing it..which is a lot more boring than doing it myself.  Tried very hard to learn different ways to play this game...Navy, Air Force (Naval Artillery is FUN!) etc.....but found myself opting out when my friends asked me to play with them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2126083">Expand</a></span>

I do miss the layers of nuanced complexity that lofted the original stories above the competition, but SupCom 2 is still an enjoyable, rock-solid, and gorgeous RTS.</span>

It had an amazing amount of depth for an RTS and things like Tiers, the Economy system, and the huge amount of gameplay styles always had me coming back. SC2 is like being taken from an Olympic sized pool and being thrown in the 1&quot; Kiddy pool. No more tier upgrades, no more GIGANTIC maps, and no more economy management. Experimental units really don&apos;t feel like they have that same &quot;awe&quot; because they can literally die within 3 seconds of meeting a fully upgraded commander.
<br>
<br>Overall, just take all the good out of SupCom and leave it with an incredibly basic shell that resembles every generic RTS out there. Supreme Commander 2 is a very disappointing wait that could have easily fixed some of the flaws with the original and FA while adding even more depth, but they chose to fixate on the word &quot;streamline&quot; instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3440562">Expand</a></span>

<br>Imagine for a moment that Valve released Half Life 3. A long stretch of the imagination, I know, but do your best.

<br>Imagine for a moment that Valve released Half Life 3. A long stretch of the imagination, I know, but do your best. Now imagine that Half Life 3 were a cover based shooter with two weapon slots and regenerating health, pitting you against faceless nameless human enemies in droves with meager justification for killing them.
<br>
<br>Now, it might be a perfectly good generic modern military shooter. Knowing Valve it most certainly is. But that&apos;s not going to do much to slow the march of the lynch mob out for Valve. A few people who didn&apos;t play or didn&apos;t particularly understand what made the previous Half Life games great might give it some fairly positive reviews. But the people who did play and understand the games that came before do not care how well made it may be. Because that&apos;s not what Half Life is. You don&apos;t get to destroy a franchise by forsaking what it is built on to deliver a generic, money grabbing, &apos;for wider audiences&apos; game and then walk away with positive press. If you want to do that, you give it a new name.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s essentially what Supreme Commander 2 is. Judged on its own merits alone, it&apos;s a decent RTS, forgotten within the year but good enough to say nice things about as it passes. But Supreme Commander 2 does not have the luxury of being judged on its own merits. What it is, is a systematic destruction of an IP that delivered something literally no other game in existence could match. Supreme Commander 2 scaled down, dumbed down, made itself generic to broaden appeal.
<br>
<br>Supreme Commander 2 is a decent game. It also marks the dead end of a franchise that had done what none other did, one that carried infinitely more potential than this, potential which is now thrown to the wind. When a game is both of these things, you do not focus on the former, as that will not benefit anyone. Do not support this game. Give your money to Forged Alliance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3338271">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In particular the game doesn&apos;t crash or slow to crawl when there are a thousand units on the map.  A lot of the strategy has shifted to how you manage your tech. tree, which is different from forged alliance, where an upgrade required a new building.
<br>
<br>After playing it quite a bit,  I find I rather like the simplification,  and I can still deploy some of my favorite strategies, like turtling or  &quot;towering&quot;  with long range artillery.
<br>
<br>There are still some flaws though.  The balance isn&apos;t always right.  Some experimentals are not worth building because they are either too weak or too expensive.  I am not entirely convinced that the races are balanced either.  Nevertheless the game should be enjoyable for any real time strategy fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4334894">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are good, lots of units to choose from, many different strategies. Everything you could want from a RTS game and more. I&apos;d give it an 8 as of a month ago but with the latest patches and new maps, definite 9. If it was a bit faster and had a few more techs, I&apos;d be close to perfect.</span>

At first I was really really disappointed because it was so different from SupCom1, but later when I played it at lan parties with friends I learned more about it and it was great fun! In addition it has good support and since the October updates (incl. DLC) it has become even better and got more missing functions from SupCom1 added.</span>

Therefore it was a lot more work to get into games. So, I went back to playing Supcom:FA. However, one of the last Supcom:FA 1v1&apos;s that I played, the guy I kept getting matched up wtih complained that Supcom:FA didn&apos;t have as diverse strategy as Supcom 2.<br><br>This stuck in my head for a number of months until I decided to give Supcom 2 another chance. First of all, the 1v1 ladder has been initialized although it has been simplified somewhat. The main thing is that it allows relatively quick matchups for games. Second of all, (and most importantly), I have been pleasantly surprised to find that it actually does have more diverse strategy than Supcom &amp; Supcom:FA and this is a good thing! Supcom and Supcom:FA give more weight to unit spamming and aggressive tactics. I&apos;m not a unit spammer by nature and one of my main frustrations with Supcom/FA was losing on small maps to players who were simply more aggressive with unit spamming and/or always used a race that was suited to small map unit spamming.<br><br>I started playing Supreme Commander 2 in earnest last weekend. Nobody can deny that there are less units and the game does not have the depth that Supreme Commander / FA had. However, I think I would have a hard time going back to FA now that I have been playing Supcom 2 for a week. I can&apos;t speak for it when it first came out, but at this point in time, it may be the best multiplayer rts out there. I never would have believed that simpler is better in RTS games, but in this case it is. Somehow the developers have managed to shed dead weight fromt he first Supcom. Games feel faster. There is more back and forth in a game. Some games in Supcom were back and forth, but a lot end up with one player steamrolling the other and once it starts to happen, there is little that can be done stop it. In this game, there is more variety of ways to win.<br><br>For example, I just played a game, where I lost everything but my commander. I ended up losing, but I have my opponent a good run for his money and managed to last about an hour after I had lost everything. That would never have happened in Supcom or Supcom:FA!<br><br>I can&apos;t speak for the single player part of this game. I haven&apos;t played any. I only ever played a handful of missions for supcom and supcomFA over 5 years. If you want to know about that, you&apos;ll have to ask someone else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1462590">Expand</a></span>

Ive played all versions for years (way over 100 hours each one) and they all are great. My favorite one to play *is* SC 2 because the experimental units dont take an age to build like in SC 1 and they are not godlike as they are in SC 1 (they can be beaten with enough normal units). There has been a lot of attention tot balanced yet diverse units within the factions. There are innovative units like the BFG Big Friendly Gun to convert enemy units to friendly and the grinder magnet thats very effective. Units dont get locked up bumping into each other when moving in big groups and scenery is awesome. So I think there is lot of advancement to SC2 and a must for the fan of the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1400049">Expand</a></span>

It features a blend of tactics and strategy, with a passable story. While there have been some bugs, development of the game continues (as evidenced by the latest patch altering the way the economy works, and the recent DLC patch). The performance is improved across the board from the prequel, as well as the look. The AI is far improved from the first game, as GPG went so far as to hire the maker of a popular AI mod to improve that aspect of their development.<br><br>Battles are fluid and snappy, with a variety of technologies available to turn the tide of battle. The factional differences are astounding, and end-game fights can break several hundred units. The online community is small but dedicated, and there are players of a variety of skill levels.<br><br>Die-hard fans of the first game will not find much to like in this though; the battles are smaller and the game simply is far different.

I haven&apos;t played the first one and I assume its different, but coming into the series for the first time, I was defiantly impressed by Supcom2. Creating and joining games seems to be hassle free and there isn&apos;t a huge amount of bugs which is a bonus.</span>

I was disappointed by a few changes in this new incarnation, most notably the lack of unit variety and a limited tech tree. However, many improvements have been made that outweigh the drawbacks to this game. The performance has been heavily optimized so that the game runs silky smooth, even when thousands of units are active in a game. The AI is better than the original, but still prone to misguided decisions that make single player a breeze. It&apos;s the multiplayer where this game really shines, and where the lasting replay value is to be found. The game has been streamlined and the learning curve has been greatly reduced from the original, and unfortunately this has resulted in a restriction of some of the strategic depth of the original. However, as has been a tradition with its predecessors, SC2 is almost certainly going to receive added variety in the form of DLC or expansions. Dont buy this game if you just want to play the story mode or single-player (try the demo first), but if you enjoy highly strategic RTS multiplayer, and don&apos;t want another &quot;click-fest,&quot; then this may be the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746248">Expand</a></span>

Music is either annoyingly bland or annoyingly persistent, i don&apos;t even have a word to describe how &quot;neutral&quot;, boring and repetitive it is. Story reminds me some crappy mexican soap opera with conflicts and drama appearing from trivial causes. Makes me wonder how much did they pay to reviewers to get 80+ scores, even as completely separate game (as if it wasn&apos;t related to sp1) i would certainly NOT buy it, recommend it or even play it for free, simply because its not entertaining or catchy enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746311">Expand</a></span>

Removes everything that was great about SupCom (and TA for that matter), and replaces it all with the same tired RTS mechanics you can find everywhere else. Skip it. Buy the original or Starcraft two in a couple of months. This title is without merit.</span>

<br>SC2 is a perfect example of what happens to a game that&apos;s dumbed down, scaled down and severely compromised in order to enable it to run on 5 year old console hardware. If you&apos;ve played the original Supreme Commander or Forged Alliance then move along, there really isn&apos;t anything to see here. If you&apos;re new to the Supreme Commander franchise then buy the gold edition of the original game that comes with the excellent Forged Alliance add-on pack. Again, SC2 does nothing at all that wasn&apos;t done much better in the original game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2932596">Expand</a></span>

I played, and enjoyed, the original Supreme Commander and the Forged Alliance standalone expansion pack. That was how I was introduced to the series. That is how I know it, that is how I love it. And I still have yet to really master it.
<br>
<br>When I first saw SC2, I was rather interested. I thought it was going to be a proper sequel, like now Forged Alliance was, only bigger. I played the demo, and my hopes fell a bit. Instead of the drain-based economy that really made the first game (Lumping SC and FA in together here) unique, it had the much more typical cost-based system, where it only costs &apos;x&apos; to make something. I can look beyond that, and I played more of it.
<br>
<br>I saw the planes not landing or having fuel. I can deal with that.
<br>I saw the 1-tier factory. I could kinda deal with that (If only because it offers some defensive options built-in).
<br>I saw the scale of the units. Was kinda bleh about it, but I kept going on.
<br>
<br>I saw the Fatboy 2. I thought it was going to be somewhat interesting. It wasn&apos;t all that special (And lacked AA.. Which, if you&apos;re making a supposedly improved version, why take that out? Just from a logic perspective..).
<br>
<br>Then I went and actually got it and played through the campaign. First thing people who played the first game (With or without mods) probably would notice that is off, even without seeing the horribly scrunched scale, is the unit cap. In the previous game, the cap went up to 1000 easily, 2000+ with mods. In this, it was about 250, I think maybe 500 max.
<br>
<br>I had a bit of fun with the fully upgraded tanks. I could accept the research tree thing for upgrading units (Even on the spot). I could accept the feel of it a bit.
<br>I liked the fact that Cybrans can have all sea units walk on land.
<br>I adored the unit cannon. And still do.
<br>I like the idea of transporting sea units. It works.
<br>I liked some of the ideas for the experimentals (The teleporter thing, the UEF Galactic Colossus, a Czar that is a bit more awesome).
<br>
<br>The fact that experimentals can be mass-produced without a massive Mass/Energy complex (In this case, a good number of powergens and energy-&gt;mass converters) and can be readily stopped by the basic defensive structures? I&apos;m sorry, but no. You cannot, feasibly, march two or three Universal Colossi onto a decently-defended base and win like you could with the Galactic Colossi in the previous game.
<br>
<br>I sorely miss setting up a queue with a group of engineers and seeing them all work together on a structure.
<br>The maps that they brought back from the previous games just make the scale changes more obvious.
<br>It&apos;s a lot harder to tell where the map boundaries are when zoomed out all the way (And I kinda liked how, in the original, it looked like you were actually looking over a map of the battlefield rather than the battlefield itself).
<br>There are no SCUs anymore.
<br>The nukes feel a bit underwhelming (And there are no strategic missile submarines).
<br>The concept of experimental units is, I feel, tossed around lightheartedly. Some of the earlier experimental units are on the same scale as the units you can make in a normal factory.. And, in a lot of cases, are only slightly more effective.
<br>
<br>In the original, if someone were to be able to send experimentals somewhere repeatedly as soon as you destroyed one, then you were way too far behind the times. In this, there is a mission in the campaign where that kinda happens with the Aeon flying saucer experimental.. And especially so with the UEF experimental gunship. The latter of which being taken down easily enough by a few AA guns behind shields.
<br>
<br>You can&apos;t build add-ons to your commander like you could in the first game (Cybran ACU chest microwave laser, anyone?), and any expansion you make, factory-wise, is too easy to get fully set up, production-wise.
<br>
<br>At this point, this review is just a bullet-point ramble.. But, overall, if you are looking for a Supreme Commander game, play the original and Forged Alliance. If you&apos;re looking for a half-decent scifi strategy game, either get this or one of the Starcraft games. This, to me, feels like just more of the same. Especially when compared to the original Supreme Commander.
<br>
<br>There are some good ideas in here, and interesting expansions on things from the first game (the Cybran navy being a prime example). But it, in my eyes, simply does not live up to its name. You can&apos;t get the same kind of epic battles that you could in the original, and the units don&apos;t feel all that diverse.. If only because of the lack of variety in terms of what you have available.
<br>
<br>If you want to play a good sequel with the initials SC2, go to Blizzard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3121944">Expand</a></span>

Judging this game OBJECTIVELY (which none of them seem to want to) yields the following facts: 1  The AI is vastly superior to starcraft&apos;s, not to mention fully customizable.  2  Alliances are set before match, so you won&apos;t have any idiot backstabbers at the end.  3  All AI and players can be grouped in any team, making teams complete with AI, players, or both.  4  The graphics are decent.  5 The campaign is pretty much a lengthy tutorial, but is not without it&apos;s merit.  BOTTOM LINE?  EXCELLENT GAME!  Lots of online fun to be had, and while lacking a battle.net style interface, there are plenty of players willing to make friends!  Give this game a try and you will love it if you love RTS, but if you are a fanboy of the first one?  Well, you probably already committed to hating this.  And the subsequent &lt; 4 score is probably already here.  Your loss.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1557155">Expand</a></span>

Both the Single player as well as some good online fun makes this a great game to play. like C&amp;C or StarCraft you are sure to like this game too. This weekend on Steam its up for $5, you really can&apos;t go wrong! and the DLC pack is good buy too :) Enjoy !</span>

The graphic system is amazing.I thought the camera in the first game was the best what is possible in the next years but now I am in the better know and ey look at the hardware condition they optimize it so well that the game is provided to much more people than the first game was provided... Myself had bougth the game a few weeks after release in europe but I could not realy play the game it sucked... Last year I &quot;excavate&quot; supreme commander and I could use the game on a high level and it became my favorite game , I bougth the addon and only played supreme commander for some month... ;) I hope the game will be such good lor much more better ;P like in my current view :) Greetings Thomas ps.my english is not the best but it&apos;s my 3rd language and I&apos;m more a mathematician.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746296">Expand</a></span>

But if you never played the 1st or expansion. this game is a decent RTS. However if your looking for a Sup Com game. Just play the 1st.</span>

                                        <span>Rating this a 0 because this broke with its predecessor Supreme Commander and its spiritual predecessor Total Annihilation in favor of dumbed down simplicity.  The storyline is laughable tripe but given other RTS&apos;s, that is not a huge flaw.  What is more fatal is the removal of the unique resource and tech model and large scale for something more in keeping with other RTS games.</span>

The game has changed dramatically since the first installment, and some would argue it is barely recognisable as a continuation of that series. However, it is still a worthwhile game in it&apos;s own right.<br><br>First of all, this is an RTS with a lot of units. I cannot emphasise &apos;a lot&apos;. The unit cap is 500, but with your army nearly constantly fighting on the front, by the time you build enough units to reach that cap you have pretty much already won. In 4v4 the action begins nearly instantly and never stops - with hundreds of air units, ground units, naval forces and artillery all entering the fray. This is war. One thing to consider is that the most recent patches have changed the economy system to be more like the original - making some of the complaints about the economy null. As I speak, my copy is re-installing to see the difference, but I can still say this is a good game, before or after the change.<br><br>Despite the fact this is a watered down version of the original, this is still enjoyable to all but the most die-hard SupCom fans. Some other reviews have nailed the bad points to this game, so for the sake of keeping it short, I won&apos;t reiterate. My advice? If you like an RTS with a lot of action, the biggest depth being what you send at your enemy, where and when, you cannot get much better than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1404295">Expand</a></span>

I think modern rts players and new generation gamers should really take some time to take in this classic remake of one of the best games to have ever been made. Also, modern rts games just might have to step it up big time.</span>

Judging SupCom2 based on its own merits, if you are not familiar with the old games, you will really enjoy SupCom2 and I highly recommend trying the demo out available on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746188">Expand</a></span>

Expect lots of whining from the purists over this. I miss those parts myself, but it&apos;s a game-changer, not a game-breaker, and it makes the game a lot more accessible. A lot more unit variation between factions now, which helps keep things interesting, imo. For what it&apos;s worth, the campaign storyline is more interesting than the original and FA (although the same can be said for Charlie Brown&apos;s teacher), but it&apos;s still rather sparse and nothing to write home about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746284">Expand</a></span>

A lot more variety than meets the eye, but you need to play a bit before you get a hang of the tactics, hardcore RTS fans may be a bit diappointed as the original was a lot more complicated and intricate, but where the complexity has been reduced the tactics have been sharpened. Its not the best RTS but its not too bad either, would have done a lot better for itself it had launched as a seperate game rather than a sequel.. Campaign is rubbish  but multiplayer is okay.

I mistakenly bought it hoping it was going to surpass or equal the original. What made it stand out from other RTS in the previous version is now gone here. This is a poorman&apos;s starcraft, why buy this game when SC2 obviously did the same thing but even better? The story is boring and so aren&apos;t the missions, it might have to do with the Japanese developer Square Enix, uninteresting characters and uninteresting cinematics. Lacked imagination. To get online to play requires being online all the time. It&apos;s annoying and frustrating, especially when I got the game on day 1 and couldn&apos;t even connect to the servers. Avoid this game like the plague and don&apos;t say I didn&apos;t warn you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1559717">Expand</a></span>
