A new King&apos;s Quest title could and should have revolutionized the adventure game as we know it. But instead it&apos;s turned out to be derivative, generic, formulaic and represents everything that&apos;s mediocre about the genre from the year 2000 onward. Firstly, the game has been shoehorned primarily onto consoles and it&apos;s scattered with Quick Time Events. Some people say &quot;Oh, but they are easy QTEs&quot;, and to that, I counter &quot;So why include them at all, when a cutscene movie would suffice?&quot; Seriously, whoever thought taking a retro game that&apos;s only ever been PC based and had PC fans, and heavily consolizing it needs to be fired. Clunky 3rd-person controls will never win over a point and click interface that creates many more opportunities to explore the game world. Stop trying to cater to every gamer out there and focus on the target PC fans that this franchise is intended for. It&apos;s a niche game!
<br>
<br>In A Knight to Remember, I felt that the game mechanics represented the worst of the two extremes commonly seen in bad adventure game design: Either the puzzles are overly simple because they&apos;re handed to you on account of all the important hotspot being the only ones you can interact with OR you&apos;re stuck wandering around aimlessly, through the confusing game world, trying to figure out what to do next. The graphics are awfully outdated and belong in the PS2 era. Another great shame, as KQ (except the 7th entry) has always been renown for it&apos;s pseudo-realistic, fairly tale look. The art style in the new game is cartoony and just doesn&apos;t look right.  When you can clearly count the number of polygonal lines edges on a &quot;circular&quot; pie tray that an NPC holds up, you know that the graphics could have been SO much better. I really didn&apos;t care for the art style at all.  I also despise the developer&apos;s attempts to redefine Graham&apos;s personality and character into a slapstick abomination. The tone and humor is really far off the mark and the writing also very average. I can&apos;t help but feel deeply dismayed and let down that this is what we got as the next KQ game, after a 17-year wait. Even those fan KQ remakes were infinitely more faithful to the series&apos;  tone, characterizations, and puzzles, the very things that this series is know for.  Sadly, this new KQ game strays so far from the established conventions, that it strips away any semblance of what made Sierra&apos;s adventure games unique. What we&apos;re left with is a product that looks vaguely like KQ on the surface, and only because it uses the character likenesses, names, locations etc. But under the hood it plays and handles like a watered-down LucasArts title and anything uniquely &quot;Sierra&quot; is long gone or has been trashed. It&apos;s almost as if the devs are giving a big &quot;Screw you&quot; to Sierra&apos;s established mechanics... even the ones that worked and would have translated well into a modern adventure game. The whole thing just feels completely and utterly wrong. This game could have been so much more. It could have forged a new path and been revolutionary in the genre, like nothing before it, and like KQ games of old. Activision certainly has the money to fund this. But instead, A Knight to Remember tries to play it safe and the adventure genre as a whole, and particularly long-time Sierra fans, are worse off as a result.
<br>
<br>It seems to be that people are rating this game highly because they know Activision hold all the Sierra IPs ransom, and unless they kiss Activision&apos;s ass and **** around the negatives, they&apos;ll never see any more Sierra games made. But if they turn out anything like this one, then I would suggest maybe that&apos;s for the best. People also seem to be lauding this game because it does things slightly better than a Telltale game. Well, let me just sau that if this is the new benchmark for what makes a good &quot;modern&quot; adventure title, then I can only facepalm, and say that we clearly have a long, long way to go. Well, the gloves are off. We need to hold Activision to a far, FAR higher standard than this. A barely passable game is not good enough, and if they want to dabble in the Sierra IPs, they&apos;ll need to do so much better than this.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a long-time King&apos;s Quest fan, skip this. Just stick to the originals, lest you enjoy having your childhood memroies insulted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-quest-chapter-1-a-knight-to-remember/user-reviews?user_review_id=5402149">Expand</a></span>

And I admit that I&apos;ve been very nervous about whether this new commercial entry could live up to the hype and my own expectations. I saw early previews and screenshots and wondered whether the art and gameplay style would feel right for a King&apos;s Quest game. And I cringed a bit at the launch price. My fears have all been proven wrong. The art style is perfect, and at times downright stunning. The gameplay, while somewhat linear initially, is as open and thought-provoking as I&apos;ve come to expect from the series. The voice acting is spot on. The puzzles are neither mindlessly easy nor are they walkthrough-required difficult. But most importantly, this game just FEELS right to me. It takes me back to how I felt the first time I played earlier games in the series, hoping to always figure out just one more thing before quitting for a bit, and then learning that there was another path I could have taken to solve a particular problem and wanting to experience that route for myself. There were a couple of engine oddities, and The Odd Gentlemen really needs to learn how to interact with their community, but the game itself? This is King&apos;s Quest, and I couldn&apos;t be happier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-quest-chapter-1-a-knight-to-remember/user-reviews?user_review_id=5401307">Expand</a></span>

I would rather play &quot;Mask of eternity&quot;, which was just a bit better than this 3D spectacle. As I approached the half way mark the chilling reality set in - the final nail has been blasted into Sierra&apos;s coffin. It&apos;s a tough pill to swallow but I think, in a way, I had already come to accept this when the rights passed on to a clueless company such as activision. The game appears to have been made for three year olds - I found peppers adventures in time more mentally stimulating. From Kings Quest 7 we saw that Disney like graphics and characters can work in a kings quest game, but only when the story, narrative and artistry are closely monitored to keep the heart and themes of the series in tact. Unfortunately this disgrace does not come close to capturing the great, redefining Sierra adventure games of old. RIP Sierra -  our only hope now is to turn to the fans for crowd funded remakes.
<br>
<br>The good:  The initial splash screen and main menu. It might also appeal to newcomers that don&apos;t have a clue about the original series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-quest-chapter-1-a-knight-to-remember/user-reviews?user_review_id=5431898">Expand</a></span>

I was eager for this title to release, and so far it&apos;s been quite a disappointment.
<br>
<br>The game is more of an homage to Kings Quest than an actual Kings Quest game. The controls are seriously dumbed down. There is no point and click interface, and most of the &quot;puzzles&quot; so far have been quick-time events. You can&apos;t look at the scenery for atmosphere, unless the game wants you to look at something. It is inexcusable for an adventure game to be so stuck on rails like this. The voice acting is great, but doesn&apos;t fit playing Grahm in first person hearing an old man narrate his actions. This may change later in the game.
<br>
<br>The environments are extremely bland, generic, and reuse art assets. However it&apos;s all done very well so that you won&apos;t notice unless you&apos;re looking for it.
<br>
<br>The episodic style release is also, frankly, an insult to the series. I would imagine it&apos;s only purpose was to disguise an early release and give the team more time to work on later episodes.
<br>
<br>The art, dialogue and music just drop the ball blatantly. The puzzles are shallow. This is a Kings Quest game by name only.
<br>
<br>Everything was built to the &quot;Odd Gentlemen&quot; theme ( steampunk-esque I guess ) instead of being built to Kings Quest. There is a distinct lack of color and vibrancy as were in the KQ games.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a good game mind you. But if you&apos;re looking for Kings Quest; Just play Kings Quest. I recommended against if you&apos;re a fan of the series. If you&apos;re looking for a generic adventure game, you&apos;ll enjoy yourself. However I would wait for a sale after all episodes are released.
<br>
<br>Book of Unwritten Tales is a far superior adventure game, in every single way imaginable.
<br>
<br>To the developers; Not everything needs to be dumbed down. Not everything must be spoon fed. Not everything needs quick-time events.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-quest-chapter-1-a-knight-to-remember/user-reviews?user_review_id=5402008">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Going into the new King&apos;sQuest, I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect. I wanted them to get it right, and that meant It needed to be CLEVER, it needed to be GOODHEARTED and it needed to be CHALLENGING.

<br>What KQ winds up being is almost impossible to review. Or, rather, I haven&apos;t digested it yet. Clever? Oh, it is so incredibly clever. Goodhearted? The game oozes with charm all over the place and makes you fall in love with it&apos;s world and characters. Is it challenging? no. Not in the least.  Does it live up to Kings Quest? ABSOLUTELY. But what&apos;s baffling is that this isn&apos;t JUST a King&apos;s Quest game. It also manages to attempt to be a sequel to The Princess Bride film, and manages to succeed on that level as well. It&apos;s astonishing. You will find nearly as many references to that movie as you will the original King&apos;s Quest game, including a PHENOMENAL appearance by Wallace Shawn enacting variants of some of his best scenes from the film.
<br>
<br>The first 30 minutes of the game filled me with disappointment, as the game essentially plays out as being a modern day dragons lair. I was all set to write the game off when all fo the sudden the world opens up to a size that is at LEAST the size of KQ1 and 2 put together. The first chapter alone lasts 5 hours, or so, which is about the time it would take you to play KQ1.
<br>
<br>I was blown away by how truthful to the series it is, allowing players to solve puzzles multiple ways and with multiple moralities. You WILL pick up items. you WILL have an inventory with 9 or 10 items in it at once. You WILL use those items to solve puzzles. And MAN does it feel like King&apos;s Quest. Some decisions will irk longtime fans. I, for one, do not like Chropher Lloyd&apos;s portrayal as King Graham. He sound nothing like the character I know. But the game is trying to take KQ into the 21st centry,and builds up Daventry to be not unlike the fairy tale world from Shrek. I like that decision and I like this game.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend it to everyone. Kids to adults.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-quest-chapter-1-a-knight-to-remember/user-reviews?user_review_id=5404258">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well this isn&apos;t so much of a &quot;reboot&quot; but it does tell the stories that are in-between the storylines that players of the original 7 games fans enjoyed. We will need to wait for all of the episodes to be released before deciding if the entire game is equally good or not.

<br>
<br>Pros: It&apos;s very much in the spirit of the original games. Like the original games, the humor is largely in the dialog and observation. Unlike the original games, very little references to fairy-tales.  The voice acting is top-notch and silly. No &quot;dead-end&quot; puzzles like the original games.
<br>
<br>Negs: Overuses the &quot;faceless NPC&quot; trope upgraded to all the characters wearing armor, which is actually disappointing since they all have dialog. A bit less QTE-ing and more puzzle solving would be nice. Artwork is a bit disappointing, while Graham looks good, the attempts to give it a &quot;Comic book&quot; gives some character faces more of a &quot;creepy&quot; look than cartoony.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-quest-chapter-1-a-knight-to-remember/user-reviews?user_review_id=5661468">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed playing it and consider other chapters. What does not work to me is that it&apos;s gameplay is not the same as the old games, by introducing ability check with quicktime events it is no more a game suitable for every gamer. My parents loved the old games but could not play the quicktime event parts so it became a title suitable for young audience, no more to anyone. And that&apos;s sad to me. I would have preferred a real old school point and click adventure suitable for all ages. Plus you still have tedious walk from one part to another wirh nothing to do and that&apos;s still 99 percent of gameplay time. THe puzzle parts are welcome. The quicktime event ruins the mood, such as the shooting bits</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-quest-chapter-1-a-knight-to-remember/user-reviews?user_review_id=5830793">Expand</a></span>

The production value is top notch, and having Christopher Lloyd and Wallace Shawn just seals the deal. Gameplay is slower paced but controls excellently and there are not only multiple narrative paths, but multiple solutions to many puzzles. A fantastic first chapter, coming from someone who grew up on the originals. Also, to the people who give &quot;zero&quot; for a score, you know that&apos;s dumb, right? Like, zero means it doesn&apos;t exist. You can hate a game but no one is gonna take a zero seriously. A zero would be you bought the game and it was just a post it note saying &quot;you win&quot;. I guess you must feel very edgy with your big round red number. But admit it, that&apos;s not an opinion. That&apos;s just dumb.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-quest-chapter-1-a-knight-to-remember/user-reviews?user_review_id=6880511">Expand</a></span>
