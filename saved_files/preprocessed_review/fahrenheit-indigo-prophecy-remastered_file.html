<br>The plot was interesting in the beginning but it gets weird and boring after about 2 hours. It was like a hollywood movie in the beginning, then it turns to a bollywood one.
<br>Combine following 4 things and imagine the plot. Crime thriller, exoticism , Matrix(movie)/Wuxia(Chinese fantasy people can fly and shoot projectiles) and Mayan mythology.
<br>Just stay away from this game unless you want to suffer.

<br>After playing both Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls (and thoroughly enjoying them), I was really excited to play the game which started off this studio.
<br>You take on the role of 3 characters in this story and each one is truly interesting and enjoyful to play as. The voice acing for a 2005 game is very solid and the animations are also good for the time.
<br>The story of the game can get a bit rocky at some points, but it is somewhat entertaining to follow, although not at captive as the other games mentioned earlier (which shouldn&apos;t really be a comparison). Towards the end it can get very confusing and you really have to pay attention to understand what&apos;s going on. Overall it is presented well and is well spaced throughout the game.
<br>
<br>Now, gameplay wise, I wouldn&apos;t expect much out of this game. It is riddled with QTEs, which can be extremely painful in the second half of the game. I found myself yelling profanity at the screen more then once when I would fail and have to start the sequence again. Although, when finishing the QTEs, you do feel accomplished and very relieved.
<br>The puzzles can take a smart mind to figure them out, and you really need to pay attention to everything to solve them.
<br>I will admit, the gameplay does shine throughout some chapters where you have to participate in a game of basketball or boxing, which can be fun to play.
<br>
<br>Outside the story, the soundtrack is easily the best part of the game. Quantic Dream really did make this game sound beautiful, with loud intense music throughout the fighting scenes, or just the background music during the chapters. I found myself amused by some of the music in the game (in a good way) which helped enjoy that particular part.
<br>
<br>Overall, Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered is a good 7-8 hours of a big movie quality game. The presentation is great, with a solid story and amazing soundtrack, but you will find yourself getting annoyed and bored during the QTEs. Any fan of Heavy Rain or Beyond: Two Souls, should play this game, just to see the roots of cinematic story telling in video games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fahrenheit-indigo-prophecy-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=5060855">Expand</a></span>

I also remember the following years as it gained more and more status as a praised and novel creation. 2015 saw the release of a remastered HD version of the game. This finally gave enough reason to see what it was all about.
<br>
<br>I installed the game and two evenings later I had finished it. Maybe I was 10 years too late, but I had a hard time understanding how the original PC version gained an 85 Metacritic score.
<br>
<br>The story is poor, the characters harsh stereotypes and the gameplay nonexistent. Even the most favorable critiques will have you know that it is a flawed product: dated graphics, strange control scheme, dodgy camera angels. None of this seemed to matter because it was different, it brought something new to the table.
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t bother going to lengths about the weird Sims-like gameplay, where you&apos;d eat, drink and piss to keep your characters satisfied, or about the horrible dance-game controls of the action sequences. I was willing to see past all that, to see the story and to really immerse myself in the multitude of promised choices.
<br>
<br>First of all the story is bad. I&apos;m sorry to say, but the writing is of someone who has never even sat through a proper movie. The game suffers from nagging inconsistencies and in the third act the story almost completely disintegrates. It starts taking huge leaps at the expense of believability.
<br>
<br>After an admittedly exhilarating beginning comes the disappointing realization that your actions really don&apos;t affect anything substantial. The game can really only be played through the one way. The difference your choices make are cosmetic and limited. Branching storylines is not a concept this game utilizes at all.
<br>
<br>What your actions ultimately affect is the final ending of the game. But there&apos;s nothing new here. Meaningful multiple endings had been benchmarked already in 1995 with Chrono Trigger. And Fahrenheit gives you only three.
<br>
<br>So what was new and good here? That is a hard question to answer. My best guess is that the game was the first one to truly abandon any real gameplay and just let the person holding the controller feel like they&apos;re part of the story. And that this was enough to propel it to the status is now has.
<br>
<br>Fahrenheit hailed the coming of casual gaming on a whole new level. Today we accept that the story can take over an entire game. Or the act of climbing, for instance, can be handled with alternating movements of the thumb sticks. The gamers role has shifted towards something more like an &apos;active spectator&apos;, if you will.
<br>
<br>To me that&apos;s not enough. I&apos;ve had 100 times more immersible game-story experiences way before 2005. Half way through Fahrenheit I remember thinking to myself: &#x201C;Ok, I understand what they&apos;re going after here, but I might as well just watch the rest as a walkthrough on YouTube. It would save me some the frustration of there controls.&#x201D;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fahrenheit-indigo-prophecy-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4944526">Expand</a></span>

This remaster, isn&apos;t so much of a remaster when you consider the horribly dated graphics, wonky camera and bad controls. The story is even worse, the stereotypes keep on barking and the pace is boringly slow. Do a favor, and dont install this one.</span>

Back in 2005, spammed wall-to-wall QTE&apos;s were humorously deemed by some to be &quot;the future of immersive gaming&quot;. How wrong they were... Whilst remastering a 1990&apos;s game which simply doesn&apos;t work on modern OS&apos;s anymore is fine, if a Direct X9 game that&apos;s a mere 10 year&apos;s old needs &quot;remastering&quot; but ends up looking or playing little better, then it starts to smack of one of those &quot;cheap cash-in on the current re-release craze&quot; games.
<br>
<br>If your idea of a &quot;game&quot; is &quot;QTE&apos;s interspersed with gameplay&quot; (instead of gameplay interspersed with QTE&apos;s) and childish games of &quot;simon says&quot; every time you pick up or move an object, then you&apos;ll probably love this... As another reviewer here said, the controls are so hideous that if you wanted to simply play it for the plot, you&apos;re better off just watching a Youtube walkthrough...
<br>
<br>Score : 1 for the plot &amp; music, -9 for the abysmal QTE&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fahrenheit-indigo-prophecy-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4948607">Expand</a></span>

<br>In this interactive drama you take control over Lucas Kane, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles. In some kind of trance Lucas Kane stabs a man to death in the restroom of Doc&#x2019;s Diner.
<br>
<br>The game starts the game with a &#x201C;tutorial&#x201D; of you playing as Lucas Kane when he&#x2019;s trying to hide the body. In this tutorial you will learn the controls and a little bit about the many options the game has to offer. How you escape and do things is all up to you.
<br>
<br>During the game you have to make some big choices as Lucas, Carla or Tyler. Sometimes Lucas has visions (If you do the quick-time events correctly) of future events. This could already help you make choices. An example is a cop visiting your house the day after the Doc&#x2019;s Diner murder. This vision will show you the places the cop visits so you can remove the evidence.
<br>
<br>While Carla and Tyler investigate the murder, Lucas is trying to find out why he killed the man. The story gets a twist when Lucas develops unnatural powers and escapes from the police using those powers.
<br>
<br>The story continues about these powers and at some point Lucas meets &#x201C;The Oracle&#x201D; himself leading to a very epic fighting scene.
<br>
<br>I sadly can&#x2019;t tell too much in this review, because it&#x2019;s much better to play it yourself.
<br>
<br>Opinion
<br>First of all i&#x2019;m not a big fan of unnatural superpowers unless it&#x2019;s a super hero game/movie like Spiderman or Superman. Eventhough this game includes unnatural powers I still think the story of this game is very good. Not only the story but also the creepy atmosphere the game has gives you chills sometimes.
<br>
<br>The controls of the game can be hard in the beginning, but you will get use to it.
<br>
<br>Remastered
<br>A nice feature in this remastered edition is the option to switch between new and olf assets. By pressing the &#x201C;F9&#x2033; button you can see what it used to look like back in 2005 and switch it back to the 2015 remastered version.
<br>
<br>Other improvements that I have tested are ofcourse the widescreen support and controller support. Back in 2005 it was hard to play Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy with a controller (If you could play one with a controller at all) and because there were almost no widescreen monitors it was normal to not support widescreen.
<br>
<br>If you already own the original game and are completely fine with playing it on a non-widescreen monitor I shouldn&#x2019;t recommend this remaster. On the other hand this upgrade of assets, upscale to widescreen and ofcourse controller support is only 9&#x20AC;.
<br>
<br>JosWeb Score (0/100):
<br>This game scores a big 80 out of 100.
<br>I really would recommend this game to everyone who loves a game with a good story, creepy atmosphere and easy to learn controls. This game is not a shooter or a big action game, but a really good interactive movie so it might not be a game for everyone.
<br>
<br>To qoute Tyler: &#x201C;Go buy yourself a videogame.&#x201D;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fahrenheit-indigo-prophecy-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=5043998">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Este juego es una espectacularidad videojugabilistico, rayos que forma tan interesante de mezclar quick time events, con acci&#xF3;n y aventura grafica, una historia intrigante de principio a fin, alien&#xED;genas, grupos secretos, asesinatos. m&#xFA;sica genial, muy recomendado para que los ni&#xF1;os ratas aprendan de lo que realmente es un videojuego</span>
