<br>
<br>It&apos;s true that game sometimes got a problems with a gameplay and story elements, and unfortunately they happen in episode 1 most often which can turn off some players, but everything gets better and better and when i reached ending of episode 3 i was sitting with my jaw open with only one thing coming to my mind  amazing !
<br>
<br>*Very small spoiler ahead*
<br>
<br>Both main characters are very well written and voice acted and i will keep remember them as i do remember for example Lee Everett from The Walking Dead  they are that good.However side characters are just so so,they are interesting but too often game miss an opportunity to give them a bit more depth which makes them a bit forgettable.
<br>
<br>Both graphic and soundtrack is amazing.Art style is nice and it&apos;s keep consistency all the time and i really like how this game looks.For soundtrack just do your self a pleasure and search for &quot;Life or Death&quot; on youtube  it&apos;s gets even better then that !.Last 15min of episode 3 are very strong and emotional, and one of the reasons for that is the soundtrack and voice acting.
<br>
<br>Cognition is one of these games i always wanted to play, and i wish more peoples give it a try (there is a demo version).If you are here looking for a great game and you don&apos;t care how popular it is then give Cognition a try, it&apos;s worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller-episode-3---the-oracle/user-reviews?user_review_id=3188320">Expand</a></span>
