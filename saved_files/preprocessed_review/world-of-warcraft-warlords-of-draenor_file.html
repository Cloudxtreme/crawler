They took so much from people with certain professions like no more smelting for mining no more sockets for blacksmiths, giving everyone the ability to mine in a garrison is crazy? Why even have mining and herbing if everyone can do it in there garrisons, the list goes on and on its crazy how much they take out of this game hell every time I take a break from this game I come back to so much confusion and anger at what was gone. Yes I know they do some stuff right but here lately they seem to do more wrong. Hell one of my favorite parts of the game was taking high lvl characters and trying to solo old raid bosses when I wasn&apos;t raiding just to see who I could solo and try different things to down a boss thought impossible with one player, not in Warlords of Draenor hell want to kill raid bosses in 25 man heroic ICC ...... One shot, hell I can solo mists of pandaria stuff. This game is just the bane of my existence. I&apos;m such a fanboy of the game and defend it in so many ways but here lately that has ceased to happen. And one more thing I HATE DAILY&apos;s but you dont really miss something till its gone. I don&apos;t mind doing some of them I just don&apos;t like doing 20-30 a day welp thats gone. Now they have turned us .... your toon  into the daily quest giver. Hell they knew we hated dailys so much they just made us the quest giver, but instead with your followers this is retarded. I could go on and on all day but i&apos;m going to stop here............ I just wanted my wow fix but I guess i&apos;m going to be wowsick!!!  I&apos;m going to get my collectors edition moneys worth but I know I can&apos;t play this for the next year continuously.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4763879">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is the worst launch of an MMO in the at least past 5+ years. They&apos;re merging of the realms backfired terribly, and seriously I just dont get it, this was sooo predictable. These must be the most incompetent fools in modern gaming.
<br>
<br>To put aside the technical failure (which you shouldn&apos;t blink an eye to it anyway, it&apos;s a disgrace), the game is nothing spectacular or inovative in any way you look at it.
<br>
<br>Graphics -&gt; Still looks like crap compared to all other mmos.
<br>
<br>Gameplay -&gt; Nothing new here, except it&apos;s much more limited and forced than any other previous settings
<br>
<br>PvP -&gt; Take at look at ESO blizzard, that is a proper PvP not your garbage, heck even GW2 has epic PvP.
<br>
<br>Questing and Leveling -&gt; Shorter than ever! Now with the bonus objectives the exploration which was crap is now even worse! No optional quests, just cheap objectives yay! Whenever there is voice acting its a disgrace as we are all used to now, no lip sync no fully voiced quests..GG
<br>
<br>Endgame -&gt; Lets cut it even more, only 2 raids! And by the time we release those raids 95% of population will be 100 already with nothing to do anymore, because we added sooo much content right?
<br>
<br>Garrison -&gt; After pokemon battles, here comes a shameful version of travian. Yeah you heard it right, another **** minigame that is not worth a penny. Yet it&apos;s all made around it..

<br>Hell even Elder Scrolls Online added more content in their first 6-7 months than WOD is providing after 2 years of no content. 5 zones of WoW is approximately 1 zone of ESO..Only Cyrodiil is big as a whole eastern kingdoms, try to imagine that.

And if you were thinking the same thing, you are probably right, Warlords of Draenor is a disgrace to all gamers in general, as well as a disgrace to many WoW veterans like myself.

<br>And it&apos;s not about a game that is an improvement over Mists of Pandaria, but the fact that it&apos;s giving much less content than MOP.
<br>
<br>Much less content than other MMOs for a way higher price. Yeah that&apos;s right.</span>

As far as I can say after ~3 hours of gameplay, the environment team has done a great job of the new Draenor setting. The pacing of the story seems decent at the moment.
<br>
<br>On the downside, Blizzard has made yet another fiasco of its launch day. The servers are unstable, and the general latency at best of times is somewhere above 300 ms. Another issue would be actually getting to log into the game, as queue times on most of the servers vary between 20 minutes to 4+ hours depending on your luck. As I said earlier the garrison feature seems to be the most game-changing feature but fails to deliver, since the instancing server kicks anybody who dares enter the garrison zone. While it is promising judging by the preview, many players cannot experience the true experience behind WoD simply because the technical side suffers greatly. At the same time some poor decisions that make players have to &quot;stand in line&quot; to open a certain cage/loot a certain object/ etc  tend to prolong the time needed for completing a simple quest to nearly 10 minutes of random clicking.
<br>
<br>Story-wise the game does indeed own up, but ,again, certain bugs bring the general rating down. While some players may be luckier than others with these problems, most of us are left to the long wait queues, the frequent disconnects from the server, and the glitchy phasing of quest NPCs. Moreover the previous decision they made in regards to servers (to connect and merge some servers) has since become a hindrance since there is no room for everybody to play the game.
<br>
<br>In the end, the game falls flat on its face in an attempt to bring a better and more intriguing action to its players. At no extent is the game a bad one, but the sheer number of technical issues prevent it from getting a score higher  than 4 from me. Should these problems be fixed in the upcoming days, the game will move from being a big letdown to most fans, to maybe an experience as good as WotLK used to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4685552">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>3. total new dungeons: 6 - Blizzard is this a joke? It&apos;s not enough that you are making your heroic versions of dungeons same recycled **** you are also capable of doing 6 dungeons in 2 years?
<br>
<br>4. questing - look at other mmos, especially swtor and eso, wod questing is same as always.
<br>
<br>5. new character models - indeed they look more 2005 than previously 2003.
<br>
<br>6. graphics - again no improvements at all (seems like it will always look way behind others)
<br>
<br>7. forced garrison - yep sure everyone likes that. Lets put another minigame, pokemon battles werent enough, how about we have travian in our mmo?
<br>
<br>8. 60$ for this? There is more things being removed then being added.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4690749">Expand</a></span>

While the launch has been truly bad, game itself is much worse than just mediocre. This is a big step backwards. WoW series aren&apos;t the biggest rpg series in the world, and they for sure never got that RPG element in the game.</span>

Well, Blizzard has finally got most of it worked out and it&apos;s great to finally experience the expansion. Let&apos;s just say it&apos;s the best one they have done yet. Really terrific zones, excellent quests, back to the Warcraft roots. Even more so with the garrisons which are awesome and a lot of fun to spend time around. Only gripe would be the soundtrack can be annoying in some parts (login, frostfire ridge) but it picks up later. Blizzard even added 5 days free time for all of us who had to sit through the faulty launch. Looking past that though, I would recommend Warlords of Draenor highly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4678756">Expand</a></span>

<br>When you get past the technical difficulties you are greeted by another dumbing of a genre. WoD plays even more dumbed down than previous settings of Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria. World content is eaier, dungeons are easier, Quests are easier and even more linear. There isn&apos;t much improvement overall. And yes WoW needs hell of a lot improvements, other mmos are way better than this garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4693532">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Expansion shouldn&apos;t be more than 20$
<br>- There should be at least 3x more content
<br>- And there should be max 1 year between expansions
<br>
<br>Blizzard is failing all those 3 things, and on top of that they even released unplayable buggy game.</span>

As if Blizzard has control over a large scale DDoS attack (remember not even Microsoft or Sony could handle SMALLER attacks on their servers). Every person who was affected by the server outage feels like they were ripped off because they couldnt play for a couple days. They need to grow up. Truth be told this is the greatest WoW expansion since WOTLK. The innovation it brings into this already successful game make it as addictive as ever. Over time people will come to realize that and these negative reviews will be erased by a large ratio of positive:negative reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4700048">Expand</a></span>

<br>What are you guys talking about, WoD is so far the best and the most well polished expansion among WoW history. Those changes are so cool. There are even people who complaining about the graphic. WoW is a game designed for as many player as they can. Not everyone have the hardware to play high end graphic game. Personally I think Blizzard have tried their very best in designing the environment details.

<br>Guys, if you want to try this game, please do not look at those spammer&apos;s review, try it and you will understand what I mean.

One thing that I have learned over the years is the players of Blizzards games are the whiniest, **** group of people in any gaming community. It&apos;s ridiculous. They **** and complain on forums, facebook, trade chat, any place they can find and yet they continue to play the games and continue to **** I don&apos;t get it.

The  magical atmosphere, the  gorgeous music, the changes and additions of gameplay elements ( rare mobs - epic loot , and especially the awesome garrison ), streamlined and sweeping questing, the emphasis on lore elements, the amazing beautiful environments - all that makes for a truly incredible experience and certainly the best gaming experience wow has ever seen. It is so absolutely fun to play WOD that if there are some shortcomings, to make note of them would be like to make note of some fault of a plate on which a most delicious meal is served. Even the challenge bar went up a bit which is a very welcomed change.
<br>This is the best expansion to happen to wow and it is a mature, magical and absolutely fun game to play on it&apos;s own accord. I think MMO can not get any better than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4684175">Expand</a></span>

Sure, WoW has been doing this for 10 years now but you guys need to understand how servers and expectations work. The sheer amount of people logging in has exceeded their expectations which is why you are getting issues. They can only plan for so much but they have literally seen more players logging in than they have in a great while. The expansion has helped to renew the game some and time will tell by how much.
<br>
<br>With that said, I find the expansion to be enjoyable so far. I quit WoW when Siege of Orgrimmar came out. I just got burnt out and couldn&apos;t take the direction the game was going. I wasn&apos;t even planning on getting the expansion until my little brother talked me into it. I had to come to realize that this game lost its original hardcore nature and nothing Blizzard does, short of screwing over a lot of people, will change it. So yeah, I&apos;ve been disappointed with the stat squish, over simplification of talents, dungeons being shorter, and raids being too easy. Honestly, they increased stats too much when Burning Crusade came out but I did enjoy feeling like I was getting to the point of being a raid boss myself. But despite the changes and realizing it&apos;s still a fun game I have come to enjoy the new expansion so far.
<br>
<br>The zones look amazing. The character models while improved, didn&apos;t wow me too much, but it is nice seeing much better in-game cutscenes with the new models. The quests are standard fare but some of them are quite enjoyable. The enemies are varied and because of the stat squish they seem easier to kill which means less time when doing kill quests. I really like the Garrisons. It&apos;s nice having my own mini city where I don&apos;t have to deal with idiots in trade chat. However, I wish they weren&apos;t limited to Human and Orc styled buildings. They add another layer to the game which I find to be more enjoyable then farming or pet battles.
<br>
<br>Granted, there have been server issues, but in the entire time of me playing I have only disconnected once. My only issue so far is waiting for the queue to get in the game. I took a nap because I have work in a few hours and now it&apos;s taking forever to get back in. But despite that, I am hopeful for this expansion. It gives us a chance to explore some very rich and interesting lore while also creating something new. To the haters, look past the server issues and play the game. Reach 100 first and see what it&apos;s like before you come on here whining about the servers and giving the game a terrible score because you want attention. Most of us don&apos;t want to deal with whiny brats.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4685293">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Regardless of what you may think of Blizzard, that&apos;s pretty low. Normally I would give this game a 6 or 7, but I feel I have to give it a 10 just to help balance out the spiteful reviewers who hate a game on principle.
<br>
<br>That said, the game is... decent. Not as amazing as WotLK or TBC was, not at all. But even if I&apos;m Alliance(and therefore Blizzard&apos;s un-favorite), it&apos;s always nice to see a new setting. And the graphics are incomparably better than they were before, what with the character model upgrades. Also, there are quite a bit more in-game cutscenes, and I&apos;m at least glad that they&apos;re making a NEW story instead of just &quot;continuing Warcraft 3.&quot;
<br>
<br>But as with every expansion, it&apos;s basically more of the same. So if you didn&apos;t like WoW to begin with, you won&apos;t likely enjoy this. But if you&apos;re a fan of WoW, you will probably find this a bit better and more &quot;warcrafty&quot; than Mists of Pandaria.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4685940">Expand</a></span>

This is actually a breath of fresh air, the cinematics look outstanding, quests are fun, the zones look **** gorgeous, and I feel genuinely excited for the future of this expansion. Some people are complaining about the reduced amount of time to level, the very **** thing people were complaining about for expansions upon expansions. &quot;D00d dis gaym sux man u hav 2 do 2 many qwests, gg blizz, gggggggggggg exdee, exdee XDDD&quot;, I love it, there&apos;s not much of a grind, lots of areas to explore, a garrison to take care of, plethora of dailies coming our way, new exciting raids, difficult heroic dungeons, and so much more.

<br>I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d like Garrisons but it has proved to be one of the best &quot;extras&quot; that have been added. I would prefer that Garrisons were more difficult or complicated, but that hasn&apos;t stopped me from having fun with it.
<br>
<br>I also had some server stability problems on release day, but I expected that. After a few hours my server was stable.
<br>
<br>My characters don&apos;t feel as powerful with the changes to class abilities but so far, I would absolutely recommend this expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4685523">Expand</a></span>

The content is interesting, the story looks nice and the atmosphere is very beautiful. I think it is a good expansion because it might can bring players the old Vanilla atmosphere back.

<br>Regarding the game itself, I played over 10h until now and I can tell you it&apos;s going to be a huge expansion! the quests have very good flow into them and they are very enjoyable! Blizzard really nailed it this time, there is almost no more &quot;go kill this and that and come back&quot; quests, there&apos;s a lot of story line into them. Also they did a very good job on the environment, the new zones are amazing and it really feels more like the old days of warcraft.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4688385">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Please please please do your IQ a favor and COMPLETELY ignore every moron that is coming on here, less than a DAY after launch, to complain about a game that is by all accounts, the MOST SUCCESSFUL EXPANSION TO DATE.
<br>
<br>I have seen nothing but PRAISE while questing, EVERY SINGLE PERSON in General chat that has said ANYTHING about the game so far, has said that they REALLY ENJOY IT more than they could have ever expected.
<br>
<br>So what does that make the negative reviews on here? PURE B.S., TROLLS, and possibly HIRED BY OTHER MMOS TO TRY AND EXPLAIN AWAY THE TITAN THAT IS WOW. SORRY BUT YOU DON&apos;T GET THE CHANCE TO EXPLAIN QUALITY GAMES AWAY, because those of us who actually PLAY it will be here to utterly, and unequivocally, CRUSH your ignorance.
<br>
<br>This game is HIGH QUALITY from the second you step foot in Draenor, YOU WILL SEE IT FOR YOURSELF.
<br>
<br>THINK ABOUT IT, what other MMO in the world comes even REMOTELY close in terms of END-GAME CONTENT, let alone CONTENT at all? NONE! I&apos;ve played them all, NOT A SINGLE ONE comes even REMOTELY close, there is NOTHING out there. Save yourself the trouble of trying all the garbage that these trolls claim is so amazing, and just stick with the real deal, WoW is here to stay, get over it, and get with the program.
<br>
<br>PROS SO FAR:
<br>
<br>-Questing is actually diverse, varied &amp; not repetitive (this is a huge plus cause I hate questing)
<br>
<br>-Beautiful new zones (so far)
<br>
<br>-Music in this expansion is epic (so far)
<br>
<br>-Cut-scenes really put the story into perspective, and help introduce new content
<br>
<br>-Dungeons offer more flexibility of boss order, and are actually pretty varied &amp; fun (so far)
<br>
<br>-New updated graphics &amp; character models look great, but again I don&apos;t play this game for graphics, never have, but the detail &amp; the landscaping is probably the best I&apos;ve seen. Again not talking about POLYGON COUNT, just the layout in general feels very well done.
<br>
<br>I will update this list as I play more through the expansion, you can verify that I am indeed a real player, my character name is Winterlight and I play on server Kel&apos;Thuzad, unlike these fake negative reviews, I ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME.
<br>
<br>As far as the launch complaints go, what the hell did you expect from the most popular MMO on Earth? I&apos;m actually surprised we could do ANYTHING at all, considering how massively popular the launch was. Yes it was extremely laggy, but there were no bugs (unlike what some of these reviewers claim, I did not find any bugs at all, have not had any problems in questing thus far).
<br>
<br>For people who are stupid enough to think that the number one most popular MMO for 10 years in a row is somehow &quot;BAD&quot; or &quot;DYING,&quot; think about it logically, it makes no sense BY ANY METRIC WHATSOEVER. Do yourself a favor and ignore those people, and instead, PLAY the game, DECIDE FOR YOURSELF. IF ANYONE is BRAINLESS and a &quot;SHEEP&quot; it&apos;s the WoW haters, since it makes NO SENSE what they say regarding WoW &quot;DYING&quot; or that it&apos;s &quot;BAD,&quot; it simply is not true, at all, and never has been. So who is a &quot;SHEEP&quot; now? I think the answer is clear, if you take the time to think logically about it, you&apos;ll find that WoW is #1 for 10 years for a damn good reason, and it&apos;s not because of &quot;SHEEP&quot;.
<br>
<br>If anything the launch is an indication that WoW is here to stay, and will continue to be the number one most popular MMO by leaps and bounds, there is no contest here, WoW is ahead by millions and it will stay that way for a very long time.
<br>
<br>FOR THE ALLIANCE.
<br>
<br>FOR AZEROTH!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4687131">Expand</a></span>

Even hunters, which were in my opinion one class that still retained some semblent of a difference with respect to other classes is   gone down the drain. Crafting is gone. Basically, WoD is to Vanilla what D3 is to D2/1, garbage. Every single class plays more or less  the same. If you are looking for an RPG experience stay away from this game. Oh and don&apos;t get me started on Garrisons, it&apos;s just a time sink (like almost everything else), and nothing original. Many other titles have executed the housing/companion idea before and in a better way. The utter lack of creativity when it comes to the story was the cherry on the cake. Remember all those Orks from the past, well they are back, alternate time reality or lack of creativity....you decide.

What was once a monolith is now only revered by those that still sub, and while that may be a legions worth of numbers, it doesn&apos;t stop others that have lost their love for WoW (or never held it) from seeing just how dated this horse is.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, the graphics updates are a waste of resources.  They&apos;re taking a game from 2004 and making it look like a game from 2008!
<br>
<br>This expansion will only be enjoyed by the legion of fans that have rusted themselves into WoW&apos;s coding.  It won&apos;t be missed by anyone else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4885765">Expand</a></span>

The good reviews to this expansion make absolutely no sense. Less effort went into it than a facebook game, in fact some of it&apos;s key features are less involved than the vast majority of facebook games (garrison missions, naval yard). The entire expansion revolves around farming - the same stuff, the same zones, the same chores, day in and day out. The only redeeming part of this expansion is the third raid isn&apos;t half bad, yet Rift provides better end game raiding - so why bother? Depth has been all but streamlined out of the game. Very little is unique to your toon now, gameplay is insanely linear for an MMO though it&apos;s well hidden (you realize it around your first alt you gear up, there&apos;s really only one route to end game). Community has become toxic at best, frighteningly combative might be more accurate. Servers are turning into ghost towns as the subs cancel, raid groups need constant refreshing, then regearing due to play abandonment, PVP is beyond a laughable joke. I suggest this: look at the forums. There&apos;s VERY few players left defending this expansion and a lot of really really angry long time players. These positive reviews are a joke. The playerbase is further angered by the fact they hiked the cost of this expansion while delivering less and lower quality content. I guess the first play-threw of the story wasn&apos;t awful, but there&apos;s WAAAAAAY better stories, for cheaper, that have nicer graphics, less toxic players, more replay value....really an advantage over every aspect of WoD. Save yourself the time and hunt for a new MMO</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5385385">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But then I started to PvP (Player versus Player), because that&apos;s what I&apos;m mostly interested in, and oh god... There is imbalance everywhere! There&apos;s no matchmaking in unrated PvP although there are: Abysmal gear differences? Check. Number of heal differences? Check. Class combination differences? Check. Premade group differences? (10 people playing coordinated with TeamSpeak against 10 random people) Check. Buffing/nerfing the wrong classes? Check. Skill differences? Check.
<br>
<br>PvP is still very fun at its core, but it&apos;s just uber frustrating to loose match after match while your skill, tactic and teamwork means nothing due to an superior enemy team. What&apos;s even worse is that the developers are ignoring the community feedback entirely and there has been no new PvP content except Ashran (which mostly sucks anyway) for ages.
<br>
<br>Nope. Just nope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5230003">Expand</a></span>

(And i thought pandaria was bad) All the complexity that this game was known for, has been ruined by the year.. Each year blizzard charges you $60 for an expansion that its supposed to make the game better(and this isn&apos;t counting the $15 per month for the subscription) when in the end they just laugh at you in the back counting all the money that they&apos;re gathering from all the players that are constantly hoping for a good mmo game. The characters look more &quot;pretty&quot; and  cartoony obviously to target the younger generation to buy the game. Game mechanics are also EXTREMELY more simplified for people who just started playing the game.. Theres no flying in the zone where this expansion takes place also, which Blizzard says &quot;World of Warcraft is full of memorable moments that are only possible when players explore the world by ground. And as we&#x2019;ve continued to develop content over the years, we&#x2019;ve focused more and more on providing players with these kinds of experiences&quot; But what about the other expansions? shouldn&apos;t players also experience the same thing for the other zones? anyone can reach level 60 within a few hrs if they really wanted to and they&apos;ll skip through all &quot;those kinds of experiences&quot; I can go on and on about the pvp system to the loot system in raids and spells that were taking away and how the servers randomly kick you offline etc.. All in all this game is a waste of precious time and money, all the grind that used to be fun with friends has turned in to nothing but a big disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5369965">Expand</a></span>

That said, this expansion is entirely void of content, two raid tiers...the end. 6.1 added selfies, 6.2 added a zone that was delayed that adds nothing to the game. PvP is in one of it&apos;s worst states since I began playing in beta, raiding heroic/mythic is good, but there is such a small amount of content it&apos;s hard to enjoy it. Classes have degraded since the beginning of the expansion, they have become less fun with less to do and Blizzard seems in the weeds in a way I haven&apos;t seen before.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t have the feeling that I&apos;m waiting for a fix, or for more content. I have the feeling for the first time in a decade that they have no idea what to do or how to fix this. They are clueless, they have almost completely stopped listening to the community, they broke a lot of promises made for this expansions and all we&apos;re left with is a broken world filled with no content, no social interaction, a dead PvP scene and forced content to get a lucky roll for the best PvP gear in the game in a zone no one likes. It&apos;s just bad, it&apos;s poor quality and it shouldn&apos;t be accepted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5363147">Expand</a></span>

By far the worst expansion at end-game, but at least there was a lot of good questing and leveling content (for the first time).
<br>
<br>- Leveling/Quest Content to 100: 9/10. The best it&apos;s ever been, actually! It was really good and there was maybe one zone I disliked, as opposed to 90% of them in previous expansions.
<br>
<br>- Dungeon Content: 1/10. Disappointing as all hell. The dungeons are mostly forgettable, there&apos;s a meager 8 (7 new, 1 revamp) at launch (none coming in 6.2, probably none for the expansion), and they&apos;ve pretty much chosen to abandon keeping Dungeon relevancy through the expansion. It&apos;s very sad.
<br>
<br>- Low-level Dungeon Content: 9/10. Despite the 90-100 dungeon experience blowing terribly, low-level dungeon experiences have been vastly improved! annoying dungeons like Razorfen and Blackfathom Deeps have been greatly enhanced to be a bit less &quot;where the hell do I go?&quot; and having bosses listed on the side. Optional bosses also grant gold and experience, while doing all the main bosses listed awards a massive experience (and money) boost! You can even power-level your friends from 1-80 in a matter of hours with this! However, WoD is all about 90-100 content, so this wasn&apos;t included.
<br>
<br>- Garrisons: 2/10. Extremely exciting (due to being new) when you first see them, but incredibly disappointing when you realize it boils down to a Facebook minigame. Menus, menus, menus. How dull.
<br>
<br>- Raid Content: 6/10. It&apos;s really good, believe it or not, but extremely repetitive (more than ever before due to the 4 difficulties). Highmaul was fun the first time, but got incredibly stale for most players (myself included) because it only has 6 bosses. Blackrock Foundry is also really good, but it too got old at having 10 (and devaluing Highmaul to irrelevancy). Most of the encounters are good though!
<br>
<br>- &quot;Stuff to do&quot; at max level: 0/10. WoW right now is &quot;Raid, PvP, or die!&quot;, as there&apos;s nothing to do outside of PvP or raiding. You will be incredibly bored at max level, though this should be sliiiightly compensated for in 6.2 (for people who don&apos;t raid).
<br>
<br>- Overall score: 3/10. Very disappointing for an expansion that was waaaaaaaay overhyped. It costs $10 more than previous expansions, has significantly less content than them (including no new race or class, the first time an expansion has done this), and didn&apos;t add anything particularly amazing like other expansions have, unless you count &quot;omg pretty models and graphics!&quot; as something &quot;amazing&quot;, but I don&apos;t. I&apos;m not the kind of player to give a crap about graphics over gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5291505">Expand</a></span>

The moment I hit max level I came to the conclusion that the game evolved in nothing more then a sparkly Facebook game. Professions got destroyed beyond repair which pretty much negate the point of being out in the world farming mats and turned in to daily cooldown you have to hit everyday to get anywhere. The legendary quest is simply farm X items in raid till your eyes bleed.
<br>If there are other games out there that can make a good balance between farming and questing for your &quot;legendary weapon&quot; combining it with awesome lore why cant blizzard find this medium.
<br>
<br>The release again was not pretty, couple that with the fact they bottle necked the whole leveling system with the new garrisons caused a lot of grief. This was the first expansion where I actually took a 2-3 day break because the game was completely unplayable and when I finally started leveling the world was near empty already. (max levelers where all in their garrison already)
<br>I gave up lfr raiding after I went through the first raid for a total of 4-5 times the environment felled dull and uninspiring the people where not even the problem.
<br>
<br>And then the drama started on top of everything (flying debacle, lack of engaging content, bland mounts in game vs the whole store mount issue).
<br>I simply came to the conclusion that the way blizzard is now developing their game is simply not for me anymore.
<br>I however will keep an eye out for the next expansion to see if they change again (blizzard is kinda known for going either one extreme or an other). But right now they lost me as a trusted customer (always pre-ordered CE editions in good faith, and bought things of the store because I was satisfied with the amount of good stuff they also put in game.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5387336">Expand</a></span>

They literally ran out of ideas, so you know what they came up with to occupy players&apos; time? Flying. Wow. That&apos;s it. Flying. You have to spend an entire month at least just grinding, exploring, and doing useless dailies in order to fly. Other than that, there is nothing to do anymore.</span>

<br>
<br>Wow failed to deliver on all promises. Also, Blizzard transitioned their forums to Twitter. That&apos;s right.. Twitter. So, rather than reporting issues on their very own forums...... you report them to the Twitter Dev account. Players and MVP&apos;s came out of the woodwork to complain about this irrational decision, but Blizzard showed no care. Furthermore, Blizzard lacked any communication with the pvp community for the first 3 and a half month before Lord responded. However, it was a once sentence response then complete silence.
<br>
<br>This game is literally hollow (not even kidding about that) and it feels like an early alpha staged game that offers decent MS. It feels less complete than the beginning of WOTLK. Blizzard said they had a staff of 100+ people working on WOD, but it did not seem that way. In comparison FFXIV had a third of that workforce and they came out with a great game and continue to create far better content, ideas, raids, the list goes on.
<br>
<br>WOD is a waste of time and money and I highly recommend you to NOT play this game at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6283969">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The garrison was a great idea and giving people access to other professions was great, but they also made professions feel nearly worthless. The changes in itemization (Yay no hit or expertise) and class functions were certainly interesting and expected.
<br>
<br>However, this expansion just did not deliver. They tried to justify the removal of flying and gave us crappy jumping puzzles. This is an mmorpg, not a platformer. They messed around with Ashran to the point where it wasn&apos;t really fun to go do since the rewards weren&apos;t there unless you really wanted that pvp set. I was hoping when they tacked an extra $20 on to the price of the expansion that there would be something worthwhile.
<br>
<br>After completing everything up to the end of 6.2 HFC, I must say it was not worth it. I often find myself logging only to do garrison chores and raids. Other than that I find other mmorpg&apos;s or games in general that have the story and immersion that this expansion so greatly lacks. Even at the end of HFC everyone seems to forget how the expansion started as it was all glossed over with a few lines of happy feelings.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sorry, Blizzard, but your players deserved better. In one year we have gone through three raids and lost three million players. Stop blaming players for not having your vision when it is the lack of immersion, inspiration, and story that have for so long drawn players to this game.
<br>
<br>The one good thing I guess I can say is that the artwork and graphical content of this expansion was done very well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5358913">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>10 million constant subscribers is what wow gained after the release of WoD, and for the good reasons too. But then all those people thought to themselves, alright, that was a hecka of a good expansion to play around in for 3 weeks, and left to play some other games while hoping blizzard makes an expansion similar to TBC, where not everything is handed you on a plate.
<br>
<br>You can even buy GAMETIME throught 3 days of farming your garrison. Even though that&apos;s a good way to not pay for wow at all, it just proves how easy it is to earn gold in this game, it&apos;s doesn&apos;t bring the fun and the challenge you had back in the old days of WoW, and let&apos;s face it, it probably never will.
<br>
<br>This is an average expansion which will keep the subscriber number from falling even lower, unlike MoP which was utter **** and even though it added some voice acting and a few more new raids it really didn&apos;t do anything to interesting to make this a good, or even a decent expansion. It&apos;s just average.
<br>
<br>Should you buy it?
<br>
<br>If you plan to buy all your game time from in game money, then why the hell not. But this late in the expansions lifetime, you won&apos;t even find anyone to play with, so I&apos;d rather suggest just waiting for the next expansion like all of the other old timers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5372912">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_5661642"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Been a rabid WoW fan since the launch of BC, even tho I joined the *ehem* &quot;recommended for best experience&quot; servers that were desolate for Horde and swarming with Alliance and generally got the absolute worst experience possible, but none of that ever took away from the sheer epic that was BC. Personally, I vote that BC be inducted into some form of &quot;hall of fame for oustanding video game design&quot;. Everything was perfect. The atmosphere, the music, the characters; it was all flawless, polished, and took me to mind-blowing locales and experiences that became the standard for MMO&apos;s to this day. How many times has a new MMO boasted itself as being &quot;the WoW killer&quot; only to copy WoW verbatim, go F2P, then die? It&apos;s a testament to the legend of WoW....or, what it once was.
<br>
<br>Bliz gave the community a dark simulacrum of what we were demanding; BC servers. Instead, we get a dumb, dumb, dumbed down xpac full of half-hearted references to what we loved. Now, WoW is a long chain of &quot;kill 30 orcs, now go here and kill 30 ogres&quot; for the first quarter of the xpac, you fight 2 things. IT&apos;S THE SAME DAMN QUEST FOR THE FIRST 4HRS! Enemies, allies, bosses, all as generic as anime pop illustrated by a 10 yr old girl with cat ears and melon-sized eyeballs. I went thru a run of the raids and literally every boss had the identical, Lenny-esque mentality whos dialogue is.....wait for it.....&quot;SMASH.&quot;.......&quot;CRUSH.&quot; Where is the epic tale of Illidan Stormrage; the tale of a young, victimized, misunderstood elf man that was corrupted by his desire to be a hero? Where is the intricately woven tale of his conflict with his brother who over-shadowed him, lived all of his dreams, and was forced to be the one to capture him? Where did all this glorious storytelling prowess go, Bliz?
<br>
<br>The raids themselves were nothing note-worthy. Remember earning the honor of joining a raid; the most difficult content reserved for the elite? A beautiful, lore-immersing, fascinating sub world? Gone. Raids are now really big dungeons with no mechanics and forgettable, generic orcs who all have the same dialogue &quot;[name], I HAVE FAILED YOU!&quot;  &quot;BURN!&quot; &quot;DIE!&quot; and everyone&apos;s favorite: &quot;WE ARE THE TRUE HORDE!&quot; Horde, Fel Horde, and now Iron Horde. What&apos;s next, Plastic Horde? THEY ARE THE TRUE HORDE!
<br>
<br>If you hit the cap and don&apos;t raid, there is one last option: PvP....and it is WORSE than EVER. DK&apos;s swarm everything like locusts. Join a dungeon: tank and 2 dps are all DK&apos;s. Join a BG: 5+ DK&apos;s guaranteed. Everytime. It&apos;s pretty much druid cat, retadin, DK, (and sometimes hunters) or bust. Why these 3? All of them can perma-stunlock you, kill you before it wears off, and heal themselves TO FULL repeatedly. REPEATEDLY. This really p**** me off as a shadow priest, especially since shapriests absolutely SUCK right now with no damage, poor healing, laughable defensive abilities, and no dps cd&apos;s. Shapriest guide: dot, dot, invis, disperse, explode. Full conquest gear and I can do 60k crits from time to time. A dk can pull me, cc lock for about 20 (!!!) seconds, all while smashing me with 100k crits, back to back to back relentlessly, heal himself to full in 2 sec, silence me for 6, make himself immune to magic for 5 and on and on and on. DK&apos;s are arguably the most brain dead &quot;balancing&quot; I&apos;ve seen since LoL.
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s just the classes. What really makes PvP infuriating is how you cannot compete. You join any kind of PvP trying to get gear, but you are about 4 tiers behind everyone else, so you are completely defenseless to all these other players that have spent MONTHS grinding out their gear, and now have nothing better to do than join bg&apos;s full of no-geared fodder to spam taunt emotes on.  Bliz seriously needs to address this. If I fight anyone in equal gear, I can pretty much beat anyone, but when I have 285k hp and fight a DK with 440k, it&apos;s not fair. It&apos;s not fun. I&apos;m not even playing. I&apos;m watching a bad film about a poor, helpless elf man that&apos;s being beaten cripple by ANOTHER human DK. &quot;Most one sided fist fights caught on film&quot;....a perfect illustration of gearing in PvP.
<br>
<br>The biggest issue of getting geared in PvP is it takes sooooo loooooong in this purgatory of the inferiority complex, that by the time you are FINALLY geared and you can FINALLY compete, you&apos;re burnt out! You don&apos;t care anymore! It&apos;s not fun anymore! And now that you have the best gear, you torment the people trying to get gear, now? Or level a new toon from level 1-100 to repeat the process?
<br>
<br>I never feel like I&apos;m &quot;playing&quot; WoW. I always - instead - feel WoW is playing me; that I&apos;m grinding things out and not enjoying it because I&apos;m always so far behind and it takes AGES of boring grinding to FINALLY get to play. The world becoming increasingly generic and dumbed down doesn&apos;t help at all, nor the toxic, anti-social community that forces you to listen to their gutter-talk incantation for hours cuz comunikashun izzo emportant1!1oneone
<br>
<br>Subs are dropping like flies, and I&apos;m one of &apos;em. Bye WoW.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5661642">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>PvP is also very grind-y. dungeons are cool, they are certainly better than MoP dungeons. But raids are not that fun actually. The idea of Garrosh creating an alternative timeline doesn&apos;t offer much in terms of lore and story telling. It felt like Blizzard has run out of ideas and is just recycling old stuff, and they confirmed that with timewalking dungeons.
<br>
<br>It strikes me as very strange that after all those years WoW&apos;s graphics is still pretty much the same cartoonish clumsy look. The music is great as always

<br>The over-all feel of the game now is very stale and boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6227798">Expand</a></span>

The questing experience in Draenor is by far the best questing experience in this game to date.
<br>
<br>However, after you&apos;re done questing, you&apos;re sort of left wanting more twiddling your thumbs with nothing to do.
<br>
<br>Garrisons - These were a decent idea but I think they over exaggerated how much people cared about them. No one from my old guild was nearly as excited about these as they clearly were. Not only that, but Garrisons feel like a mobile app game.
<br>
<br>Some of the buildings have ridiculous requirements for upgrading to Level 3, such as earning exalted reputation with almost every reputation on Draenor so you can unlock a building that gives you a 20% reputation bonus on Draenor... what?
<br>
<br>Raiding - I honestly feel like they had a decent difficulty gap in MoP. LFR was easy enough but adequately hard that if you AFKd, you could die. Flex mode was easy enough but you could still die if you kept making silly mistakes. Heroics were from my opinion at a decent spot.
<br>
<br>Raiding in WoD doesn&apos;t make any sense what so ever. LFR has been turned into an actual tourist mode where dying is nearly impossible. They gutted most of the fight mechanics, made them do almost no damage and fights are now literal loot pinatas.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s even worse when people go from LFR in Draenor to Normals because the jump in difficulty is absolutely asinine. Normals require people in 635 gear to be on their best performance or you won&apos;t make enrage timers and making simple mistakes will wipe your raid. Normals were supposed to be the next evolutionary step up from LFR, not a huge freaking leap in difficulty.
<br>
<br>Casters - Why? Just why? They absolutely obliterated a lot of spellcasters in this expansion. They removed a lot of abilities that made casters feel like casters and gave Mages abilities like &quot;Comet Storm&quot; or &quot;Prismatic Crystal&quot;. The Crystal is awkward, clunky, a pain in the ass to place and just hope.. just hope your tank isn&apos;t kiting the boss or your talent is wasted. Not that it matters, it only lasts a few seconds anyways.
<br>
<br>Warlocks, Ele Shamans and Mages were in such a horrendous state at the beginning of the expansion, high guilds simply weren&apos;t taking them.
<br>
<br>PvP - This expansion was supposed to &quot;fix&quot; PvP. Feral Druids can still out heal some healers, some melee can still CC chain and burn down others but now, since they&apos;ve made caster CC breakable so easy, it&apos;s incredibly tough to keep melee off of you.
<br>
<br>Aside from casters and PvP, this expansion feels entirely rushed out to meet a deadline. Every single expansion, we&apos;re getting less and less content under the guise of &quot;future patches&quot; or &quot;exciting content&quot; that&apos;s coming our way.
<br>
<br>Flying - I&apos;m honestly neutral to the point on flying that I&apos;ve never cared either way. However, they added insult to injury by promoting a $25 mount and saying it was &quot;ready to fly&quot;. The Grinning Reaver was advertised as something you could take to the skies.
<br>
<br>Dev Communication - Forget communication, they&apos;re all obsessed with Twitter now. They rarely post to class forums or the general forums. It&apos;s probably a good thing you can&apos;t downvote them when they do post because some of these devs are delusional or so out of touch with what made this game as big as it is.
<br>
<br>Save your money and wait to see if 6.1 brings anything worth buying into.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, WoW&apos;s budget has been cut and now everyone&apos;s just being milked so they can fund projects like Overwatch. I mean, Bobby Kotick&apos;s $60 million salary isn&apos;t going to make itself. Blizzard has fallen from the Gods of gaming to yet another corporate money grab soul sucker.
<br>
<br>I honestly hope they never make Warcraft 4. After seeing what they&apos;ve done to WoW and what they did to Diablo 3.. please.. Blizzard.. PLEASE, do not touch Warcraft 4. Let other companies take over your franchises from now on, please.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4849776">Expand</a></span>

Here I am, almost 2 months of play time into the expansion, and I&apos;ve decided to cancel my subscription.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s the problem - this expansion would probably be a great singleplayer game, but as an MMO, it&apos;s underwhelming.  Once you do your quests, it&apos;s over, that&apos;s it.  Hang out in your garrison all day in trade chat and wait for your dungeons/LFR to pop.
<br>
<br>They totally trashed professions, which removed my desire to level any alts.  There is little-to-no appreciable daily content to speak of, which is a bit of a blessing and a curse, but mostly a curse, IMO, because there&apos;s nothing to do.  They took out Justice/Valor Points, so no steady gear progression, it&apos;s all RNG.  Garrisons were a neat idea but overall pretty underwhelming.
<br>
<br>And the bugs, oh lord, the bugs.  To me, this expansion really throws off some bad signals with the bugs, and the fact that there&apos;s a whole zone that&apos;s been closed off since launch.  I hope I&apos;m wrong, but the signal I&apos;m getting is that Blizzard released an unfinished product, which is very much not like them to do.  If this is a sign of things to come, I may have to turn in my Blizzard fanboy membership card.
<br>
<br>I might resubscribe later after a content patch or two, provided they add some actual content to the game, but I guess I&apos;ll have to wait an see.  In the meantime, they won&apos;t be getting my subscription dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4874098">Expand</a></span>

However the class balance is worse then ever. I started playing one month after release and by looking at the disparities between classes this feels like alpha.

<br>What could have been one of the best expansions so far with a bit more work and without their simplification crap turns out to definitely be the worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4863274">Expand</a></span>
