<br>
<br>Weapons:bullet lead and time delay make landing shots at range feel rewarding while advancing over no mans land slightly easier.
<br>Uniforms/weapons/maps researched and based on historic information is great, the items look great and realistic. Been to enough re-enactments to handle dated items that look worse then the game ones.
<br>Weapons tend to be well balanced, they have their draw backs such as the MG08/15 being the best MG but slowest moving and only firing when deployed. Makes it a fearsome weapon in a strongpoint but easy prey to a grenade or mortar.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is rather brutal and harsh to new players, but the community is mostly positive and supportive, both ingame and on the Steam forums. You can also accesss a wide range of guides published by players which can help guide people on the game and answer questions.
<br>
<br>Devs are engaged with the community, there&apos;s only 3 Devs but they do have a number of volunteers and freelancers to help develop and keep an eye on things, yet they still manage to join in on the forums and are often in game and (May 2015) are streaming on Twitch. Great to see Devs in the community.
<br>
<br>Content, currently based on the Western front during the trench combat it can get a bit samey, however I feel after 650 hours that finding good players to play with and agaist in different squads make a huge difference and help keep things changing, still taking a while to get used to the recent MP-18 changes. You also have new content added (see roadmap) lately a new early/late war map where it&apos;s more mobile with less defined trenches is a different gameplay to Flanders or Picaride.
<br>
<br>If you are still unsure or have questions ask on the Steam forums and see the new Broadcasts there :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=5238408">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is a little rough around the edges, but you have to forgive small indie devs without their multi-million funds.
<br>What it lacks in polish, gets made up with the gameplay.

There are reviews complaining about &quot;Technical issues&quot;, but I have never once had a technical issue in Verdun, and I have almost 90 hours in it. Not a single crash, noticeable framerate drop or other error. So, disregard those.
<br>
<br>Verdun is a shining example of a realistic, team-based shooter done RIGHT. Fun gunplay, beautiful maps and a very replayable gameplay style. The maps are well balanced, every gun feels like you&apos;re handling an actual 1900&apos;s era firearm as opposed to a super soaker (The guns have weight, they sound meaty and they do a TON of damage. rifles will rip through opponents and almost always kill them in one hit).
<br>
<br>Gameplay: Verdun is a squad-based trench warfare PTSD em-up. You take control of a random bloke in the middle of famous WWI battlefields. Oddly enough, the battle of Verdun isn&apos;t in Verdun.. You and your squad must take turns defending your trench from waves of opponents, and then charging their trench to take it over. The game is extremely accurate in this regard; charges &quot;over the top&quot; through no man&apos;s land generally consist of a slow push through a vertical hellstorm of bullets, with men dropping like flies left and right. While charging, you actually feel the desperation and will to survive that would&apos;ve run through a soldier back at the time. As a defender, it&apos;s your job to shut these attackers down. You will be grenaded, hit by gas, hit by mortars, hit by snipers, hit by Machine Guns, you will be attacked in nearly every conceivable way. But, you MUST stop the enemy from getting to your trench. If an enemy Officer gets into your trench, his entire squad can spawn on him should they fall in battle. This is how most charges are won.
<br>
<br>Verdun&apos;s gameplay is best summed up as a back and forth bloodbath, with rifles and MGs cracking off from each trench as desperate men fight for honor and country. If you buy ANY multiplayer game this year, buy Verdun. You will be entertained for HOURS. It&apos;s easy to get into, hard to master and VERY, VERY fun.
<br>
<br>Squads: Each squad has 4 players. Each squad has 4 roles, and there are 3 different types of squads. One all-rounded squad featuring a light machine gunner, a rifleman (capable of using telescopic scopes to work as a sniper OR a bayonet to clear trenches), a grenadier and the non-commissioned officer or NCO. The NCO&apos;s ability in this squad is a mortar strike. The NCO can mark a specific area, and that general area will be struck by 3 mortar shells around 10 seconds after the ability is activated. This is VERY useful in eliminating well-dug in machine gunners and snipers, as well as infantry in your trench. Friendly fire does not work with the mortar. The second type of squad is an assault squad, consisting of a melee specialist who can carry grenades, a flanker, a NCO capable of using rifles right off the bat and a recon soldier. The ability for this squad is a Recon plane, which will mark all players in that sector of the map (no man&apos;s land, trenches etc) on the minimap. The minimap NEVER shows enemy players unless they have been marked by a plane. Only recon planes can mark players on the map. The third squad is identical to the second, except they have poison gas as their ability. Poison gas CAN kill, but everyone is equipped with a gas mask, so its lethality is diminished a bit. It&apos;s best used as a smokescreen for attacking infantry or to cause chaos in a trench.The NCO can order his men to guard/attack certain points by holding Q and pressing left click by default, or call in their squad ability with Q+Right Click.
<br>There&apos;s also a progression system in the form of levelups. You gain some XP from kills, but most of your XP will be gained by defending or charging. You will NOT be able to level up if you just camp in your trench all day. Every level up, you&apos;re rewarded with the ability to choose one preset loadout to unlock. Each class has 3 available loadouts (the British heavy gunner for example can choose from a rifle and a pistol, a light machine gun with plenty of ammo or a rifle with a small amount of ammo and a light machine gun with a decent amount of ammo), and there are 4 classes per squad. One person per class.
<br>
<br>tl;dr: A beautifully executed, historically accurate WWI trench shooter with awesome, replayable gameplay that will keep you coming back for another game. NOTHING is as satisfying as charging your opponent&apos;s trench, hopping into a blaze of gunfire and bayoneting a bunch of enemy troops, or firing your Lewis gun from the hip as angry Germans pour into your trench. Buy this game if you have ANY respect for gaming as a medium, as Verdun is nothing short of art. A 3 man dev team managed to beat out EVERY single triple A multiplayer game, and that is nothing short of legendary. Please, for me, buy Verdun. With that said, I&apos;ll see you on the battlefield!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=5399300">Expand</a></span>

Although it is in beta, and is made by a small group of developers, this is some of the finest WWI shooting i have ever experienced. It has a hardcore, similar playstyle to that of red orchestra/rising storm/insurgency to it in the sense that its generally one-hit realistic kills, explosions and trench war-fare. All players are actually on one server, and it divides each player into squads in which you fight together and level-up in. It&apos;s quite a neat and intuitive system built for playing together as a squad, and not a lot of empty server issues as new lower budget fps tend to have. I would definitely pick this game up even in beta if you are a fan of realism/WWI/trench warefare/history or the like. I have only played a couple of hours and im already hooked.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=3609338">Expand</a></span>

Now, it&apos;s not a game for everyone to get into. The game can be really frustrating as many times you will die from something you didn&apos;t see. It takes patience to play, but put enough time in and you will see the gem that this game is. It is a semi-tactical (it is slightly more arcade feeling than games like Red Orchestra) first person shooter based on the infamous battle of Verdun during World War I. As of 6/18/14, the only available Entente country is France (as they fought in Verdun), and the only available Central Powers country is Germany (for the same reason). There are other playable countries on the way. Verdun is currently being developed by three people, three. This means there will not be constant updates and bugs that seem easy to fix will take time, maybe weeks or months. But the developers have seemed loyal to the game and don&apos;t seem like they will abandon it. Negatively, there are optimization issues with the game. My PC can run Battlefield 4 on ultra at 60 fps, but this game barely seems to hit that mark. It looks good, but not that good. They have released an optimization patch, and hopefully they will do another in the future as the first was focused on making the game playable for lower end PCs. The game also has a very, very small following. As a completely multiplayer game this is  a serious concern. While I have never had an issue finding a full game, it is generally filled with very experienced players, which makes the game very difficult to learn for new players. There is no voice input, which can also hurt new players ability to learn the game, as well as coordinate attacks. But, Verdun is a game that does what it sets out to do: create a World War I shooter that feels genuine. While nothing could ever truly recreate the horror that many men had to experience during the Great War (and we don&apos;t want to experience that), Verdun gives its best shot at it and comes dang close, while still making it an enjoyable experience. But Verdun also comes with a warning, do not come looking to dominate the game, do not come to see fancy graphics, come to experience a truly remarkable shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=4283302">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But for a beta, it&apos;s amazing! Completely different experience from COD. The trench battles are intense and team-based gameplay is ESSENTIAL to victory. This is already the best WW1 FPS experience I&apos;ve ever played,  and it&apos;s getting better all the time. It has great ideas, a small but dedicated (and lovely) playerbase, and I could not recommend this more. Yes, it has flaws, but it&apos;s a goddamn beta! If it&apos;s this good now, I can&apos;t wait for the finished version.

I got fps issues in the game after some update despite the fact that the graphics look horrible. The graphics are just horrenderously bad as if my graphics card is throwing up, the character design looks depressing and the animations are terrible and make you laugh out. The sound effects are mediocore, the map design looks bland and uninspired. The game is utterly generic and the playerbase is laughably tiny. I know it&apos;s still in beta but i&apos;m pretty sure that almost nothing will change in the future, it will even get worse.

<br>
<br>Without it, the game is some repetitive &quot;King of The Hill&quot; sort of game. Nothing too much wrong with that, so far. Add that with the fact that PING comes into a decisive part of the game; unbalanced sides favoring the Entente Power; useless german weaponry; one-shot kill Entente rifles NEVER MISSING; lack of variety in strategy; no tutorial to familiarize with the game; dirty gas mask lenses; teamwork always lacking and, most of all, taking 5 Lurger bullets to kill a single soldier, makes this game just plain frustrating and stressing, quite the opposite of what it&apos;s intended to.
<br>
<br>I see no reason to buy this game. If you would want to buy it, nevertheless, please, WATCH the GAMEPLAY BEFORE DOING SO!
<br>
<br>As a thumb rule : If buying a FPS game, double check it before. It could spare you a lot of frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=4526667">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really wanted to like this game but after about 9 hours over a few sessions of trying I gave up.
<br>A lot of people are still drinking the kool-aid, but given a few more hours they should wake up.
<br>
<br>The game must not be optimized at all, and, or they made very poor choices for core engine structure when they put this thing together.
<br>
<br>The biggest problem is the glitchy/out-of-syncness that you experience in this game, regardless of your ping or graphics settings, etc.
<br>It is as if the game only has a few preset canned animations that are forced into what ever action you are doing.
<br>
<br>An example that you&apos;ll endure repeat over again is when your fighting head to head with someone.
<br>You might see four frames of animation at best.  Someone will shoot and someone will die with out much of an indication why.  No muzzle flash, nothing..
<br>Then other times you are fighting on the edges of a tench and you are shot at while your enemy is pointing up in the air.
<br>Any sense of being there, of immersion, is lost  most of the time.
<br>
<br>And then the balance and a lot of the game design choices are horrible.
<br>Apparently when you level up you gain an almost god-like edge.
<br>You&apos;ll see people with mid to high levels all the time with ridiculous kill to death ratios of 50/1 etc.
<br>And then a sniper hits you half way across the map for no apparent reason.
<br>Okay if you have some ridiculous mechanics like this in the game then at least separate the battles into ranges/classes or automatically adjust somehow.
<br>Reminds of the idiom: &quot;bring a knife to a gunfight&quot;
<br>Although what I could have been seeing were aimbots or some other hacks, which again would be even more sadder meaning no anti-cheat system.
<br>
<br>Then there are four (as I recall before I  uninstalled) base classes/roles that are uninspiring and pretty pointless.
<br>One example is the default &quot;commander&quot; class.  You start with a pistol and binoculars.
<br>First off all this pretty much relegates you to be a trench fighter only, and then you can&apos;t do anything really meaningful with the binoculars.   You can direct your squad to attack, which is unrewarded and everyone ignores anyhow, or you can direct a mortar attack that does nothing and all so ignored.
<br>
<br>At least the idea of a WW1 style trench battle is unique. And that&apos;s all you do, fight in a handful of tench maps over and over.
<br>
<br>This game feels like a poor alpha state concept game.
<br>Maybe in a year or so (if there is still anyone around in it) it might be okay..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=5245068">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Its also extremely beginner unfriendly.  It is really difficult to tell whos on your team or not - from what I coudl gather, experienced players would just shoot at anyone in the general direction of where they expected the enemy to be - which means you pretty much had to memorize the map.  Either that or they were cheating.  You&apos;ll also be killed pretty quickly.  My experience was I typically had about 5-10 seconds before being shot.  A few times I was even killed on spawn.
<br>
<br>Bottom line, there are much better FPS out there, don&apos;t waste your cash here</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=5320592">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you&apos;re looking for a WWI version of CoD or Battlefield, forget it. This game requires some patience and understanding that you&apos;re not going to get shot 10 times before you die. One bullet = death, very much like Insurgency. There&apos;s a bit of a learning curve to the game, but give it a couple of hours and you&apos;ll have the confidence to take on the Squad Leader role.

<br>It&apos;s not a perfect game, but it&apos;s damned entertaining and for anyone who is looking for a game that is as much a military simulation as it is a game, you&apos;ll enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=5242106">Expand</a></span>

<br>That&apos;s besides the point, in the past few years all they&apos;ve done is add new content, when this base game still feels like an alpha.  The graphics are pure piss, the gun sounds sound like they&apos;re recorded from a drum set, but nothing compares to express how horrible the controls are... They aren&apos;t &quot;realistic&quot; they&apos;re just clunky and broken.
<br>
<br>So why do people love this embarrassment of a game?  Same reason I play it: it&apos;s the only ww1 game on the market.  Once an actual good trench warfare ww1 game comes out this game will poof from existence.  They seemed to have dodged the very large bullet that is battlefield 1 since bf1 isn&apos;t about trench combat, thus this game probably has another 2 years left in its life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6753954">Expand</a></span>

Its the &quot;Spirit of the Bayonet &quot; You either get it or you dont.
<br>
<br>Without a doubt one of my all time favorite games. The Devs actually play the game and are very responsive to questions on the steam forum. The community, overall, is very supportive and helpful . Dont be fooled by the 36 player maps. You respawn continuously in &quot;waves&quot; to continue the assault or bolster the defense. 36 can seem like a hundred as waves are moved down or defenses overrun.
<br>
<br>Verdun rewards tenacity. It has a steep learning curve- thats for sure. But there has been few games that have given me the sense of relief of solid defense, sting of defeat or &quot;F yeah !&quot; in victory like Verdun does.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=5419498">Expand</a></span>

I think in that respect it succeeds brilliantly. This is trench warfare as it really must have been:
<br>
<br>- waiting around for the enemy, and then getting shot in the head from somewhere you never saw coming.
<br>- going &quot;over the top&quot; of the trench on command of your squad leader, and getting mowed down almost instantly.
<br>- Capturing an area, only to be hammered with chemical gasses
<br>- putting on your gas mask, obstructing your visibility so you can hardly see where (or who) you are shooting.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is brutal and unforgiving, but hey, this is war! I love how the game doesn&apos;t make it &quot;arcady&quot; or easy. This makes it all the more rewarding when you get to kill someone.
<br>
<br>The graphics and lighting are really nice too, being nice and muddy in the trenches, but has a good selection of more colorfull maps as well.
<br>
<br>If you are not afraid of a challenge, I recommend it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6476141">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll admit that FPS isn&apos;t exactly my favourite genre, but I can certainly get into a good one, and have done in the past.
<br>
<br>Firstly I think this game looks great - I do have SLI GTX 970, so tend not to suffer too much from frame rate issues or anything else, but the textures, graphics and lighting all look pretty good to me.
<br>
<br>The control layout is simple, and makes a change from most modern shooting games in that you only have some basic commands, you don&apos;t have to hold down three keys to send your medic to go and order some more bandages or whatever you seem to be required to do now, it&apos;s much more like the early Medal of Honour serious, run, crouch, shoot, reload. So should be easy to pick up for the casual user.
<br>
<br>The downside? It&apos;s either not very popular, or the server matching system leaves a lot to be desired. It&apos;s clearly a game that is going to attract enthusiasts of WWI, and whatever server I seemed to join there were always one or two players on each team who would be repeatedly killing the other 8 players on the other team. When one player has a K:D of 30, and everyone else is 0.2 then it doesn&apos;t make for a particularly enjoyable experience.
<br>
<br>Basically, it&apos;s not in any way &apos;NOOB friendly&apos; - lots of games arent, of course, but this especially so. Basically, if you haven&apos;t already got it, or if you don&apos;t already spend most of your time playing FPS, you aren&apos;t going to enjoy this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/verdun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6106244">Expand</a></span>
