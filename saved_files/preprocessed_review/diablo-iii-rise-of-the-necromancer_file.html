So is it good? Well.....
<br>
<br>The Necromancer itself is good, it plays fine, it works fine, and it&apos;s fun and all, however, the rest of the pack itself is a major problem with this. If you&apos;ve played Diablo 2 it&apos;s pretty similar to the old Necromancer who summons a crap ton of minions to help him fight.
<br>
<br>The pack mostly contains useless cosmetics(Banner items, a pair of wings, and a pennant), an extremely useless non-combat pet that doesn&apos;t help you in the game whatsoever. The only two worthwhile things in the pack that aren&apos;t The Necromancer itself are the stash tabs, and the two character slots. There&apos;s not even any new playable quests with this pack. It&apos;s more of a pack that pretty much says: &quot;Here&apos;s the necromancer.........okay bye!&quot;
<br>
<br>However, that being all the pack has to offer, I feel as if 15 dollars is WAY too much of an asking price, especially when most of the content in the pack(Excluding the necromancer, stash tabs/character slots) does nothing to impact or enhance your gaming experience in anyway shape or form. It&apos;s more just to go: LOOK HOW COOL THIS STUFF IS?
<br>
<br>Do I recommend the pack? It&apos;s a half and half. If you have 15 dollars on hand, and really want to play The necromancer then i&apos;d go for it, as the necromancer is the reason itself to even buy the damn thing. If you aren&apos;t really interested in the necromancer, and are more cautious about buying the pack, i&apos;d wait until it&apos;s on sale honestly. You don&apos;t even need to buy the pack to play the new maps, as the new in game maps are free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-rise-of-the-necromancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7384609">Expand</a></span>

As has been noted by critics and users alike, the pricing is questionable. If we&apos;re keeping track, D3 was released at $60, RoS at $40, and RotN at $15. So, $115 for, what seems to me, content worth half the price. The price point alone was enough to cure me of my almost two-decade (probably 5-10 years too long) devotion to Blizzard (D1/2, WoW, Warcraft, and SC1/2). I refuse to buy EA games for the same reasons.. I wish I&apos;d waited until the RoS price drop to buy D3, but my sweet wife knew how much I enjoy Diablo and got it as a birthday present.
<br>
<br>As to the expansion content itself, I played a friend&apos;s account and certainly enjoyed the class. I appreciated the nod to D2--the necro was an easy choice of first character for me. I was, however, shocked at its omission from D3. The vanity items and extra slots would probably be useful. But, again, my recurring thought was &quot;$15...for this?&quot; If you&apos;re literally wiping your behind with $100 bills, sure, buy the DLC. If not, give Path of Exile a shot, or check out the Steam sale. Or go outside. Lord knows my pasty skin needs it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-rise-of-the-necromancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7388527">Expand</a></span>

Seriously: looking there, reaper is the only expansion and ultimate evil is the other big release, and since on top of it path of exile just released a way bigger update that was just listed as a huge patch and did not got a new entry on this site, i think callling this patch anything other than a paid patch would be just weird)... well anyway, this patch is a decent(if overpriced) update by itself: The new class is okay, resembles the old necro from D2 enough to give that nostalgia, yet still fits in the D3 roster. The nice gameplay that D3 always had is still here, so its not a bad experience
<br>
<br>...At least for the first hours, that is...
<br>And thats where the low score is coming from. The patch does include good stuff, but does nothing to help with the old problem that plagued the game since launch, specifically: The nill end-game
<br>It is caused largely by the terrible itemization on the game. They did removed much of the cancerous overpowered BS sets that plagued the game after reaper release, but many core problems persist: Because every piece of gear is too generic and even the legends and sets are really just rares with a single fixed affix, the old, overly simplistic rule of just picking the current meta set and try to get a limited number of affixes on every piece of gear and stack them as much as rng allows you to is still there. Its still a game where each piece of gear is only there because of a single affix and most of the text attached to each piece is just there for stat stick purposes. That also lead to the problem that builds still tend to be very rigid: That leg/set is listed on the build because a specific affix that cant be found anywhere else and thus, have no replacements. And OFC, because all other affixes are from a random generic pool, any slot that dont feature a specific thing can be filled with wathever for the exact same results
<br>Another problem is that this is a late game about grinding that dont give you ANY control over your grind. They removed trades between players and the AH but did not made any way to direct your drops or give some sort of consistency on your reward for your time played, save for some specific rewards that are aquired on key points in the story. The game leaves you completely at the mercy of the RNG to find most of your gear and thus, progressing the character after some point is completely out of your control. You cant trade the loot for currency and use it to get the upgrade like we did in the gold AH and we do in path of exile, you cant farm the currency then trade your way to the upgrade like we did in D2 with keys/torches/forge and grush services, heck you cant even pick a spot where the item you are loooking for is more likely to drop and use the rest as bonus like in marvel heroes. All you can do is pick the most efficient(on the most generic possible way) place and pray really hard. And yup, just keep rolling the dice and hoping for something that migh never come gets boring quite fast...
<br>
<br>At the end, this is a patch that offers a lot for the early and mid game, but the end game is still barren. Even weirder: they included a gem that removes level requirement and can make the early game a fast breeeze, so they clearly want to make a game focused on late game, but are making zero progress in making that part engaging... it just feels they are clueless(also, why they just dont give the option to just jump to level 60 if you have another char of that class on that level instead of making that joke of a gem is beyond me)
<br>The best thing i can say is that now the ranked system for the faster clearer on the ladder features a fixed map, so now you can actually prepare and that easy-map-farming BS is no more(who da fu* was the brainiac that though that making a race where the map is re-roled at each attempt for a time was a good idea anyway???) so now that rank may actually mean something
<br>
<br>And yeah... charging money for a patch that does nothing to fix problems from the stone age is just bull. Even more when the patch is just... well... a patch, and not a major one at that(the gaming industry is getting a bit too happy at charging extra for new characters it seems...) It only makes the game even sadder and bring back that feeling that maybe its time to just let poor Dibs rest in reace with the dignity he still have left, or hire a less RNG-paranoid team if you plan to make another sequel</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-rise-of-the-necromancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7478465">Expand</a></span>

<br>That being said, the Necromancer is hands down the best character class in the game in my eyes in terms of share user control. The Necro is a very active character that requires smart positioning and resource management, which is refreshing compared to the one-click win variations of all other classes.

If you enjoy curses, blood leeching, armies of the dead, bone spear, and so on, then you&apos;ll love the combinations of the Necromancer.

Diablo 3 has been out for 5 years, so it&apos;s not going to break the mold of its core design, and that core design is not for everyone. If you enjoy D3, this expansion will thrill you. If you hate D3, then no expansion is right for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-rise-of-the-necromancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7404086">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is nothing like Diablo 1 or 2.  It pre-built just to farm, no more magic find items and the items drops are ridicules.  Used be to an amazing feeling finding a legendary or set items now they drop like files.  1 Act I think I got 7 Legionaries.  This game is boring and its really build for just boring kill farm one act to the other.

It completely blew away any and all expectations and its obvious that Blizzard gets better and better with what they roll out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-rise-of-the-necromancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7388074">Expand</a></span>

The Necromancer pack is rather lowly priced. The new character class at hand (gotta congratulate the developper Blizzard for 7!!! completely different playable character classes) itself is really great, well-balanced, wholly assembled and a radical addition to the already stimulating character lore already established by Diablo I and further expanded in Diablo II.
<br>
<br>With all the updates &amp; fully patched, Diablo III has become even better now 5 years since the official highly acclaimed launch which sparkled positive critical reviews. With abundantly favorable fan service and loads of addicts to play with, it is an engrossing hack&apos;n&apos;slash &apos;n&apos; looting experience with slick &apos;n&apos; crisp graphics, intuitive menus, rivettingly switchable variations of skills,attributes, level 70+ paragon skills for your powerful heroes that can be amassed &amp; playability out of this planet. Haven&apos;t encountered or experienced a more addictive game since Diablo I and II (gotta love all Diabloes).
<br>
<br>All these low scores by players are false &amp; meaningless, considering the single-player Campaign portion alone on which the main game is built-on. It has lots of variety, dungeon-hacking with other players is a constant breeze. Play this game! It&apos;s worth it!
<br>
<br>Still rifting, questing &amp; looting. Heads &apos;n&apos; tails above the competition like PoE which is too stiffing and glares in the graphics dep, and Torchlight which is pretty straightforward as-is.
<br>
<br>If they agree on developping Diablo 4, this would be hard to beat.

The Necro pack was well worth the small investment for the many hours it returns back. I would speculate that many of the over-the-top negative comments are by those that really don&apos;t know how to get the most out of this game or haven&apos;t even played much at all. Or perhaps there other factors for their negativity beyond this game itself.... who knows.
<br>
<br>It is a nuanced game if you go beyond just copying other players build and experiment more yourself. I started the Necro in Beta and watched that evolve and get tweaked while trying to figure out builds from scratch. It was engaging enough during those many hours to purchase the pack once it became available.
<br>
<br>They also expanded with new maps in the 5 regions, and increased stash and character slots which were a big plus when you are running all of the characters in regular, seasonal and Hardcore.
<br>In the future, I would like to see more campaign additions, and continue adding more map options in Rifts and Grifts.
<br>
<br>Another option for players is to switch between solo pushes and teaming up... switch characters and build, try HC...  as your going along... i.e. do different things.
<br>
<br>Anyway... if you can look beyond all the extreme negativity presented here or elsewhere, you may find many hours of entertainment playing D3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-rise-of-the-necromancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7570010">Expand</a></span>
