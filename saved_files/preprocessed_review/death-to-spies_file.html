I like the idea, and concept but the game itself is broken. A six would just be for the story-line and armory, nothing else. The A.I. is horrified! You can be seen with a disguise from the other side of the map! The detail of maps, and characters is laughable. This feels more like a beta stage demo than a full game. It at least deserves a weekend rent or the playable demo, but for you who are looking for a game to play just when you are incredibly bored, then this is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/death-to-spies/user-reviews?user_review_id=410890">Expand</a></span>

And you can bring principal weapons only if they are german, so when you ever used english weapons like the Springfield &apos;03? And there are only the MP 40 and the K 98 you can bring without being uncovered!<br>And there is NO story, only a mission after the other! And nobody tell you who you are, why you are fighting... Nothing!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/death-to-spies/user-reviews?user_review_id=2277910">Expand</a></span>

For one I had an issue about the controls where the buttons would change at random (left becomes forward, right becomes backwards, etc,) now I&apos;m not running it game on low spec computer, I have a good gaming PC (can play The Elder Scrolls : Skyrim and Fallout 3 with ever little lag).  Another issue is that I keep running into invisible walls that shouldn&apos;t be there, like the door ways of the room where the objectives are.  I don&apos;t know if you guys have the same problem I have or not but I think the game has a lot of room for improvement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/death-to-spies/user-reviews?user_review_id=4561037">Expand</a></span>

Enemies will respond accordingly to mostly all of your actions on the field but I recommend stealthing this game fully as the A.I. can become brainless when you are caught. They run around aimlessly and constantly chuck grenades at you. The game is definitely meant to be played silently and it is way more rewarding this way.
<br>Death to Spies has you tackling Nazi prison camps, bases and even tasks you with destroying an entire bridge to cut of enemy reinforcements to the front lines as well as a few other locations I will leave to you to find out for yourself. Do not expect anything exciting from the story and dialogue as that does not seem to be a huge focus in Death to Spies. Character voice acting and lip to voice synchronization is a mess but I did not let that take away from the stories I created within each individual mission.
<br>To say the least, Death to Spies is truly underrated and was lost in the shadows of Hitman. It is a must play for hardcore stealth lovers!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/death-to-spies/user-reviews?user_review_id=6871642">Expand</a></span>
