However, it seems the developers are are well aware that each of their creations will be considered the best of the genre and use this as an excuse to be lazy, having objects interact with each other in only the most minor of ways. This leads to ridiculous and cartoonish behavior of player controllable vehicles. Not to mention they have a history of charging a lot for minor content DLC. The games feel like a developer taking their audience for granted instead of striving to make their game the best it could be. But at its core, Farming Simulator 17 is thoroughly enjoyable, and does a great job of providing you with the freedom to manage your farm any way you see fit. With a little more work, the next incarnation of this game could take audiences by storm.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-17/user-reviews?user_review_id=7216411">Expand</a></span>
