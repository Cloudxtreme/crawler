<br>The short version: Very good for nostalgic people. Still has a few bugs here and there, and the save function will catch you off guard at times. Good game overall, but the puzzles have aged. The story is worth paying attention to though.
<br>
<br>The long version:
<br>
<br>A funny little game with a very good plot and all new mouse controls.
<br>
<br>Great game that will be enjoyed most by people who played it in 1998.
<br>
<br>Graphics are considerably smoother, but the game still runs in 4:3 with a border. You can get it to run in 16:9 but all it does is stretch the screen. As said before, the mouse controls that were usually used in lucasarts games were not used in the original game, so they put it back in because the controls were dreadful.
<br>
<br>The game is much more enjoyable if you go into it without knowing anything, but it&apos;s still enjoyable for people looking for a blast from the past.
<br>
<br>There are special features now, like being able to switch from original graphics to remastered graphics (the difference being the lighting, shadows and textures. The prerendered backgrounds are untouched).
<br>
<br>Some puzzles require observational skills to solve, and talking to people and emptying their dialogue trees will sometimes help you will the trickier ones. Some of them have aged badly though.
<br>
<br>The achievements are rather easy to recieve. Most of them are obtained when you get people to say certain things, which is a bit too easy. There are also achievements for playing the game with the old keyboard controls and settings. I&apos;ve played over 2 hours and I have already gotten most of the achievements.
<br>
<br>The save feature isn&apos;t automatic, which is a huge problem for people with bad memory. It&apos;s not an issue with me, but I did go a full hour before remembering to save, which is dangerous.
<br>
<br>I have beaten the game, so I can say that it&apos;s not the longest game you will ever play, but that all depends on how quick you are at solving puzzles. I haven&apos;t beaten too many point and click adventures in my time, so I can say that it is a decent length.
<br>
<br>One of the biggest issues for me was the fact that there were definitely quite a few bugs that could have been ironed out. When these issues occur, you know it&apos;s your fault, but it could have been patched. For instance, during an in-game cutscene (not a rendered one), you can click on the inventory icon, which many people will do since there is at least one point in the game where it seems appropriate to do so, but it actually makes the game no longer interactive, and you can&apos;t even open the main menu. Top that off with a long time gap between your last save, and your progress is gone. So, many of these glitches happen if you open your inventory at the wrong time, or if you just do something that the game doesn&apos;t want you to.
<br>
<br>The game has aged rather well, but obviously there will be graphical weaknesses as you expect from old games. This is a story based game too, so gameplay is really great when it comes to puzzle solving, but if you aren&apos;t one for stories, then you might not enjoy this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=5369892">Expand</a></span>

<br>2.) Those who want to explore the nuances of the game.  The style.  The ambiance.  The way that the game is structured.  The &quot;reading between the lines&quot; of the morals, and themes of the story itself...
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re in category #1?  Avoid this game at all costs.  The game is about the sum of the parts being greater than an equal to the whole.  (Much in the same way that Animal Farm is much more than just a story about talking animals running amok...)  Some of the puzzles are just...odd.  They don&apos;t seem to make 100% logical sense, and the game certainly isn&apos;t going to highlight the puzzle piece with a glowing exclamation point, or halo to let you know what you&apos;ve missed.
<br>
<br>But...if you&apos;re in the second category, and you haven&apos;t played this yet?  Then why, oh why, in the name of all things holy or not, are you even bothering to read this review?  Get on your favorite platform, and get this ASAP.  You&apos;ll be rewarded with the texture, style, and nuance of a finely crafted masterpiece.
<br>
<br>Playing Grim Fandango isn&apos;t about the jaw dropping graphics, or the smooth textures, or the latest in whiz-bang technology.  (Which is what a lot of people who aren&apos;t steeped in the adventure genre don&apos;t quite get...)  This game is about the Land of the Dead.  It&apos;s about Manny Calavera.  It&apos;s about the questions that plague everyone regarding life...death...and beyond.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4931961">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Look, the game is a re-release that runs on modern systems, with very few improvements (mainly models and lighting, bit of audio). And that&apos;s pretty much it. It hasn&apos;t even been optimized for 16:9. You can choose it, but it just stretches everything and makes the game look ridiculous. The backgrounds look grainy and out of place.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re cool with that, the price is reasonable enough that you can safely jump in and give it a shot. I am not sure how relevant it may be for today&apos;s audiences (and I can&apos;t judge, because I&apos;m wearing nostalgia goggles). I assume they will find the puzzles infuriatingly illogical, because they are the product of a school of adventure game puzzle design whose goal was to make the puzzles as creatively obscure as possible. Often the solutions to the puzzles are part of the joke themselves. The objective was to have them inject the narrative with wackiness and to make you chuckle when you managed to solve them, not to have them make logical sense.
<br>
<br>Even playing through the game with full walkthrough help though is worth it. The story, humor, characters, setting and art style are so unique and genuinely disarmingly funny, that you are going to have a blast. It&apos;s a rare gem, whose commercial failure sealed the coffin of the adventure game genre, ironically enough. But hey, at least they went out with a bang. I can&apos;t bring myself to subtract more than 1 point for the mediocre Remaster work, so a 9/10 it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4931659">Expand</a></span>

<br>So, like so many games it has a hype machine cranking up already, and reviews all banging on about the originality of the original not lost etc etc etc.  Funny story etc etc. That&apos;s all fine, of course, but for someone like me who can&apos;t be bothered to think of all the weird possible connections between objects on the screen etc, and how things connect across scenes, who feels somehow cheated if I need to google an answer and look at a walkthrough... well, I know I am not really ever going to finish it and well, I have far too many games I got bored of and didn&apos;t finish.   Most of those are because they got insanely hardor I had a break and forgot the myriad of controls. This time it is because I just won&apos;t have the patience to figure out every possible weird answer to every puzzle. In truth, I think because it wasn&apos;t published for so many years, that makes this game much more of a &apos;classic&apos; and more easy to hype up.  The stylised design has stood the test of time very well indeed, but... well... I&apos;ll stick with &apos;adventure&apos; games like ethan carter and Brothers or more logical and simple puzzle games like Talos or Portal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4931446">Expand</a></span>

<br>Grim Fandango is, quite simply, one of the greatest video games ever made. I could go into the story of Manny, the Day of the Dead motif expertly blended with film noir that flows through the title, the beautiful art direction overall and the illogical logic of the well crafted puzzles, but it would simply be gushing praise that isn&apos;t required. Put simply, it&apos;s almost the perfect game in every area you care to examine.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve seen some moaning that there&apos;s no auto-save, or hint system for the puzzles - those people are severely missing the point of the title, as you&apos;d quite frankly ruin the game if those features existed.
<br>
<br>So well done to Double Fine if they realised that this classic needed to be largely untouched, and simply released to be made easily available to those who missed out on it first time round. It&apos;s possible they just got lazy and did the bare bones and got lucky, but even if that is the case I&apos;m glad they did.
<br>
<br>For the price, you won&apos;t get better value for money in 2015. One word of warning for the Call of Duty generation - you can&apos;t press F to win here, so prepare to have to use your brain a bit; but be prepared to be richly rewarded if you do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4931421">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s a puzzle game - and as another reviewer has pointed out - the puzzles aren&apos;t solvable unless you&apos;re prepared to grind away for hours - there&apos;s no logic to the solutions, just trial and error.
<br>The game is not entertaining or fast enough to encourage the tedious repetition of the same scenarios required to find solutions - after 20 minutes or so you think you&apos;re missing the point and you Google up a walkthrough to find a way forward. When you can&apos;t work out what to do next, you consider going back to the walkthrough - but you quickly realize that you haven&apos;t missed any fundamental instructions or concepts and that this is the way the game is made. Since progressing by following someone else&apos;s instructions is entirely pointless - you stop playing.
<br>Despite recent criticisms I&apos;ve found Metacritic&apos;s professional and user reviews useful in deciding where to spend my leisure time and money - but something smells very bad about the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this game...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=5021937">Expand</a></span>

I know it was a master piece at the time, but it should had have a remastered version in proportion to its reputation.</span>

<br>The remaster hardly remastered anything at all. The backgrounds are still prerendered, propably in higher resolution. So are the cutscenes. It looks even morse now with the crisp colourful 3d models standing out of the scenery. Textures are still with minimalistic details. I expected more, and am disappointed.
<br>But overall - the game is brilliant, but remaster is more of a re-packaging of the same thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4930633">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t try to hide, no excuses, if you like adventure games and you haven&apos;t played Grim Fandango no need to think twice - just pick it up right away!
<br>
<br>Double Fine Productions has approached this classic as you would a masterpiece, that is economically and with great respect, and I think it was the right choice. The already excellent voice acting is unchanged, there is no &quot;modern&quot; wide-screen mode but the original textures have been repainted with higher resolution and the original musical score has been re-recorded as faithfully as possible. The control scheme has also been updated and mouse control is now added, something the original game probably should have had from the start.
<br>
<br>But what makes this game so special is the quirky and effortless writing and mood, there really are very few games like it. The way it stands apart from other games makes me think of Psychonauts and BioShock. Every now and then a game comes along that sets its own tone and just does it&apos;s own thing, regardless of the rest of the industry at the time. And Grim Fandango is certainly such a game, it&apos;s a wonderfully bizarre adventure that you won&apos;t soon forget. On the list of AAA+ adventure games that everyone must play this is certainly near the very top.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4930124">Expand</a></span>

You obtain items you wont need and will forget about until a couple of hours into it and there is not sense of rhythm to anything you do. Its like Metal Gear Solid 2 (loose reference there), where the first part of the game has the most love put into it then it swoops down hill in quality, as soon as you get out of the first mission area the game fall apart. Expected a climatic ending? NO!, you get a number 9 ticket slapped in your hand so fast you can almost hear Tim Schafer himself saying &quot;There&apos;s not funding left, QUICK end the game now!&quot;  This game is far to over praised for its own good and would probably work better as a mini series as it has great characters and paints an intriguing picture. You might as well play minesweeper whilst pausing it once in a while to watch your favorite film.

Its a game made for the oldies and even though new gamers might not like it as much, it is still a fun little treat to hold you over until the next big something comes out. Flawed but still a fun and enjoyable game.</span>

<br>People who don&apos;t mind spending around 40-60$ for AAA games may end up finding this release underwhelming.
<br>In the good old days there were very few distractions due to which one could focus more (maybe think a little)...but for today&apos;s generation this game is going to be a VERY hard nut to crack
<br>A hint system would have definitely helped ease the game.
<br>Some of the puzzles are obscure (maybe since I was so into the game that I didn&apos;t notice it...but yes they do require some serious lateral thinking) but the sheer ridiculous creativity on display in this game is just through the roof.
<br>The updated character models look good and the developer commentary (over 2 hrs I believe with comments for practically every screen ) really takes you through the development process which I found very entertaining.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s an experience and not just a video game and a timeless classic...love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4934981">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You take the role of a grim reaper / travel agent, on the search of a lost client whom ran out of your office when you couldn&apos;t do your job correctly- (or so you&apos;re led to believe).  The story - and setting are both top notch.
<br>Grim is at heart, a point and click adventure game, but as it&apos;s 3D (one of the pioneers when first released), it was seen as somewhat different- especially with the &quot;tank controls&quot; that the later Lucasarts games started to add.
<br>
<br>Voice acting, music and sound is GREAT.
<br>
<br>Puzzles in this game get very difficult, nonsenical.  At times triggers are done at what seems to be random, where dialogue options open up randomly, or when you can use an object.  The feeling of knowing what you want to do, but not knowing exactly what is needed to start the sequence...  Grrnnnnnngg!!  Half way through the adventure it had me look up FAQ guides online- finishing the game only to see the story.  The fun had turned into frustration ;/
<br>
<br>---
<br>The remaster adds developer commentary to scenes, concept art, new character models, new control scheme (mouse!), and wide-screen support.
<br>
<br>Whilst many of these are welcome, it doesn&apos;t feel as a &quot;remaster&quot; should.
<br>The character models look almost out of place, infront of the (now) blurry lower resolution backgrounds- even a simple contrast / brightness photoshop touchup would&apos;ve been welcome.
<br>Dev commentary was brilliant throughout.
<br>
<br>It was obvious that they learnt a lot of things with the Monkey remasters, but also it feels like the team did a semi-lazy job.
<br>
<br>Rating ; 3/5
<br>- Recommended for anyone veteran or skilled in Lucasarts adventure games.  For anyone else, start with MI!
<br>
<br>Bugs encountered,
<br>- Keyboard controls sticking, not idle when afk (often)
<br>- Manny model doing odd things (arm&apos;s waving around, odd things)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=5883754">Expand</a></span>

I fell in love with Grim Fandango when I first played it becuase it had an amazing concept, beautiful artwork, exceptionally memorable characters, incredible voice acting, stunning graphics (they were stunning at the time) and extraordinary gameplay. It&apos;s one of the best adventure games of all time and I was astounded by how good it was after having played Full Throttle, one of the other best adventure games of all time. It had more modern elements at the time, but retained the old school adventure game feel to it, which meant it was very challenging and everything wasn&apos;t so obvious. Some solutions also seemed down-right insane, which I loved.
<br>
<br>I lost one of my original game CD&apos;s and I couldn&apos;t find the game anywhere. It sort of just disappeared off the face of the Earth, which was very disappointing. I eventually did find a copy and couldn&apos;t get it to work, so I had to give up and it felt like putting and old friend to bed forever :(
<br>
<br>When I saw a few weeks ago that a remastered version was coming out I just about had a stroke from the excitement of seeing one of my all time favourite games, coming out with new graphics, control options, no need for install CD&apos;s and of course being compatible with Windows 7!
<br>
<br>I would have still been insanely happy even if they re-released the original, but just made it compatible with Windows, so it&apos;s a super bonus to have it remastered and for me to be able to use my Xbox controller!
<br>
<br>I do however think though that they may have gone a bit too far with the word &quot;remastered&quot;. I would probably have used the words &quot;updated&quot; or &quot;enchanced&quot;. Even though they have updated the characters and music and added dynamic lighting, they missed a huge part by not updating the scenes into 32 bit full HD with no borders. The scenes are still the original scenes with the grainy 16bit look. Surely they would still have the original artwork to be able to do this?
<br>
<br>Aside from this, I&apos;m very, very happy to be playing through my old favourite and would recommend it in a heartbeat to anyone who&apos;s already played Grim Fandango and definitely to those who haven&apos;t!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4979649">Expand</a></span>

<br>I thought this game was great technically. Only two minor bugs I experienced having to do with the character temporarily floating instead of walking and one where I would not be able to move and would need to reload. Otherwise, the visual enhancements seem great (I turned on the setting without the enhancements to see what it would look like otherwise). Only wish they added an autosave feature on the technical side, since manually saving in an adventure game kind of sucks in this day and age.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-wise the beginning puzzles were great and completely logical. As you go on though, some of the puzzles begin to become way too convoluted and don&apos;t really make logical sense. Also, the game doesn&apos;t really have clear objectives so later on in the bigger areas I had absolutely no clue where I should go and what I should even be solving for. The story was the main draw for me and the writing is absolutely wonderful. You get double fine/Schaeffer charm in spades. So even if those puzzles seem off-putting, the story is worth just getting some help online for those more inane puzzles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=5369605">Expand</a></span>

Just wondering if anyone else is having crashing issues as soon as you try start the game up on steam. Really frustrating as i&apos;ve heard great things about this game and really want to play it!</span>

Grim Fandango has always been by my heart as one of my most beloved LucasArts adventure games of all time! Along with Tales from Monkey Island and Full Throttle! This has to be my third time playing Grim Fandango, and this time as a full remastered edition! First time was back in 2002 when I still had my Windows 95 PC, this was my first ever adventure game that I played along with my stupid educational games. Second time was when I rediscovered my original Grim Fandango CD-ROM game in 2010 and now again in 2015 for the remastered edition!
<br>
<br>Grim Fandango&apos;s story is brilliant. From its quirky characters to its lovable cutscenes and funny comedy. The characters such as Manuel Calavera and Glottis will surely make you fall in love with them! The music (especially in the remastered edition) is absolutely brilliant and resembles very much Spanish and Mexican music! The cutscenes are lovable and fun to watch, overall the game is brilliant!
<br>
<br>The puzzles and game progression, although when I was young and I played Grim Fandango for the very first time I did not have any walkthroughs or guides, hell I didn&apos;t even have internet back in 2002, so the puzzles were a bit challenging and can be a bit too awkward for modern-day players or even newcomers to the genre. The game does not help you at all when progressing through and does not hold your hand when your stuck on a puzzle for too long, so be prepared to get stuck here and there, thankfully I remembered most of the stuff! Lucky guys with internet nowadays, you can simply type in walkthroughs for the game!
<br>
<br>The remastered version, Double Fine have really done a job well done for remastering this classic. The music is spot-on and digitally remastered. The cutscenes, although not fully converted to HD are very watchable, and the new HUD system they implemented has made it easier for players to play the game (honestly, the game&apos;s original controls were clunky and very awkward, surprisingly you can still play with the old controls!). The addition of HD graphics and shadow textures, etc... made the game more stunning than it originally was (and if you want some nostalgia, you can play the game in its original graphics!)
<br>
<br>The thing that put me off slightly was the aspect ratio, this game is not tailored for 16:9 monitors and it seems that Double Fine did not optimize the game for 16:9 monitors but kept it at 4:3 aspect ratio, you can still change the aspect ratio from its original 4:3 to 16:9, but you might have to play the game stretched out.
<br>
<br>Overall, Grim Fandango and its remastered version are simply brilliant and if you are a fan of LucasArts (like me!) or you like adventure games or you want to try something new, then I would highly recommend playing Grim Fandango and I hope that Double Fine will continue to remaster these old LucasArts classics!

<br>- Guess they couldn&apos;t save me, eh?
<br>- No, but there&apos;s still a chance you could save me...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=5338143">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One of the very best soundtracks ever made, recorded anew with an entire orchestra; one of the best plots (if not THE best plot) ever written for an adventure game, now with dynamic lighting and hi-res textures.
<br>
<br>Get this game, you will remember puns, characters and music for ever.</span>

<br>Basically, if you used to own this game like me, this is a better version of it. If you&apos;ve never played it, this is a good introduction to the adventure classic or to point-and-click adventuring in general.
<br>
<br>The price is very reasonable, I&apos;d recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=4945053">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This great game doesn&apos;t deserve such a loveless port-
<br>the controlls via a Xbox360 gamepad is a drag too - unlike with mouse controls you never know, which end of the screen is going to another scene. You have to find out the hard way after hours (exaggerating) of running around.</span>

<br>The thing that really bugged me is the absence of logic in solving some of the puzzles and the way to solve them is simply going around clicking everything on everything and hoping that something works. I&apos;m not a fan of going around for an hour and searching for that one thing you need to click on to progress, so I used a walkthrough for a lot of the game and by last quarter of the game it just really became frustrating for me so once stuck I didn&apos;t bother spending any time thinking what else I can do and simply referred to the walkthrough. I like challenges but prefer to spend my time on the ones that have logic in them. Overall, the game is quite brilliant in other ways and is definitely worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-fandango-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=7186903">Expand</a></span>
