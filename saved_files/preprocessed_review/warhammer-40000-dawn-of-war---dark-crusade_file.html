<br>
<br>Not a 10, however, because it has some downsides: Cutscenes are lazy. Every time something interrups the speaker, you can hear the person finish the sentence and exhale, waiting for a second bfore he is &quot;interrupted&quot;. Animations are poor in cutscenes, and they dulled the razor sharp units. Shackled creation of elite units, dulled damage. The low damage makes sharp painful combat be a long, dull, drawn out engagement, much like WC3.
<br>
<br>Also not a 10 because they are already slacking on the factions. Necrons are beautiful, but Tau is lazy, with many units being very similar in appearance. Too long range, overpowered when in AI hands that micromanages.
<br>
<br>But, with a nice, replayable, boss-fight campain it is one heck of a game. Too bad they didn&apos;t polish it a bit more. Better voice acting and cutscenes would have made this and incredible game. Also, they nerfed the Dreadnought.

But failing to find Dark Crusade, I turned to Soul Storm, which is the let down of the series. A year later I get Dark Crusade. From the second I picked it up, I noticed something. This was much better than Soul Storm, an alleged improvement. Nowadays, with Dawn of War already up to the second expansion of Dawn of War 2, I STILL prefer Dark Crusade. It has a terrible balance, however, because most races are better at fighting than others, and some are just weak until WAY down the research chain (I&apos;m looking at you IG, with your strong as paper infantry, and crazy strong tanks). Still, Dark crusade forced you to sometimes lose a province to destroy a stronghold, which has always made me double-check every move I made. In my opinion, this could never be as tedious as Retribution (It&apos;s the same map and enemies 7 times, woo hoo?).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=1737453">Expand</a></span>

This is the best Dawn of War game in my opinion  and exceeds Soulstorm and the Dawn of War II series. The gameplay is unique and refreshing to say the least and the graphics are pretty damn good for a 2006 title I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the 40k universe or RTS in general.</span>

Dark Crusade provides a tremendous amount of content at a stellar price. The game gives one the choice of any of seven distinctive, well-balanced factions for use in a campaign on a Risk-style map. No two factions play alike; this, coupled with the fact that each faction&apos;s individual campaign is tailored to its back story, makes successive playthroughs of the game feel like new experiences rather than stale repetitions.  This gives the game immense replayability. Needless to say, the gameplay is a lot of fun as well, and the campaigns are structured such that the battles fought therein do not feel repetitive.<br><br>Fans of Warhammer 40K will love this game. I suggest to anyone that they buy Platinum Edition (the original Dawn of War plus Winter Assault and Dark Crusade) so as to get the entire experience, but if you must choose only one of the series, Dark Crusade is your best bet.  10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=2296279">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay isn&apos;t balanced for competitive play, and the graphics are getting dated, but the great 40k lore and loads of interesting units more than make up for its shortcomings.

But I will admit that this game did increase the replay value and made multiplayer allot better.</span>

They&apos;ve taken away the ability to play the factions in unique methods which differ from what the computer does in replay by way of unit restrictions which affect each and every existing faction so severely as to essentially make the game actually different from the first two. Unfortunately, this difference is not an improvement in my personal opinion. The risk-like campaign mode is new and interesting, but after two turns at it you begin to spot glaringly obvious balancing issues. It promises a sequel after completing the campaign, but I&apos;ve already quit playing this one. There seems to be a movement in the game development industry as of late to restrict options of gamers, this saddens me greatly, this isn&apos;t the first good game I&apos;ve seen destroyed by that mentality. I don&apos;t think it will be the last either, the first two are excellent and I highly recommend them, however, this latest edition is a complete waste.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=393473">Expand</a></span>

My friend and I would play it online and have a good time. However with Relic releasing these expansions I thought I&apos;d put my thoughts down here. I bought Dark Crusade last year. My criticisms about this game are agitated by the fact that Relic keeps releasing more and more races into the online mix, (Nine total with the next expansion), and its become just silly. You cannot take this game seriously anymore, and while it&apos;s cartoonistic humour and style used to suit it well. It&apos;s become to the point where Relic dirtied the bath water with a bunch of filthy pointless races that don&apos;t complement the others at all. Every race has become foreign around the next, and it doesn&apos;t play smoothly like it used to when there were only four races. When it was the first game, vehicles like the dreadnought were immensely powerful and exciting to watch as they threw around squads and ripped through them. With every &apos;balance&apos; patch relic has released, their sole idea was to NERF other units down to balance the gameplay instead of bump the other units up. After almost four years of patching in this fashion, Warhammer&apos;s battles are now painfully slow, the units take an incredibly long time to die, not helped by the instant reinforcement feature. I find that the excitement and the fast-paced gameplay is no-more because of Relic&apos;s constant balance nerfs. Secondly, the end result of having NINE races into the Warhammer mix is that this game is now IMPOSSIBLE to properly balance. And any attempt by Relic&apos;s traditional nerfing will simply cause slower and slower-paced fighting. I am positive that this game&apos;s future is dead. My four is given to this game mainly because of the way it&apos;s been handled over the years. It&apos;s just been terribly poor and the original depth to it has been filled in with poor design. The original pace and character of the series is utterly gone with the arrival of these new expansions. It seems like they just churn out their ideas constantly. And some of these ideas are just disturbing, they have three races revolving around Death, one based on Feminists, another two on technology worship, and the last on religious fanaticism. The Orks main theme is stupidity, seriously, the developers spell everything wrong in the Ork descriptions. ??? In conclusion, this game used to be really something, but Relic&apos;s deadening patches and un-inspired expansions have proven to be more like a cancer. There is not a chance in hell they can ever straighten out this gameplay as far as I can see, and the game is just no longer fun. It&apos;s just silly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=409243">Expand</a></span>

I bought this as well as the gold edition of Dawn of War (which includes the Winter Assault expansion) so that I could, if I wished, play all factions online. Although this is an expansion pack, it does not require you to own the original game. The only limitation, is that all of the factions which are available in the single player campaign and skirmishs are not availble for online play. For that you must own and install the original game and use those CD keys to vaildate in the Dark Crusades expansion. This is an excellent game from an outstanding company. The graphics are very good considering the date of the original, and widescreen resolutions are available natively. Having the DVD in your drive is not required for play, which is something I wish all game makers would consider implementing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=392627">Expand</a></span>

The SP concept is awesome which includes a feature for you to build up your commander with extra gear that gives them abilities and change their appearance to something more FEARSOME. or in comparison with other games, &quot;level-up&quot;. and add a new range of dynamics to gameplay, the new features are enough to be split into two separate expansion and the Necrons add a whole new strategy of playing an army. The game feels very well developed, and thoroughly tested before release, not to mention the relatively short duration of it&apos;s development after Winter Assault. Honestly, I don&apos;t do user ratings like this one, but I really feel this game is very, very well done, and the developers deserve many slaps on the back, probably till they vomit blood, but they deserve it for the excellent work. I hope they keep this level of creativity and quality up for the next release!

I was waiting for some new races and its briliant the way they have made the new necrons since they cant really be killed, witch would make them kind of imba, but they found a great solusion to that, but beware since its quite hard to learn these new races. Expecially the Tau... They are the only reason for im not giving this a 10 beacourse they are funny to play but the really lack firepower since they suck at meele. But everything else about this game is great, so if you have the first one, i deffenetly can recommend this expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=398425">Expand</a></span>

With seven races to play, who all play in a unique way, there&apos;s a little something for everyone in this game. Already a great RTS, Dawn of War has solidified its position at the head of the pack by delivering solid game play with massive armies trading savage blows using everything from pistol wielding Commisars to bombardment from outer space. With very little resource micromanagement (you simply take a strategic point or build a power supply building, then solidify it&apos;s fortifications with pretty straightforward upgrades) it&apos;s a game that is very easy to pick up and play, or to embark on a world-spanning conquest of the six other races that inhabit the world of Kronus. For owners of the original Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, this expansion pack is a MUST HAVE, and for anybody else... well this expansion pack is still a MUST HAVE, you won&apos;t be bored anytime soon with so much to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=400306">Expand</a></span>

The 7 races are rich both in character and in fighting style, each with a substantial variety of different infantry and vehicular units, as well as an epic pantheon of heroes. The story mode is interesting and varied, and can be played through multiple times with different races and outcomes. Probably the most impressive element of this epic game, however, is the shockingly versatile camera, allowing for stunning cinematic battle scenes completely in real-time. The only downsides (and there are few) are the terrible difficulty customization, which changes enemy unit strength instead of their strategy, and the limited multiplayer options for those who don&apos;t own the core game. Overall, though, these really don&apos;t even put a dent in the overall experience. Buy this game and bring the grim darkness of the far future straight to your PC!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=2814869">Expand</a></span>

This made me realize you probably have never rolled a dice nor played the tabletop game of this wonderful game. There are in fact more races than nine in the tabletop form of the game, and the &quot;balance&quot; is made by making each individual really good at something, but lacking in something else. For example, Eldar had tons of specialist troops that were really good at what they do (Dire Avengers absolutely pouring out shots like it was nothing),but were extremely fragile and somewhat expensive as far as points. If there were a universal &quot;balance&quot; of power, then I agree, gameplay would become pretty boring as the races seem to be intertwined. That&apos;s why the developers at the former company of THQ added more races with different attributes, which can clearly be seen in the Tau&apos;s overall godliness at shooting, the space marines being expensive but good at everything, the Eldar&apos;s speed, the Necron&apos;s toughness, and the imperial guard and ork&apos;s strength in numbers. Your criticism of the themes that the people at THQ had for their races also rings hollow when you dig into some of the tabletop game&apos;s lore. Orks are meant to be stupid, they&apos;re fungi made into a humanoid form. Necrons and Tau basically worship technology  but their lore says why. Necrons made a pact with a god who appears as a metallic figure to immortalize their race as they were facing extinction, but the god turned them into soulless machines  to do his bidding to pretty much annihilate anything. The Tau worship technology because they were deprived of it. Think of going to a third world country with an iphone, or even better think of Hernan Cortez being worshipped as a god by the Incas for his appearances, ships, and horses. I&apos;m assuming the death theme has to do with the Chaos faction. That should really be a no brainer, there has to be a villainous character, so why not  exemplify it into an entire race who, in the lore, attempted to kill the Imperial Guard&apos;s/Space Marine&apos;s god? Feminist&apos;s? The only feministic race I could think of in Dark Crusade would be Eldar, and yeah that&apos;s just because the founders of the table top game just made like that to fit their attributes of sneakiness and deception. So really, all your problems with the dev&apos;s as far as themes are honestly unfounded because they took most of the content from the tabletop game. Warhammer 40k deserved a game and got it, to go astray from the game now would just be utter stupidity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=3076219">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;d recommend getting the game on Steam so that you can still play online MP (moved from GameSpy to Steamworks) or just buy the Amazon DRM-Free copy and check the game&apos;s forums.  There&apos;s a pinned article from SEGA with a link to a website where they accept box codes and give Steam keys out to retail owners.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=4428287">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dark Crusade (DC from now on) is a RTS game set in the Warhammer 40K universe, and that much you knew. What you probably didn&apos;t knew is that this game is awesome! The sheer number of different units makes the game varied and interesting, with dozens upon dozens of models. The units emanate charisma from every angle, faithful to the boardgame ones. The story is interesting enough, and the main campaign can hook you up for days.
<br>
<br>The balancing is superb, with no unit feeling overpowered or useless. It has not a resource gathering mechanic -well, it does, but revolves around the capturing and holding of key points rather than trees, iron and the like. A smart move, since the combat for key points is the heart of the boardgame.
<br>
<br>Visually it&apos;s okay, but it has aged - and it shows. The gripes I have with the graphics are about some special effects, with a few ingenuities regarding monitor resolution, resolved by mods. Because it&apos;s open to mods!
<br>
<br>Overall a great game, and a must for every RTS appassionate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=4636587">Expand</a></span>

I loved the new addition of the Risk style campaign map, though I found the Necrons basically swept across the map killing everyone and losing zero battles. But that is the only complaint I have. The Necrons are very over-powered, but it was pretty awesome to watch my guardsmen wipe their stupid base once and for all, and their strength really felt true to the lore and canon of Warhammer 40,000. The skirmish mode is great, I found that the AI is pretty challenging and always kept me on the defensive on hard. I did not get a chance to play multiplayer. The Army Painter is also great, making a return from DoW and Winter Assault. Making endless different Imperial Guard regiments was very fun.
<br>Overall, this game deserves a ten. It has balancing issues, yes, but if you&apos;re looking for an authentic Warhammer 40k experience, with space marines mowing down orks and guardsmen desperately holding their base, this is where to go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=5898406">Expand</a></span>

<br>My only critisicm would be that i was sad to find no expansion to this game, outside of its none official Titanium wars add on which i thoroughly reccomend.</span>

<br>Grab a good mod like Titanium and this game will destroy DOW II and DOW III. With titanium you have just about every unit that is in the codex. I think IG has about 25+ different tanks, and that is just their tanks. Each faction has more units available than all 3 of the pathetic factions combined from DOW III. Save your money and don&apos;t buy DOW III, just download the mods for this and enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war---dark-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=7288277">Expand</a></span>
