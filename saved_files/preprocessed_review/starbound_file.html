Work on Starbound has slowed to a crawl. The game itself is in a state where it is little more then 2D Lego&apos;s and there are other block building games out there that are more complete and cheaper then the asking price of this unfinished work. I would love to talk about the gameplay more but there simply isn&apos;t any to be had as the work is simply not fun at all in its presently and likely soon to be rushed out 1.0 state that is slated to be missing features. As is the developers have also gone back on their word several times involving the mechanics and gameplay, date of release, and are blaming their userbase for these faults. 2015 at the time of this writing slated as the release date. They have been noticably changing the release date since -2012-.
<br>
<br>I find this one of the most disturbing early access games on Steam in terms of lost potential. I would warn people to instead pick up Terraria, Minecraft, or a host of other games in a better state and that are still being worked on diligently. What is here is only the most basic of block games and looks to remain that way so I give this a 1. Chucklefish at present is to concerned with other matters to make this game the product it could have been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4284323">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Really cool game! I love the story a lot and I love that you can explore other unknown planets just like Mass Effect. In my opinion I think this game is a combination of Minecraft, Terraria and Mass effect! (In a good way) Love the art style, really shows that pixel-based games can turn out to be amazing games! I give this game a 9/10!</span>

<br>The graphics</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">amazing game.... there&apos;s not much to be said as I haven&apos;t really played hundreds of hours (yet) but from the first intro I can tell its already an awesome game. the soundtrack is literally epic, and I don&apos;t use that word lightly or often, but in this case its fitting. Every new track I hear is well timed with the games cutscenes and events and sends shivers down my spine.
<br>
<br>The graphics are awesome (for a 2d tile based game) and the particle effects add a lot to the scene (rain is especially nice looking, when its wind for example).
<br>
<br>but the main thing that seems to keep me hooked is the sheer volume of content... there&apos;s just SO MUCH. I played a while online with my brother (who has played a lot more of the game than I have) and he has an amazing arsenal of bizarre and interesting weapons, all very different from each other.
<br>
<br>My only issue with the game is the performance. I couldn&apos;t get the 64bit version to launch and the 32bit version I can play never gets above 50fps on my machine (which isn&apos;t a beast pc but can play AAA titles just fine.) however for this game, anything above 30fps really is fine, is still looks smooth and doesn&apos;t feel choppy at all...

<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve played Terraria, then you&apos;re already in a familiar field: 2D Minecraft-like, except this one is a bit more floaty. The Combat can seem kinda slow and unbalanced at times (in both directions, mind) but the real area Starbound shines is the exploration.
<br>Beam down to a Planet, scour it for ores and/or treasures, or just enjoy the scenery above and below ground all the way to the Small Meteorites orbiting the atmosphere above or the planet&apos;s molten core bellow. When you&apos;re finished, tell Scotty to beam you back up, find a new planet, and repeat.
<br>
<br>Of course, the game does still have it&apos;s faults.
<br>During it&apos;s Beta phases, there was no real goal in how to progress through the game, aside from &apos;get the bestest gear ever.&apos; Now that it&apos;s released we finally have a story driven plot:
<br>Some big tentacle monster destroyed Earth, and you gotta stop it form destroying the rest of the universe, somehow. Sounds Noble, right?
<br>Unless you focus on the story, it can get outright forgotten about. That&apos;s a good and bad thing: There&apos;s so much to do anyway, but it&apos;s part of the game that just feels lackluster compared to everything else. It can easily be plowed through in a few hours, although there was a recent update that adds post story content. I&apos;ve not checked that out yet
<br>
<br>Apparently some people have been having problems just running the game since it&apos;s official release. I do not know why, it&apos;s always run smoothly for me. Try running it in a different display mode, is what I&apos;d suggest (if windowed, try fullscreen, etc).
<br>
<br>And the mods, oh golly the mods. At once point the Devs made it a clear goal to make the game as easy to modify as they possibly could, and it still shows today. As of right now, Starbound&apos;s Steam Workshop has a little over two Thousand separate mods for it, although totaling to 3500. The second number, however, includes the outdated mods that were abandoned due to a dry update period.
<br>
<br>Overall, I say get this game, and get a friend or two to get this game, too. The vastness of space is best explored with buddies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6920780">Expand</a></span>

<br>Maybe i am not progressed enough to make such a call - but i would have expected a lot less planetary crafing and building and a lot more starship designing and so. Instead my ship is just a kind of hut in space with little to no function other than a base of operations. ... But as i said - maybe i have not progressed enough - so that might be a thing later in the game.

<br>Exploration is not the most exciting thing in Starbound ... because the plant(s) are not exactly very different in my opinion. Sure - there may be a slightly different background and terrain theme - but all in all ... its all quite similar.
<br>Added to it is the feeling that it hardly feels like a sci fi game. Equipment, weapons and all the stuff is very low tech and boring. (I like to point at the game &quot;Sid meiers - Alpha Centauri&quot; which allowed technology so far off in the future .. but still in a kind of logical way - that it simply felt like sci fi)
<br>
<br>Starbound on the other hand feels like the stone age - like one of those sci fi movies set thousands of years in the future - where they still use ballistic weapons like shotguns.
<br>
<br>Well - enough of my ramblings ... all in all the game is ... as i said .. average. If you liked Terraria - and you simply cannot get enough of that kind of game - Starbound might satisfy your needs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6582908">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Overall, I would only half recommend this game. If you enjoy 2D sandbox games like terraria, you will probably like this game. It has more story, mission, and a coherent progression. Most of the missions are a bit of a grind, but it isn&apos;t too bad. And I think the boss battles are much better than terraria.
<br>
<br>The down-side is that there are still bugs and issues. For instance, I was recently playing the game and my power temporarily went out. I figured this would be no big deal, I would simply load from the last time I saved the game. WRONG. The game somehow deleted my planetary bookmarks, and set back portions of the main storyline to the very beginning of the entire game (ie it somehow corrupted portions of my current save file, even though I wasn&apos;t in the process of saving when the crash happened). So there are still issues to be worked out. Be forewarned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6738154">Expand</a></span>

<br>Four &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;ing years, a million &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;ing dollars and a complete godamn development team and the result is a mediocre edge of space clone that runs like crap.
<br>
<br>The game had a lot of promise, but the developers got so much money from pre-orders and early adopters they overdosed on hookers and cocaine and forgot they were supposed to make a game after taking the money.
<br>
<br>Long periods of inactivity combined with procrastination led to disjointed updates and developers so utterly disconnected from the community that the majority of old time players who gave a &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; about the game left and only the fanboys remained.
<br>
<br>The game started out with an intresting premise. Multiple differenct races each of them explore space for its own reason with its own goals, it&apos;s own allied and enemy races creating conflict and generating and truly living breathing world, its own tech and it&apos;s own special abilities, exploring to find the reason why they left their planet in the first place.
<br>
<br>You could be a pirate, a researcher, a space bandit fighting for your own cause beacuse your own reasons.
<br>
<br>Sounds intresting no?
<br>
<br>Well, what we got now is everyone is happy, everyone is united, no conflict, part of a united federation type deal, and your character is the newest graduate out to save the world with the other graduates from cthulu who hates all live and wants to see it gone because it gives an evil boner or whatever. (ORIGINAL PLOT ALERT, DO NOT STEAL).
<br>
<br>How do you save the world from cthulu? Do 5 incredibly drawn out, tedious fetch quests, 5 nonsensical dungeons and then you fight the boss.
<br>
<br>All races are the exact same with the only differences being cosmetic. (As opposed to earlier versions where you had unique armors with abilities and special weapons)
<br>
<br>Since beta from more than half the special abilities or techs (like nullifying gravity, flying, teleporting, FTL dashing, mechs ect) got completely removed , a massive ammount of custom/unique racial weapons in the game got gutted for no reason at all, the game went back to use a terrible &quot;Damage on contact&quot; combat system and the racial armors turned from unique special sets with different abilities to 12 different reskins of the exact same item, and ontop of that all, all the unique racial AI was removed in favour of everyone using the human one! WHY!?
<br>
<br>Also, in the 4 years that it has been out the devs never gave a &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; to properly optimize it so it&apos;ll run at more than 10 frames per second on high end gaming PCs.
<br>
<br>But all that could have been easily excused.
<br>
<br>IF THE GAME WASN&apos;T IN THE GAME FOR 4 GODAMN YEARS WITH A BUDGET OF OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
<br>
<br>Honestly, I cannot in all honesty give this game a positive review, because it does not deserve a positive review.
<br>
<br>The developers took people&apos;s money, develivered a product that&apos;s even remotely close to what they promisd and took 4 years to do it. It&apos;s a mediocre game in a sea of mediocrity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6575825">Expand</a></span>

Tired of hearing about how they don&apos;t update because if you weren&apos;t an idiot you would know they do every night.  Give the game a chance if you are interested and do your own research instead of listening to trolls.</span>

<br>Super sensitive character movement, none intuitive menu systems, plenty of strange bugs, inability to hit things that are slightly below you with a sword, torches that light up a meter in front of you , toolbar system that does not remember where you had something moments ago, menus with single items that do not auto-select this item, forcing you to make extra clicks for no reason, convoluted food/ eating system, a pointless tutorial that teaches you nothing about how the game works, character dialogues that either stay on screen for ages and cannot be skipped, or go by so fast you do not get a chance to read them entirely....  there is not one intuitive design feature to be found.
<br>The developers should be embarrassed that they call this a ready to be shipped game when it is so painful to play.

Having played 92 Hours of Starbound to date over the course of the games development - I aim to give each update a decent shot. I can honestly say that this game provides an enjoyable starting experience with an adequate set of character customization options and six playable races. There is much promise upon beaming down to your first planet. You truly feel starbound. The Strange planet beckons to be explored and the unique mobs are extremely diverse with a mix of docile and hostile creatures. There is a real variety of NPCs and structures which serve as a means to explore and potential to gain great loot. But as the game progresses and you&apos;ve explored your first few planets, perhaps even killed the boss in order to move to the next sector of space, that you are experiencing a bit of deja vu. Don&apos;t get me wrong there is a respectable amount of content in game already. But not all of that content does necessarily contribute to an enjoyable game play experience. Great a fluffy unicorn plushy! - but can&apos;t I get some more weapon variety beyond a melee weapon or a gun? I&apos;ve dug down into a planets core! - oh great more stock monsters...
<br>Don&apos;t be mistaken this game is still in development in its beta stage. It boasts a good amount of content but it&apos;s still undercooked. So unless you want to risk a belly ache, or just feel like you want to support Starbound&apos;s development, save your money at the moment. The experience is still a little thin to be called a game. I mean the last 5 of 10 tiers of gear can pretty much be skipped at the moment. Starbound lives up to its name and will take flight eventually. Give it some time and I think this will flesh out to be an enjoyable multiplayer experience. Maybe not quite minecraft or terraria but still an admirable addition to the genre of Indie Sandbox games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4188034">Expand</a></span>

<br>Note: Like I said,I kinda like this game at its beta state,It&apos;s okay,NOT WORTH BUYING,Just wait til&apos; it updates a little and then buy it,It has the potential to be the best,Yes,Better than terraria,minecraft and &quot;PP&quot;.
<br>
<br>But its in beta state and this is my &quot;Beta&quot; score ,6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4561419">Expand</a></span>

<br>You can meet NPCs that are interested in being a crew member of your ship that will help enhance your team if you choose to have them along or just leave them on the ship to continue to enhance your ship in various ways.
<br>a lot of random side quests can be gained from the various NPCs that dot all of the planets.
<br>Build anything like you can in minecraft but with a lot more variety of block types and furnishings to add a lot of appeal to the decor.   then you can add people to each building or house and create your own civilization.
<br>with the update of 1.2 you are now able to terraform any biome into whatever biome you like.
<br>there seems to be more updates to come and more fun to be had in the coming months and years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6929662">Expand</a></span>

Lots of empty promises and &quot;soon&quot; coming from the developers.  Combat is tedious, exploration is unsatisfying and bland, and there&apos;s just not incentive to explore or build.  There&apos;s tons of core game mechanics, all of which are shallow, undeveloped, and unbalanced at the moment.  It&apos;s like they tried to make a sequel to Terraria without understand what made Terraria such a compelling and surprisingly deep game.  I do not recommend you buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4284370">Expand</a></span>

What it is at the time of writing this review (July 2014) is more of a alpha or tech demo.
<br>
<br>The reason I gave it such a low score is because purchasing this game is essentially handing money over to Chucklefish in the hope that once complete the game will be good. And time and time again they prove that not only are they unmotivated or incapable of delivering a good product but they also think very little of their customer base.
<br>
<br>Postponing release dates and not even coming close to meeting them along with very slow development progress are the least of anyone&apos;s concerns when purchasing this game, blatantly lying to consumers, berating them, trolling them, any form of criticism against their product are labelled as &quot;loaded&quot; and dismissed if you are on their forums and not white knighting you can expect a ban fairly quickly. These are the kind of ways this company handles their PR, this is the kind of behavior you will be enabling if you give this company any more money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4343400">Expand</a></span>

Starbound has done this mistake full force and the exploration and combat feels extremely dull and bland. On paper and on the blog it sounds awesome and I was super excited about it but after 9 hours ( i ve tried and retried over 4 or 5 characters along the updates) i never had fun. it&apos;s really sad to say but yep, didnt have fun a single minute.
<br>Fights are slow and boring, gravity is always too low and controls dont feel nervous or tight. Muddy at best. Game is super unbalanced ( which is ok for the early beta, but its been in beta for a year now and i havent seen much change...). Character progression is boring, nothing exciting to be found in exploration. &quot;quests&quot; to push you to a next step feel forced and break the fun a game like terraria had in its sandbox system and freedom of exploration. Terraria had genius in the fact that you could discover everything yourself ( i never had to read a walkthrough), starbound hasnt found a way to teach the player to play the game in a clever way and instead tries to take him by the hand telling him what to do turning the experience into a fetching bore.
<br>
<br>I have lost hope in Starbound right now. I ll come back and update my review in a few months if things have evolved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4447145">Expand</a></span>

This gives one the impression that you will be playing the game as it is developed. Sure you will, but not on Steam where they haven&apos;t updated the game for seven months. Instead you can go to their website and read about their updates. That&apos;s right forget about having them delivered to you. What you are purchasing here is a &quot;story&quot; about someone building a game. This is a novel it is not a game. However, if you love Terraria and only desire to build things in a new setting this might suit your taste. If you can get past the pokemon looking graphics and the extremely lame enemies, your hero looking like something found in a cereal box free for pc in 1985, or having pretty much nothing to do but gather material and build you may very well love this game. Had I known that a small group of people will vehemently defend this game and act like everyone else has a problem I&apos;d have passed. What you are buying here is a game where you can build things with materials that you gather, and join a cult.

<br>i know the art is hyper-generic, i know the combat system is stupid but i do not care, because that is part of the charm. the entire starting universe is lame bland and predictable, but the player is the one to put their own spin on it, turn their castle ship into Farmer Joe&apos;s Cornfeild, go roaming the universe with a cowboy hat or make a paintball arena on a dead planet... which we did on a whim and had such a great payoff.i know this feels unfinished, but that makes it ever more tantalizing, because this game, in early beta, has one hundred and fifty hours of playtime, while the unnamed game which many people claim that this is a ripoff of... has only fifteen minutes, because this thing feels like it has only scratched the surface of it&apos;s potential, and yet feels even more wholesome, encompassing, and unique. the races deserve a line and that line is... these may feel a bit generic, but when you actually look at the time, the philosophies, effort and lore they put into seven separate races... you want to pack you bags and move to this galaxy. Unlike other popular games, which are pretentious, silly and just make a lot a noise for the sake of noise, this thing is light, simple and sweet in telling a very simple message, in a very unique way that makes it actually viable...

It has tons of long-term play abilty and provides quests which helps you along your way instead of you wondering what to do. You can also choose from several specieas, each with a slightly different story and ship. Great fun! Get for pre-release before the price raises!</span>

Having failed to meet the 2013 deadline and with 2015 rapidly approaching, it seems that the &quot;1.0&quot; sticker will be applied to this game in order to avoid dishing out the refunds that so many Early Access supporters have been clamoring for since they realized that they were only inflating the massive ego of the sprite artist that nearly sank Terraria before it even left port by stealing Final Fantasy V sprites for Redigit to use. If you liked Terraria, you&apos;re in good company. Tiy loved it so much, he ripped it off himself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4418225">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And then you realize the game in itself feels like the developers did not know at first how hard and tedious developping  fully functionnal game is. Between the game complete lack of balance and the &quot;missing description&quot; for hundreds of items, it does feel like it was halfway done then someone said &quot;let&apos;s release it early access&quot;.
<br>
<br>And while the release of seasonnal content for valentine&apos;s day was appreciated, it really shows the issues in this game development. It is not centered on content quantity, not quality.  And if you consider this game is basically still on alpha stage with no change brought in a year, you wonder where this is going.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4561949">Expand</a></span>

My friends and I have built everything from space-bars to giant lasers, a steam-punk planet, an Avian home world, you name it! Even Terraria at its present height doesn&apos;t have this much potential for building flavor.

It&apos;s just another example of how damn ambitious this growing indie game has been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=5540902">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is what it is. The fun here is in the open world / sandbox elements. If you&apos;re looking for a Metroidvania platform shooter with carefully refined physics, then look elsewhere. As an avid Terraria fan, I think Starbound actually does a few things better. The customizable game options are pretty slick. There actually is a story mode, building and crafting are a lot quicker, the missions and quests are more prevalent and have more purpose, and there seems to be an online lobby or hub-like area where you can purchase items and embark on side quests.
<br>
<br>As far as what people consider Terraria clones go, this is definitely the best one out there. It is essentially Terraria in space with a few differences. If you can get past the clunky combat, this game is more than worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=5620281">Expand</a></span>

<br>Is it fun? I think so. Did I enjoy it more than Minecraft and Terraria? Yes I did. I really did. I enjoyed the feeling of exploration in this game. You come across so many NPC towns, cities and colonies. So many dungeons, so many quests. It feels like you are exploring a pre-existing universe, and not just dumped on a blank-slate planet and have to build it up yourself. I realize that&apos;s what a lot of people like about Minecraft and Terraria, and maybe that&apos;s why so many people went into Starbound expecting the same when it&apos;s actually quite different.
<br>
<br>But can I recommend this game in its current state? Hmm... There is no question that this is game, even in Early Access, is far better made than the majority of games I&apos;ve played in the last few years. The quality that went into this game puts Fallout 4 to shame, and that game had an enormous budget and a professional development team (Are you getting tired of indie games being vastly superior to AAA releases? Me too.)
<br>
<br>But I guess I can&apos;t ignore the elephant in the room any longer. Yes it is Early Access. It has been Early Access for 2 years now, and will probably remain in Early Access for a long, long time. Starbound is shaping up to give games like DayZ and Project Zomboid a run for their money in the &quot;Which game will be finished first&quot; race. Project Zomboid has been in Early Access for almost 5 years now and I think it&apos;s safe to say that Starbound will probably still be Early Access 3 years from now too. I have unfortunately ran into the EA wall a few times in Starbound. Heavy frame drops at random points, a lot of items in the game do not have their functions in place yet, racial traits are not in place yet... So on.
<br>
<br>Does that make it a bad game? No. It&apos;s still very enjoyable, and like I said it&apos;s remarkably high-quality. But Early Access... Pay full price for a game that may never be finished... I&apos;m sure many of us on Steam have fallen into that pit before and you probably don&apos;t want to put yourself in that position again. I can&apos;t blame you.
<br>
<br>Summary:
<br>
<br>As it stands, I enjoyed this game a lot. I enjoyed the sense of exploration and adventure. I enjoyed having one tool that mines, cuts down trees and destroys backgrounds. I enjoyed exploring NPC cities. I enjoyed having a ship you can make your home, and upgrade it to add more and more rooms. But I just can&apos;t recommend this game (Or any game) while it&apos;s stuck in Early Access. Especially if it has been stuck there for as long as this game has been. And there is a strong possibility that this game will never be finished.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=5999022">Expand</a></span>

Now I have been extremely patient waiting for a full release, and may have continued to do so, until I read that they have MILLIONS of dollars from gamers like myself yet the game is still far from being released!  I feel like I have been hornswaggled!  The Devs have used our hard earned money to purchase expensive plane tickets to England, for prime office space, and who knows what else, and the game has been pushed back for release until 2015?  That seems completely absurd! Top it all off with a recent progress post on Chucklefish forums from a head Dev that states he has no idea what the other Devs are exactly up to!  Look it up for yourself on the official forums! Never again will I invest in an early access game because of Starbound.  I don&apos;t think the game will ever be finalized.

It is worth it, and will continue to be as it develops more.
<br>
<br>There exists a lore for every character type as well, so the RPG elements are well polished for the build-stage this game is at, and will only get better.  And the npc encounters that recognize you as your race and engage you differently in many circumstances is fresh and non-repetitive.
<br>
<br>The exploration potential is boundless and fun, along with the building emphasis of stages based upon your completion of quests; very fun.  Jetting from planet to planet, system to system, makes the whole game seem never ending; very expansive.  Not to mention that I found myself wandering on the surface of various planets a lot more, which I personally enjoy, and within the depths to accumulate more resources, hidden caves and base structures which I could gain unexpected gear and weapons from.  The vast amount of weaponry and uniqueness to each one is simply brilliant.
<br>
<br>There is so much to see and accomplish in the game at the current stage, that I very much look forward to coming back to is with each developmental improvement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4963496">Expand</a></span>

<br>I bought this Game 2013 in Early Access, was hyped by the &quot;Future Feature List&quot;.

Eventually I played around 100hrs, with Friends on a Server, and a bit Singleplayer.

After all that, and around one Year later I can summarize it as follow:

Graphics are nice, sound and music are nice.
The Basic Ideas and concepts sound good in theory.

<br>
<br>After all that, and around one Year later I can summarize it as follow:
<br>
<br>Graphics are nice, sound and music are nice.
<br>The Basic Ideas and concepts sound good in theory.
<br>
<br>But:
<br>-For a Year now there are no new Updates. (besides silly valentines day items)
<br>-Performance is just incredible bad. Lag on High End Machines, unplayable on standard PCs.
<br>-Game Progression makes absolut no sense and is dull like hell.
<br>-Most of the random generated Items are totally worthless
<br>-Lots of Bugs and so many missing features...
<br>-NPCs are just senseless placeholders, most items are too.
<br>-Childish and whiteknighting community who defend all negative aspects to the death.
<br>-grindfest for getting to the next level, to start all over again to get to the next level, repeat...
<br>
<br>So in fact you spend alot of time mining material to build a nice house, city etc. from. But then you have nothing to do, no reason to explore the Universe etc.
<br>
<br>The Developers startet to make some other games meanwhile...honestly I think this game will never be finished.
<br>
<br>My advice would be to stay away till there is a really major update with some real progression and missions that make sense.
<br>
<br>It is some Fun in Multiplayer if you know the people you are play with, and have a powerful rig to handel the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4570301">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>That being said, it really is still in a very rough state and it is clear that it is far from finished. Once you have &apos;cleared&apos; the content that is available at the moment, there is not much or nothing in the way of dungeon crawling, questing etc.
<br>
<br>Yet I find the criticism displayed here unreasonable, because it actually does not criticise the game, but the development cycle. A game taking long to develop is actually not valid criticism of the quality of the game**
<br>
<br>If I judge what I have gotten for my money, which is 70-80h* of delightful gameplay for about 15&#x20AC; or so, then I can say that this is great value and has left me highly satisfied. Would I like to continue playing with more content? Hell yeah. But I&apos;ll have to wait till the game is properly out.
<br>
<br>*mostly coop. Probably would have been much shorter, if I had played entirely solo.
<br>
<br>** I am not suggesting that people cannot be rightfully upset at having the release date pushed multiple times if they have been fans of the first hour. But the rating should not reflect your estimate of how well the development progresses, but what the game offers right now in its current form &#x2014;&#xA0;which I personally find more then satisfying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4402105">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Decent presentation
<br>Good soundtrack
<br>For me runs better than it ever has before but I understand a lot of people are having problems with it. That being said it still has random frame drops on my machine. GTX 970, AMD FX-8350
<br>A lot of different loot and cool abilities
<br>Varied surface landscapes
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Incredibly poor UI decisions; draggable windows that don&apos;t stay put in between closing and pulling them back up, the hotbar can&apos;t be truly customized to put things where you&apos;d like them, inventory/options/crafting all accessed from separate buttons (this is an issue for me because this game is similar enough to terraria that the UI feels like it should be the same)
<br>The questing is generally terrible fetch/delivery quests
<br>The varied planet surfaces don&apos;t matter when you spend a large portion of time underground
<br>Mining and digging a straight tunnel is tedious
<br>The endless save wipes between every version (this doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re new but for anyone whose been playing since the early access release this is a problem)
<br>The whole game is a grind
<br>
<br>I could go on and on but honestly it&apos;s not worth it. If you&apos;ve played Terraria and think this looks good, just play Terraria again. All that being said if I have to give this game a score it gets a 3/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6569208">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Those who keep comparing it to Terraria really shouldn&apos;t. I hated Terraria, but I love Starbound because the focus seems more to do with exploration than &quot;survive this horrendous attack on your house&quot;, and the tools and crafting system seem more intuitive to me. Not to knock the survival genre game, but it&apos;s not my favourite, and Starbound has elements of combat within it, but it doesn&apos;t take away from the enjoyment of the game or lay waste to all your hard work within one bad blood moon attack.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d also like to add that multiplayer really adds more enjoyment to the game, just because everything&apos;s more fun with friends, you can also set yourselves interesting challenges with the power of your imagination, like who can terraform a planet faster, or who can build the biggest monstrous building in a set amount of time. The options are literally only as limited as your brain power ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=5408733">Expand</a></span>

It took a LOOOONNNG time for the game to come out, but the reason it took that long is because the community kept growing. The Developers (Chuckle Fish games) were flooded with money, the kick starter goal was annihilated (in a good way) and Chuckle Fish wanted to give the community, a game that was worth the money that the community had put in, and they did it. The music is some of the BEST MUSIC I have ever heard in video games, AND the music isn&apos;t loud and in your face its in the background as you&apos;re focusing on collecting ores or exploring an alien planet, this is competing with my favorite game AND one of the best games on Meta-Critic: Cave story. The art style is joyous to say the little detail is what pushes this game to a ten instead of a 9. Oh, and if you&apos;re reading: ignore the other reviews that say this game is a linear grind, because it&apos;s not. IT&apos;S THE BIGGEST METROID-VANIA THAT YOU HAVE EVER SEEN (sorry for the caps I had to get the point across). But at the same time it&apos;s not, its a RPG, and a Exploration, and a Terraria-LIKE game it doesn&apos;t copy Terraria but the Tier system is like it. I haven&apos;t even begun to talk about the Bosses (No Spoilers). All of them are different and unique, (No Spoilers) The Final Boss, while not being too hard, is FUN, it is PURE FUN, I won&apos;t talk about his attacks (even though i want to). The quests, while yes, SOME being fetch/Delivery quests, they make sense. The People who give you quests live on an asteroid, so it makes sense that they might need some Iron or some Silver, that just makes sense to me. Sorry for rambling on this long, if you couldn&apos;t tell I really like the game, so I&apos;ll end this here with one last thing:

<br>It&apos;s Terraria inspired and it looks like Terraria but people who played both games will know the difference but games is really a game of it&apos;s own not a Terraria clone. Biggest weakpoints of the game are:
<br>-Interactions both with characters and items/blocks and the inability to hit something under you with weapons
<br>-Bad story it&apos;s just bad
<br>If you can overcome this flaws you will enjoy the game and you can look forward to updates with a lot of content that will give you another reason to explore. Also this  game features a good multiplayer system where you can have tons of fun with friends.
<br>Best qualities of the game are:
<br>-Variety in combat, as i have said numerous weapons and great variety of enemies to defeat each with it&apos;s special attacks.
<br>-Music just good soundtrack for me at least
<br>-Art style it looks very nice and it&apos;s enjoyable to explore those beatyful looking worlds
<br>-Lot of content
<br>-One of the closest things to No man&apos;s sky with a galaxy to explore (lot smaller honestly) but if you are not able to play No man&apos;s sky this is game for you
<br>Conclusion: Starbound is a game with rocky start that&apos;s why there are so many bad reviews but now it&apos;s actually enjoyable game. Rare game that acutally isn&apos;t much overpriced. If you decide to buy it you can have tons of fun from it&apos;s many features from fun multiplayer to good singleplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6579555">Expand</a></span>

The beginning of the game I was motivated to play. Soon after, the game becomes repetitive as you progress, the controls become cumbersome. It really lacks true depth. I get a slight lag when there is lot going on and slows my movement down to change equipment that causes me to die.
<br>There is infinite building but you can&apos;t get the detail easily and no benefit building on these worlds.  Just a standard building game.  I can&apos;t seem to get the benefit of more crewman either.
<br>The last boss is virally impossible for me at least since it&apos;s near impossible to dodge and the lag slows my play down just enough that I can&apos;t heal by one click or even two clicks of the mouse.
<br>Overall, becomes boring and the controls are too cumbersome for boss battles.   What a disappointment.  The critics score is too high.  Less than average game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6924193">Expand</a></span>

I purchased it when it originally released on Steam over a year ago, progress has been laughably slow for a game that has made millions of dollars on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access. I still find it amazing that they could not have hired just a few more people to work on the game and get content pushed out at a decent rate. There are &apos;nightly&apos; builds, which are as you can imagine very regular releases, but they are not stable and typically result in crashes. The community surrounding the game is horrendous, devote fanboys on one end, and those who feel swindled on the other. There is supposedly a large update coming out first quarter of this year, but if it&apos;s like anything like I&apos;ve come to expect from Chuckelfish.. Well, I&apos;m not holding my breath. Would strongly recommend against purchasing this game and supporting poor developers.

Yes it&apos;s nice, graphics are calming music is soothing but I don&apos;t want to call it a game.

If this, or early access, are potential bugaboos for you, I&apos;d recommend waiting until the full 1.0 release. That said, let&apos;s get to the review.
<br>
<br>First off, we&apos;ll talk aesthetics. Chucklefish has opted for a 2D style pixel graphics art style, with fairly fluid animations, cursor facing, scrolling skyboxes and backgrounds. There&apos;s multiple races to choose from, each with their own unique characteristics, styles and backstories. (Some of which have barely been touched on, but you&apos;ll get a rough estimate from some opening flavor texts, and by collecting unique logs through out the game.) It&apos;s bright, it&apos;s colorful, it&apos;s fluid.
<br>
<br>Mechanically, it&apos;s very similar to Terraria and Minecraft, only on a much larger scale, as crafting, building, smithing, tech and many other collectables, furnishings, weapons and tools can be crafted from various ores, or combinations of resources. (Oil + iron = steel, and so forth.) You are given a ship that you must collect items to repair, and a set of missions to get you acclimated to what the game will require you to succeed at in order to progress. The downside, is that while the game is more fully fleshed out than during the prior versions, a lot of it is still barren and buggy, which is a shame, because there&apos;s definitely a ton of potential. Combat is done in one of two ways, melee, or ranged. Melee offers a variety of weapons, daggers, swords, axes and spears, some of which can be found in chests throughout the planets you visit and mine. Ranged is guns, beam weapons, bowguns, and hunting bows, some of which can be upgraded. Lastly, tools. Tools are important, but the newest update has dropped the durability of practically all of them, which forces you to carry spares that don&apos;t stack, which has dropped their importance to upgrading your matter manipulator. Mining plays a HUGE role in this game, and is probably one of its biggest time sinks, as a mechanic. That said, the upside is that the rate of occurence of unique tombs, bases, new underground biomes and other encounters has increased since the last update. Obviously, this entire mechanic is still quite tedious, especially considering how tools have been nerfed.
<br>
<br>Now I&apos;ll touch on music and sound, which, in my opinion, is meant to be charming, and instruments have actually been in the game for quite some time, which allows your character to play bits of music in the game. It adds flavor, if nothing else.
<br>
<br>Now I&apos;ll summarize. The bits and pieces of a great game are here. The rate of which the dev team is tying those pieces together, has been slow and tedious. There has been a massive addition of content added during the big update, but unfortunately, so have a lot of new bugs, some of which stonewall progress. If they were just annoying visual glitches, I&apos;d dismiss them, but some of them are runtime crashes during missions. That&apos;s a major no-no, and something their QA should have caught before the update. I&apos;m giving this a solid 6 of 10 as of right now. My recommendation is to wait until it&apos;s closer to being finished and bug free.

There is so much lore to the game that you could write a book as long as Harry Potter 5 for every piece of it. This is by far my favorite game, and I would recommend this to anyone that likes science fiction. This game is like a cross between Terraria and Startrek,  and it is filled with so many hilarious references. I absolutely ADORE this game and everyone that likes Science fiction will to.

Differences (positive, negative, or neutral, your choice) include: Different species to choose from... the crafting system isn&apos;t as complex... there are more NPCs... it&apos;s slightly more quest-oriented... and it&apos;s in space...
<br>
<br>It costs more than Terraria so I suggest waiting for a Steam sale if you want to pick it up.
<br>
<br>Final thoughts: It&apos;s not original in the slightest. It costs more than Terraria so if you want to check it out wait for a sale. It won&apos;t take that many in-game hours to see most everything so it&apos;s not really worth $15. That said it&apos;s pretty fun for about a week so it gets a pass by a narrow margin.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=5468601">Expand</a></span>

<br>The community is good, the gameplay is good, but in my experiences the game really shines as a roleplaying platform. The assets are very numerous, it&apos;s possible to change each individual color on any piece of clothing (with a third-party web-app called SBSE) and the RP communities are great. It&apos;s incredibly easy to create custom assets (such as guns, etc) that EVERYONE can see without needing mods, and is overall a very highly moddable game. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good adventure, and especially people who like RPing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=5540995">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What makes this game differ from an incredibly similar game like Terraria? One thing major thing that caught my eye was the animations. They&apos;re beautiful, bouncy and fun to look at. Even swinging a sword feels good. Another major difference is that this ones more surface-based. You&apos;ll be finding yourself wandering on the surface a lot more which I personally enjoy, considering you may encounter npcs like avians or glitches, which are actually birds and robots.
<br>
<br>I encourage anyone questioning whether or not to purchase this to not be off put by reviews that say it&apos;s not worth it because its a Terraria clone. Many have said the same thing about Terraria and Minecraft in fact, that Terraria is just a 2D clone of Minecraft, which depending on your definition, really isn&apos;t. I say take a risk, spend a few bucks, and have a great time exploring the universe. Creativeness bursts within this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=4202616">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>
<br>- The music is excellent, and the game sounds great overall
<br>- The art style is fun
<br>- The variety of weapons (although the combat mechanics make this almost meaningless)
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>
<br>- The inventory system - which should be the core of a game with thousands of items - is badly broken. This is after years of testing. There are now five separate inventory screens, and the UI that controls them is clunky and frustrating. Items that used to stack no longer do, which leads to inventory crowding almost immediately.
<br>- The story is bland and unoriginal. This would be fine if it wasn&apos;t a mandatory part of the early-game, but you&apos;re now required to run the same broken dungeon you were in beta before you can do any real exploring. It still sucks.
<br>- The quest hub/town area has undergone only cosmetic changes since early beta, only now there&apos;s a story dungeon sloppily cobbled onto it.
<br>- You now drop healing items and other important items on death on the normal difficulty mode, which adds a layer of meaningless frustration.
<br>- Combat is the same &apos;try not to let the monster hit you&apos; snoozefest as before, only now you sometimes have functional weapons when they aren&apos;t glitching out.
<br>- Enemy variety was supposedly going to be huge, but I found myself running into the same six aliens over and over. I guess this got scrapped?
<br>
<br>I know $15 isn&apos;t very expensive, but considering how much money these developers made through early access and what a long development cycle this had...I expected much more. Unless Starbound gets the fixes it still needs and an almost complete inventory/combat overhaul, I see no reason to come back.

<br>It&apos;s a terraria, with some significant differences. Fighting and building are more separated. On planets, you don&apos;t fight much. There is fighting, just not a lot. There you dig, explore and build. Then, there are missions and instances, where you are not allowed to build or dig, where the real fighting takes place.
<br>
<br>Another major difference is that you improve your armor like in terraria, by crafting, but weapons are all found exploring. It&apos;s much more centered around exploring than terraria. On the other hand, there&apos;s less variety in useful items than terraria. I would say starbound has more blocks and decorative items, but it has less real usefull items (still has a lot).
<br>
<br>IMO 1.0 starbound is a very polished game and an awesome experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6575115">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unlike other games in the similar vein, Starbound</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Starbound is one of the finest examples of a game with loads of ambition that, through lots of hard work and dedication from both the player and the developers, manages to be both addictive and engaging. It&#x2019;s a game that gives back what you put into it: Gives you the chance to let you experience the massive universe how you so choose.
<br>
<br>Unlike other games in the similar vein, Starbound actually manages to have a Story behind it. Unfortunately (yet not exactly surprisingly) the story itself isn&#x2019;t interesting or meaningful. Between predictable and tired apocalyptic stakes, boring villains running an unironically and equally as boring cult, and ancient all-powerful evil and six macguffins to drive the &#x201C;plot&#x201D; forward; The story only serves to be an ultimate end goal to slowly work your way towards.
<br>
<br>Thankfully what truly drives the experience, and what the developers wisely chose to focus their efforts on is the universe itself. Vast and expansive, varied in both scope and content, filled to the brim with characters of many kinds. There&#x2019;s no two places exactly alike, and there&#x2019;s so much to explore and find.
<br>
<br>But more importantly, the game encourages you to experiment with how you interact with the world and play whichever way you choose: Whether to be a heroic space Bounty Hunter working together with your crew to trifle evil wherever you go, a lonely Asteroid Miner treading carefully among the depths of space to make a profit, or a humble farmer doing nothing but working their homestead; There is a multitude of ways to tackle the universe. It&#x2019;s just a shame that the story missions themselves seem to only be about killing and destruction. The game would have benefited greatly if they had introduced more variety with the main missions. As an aside; Between the easy multiplayer and the very robust, simple to use modding system the game supports both serve a great benefit, providing the game with potentially infinite content and hours and hours of fun with your friends.
<br>
<br>Packed with charm and wit, a vast universe, and so much to create and explore, Starbound has eventually become one of the most compelling experiences in a long time, and while it isn&apos;t perfect, I don&#x2019;t plan on quitting any time soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6645653">Expand</a></span>

This game did have a long period of early access, yes, but what many people forget is that this is an indie game that only charges a fourth of the price of a full game release and still managed to actually deliver a full game&apos;s worth of content. It&apos;s arguable whether this game would actually be worth $60, but its $15 asking price for an entire universe of sandbox planets to explore that all feel both familiar and unique, seven interesting races with dozens of codex entries that flesh out their background, a full-length campaign that integrates with your exploration to encourage traversing the universe, a crew system that gives unique followers and passive bonuses based on who you recruit, and full mod support for the community to do practically whatever they&apos;d like with all of this... I honestly couldn&apos;t ask for much more beyond making the game fully 3D, but No Man&apos;s Sky seems to indicate that that may not be such a good idea.
<br>
<br>Starbound integrates Role-Playing with sandbox and exploration in such a unique way and only has a $15 asking price. For the over 400 hours of enjoyment I&apos;ve gotten out of it, I would be doing it a disservice to not rate it a full 10. It&apos;s been a long journey through the stars for me, and I can forsee a longer yet one in the years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6629874">Expand</a></span>

<br>(e.g. space combat or mechs - though you can easily get mech using mods)
<br>it delivers a satisfying and funny experience to the player.
<br>
<br>Simply put: 2d art is gorgeous, combat is compelling and fun (wide array of weapon types), crafting is good (many recipes, blocks, upgradeable crafting stations, wiring for advanced building).
<br>Overall, the game is quite polished and fully enjoyable.
<br>
<br>The feeling? It&apos;s Great too: having a spaceship to &quot;freely roam&quot; the space while exploring new planets - where you&apos;ll often find caves, outposts, chests, and interesting stuff in general - really gets you involved and willing to spend lot of hours on the game.
<br>
<br>8/10, highly recommended!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starbound/user-reviews?user_review_id=6584769">Expand</a></span>
