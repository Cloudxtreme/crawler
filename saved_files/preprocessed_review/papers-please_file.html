It has become one of my favorite and most memorable games of all time right beside games like Baldur&apos;s Gate 2 and the Half Life series. It is an extremely bleak and depressing game that really makes you appreciate everything. The sound is great and I will never forget the sound of the horn. The gameplay is very simple but detail oriented. At first glance it seems quite boring but the stakes are so high that you try to counterbalance speed and thoroughness in order to make it to the next day. It is one of the few games I have ever played that I would consider a masterpiece and possibly even art. It is enthralling and it sucks you in in a way that no other game really does. If you want a unique experience give it a shot and see if it grabs you because it is unlike everything else on the market now or that I can remember.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3410156">Expand</a></span>

For a game that looks like it does, it does quite well for itself. It&apos;s really innovative and I&apos;ve never played anything like it; as an immigration inspector, you must determine the validity of each person&apos;s a passport and supporting documents by comparing them to rules and regulations given to you  you can eye most of the stuff, but if you aren&apos;t sure there is an &quot;inspection tool&quot; that allows you to know for sure if a discrepancy is found. Sometimes errors can be easy to spot like and expired passport, sometimes it&apos;s a bit trickier like a person&apos;s name or weight being incorrect. The game makes things more complex as you progress, but one of the problems I had is that the only way to tell if the gender is correct is by using the inspection tool, no thanks in part to the graphics. Overall, a very well-made game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3418501">Expand</a></span>

I also loved how the game always added new challenges and rules, by the end of the game, it was one of the most challenging games I&apos;ve played in a while without having to fire a gun. The game surely isn&apos;t superb being that it doesn&apos;t drive you any further than your first journey and the ending, while being 20 of them, falls short. Regardless, Papers Please is worthy of Glory to Arstotzka.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=4519815">Expand</a></span>

It has been well described by others so I will just say it may not be a game I play for 40 hours but it IS a game I will tell all my friends about and I will remember some of the things that happened in it long after generic shooter #213 and generic RP #695 are both long forgotten.  So totally worth the ten bucks.</span>

Set in the fictional communist country of Arstotzka, you take the role of an immigration inspector at a border checkpoint. You must look over documents and use various tools in order to keep spies, smugglers and other unwanted bad people out of the country all while on the clock. On top of this you have to make enough money to support your family and survive yourself.
<br>
<br>Will you follow the rules or turn to taking bribes to make ends meet? It may sound easy and perhaps even boring, but trust me that once you dive in it is really exciting.

It&apos;s elegantly designed, plays well, and makes me want to keep coming back for more.  It has a story mode with 20 endings and an &quot;endless&quot; mode.  I&apos;ve found that doing the right thing in the story mode doesn&apos;t always get you a good outcome, and it&apos;s left me laughing more than once.  I&apos;ve also found myself moving too fast and swearing when I get written up for missing one of the many details that can be wrong, but if you don&apos;t move fast enough, you won&apos;t make enough money to take care of your family.  It&apos;s a great combination of both the need for speed and the need for accuracy that makes it work.

A game where all you do is approve or deny people to go through a fictional city named Arstotzka seemed creative but a bit boring. But I risked it and bought it. And I was taken by surprise how invigorating it was! There&apos;s a unique storyline you follow through  you can do tasks for the mysterious force of EZIC, or continue giving glory to Arstotzka. I admit, this game eventually gets boring and is not something you will spend 800 hours playing. But it&apos;s a concept that surprisingly bodes well with retro graphics and will keep you refreshed for a while, but again, the longevity of the game and the re-playability is a problem that is needed to be solved, even with the endless mode you can play after having fun with the storyline.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3639312">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Whats not to love? Characters bribing you and illegal yet emotionally effecting or those who pay you higher than your actual paycheck will bring challenge into the game. It may be called &quot;retro&quot;, but its old-school and something you can always go back to. Even though it does get repetitive, boredom is at a respected minimum thanks to the story. A strong, good story, which blew me away. The realism doesn&apos;t get ridiculous and just gets challenging and more and more lovable. Entry or deny; you feel like making a huge decision with just stamping one passport late into the game, with a great ending(s), depending on what YOU chose to do. It gives you so much choice and power. For the cheap price and upcoming fun for new players, go and buy it. You won&apos;t regret.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3641940">Expand</a></span>

<br>You play as an immigration/border control officer, and it&apos;s your responsibility to allow or deny people into your country. If someone gets into the country with false info, or if you turn away a valid candidate for entry, you get fined. Money is tight, you are the only person supporting your immediate and extended family.

<br>This game forces you to reflect on what kind of person you are, and how you view people around you. Do you worry only about yourself and your family? What about the wife who couldn&apos;t get a passport and will be killed if she&apos;s turned away? There are no easy choices, but you must make them.

Papers, Please is a game where you play as a border inspector, checking over paperwork, looking for inconsistencies, and making choices that impact many lives, including those of your family.
<br>
<br>The gameplay can get intense at times as you hurry to process as many people correctly as possible. Papers, Please had me hooked very quickly, and never let go. I&apos;m planning to continue playing even though I&apos;ve beaten the story twice, just to get all the endings and maybe try out endless mode. There&apos;s not much music, but what&apos;s there is great and fits the game incredbily well. The graphics are beautiful. Arstotska is mostly devoid of color, and this game looks as it should. The game controls almost entirely with the mouse, allowing keyboard shortcuts if you have the money to buy them and increase your efficiency.
<br>
<br>I picked up Papers, Please at full price, and it was absolutely worth it. This is one of the best indie games I&apos;ve played, and I think it&apos;s absolutely worth $10. I&apos;d recommend it to just about anyone.
<br>
<br>Note: the game has a little non-sexual nudity that can be disabled in the options.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3602042">Expand</a></span>

It wasn&apos;t the checking papers that made me like it so much, but the small moral dilemmas of every day life you are presented with during the game. Should you let this person through even if they have the right papers? Sometimes you simply didn&apos;t make enough money to pay for heating in your house. It&apos;s interesting, and the most enjoyable part is seeing who you have to check papers for next. Also, the reason why your country gets more strict on security.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a cheap, simple game that is refreshing. You have to think during the game, but it isn&apos;t stressful.

<br>
<br>You play a citizen of Arstotzka, which exists in the game&apos;s fictitious world (though with very obvious links to our real world), and you have been chosen as the border inspector of your area. Your job is to ensure that all authorized persons get in and all unauthorized persons don&apos;t. At least, as far as the Ministry of Labor is concerned.
<br>
<br>You can&apos;t neglect your personal life, however. You still have a family to take care of. And since you get paid by the person rather than by the hour, you must either work quickly and accurately, or you&apos;ll lose everything.
<br>
<br>Over your new career, you can expect to meet lots of interesting people. Some have lost their passport. Some are looking for other people. Some are criminals. And you&apos;re the one who casts the final word on whether they enter your country or not.
<br>
<br>This is the only game I&apos;ve played in which a LACK of quality-of-life features actually works TOWARDS the overall feel of the game. It puts an astounding amount of effort to emulate the job of border inspector, down to every motion. Papers have to be clicked and dragged to open and read them, and stamps have to be applied, and then papers have to be handed back to the entrant. A similar game could have just had you click on one of two buttons labeled &quot;Approve&quot; and &quot;Deny&quot; to automate the process, but I feel that NOT doing that helped the overall feel.
<br>
<br>Always remember: Glory to Arstotzka.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3585868">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay of the game consists entirely of examining documents given to you by immigrants and attempting to figure out if they are lying about their information, forged, their documents, etc. This means looking at tiny numbers, comparing them to other numbers, comparing the person and their mugshot (which may or may not look the same, but the game considers the same person), and occasionally dealing with situations that dramatically alter the story of the game, which is actually quite good.
<br>
<br>This novelty is fun for the first few levels, when you are just cycling through numbers, comparing weights, heights, hairstyles, etc. However, the game quickly becomes unreasonable in what it asks. You see, this isn&apos;t a puzzler. You don&apos;t have your own time to figure these out.
<br>
<br>Your character is essentially paid on commission, and for every person that goes through, he gets money. For every character that goes through and shouldn&apos;t, or ones that should go through but you turn away, you are issued a citation and fined. This means that you can&apos;t buy upgrades and you can&apos;t take your money home to your family. Mess up enough times, and your family is put to death by the government.
<br>
<br>This completely asinine ticking clock mechanics makes the game extremely stressful in a not fun way, as you cycle through person after person, trying to match up upwards of 10 sets of rules (needs specific symbol on password, needs three forms of ID if native, two if immigrant, heights match, dates match, diplomats don&apos;t require ID, etc), which gets massively tedious incredibly quickly.
<br>
<br>I am a guy who loves a good story, and the story of this game really gripped me. However, the gameplay is shallow, boring, and literally just irritating. You can call it meta or whatever you want, but at the end of the day, this is a tedious game with irritating rules and a great story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=4172568">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But then this game becomes more complex. You&apos;re stuck at a job, not even making enough money to keep your family warm and fed, when someone offers you a bribe to let them in. Should you do the right thing and detain them? Or should you take the money to buy the medicine that your son so desperately needs?
<br>
<br>I was shocked when I had to scan one of the immigrants so see if they were hiding any contraband and a fuzzy, dark, nude picture of them appears on my desk. The picture was so invasive, it reminded me instantly of a country where the people have no rights.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a surprisingly emotional game, with complex moral decisions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3622063">Expand</a></span>

Once you start playing though it actually has a way of pulling you in to the story and the consequences for you decisions. The game starts off easy enough, don&apos;t let this fool you though, as the game progresses there is a lot to take into consideration before letting someone though. You are paid on a per person basis and this forces you to try and balance getting the people through as fast as you can while trying to not let anything bad slip though. The game is semi-forgiving and you are allowed two mess ups a day, this sounds like plenty but you&apos;d be surprised how many things will slip right past you. Right now you can get it on Steam for only $9.99 and for all the fun that the game provides that is a very low price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3420072">Expand</a></span>

<br>I didn&apos;t expect to be this satisfied with it. The game play itself has a lot of details that makes it more interesting. The token idea, making every decision you take, whether agreeing with the law or going with your judgement counts !
<br>Too bad the &quot;campaign&quot; is short.
<br>Congratulations on delivering such a fun game. Still replaying </span>

<br>
<br>I love how in this game tells us about the communist country we have to &apos;Glorify&apos; and support it by working as the border control. We have to investigate the people who attempt to pass into our country, catch criminals on the run, secretly work with the revolutionary group, and collect income to provide for our own family. The best part is, we have to do all of this at a simply desk job!
<br>
<br>What I love best is have the game mechanics tells us that it is hard to do the kind things for people, as it would put you and your family at risk. I remember this one moment (P.S. SPOILER AHEAD!) when I allowed a man in, but he asked if I could allow his wife in as well, who did not have the right paperwork to enter. She begged me to let her in, otherwise she would be killed when she returns to her own country. But if I were to allow her in, I would not be my income rate to pay for rent, food and heat so that my family would survive. The game pressured me to do my job correctly or I would fail.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, this thrilling documentary game has given me a lot to think about when it comes to moral choices, as I think it really can bring out the true sides of your character without telling me if I did the right thing. This game is a real masterpiece and I think everyone should pick it up!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3524141">Expand</a></span>

<br>We proved this man with the nickname  3909! It is so accurate puncher displayed the work that creates a feeling as if he had it worked! Stunning meticulousness. Imagine this exciting picture: You&apos;re looking at documents of another immigrants, try to do it quickly, because at home you will find a sick son of a terrible disease, and the more documents you check the more money you earn, but only because of the fact that the person whom you do not have the right to put (a flaw in the documents) begs you to let him offer more money, but maybe you will calculate and take away jobs because of taking bribes, but need money for treatment! And here you are torn. That in such moments you realize what&apos;s special about this very unusual game. An unforgettable story of a nameless puncher </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3527484">Expand</a></span>

<br>Lucas Pope is a genius. The perfect match between simulation and graphic adventure.  A game made by a one-person team succeeds where many AAA blockbusters fail (Heavy Rain, for example).
<br>
<br>Ok, maybe it&apos;s not for everyone. It requires little patience and gets harder and harder. But still is not hardcore gaming. It&apos;s art, in the form of a video-game. It make you feel lots of stuff, not very seen in any other title. Emotions like self-shame, or guilt.
<br>
<br>You will like this game if you  are:
<br>
<br>-a big fan of old school graphic adventures, but  sick of almost every new title that just repeats the same formula.
<br>-a casual gamer who enjoys repetitive game play with great difficult curve
<br>-reader of classic science fiction novels like 1984
<br>-a citizen in a post-USSR dictatorship
<br>-an art lover, a humanist, who wants to know of new and exciting ways to express anger against governments with humour
<br>
<br>Just one advice: Bigger impact if you know nothing about the game. So, do not read too many reviews!
<br>
<br>Game Play and Mechanics: Challenging and entertaining.
<br>Plot: Not only good but perfectly integrated in game experience too.
<br>Graphics: Perfect. Couldn&apos;t serve better its purpose.
<br>Sound: Good. Just one song, lots of silence. Cheesy sound fx. Like graphics, it is what it has to be.
<br>Fun: Tones. And many other emotions too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3782774">Expand</a></span>

<br>The design in this game is genial, to say the least. While the objective in the entire game remains the same  whether to allow or deny someone to pass the checkpoint, each level there is a new feature that keeps you on your guard. The graphics are humble, but in some way it actually helps portray the grim atmosphere that a border guard in a Communist country feels. The story, while there isn&apos;t that much of it up front, is still presented in pieces and is well thought. But the most amazing feature in this game is that it actually makes you think, what are you willing to do to survive? Are you willing to deny access to an innocent individual so that your family can get heating for the winter?
<br>Overall, this game deserves all the praise it receives. Truly an innovative, moving marvel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3829506">Expand</a></span>

Papers, Please is an interesting game, unlike everything you have saw before. This game has you dealing with choices which can affect someone&apos;s life to either become better or worse, example, there&apos;s a guy escaping from his country with his wife, his passport has no problems, however his wife&apos;s passport has, so now you have to choose either if you will to let her pass or not. The game is pretty difficult, requiring full attetion of the player into the game. The game starts simple and gets harder, but not into unfair hard, but fair hard, because if you do something wrong it is your fault not the game&apos;s fault. Overall this game gets a 9/10 to me, while the game is good, it is not something that everyone will like about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3900313">Expand</a></span>

Played for 2 hours and only saw one of the 20 endings. Great replay value topped by a lot of potential for DLCs, Steam Workshop and upgrades. Bravo!</span>

<br>
<br>This is a game where you play as an immigration officer, determining the outcome of immigrants coming in to this bad bad country that you work with. Its soooo much better than it sounds. You check inconsistencies in people&apos;s passport. Eg: if a passport has a wrong country of issue, whether a person is male or female based on a misinformation (which leads to some hillarity when you found out that a person that looks like a woman turns out to be a guy), and bust some drug smugglers. The further you get to the game, the more it becomes interesting. You can get access to a gun because of a terrorist attack, or defuse a bomb. Also there are moments where some people doesn&apos;t have a valid document, but they are begging you to let them in. So in some of these cases its up to you if you want to be a dick or have a heart and let them in. Its a nice little touch that keeps me playing the game, for 3 hours straight i might add, and there&apos;s 20 different endings, which demands a lot of replayability.
<br>
<br>One complaint that I have with the game is that sometimes checking for inconsistencies can be annoying, especially during the later missions where immigrants needs a passport, permit, a personal height and weight information, so you have to have a high attention to detail because one simple mistake can cost you. A couple of times I got penalized just because the person&apos;s gender is wrong, or his height and weight is wrong, right after I checked if his country of issue, his work permit, passport expiry date and reasons of entering the country is right. But once you get experienced enough to detect those tiny flaws, the game becomes so much fun.
<br>
<br>One of the most interesting game I have ever played in my life, and certainly one of the best games in 2013. I would give this game a rating of so awesome I will play this again and again. Now then, I&apos;ll go back to stamping people&apos;s passports</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3410953">Expand</a></span>

A small slipup and this game could have EASILY become repetitive, but he polished it so well (a bit of unique dialog here, a side-goal there) that it never actually feels that way.  This is exactly what I game should be.  I don&apos;t think this game could really be improved upon at all.</span>

<br>
<br>Multiple endings? Check
<br>Great storyline? Check
<br>Tokens aka collector&apos;s badges? Check
<br>Increasing difficulty? Check
<br>Great 8-bit graphics? Check
<br>
<br>Game has very high repeat value and you can play again and again with different decisions and everything. Now go buy the game!</span>

<br>First. This IS a puzzle game. Now you might go &quot;Darn, I heard it was good. Nevermind.&quot; Or &quot;YES.&quot; If you said the former I feel bad for you.
Second. The story... That&apos;s all there is to say.
Third. Interface is pretty cool.

<br>Final. The feel around this game. It&apos;s not a very funny game. It&apos;s either viewed as dark and/or dramatic.
<br>Con(?)
<br>It gets exponentially harder each day.
<br>But hopefully you don&apos;t shy away from a challenge. ;P
<br>
<br>Conclusion...
<br>One of the best games of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3417923">Expand</a></span>

You basically choose whether to be the good border officer, that falls for the sad stories or the bad border officer, that strictly follows the rules. But at the end of the day, you just need to keep your family alive and get through the struggle of being an Arstotzkan citizen. Well done Lucas Pope, well done.

I dunno, I couldn&apos;t get past 20 minutes and I restarted two or three times and always abandoned at the approximate same place  there was nothing happening.Nice try though. Two starts for being unique, otherwise zero.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3821014">Expand</a></span>

During the first hour or two of playtime it&apos;s easy to find yourself immersed in the dystopian fictional world and curious about what will happen next. However, after a while you realize that there is very little variety in terms of the scenarios that present themselves. Assuming you manage to stay on the good side of your superiors, this lack of variety leads to sessions that drag on and on and become extremely tedious.
<br>
<br>After reaching the end of any given playthrough there&apos;s little point in playing again. The only changes you&apos;ll encounter are when you get to choose a slightly different path by allowing somebody&apos;s wife through (or not), confiscating a diplomat&apos;s passport (or not), and so on. The differences in outcome are minor at best and certainly not worth 30-60 minutes of drudgery as you click through endless piles of documents.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s presentation is bare bones, but I think the audio and visual style works well and accomplishes what it sets out to do. The interface is decent, although the small space you have to work with means getting papers lost under other ones and lots of annoyance as you go digging for whatever it is you&apos;re looking for. The system for finding discrepancies is a fairly opaque at first, which will lead to frustration as you wonder how to properly execute your instructions. Even later on this can be an issue at times as the demands you&apos;re placed under become more and more complex.
<br>
<br>I think Papers, Please is an interesting experiment and worth at least playing around with for a few hours. I&apos;d definitely wait for it to go on sale though. I just don&apos;t think most people will find enough enjoyment here to justify paying full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3490847">Expand</a></span>

Also, as mentioned in other reviews, checking height and weight is both difficult to do if you weren&apos;t brought up in the metric system and mechanically frustrating (I knew someone was a wrong weight but I couldn&apos;t call them out on it). That being said, this game is incredibly fun to play. 20 different endings is nice and all, but each day is scripted and rewards/punishments are always the same, making for about two legit replays for the intelligent player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3412343">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is entirely based around being presented with information and then having to verify that the information matches criteria specified at the start of each day. A typical early scenario would involve being handed an ID card and a work permit. You would have to check the following information; same ID/name on both papers, dates are correct, photo on ID matches the person handing it to you. After that, check the immigration rules for the day  make sure people are allowed to enter from that country. And that is it  all you do is pattern match. If that sounds like fun, give it a try. If your brain isn&apos;t wired to find pattern-matching fun, avoid like the plague.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3603148">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But here is the catch, it&apos;s not 1995, the standards for released games are much higher than it were. No longer can a game like this shine when it has the likes of Red Dead Redemption, Europa Universalis IV, and Bioshock to compete against. It&apos;s addictive, it relies on oneself to solve the oh so mighty question of whether this dear old Kolechian lady is trying to get away with cheating the system, and it&apos;s really fun because of it.
<br>
<br>But it&apos;s no masterpiece, it&apos;s no 9/10. It can&apos;t be, not anymore. It&apos;s time could have been 20 years ago. And before you dismiss my review, I get the whole retro look, the Indie scene, and all that, I just don&apos;t use it as a get out of jail card.
<br>
<br>Ten hours into the game, and I&apos;m done, I will never look back on it. It&apos;s not a jewel, it&apos;s a fake renaissance painting, and everyone is falling for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3439707">Expand</a></span>

You are an immigration officer, charged with determining who to let into the fictional Eastern European communist country of Arstotzka. Even the genre of the game is rather hard to pin down; ultimately, the game boils down to trying to find inconsistencies in the papers, making it a puzzle game of sorts, but it somehow lends checking people&#x2019;s paperwork an air of great gravity and tension, even if the actual activity itself is rather boring.
<br>
<br>I don&#x2019;t know if you can really say that Papers, Please is a fun game; there is a great feeling of tension throughout, and yet also of monotony. Somehow, you feel obligated to keep your faceless family members alive; somehow, you feel like the question of a bribe is a real one that has real weight; somehow, you feel like what you&#x2019;re doing is important. And yet, ultimately, you&#x2019;re just checking paperwork and determining whether or not to let people through based on the paperwork and your own feelings about the situation.
<br>
<br>It is definitely an engaging experience, but I&apos;m not sure if I can really say that I had fun playing it, apart from the interactions with Jorji and the tasks I did for EZIC. But I still played all the way through without putting it down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=4343438">Expand</a></span>

In fact it takes a very simple concept; paperwork in increasing quantities and of increasing complexity; and asks that you check it against existing guidelines for mistakes or falsehoods. At first it is about as exciting as it sounds. But then the pressures of getting this tedium out of the way quickly so you can service as many people during a shift as possible, in order to pay your bills, and of doing it without mistakes so you won`t be fined start to kick in. The more rules you have to observe and the more papers have to be shown by every person entering your booth the harder it gets to keep things moving along. Rush and you`ll make mistakes and get fined. Be too conscientious and you won`t have time to get enough people through customs, or indeed rejected for some discrepancy. It is a fascinating process to go through, and at the end of it you must necessarily have developed your own system for checking all the facts you need to check in a timely and organized fashion, or it`s just not going to be possible.
<br>Just listing all the possible mistakes you can make in the sea of papers and procedures this game throws at you would be too long. Wrong gender on the passport, wrong picture, wrong name on the work visa, wrong date on the access pass, wrong city of issue on the passport, bomb strapped to leg which you couldn`t find. It is endless but all just natural and inevitable consequences of the complexity of the concept. Which is basically monotonous paperwork at a border crossing. It should be neither fun or engaging but somehow it manages to be. At least for a while.
<br>
<br>I would score it higher like all the hipsters are doing. But the game suffers from a distinct lack of replayability. Not that it necessarily needs it. It is obviously amongst other things a political and social statement which also forces some stark moral choices on the player as it goes along. But replaying the same days over again becomes less and less alluring with each new start until you just call it a day at some point. I got to day 21 (Out of 30 I believe) before I was arrested on my last game. And I just couldn`t face going through all those days one more time, just so I could see the last week and a half.

I was very skeptical about buying this but having picked it up in the Steam sale for &#xA3;3.49; I feel like I&apos;ve robbed the developer has it certainly warrants a full price purchase.
<br>
<br>The game sees you working on the desk as a new immigration inspector at a border checkpoint for the fictitious country of Arstotzka. Your responsibility is to allow or deny people entry based on their passports. You make money at the end of each day to support your family and any mistakes you make affect your wage.
<br>
<br>At first the game seems really simple as you stamp passports based on people&apos;s rights to entry whilst looking for any discrepancies on their documents e.g fake photo, expired passport, but the game gradually builds and new conditions for entrance eligibility change such as foreigners not allowed in. The criteria for entrance alters every day so you have to keep your wits about who you let in at that specific time. It really keeps you focused and you will make mistakes which affects your pay. Attention to detail and a speedy service adds to the strange addiction this game provides.
<br>
<br>The retro backdrop and 80&apos;s Russian-inspired atmosphere really adds to the game as a novel and surprisingly enjoyable title. It&apos;s like a very addictive puzzle game that will keep you engrossed for hours at a time. A simple idea; superbly executed.

<br>
<br>My few notes:
<br>- graphic: could have been a little better
<br>- sound: could have been more various
<br>
<br>Anyway it is still a one-guy development. Respect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3860906">Expand</a></span>

However, despite all the hype and attention, there is nothing here. In a quick overview. You have a screen that resembles a counter and a shutter. Somebody appears (the graphical style is akin to old 8-bit  16-bit) and presents a document. You then have to match up that document with whichever order you have receieved for that day, i.e. No foreign passports today  so every foreign passport you deny entry and they walk off. That is all the game is. Obviously the scenarios change and maybe it will be &quot;foreigners allowed today but only from X,Y region&quot; You are just matching up lines of text from your handbook, daily orders to which ever you are presented with. Once the day finishes you get money. You have a few family members, just text on the screen, and you have to buy food, rent, heating, medicine. They can die and so can you, which results in game over. I picked this game up on Steam Sale for about &#xA3;3.00 I still regret buying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/papers-please/user-reviews?user_review_id=3884464">Expand</a></span>
