If you criticize Arma for its &quot;lack of content&quot;, then you have no idea what you&apos;re reviewing, the Arma series has survived since its first game almost a decade ago, never because of it&apos;s &quot;rich content&quot;? It&apos;s the incredible platform it brings that allows the extremely active and dedicated community to work on, the fact that DayZ was an example to show how it revived the sales of a 3-4 year old game back up to the top of the steam sales supports that. ARMA 3, for anyone who knows the series, is a giant leap, in performance, in graphics, and in game mechanics. Now it&apos;s up to the community, like they did with Arma 2, to bring its full potential, I for one am happy to be part of it, and am patiently waiting for more, both from Bohemia and the modders.
<br>
<br>Frankly, I don&apos;t even want to see this title on Metacritic, it has no place here to be reviewed by people who clearly don&apos;t have a clue. Far too many people expect the fluidity of Battlefield only to find themselves in a completely different realm, while DayZ brought the series to the light of the mainstream, which can only be a good thing as Bohemia evidently used extra profit and poured it into this new title, it has also brought in a lot of bad apples into the community, expecting the wrong things, demanding the wrong things, and criticizing it for not delivering. Review this for what it is, not impose your unrealistic expectation based on other titles onto this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3520850">Expand</a></span>

The game mechanics, the new weapons and equipment is a joy to use (drones etc.). I like the modern day setting and the HUGE map too. The game is moddable, so I will play long hours with maps... Great game but not for everybody. This is the closest I ever want to be to a war, and this is the most realistic depiction of combat, unless you are really there.

This is game is more like a platform. I have been playing since the Alpha released and have played the series since the very first one OPFP. I can clearly say this one takes the cake. The potential for this game as a platform for Milsim is just incredible. To truly appreciate this game, it should be played with a milsim group. Taking advantage of community mods, and community made operations you will soon see why this doesn&apos;t and can not compare to any other FPS. The community of Arma fans is vast, and always at work. Once this game receives an ACE and ACRE mod, it will again jump in immersion and  game play. This is not designed to be a lone wolf kinda game, granted you can do that though. Take the time a find a solid group of talented and mature players and you WILL not be disappointed. Add things such as TrackIR and dead zone aiming the realism once again increases. The shear size of the maps, and I&apos;m sure custom ones will soon follow and the community addon&apos;s and mods plus the creativity of mission editors you will always find a new and different play experience. Yes the game is fresh outta beta, possibly a little early but that doesn&apos;t mean the game is lacking content or call for a reason to be harsh on your reviews. A lot of work has been put into this game from a wonderful and dedicated developer, please think twice and look at the game for what it is and what it will become.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3516795">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>No campaign at launch but hundreds of user missions and emergent multiplayer possibilities. Campaign is coming episodically in 3 DLC&apos;s (thankfully free, charging would of made my score a 0).

Better animations, new physics engine, better sounds, much much better looking graphics. The Mediterranean setting, is really a fresh breath in gaming industry. Realistic looking huge map Altis, which were made by real life island Lemnos. Very detailed vehicles, soldiers, weaponry. I can go on, arma has literrarry no limits in creativity, it offers easy to use editor, which offeres all kind of mission making. Payday a like, ghost recon-stealth a like. GTA a like RPG like missions, sandbox unique mission called wasteland, large scale battlefield mission warfare or capture the island. Tons of fun coop missions.  All that can be found in steam workshop and on multiplay servers. Arma is a differnt kind of game, the devs offer you a big platform, to build on.
<br>
<br>Only few contras, like missing campaign and fixed wing planes for bluefor and opfor, which was announced long before release date, and will be released weeks later as FREE DLC, which isn&apos;t a big deal for me!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3520749">Expand</a></span>

You need to tread carefully or you *will* die! The movement and weapons handling feels authentic, the vehicles not as much, but they&apos;re still a fun and awesome feature of the game. The strength lies in the moddability of the game, there are already survival mods and sandbox servers. The game runs fine on my system and the multiplayer was quite solid during the beta. If you want to feel the excitement where you are constantly on your toes as any bad move could be your last, then get this game now. There modding content alone make the game worth its price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3514861">Expand</a></span>

Now I&apos;ve played this game since alpha, and there have been significant improvements through out the course. If you&apos;re looking for a very realistic modern warfare game, then this is for you.
<br>
<br>The game is a 1st/3rd person tactical shooter war simulator, it has so many things that make it realistic, such as bullet drop physics, bullets being extremely deadly, and head shots killing instantly. Arma 3 requires patience and tactical planning continuously in order to be successful. It is a very slowly paced game, unlike Battlefield 3 and Call of Duty or any other 1st person shooter in that matter. The game has various soldier classes such as the medic, engineer and recon etc. which you can pick to your liking. Teamwork is also of the essence here, you need team mates watching your backs and providing cover fire wherever possible. Another cool feature is the ability to swim underwater and scuba dive!
<br>
<br>Vehicle are done well, helicopters actually are a bit tricky to fly if you haven&apos;t done so before. there are different vehicle to choose from such as trucks with big guns on top of them, boats etc. As mentioned before, bullets are deadly, so cover is essential as well as stealth. When you engage enemies you actually feel like you&apos;re engaging in war and you can feel the adrenaline rush through your body!
<br>
<br>There are single player missions as well, not the best ones but they can assist you in your training. You can also play co op modes with friends! There are also heaps of different guns to choose from, including assault rifles and sniper rifles, you name it! 1st person view offers full body awareness and you can go prone and all those small things.
<br>
<br>Another cool feature is the ability to talk (VOIP) to  other players near your location, so when you&apos;re engaging enemies you can actually taunt them and scare them. There is also vehicle chat, team chat etc.
<br>
<br>Overall an 8 out of ten.
<br>Pro&apos;s:
<br>-Makes adrenaline rush through your body
<br>-Realistic bullet drop
<br>-Various weapons and vehicles to choose from
<br>-Very fun tactical game play.
<br>-very nicely done VOIP system
<br>-Good graphics if you got the system to run it
<br>-Co-op and
<br>Cons:
<br>-Graphic requirements are quite demanding You have been warned!
<br>-It can get boring sometimes when there is no action, sometimes you wont even shoot anyone for hours.
<br>-you can&apos;t jump, which is a bit odd
<br>-Controls can be a bit sticky at the start, but you get used to it
<br>
<br>So yes, a must buy if you love realistic games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3514977">Expand</a></span>

My first problem is the map. While the map is huge, it doesn&apos;t seem to have the character of Chernarus and it doesn&apos;t feel like a place where you should be fighting a war. I realize that BI wanted to showcase new features with water, but I just think it&apos;s kind of strange to be fighting on a Greek island. There&apos;s just something about those post-Soviet states that just makes it feel like you should be fighting there. The next problem is just the overall lack of attention to detail. A great example of this is the Xbox 360 control scheme that is on the game. While you can edit the scheme by basically disconnecting the controller and putting it back in as a generic one, you would expect that the scheme that the developers made would be pretty good. Unfortunately that is not the case. Flying or driving vehicles can be very interesting with this control scheme. somehow I don&apos;t think the helicopter is supposed to shoot whenever you turn left and vice versa, but it does. Also, I just feel that they could have waiting until the single player campaign was finished to release the game. People would have waited. Releasing it without one has just made people angry. Another rather puzzling element is the lack of jets in the game (except for one that&apos;s from like the 60&apos;s). I was looking forward to some awesome air battles above the terrain (which is beautiful from above), but unfortunately there are no jets for the NATO or Russian factions. Another common complaint is the framerate issue. I haven&apos;t been having those problems and in my opinion that is more of a computer issue than a game issue. I do realize that they post the hardware requirements that the game needs to run, but those are MINIMUM requirements and you shouldn&apos;t expect it to run perfectly on the lowest settings. When you buy this game you should know you need something a little more powerful to run it and for it to perform well. I know that BI will improve this game over time, but I&apos;m reviewing the game as it is now and unfortunately it just isn&apos;t very good at the moment. I will update my review as BI updates the game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3527573">Expand</a></span>

It is highly polished after months of beta testing and directly interacting with the Devs on what direction to take. The result is a game that I will play for years to come. I have 300 hours put into it and it wasnt released yet.</span>

In this case However the cons outweigh the pro&apos;s.
<br>
<br>The lack of optimization to the game is really showing in the third iteration. The constant stuttering and chugging because the game demands more memory that the 32 bit architecture just can&apos;t give, The terrible hardware utilization of the engine, expecting users to have 10ghz single core CPU&apos;s to counter act the aging Real Virtuality engine&apos;s lack of proper multi threading and parallel processing and the general buggyness of the overall game. Lack of content and the copy and pasted content that is there leads to ArmA 3 feeling like it was rushed out the door rather than released on time and in a better state than past ArmA games. The lack of a campaign at launch just further signifies how far Bohemia Interactive is on development of ArmA 3. While Bohemia Interactive is known for supporting their games far after launch, One has to wonder exactly how long they can afford to support ArmA 3 with all of the core issue&apos;s that it has before DLC&apos;s are needed to boost revenue.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this game only to the hardcore ArmA player who can overlook the shortcomings and the bugs that once again plague an ArmA release. While there are definite improvements in some areas of the game, they are too few and far between to make up for the lack of quality in aesthetics and overall content, the terrible performance of the game and the overall incomplete feel and buggy state that it is in.
<br>
<br>Now with the recent announcement of paid for mod content, it seems that Bohemia Interactive is looking for the easy way out via the community. For a game that they say wishes to rely on the community for most of it&apos;s content rather than developer made assets, making an announcement for then charging for those mods is something of a slap in the face. I have rescinded my previous score of a 5 and given it a 3, which I feel is befitting of both the quality of the game and reflective of the developers present choices.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3516083">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Since then, not much has improved. This is basically an unfinished game... according to &quot;Dwarden&quot;, one of the developers who constantly posts on the Steam Community Discussions for ARMA 3, Bohemia Interactive&apos;s games are like &quot;wine&quot;, and they get bette over time. Well... months have passed, and I still see something that shouldn&apos;t be considered a full release. This is still an early alpha build, at best.
<br>
<br>The game lacks content. There are few vehicles and they all look pretty much alike. The game is also supposed to take place in the 2030s, and the only available jet looks like it came straight out of the 1970s.
<br>
<br>The sound effects and voice acting is awful and not realistic at all, even though this is promoted as a &quot;simulator&quot; rather than an actual game.
<br>
<br>The interface is terrible and not intuitive at all. Perhaps one of the worst aspects of the game. It&apos;s really something you have to see for yourself... on gameplay videos, that is. You&apos;d be shocked by how bad it is.

<br>Altis, the &quot;huge open-world&quot; environment of the game, is a dead, uninteresting place. Towns all look the same. Houses have no furniture. The few inhabitants are all in beach clothing for some reason (do people actually work in Altis?). It makes you wonder why there&apos;s a military conflict to take control of the island in the first place.
<br>
<br>The poor optimization of the game deserves an essay of its own. Really, it&apos;s baffling how at this day and age something like this can be accepted by the gaming community. The game runs HORRIBLY on the most high-end PCs out there, no matter how low the settings are. Arma 3&apos;s shortcomings on this regard are well documented. Just Google &quot;Arma 3&quot; and &quot;FPS&quot;. The game uses an ancient engine that despite being incredibly heavy doesn&apos;t even manage to make the game look as good as something like Crysis 3, Battlefield 3, The Witcher 2, Metro: Last Light, etc..
<br>
<br>Things get worse when you go online. You&apos;ll get about a third of the framerates you get in &quot;single-player&quot;.
<br>
<br>Oh yes, and I added quotes to &quot;single-player&quot; because... there&apos;s no actual single-player campaign yet. Just a bunch of showcases (small demos) that were there from day 1 of the alpha.
<br>
<br>So what are you left with in this &quot;fantastic&quot; military simulator, since multi-player is pretty much unplayable? Well... load up the map editor and die of boredom.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s as if Bohemia Interactice is asking the community to save this train wreck with custom scenarios and the like. Why? because Bohemia Interactive failed at releasing a proper game.
<br>
<br>Of course, they don&apos;t lack excuses. &quot;Part of the development team was in jail for some time&quot;. &quot;Bohemia isn&apos;t as big as EA, Ubisoft, Activision, Valve, etc.&quot;. &quot;The game will get better&quot;. Just to name a few.
<br>
<br>Well I don&apos;t care. If you&apos;re ambitious enough to release what&apos;s supposed to be &quot;a futuristic military simulator in a huge open-world environment&quot;, that game better deliver. Especially when you&apos;re charging the same for it as those other companies charge for their well-polished games.
<br>
<br>Anyway, that&apos;s my rant. Don&apos;t make the same mistake I made. This game is not worth your money, or more importantly, your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3515694">Expand</a></span>

<br>The performance issue&apos;s with this game are horrific.
<br>
<br>Usually that wouldn&apos;t justify a score of 2, yet one of the main contributors is that BiS have had no-end of complaints about FPS problems back with Arma 2!, not to mention the endless amount of threads created in the beta.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s just incredibly lazy.
<br>IMO, the first and foremost priority is making a game run well across many machine variants.
<br>This is pretty much a complete joke, especially with the amount of warning they had.
<br>
<br>The realism factor and the feeling that you are actually &apos;there&apos; has disapeared with all the guns/vehicles being &apos;made up&apos;.
<br>
<br>The weapon sounds are very weak and dont really sound like actual guns.
<br>This was an issue with arma 2 as well until you used JSRS mod or the like.
<br>
<br>BiS prize themselves with their huge map they created, &apos;Altis&apos;
<br>It is massive.
<br>However, 75% of it is completely flat.
<br>There is no forest areas, very little cover and very little variation.
<br>The whole &apos;greek island&apos; feel to it is very wrong.
<br>Chernarus was a much more realistic and dense fighting area.
<br>
<br>i&apos;ve had all the arma&apos;s and must say im most disapointed with this one.
<br>The developers just didn&apos;t listen or prioritize.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3515533">Expand</a></span>

You would think Bluefor would get at least one jet at launch... but its not like you can even use the jet on Altis because of the insane fps drop while flying. I get 50-60 fps in editor but as soon as i join multiplayer i get about 20-30 fps.</span>

All sides are basically the same, wielding similar weapons with a difference being as little as the same vehicle in different camos. And that&apos;s together with the amount of content being really poor compared to previous games in the series. A lot of gameplay features are either very simplified or simply gone. What&apos;s worse is that this time the release version of the game has no campaign at all and the singleplayer content is represented as showcases and challenges which are badly designed and simply not interesting to play. In addition to this many of years-old bugs aren&apos;t fixed still.
<br>
<br>All in all simplifications and poor amount of content may appeal to new players/arcade shooter fans who do not have any expectations but ArmA vets should not expect to find an ArmA game here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3515731">Expand</a></span>

In my opinion opflash resistance has some of the best written story and poignant characters in gaming, it certainty rises above what is expected of the genre (its sad how under appreciated it is). it was a moving story about sacrifice and defiance. It just shows how war games have shifted towards multiplayer with single player becoming an after thought. Not only did the campaign get delayed but i can&apos;t even see any single player missions. what, do you expect the community to make them for you?
<br>
<br>Altis is a boring featureless barren wasteland. Its arid and sparse. It has no picturesque rivers, ravines, forests, hills, mountains. I guess choosing a Mediterranean setting made this inevitable, but then why choose it? If they didn&apos;t want to make another eastern European forest environment, then what about a jungle location like in Indonesia or south america. At least that way the map wouldn&apos;t drive me to tears at how boring and flat it is. I can fly a helicopter at an altitude of around 15-25 across the map without even having to gain altitude, that is how flat altis is
<br>
<br>In the editor i still can&apos;t see any fixed wing aircraft. Now I&apos;m sure that this will be resolved quickly, but it got RELEASED ie came out of beta and just like the campaign, its not there! Bohemia, if the game wasn&apos;t ready then you should have kept it in beta, if only for symbolic reasons.
<br>
<br>so then what exactly did i get for my &#xA3;29.99. I basically got a platform, a framework that hopefully the glorious arma community will flesh out with custom maps, mods, addons etc. But then i could have just stuck to arma 2 which already has these things, and i would have saved my money. arma 3 is unfinished yet is apparently released, its graphics are virtually the same as arma 2, except with an uninteresting setting. Arma 3 achieves nothing that couldn&apos;t be done in arma 2, and so will only serve to split the community. It wounds me to write such a negative review because cold war crisis and arma 2 are some of my favorite games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3515631">Expand</a></span>

The trees, bushes, and grass are very well done, making the game a sniper&apos;s dream come true.
<br>
<br>The version of ARMA 3 that I downloaded from Steam included a single campaign, that begins in a similar manner as the Operation Flashpoint primary campaign.  However, some of the missions apparently were not play tested very well.  For example, in one mission you have less than two minutes to find a UAV kit, set-up the UAV, then locate, and eliminate two enemy spotters using the UAV, even though you have no idea where the spotters are located.  The location of the UAV and the enemy spotters change randomly every time you replay the mission.  That makes the mission challenging, at best.  Unplayable, at worst.
<br>
<br>ARMA 3 has a much higher learning curve than CoD or Battlefield, and that can frustrate new players.  Thankfully, ARMA 3 includes a Virtual Reality testing ground where you can become familiar with the weapons before going on a mission.
<br>
<br>I have not played ARMA 3 in multiplayer mode yet, due to the frame rate issues.  There are also still issues with bugs, but they are relatively minor.  I have not experienced a game crash or a lock-up, but I have no DLC&apos;s installed either.  I am just reviewing the core game as downloaded from Steam.
<br>
<br>Overall, I would rate ARMA 3 a 7/10.  Excellent graphics, but playability is difficult, with minor bug issues still to be resolved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4870626">Expand</a></span>

Even with all the hackers and other things the amount of realism was too much to pass over. Arma 3 started off a little slow with content and things to do, yet it has been seeing much more support over the last few months. It now has a single player campaign mode and some online support along with tons of steam workshop mods.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: Realism is a keyword here, this game is not your typical fps or third person shooter. It is important to play this game as you would in real life. Bullet damage is high as getting shoot once or twice will put you down. Aim is also difficult as it has recoil and bullet drop so spamming your rifle down range will only end up getting you killed. AI is easy when it comes to single player and will only get the drop on you if your stupid and run into situations with no care in the world. Multiplayer is a blast depending on what mods or if you have friends to play with.
<br>
<br>Graphic: Next gen graphic&#x2019;s as it is top of the line, game runs smoothly on decent rigs and looks amazing on top of the line hardware.
<br>
<br>Replay Value: Single player is fairly quick and won&apos;t keep you coming back, but multiplayer aspect of this game will keep you busy for as long as people keep busting out content.
<br>
<br>Overall this game is a huge win, a must have for military fans and people who enjoy fps/third person games that aren&#x2019;t your typical styles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4152052">Expand</a></span>

The gear interface is much easier to use and the HUD is a lot less clunky than it used to be. The game is a visual treat for a game of it&apos;s size but of course it does have it&apos;s cons that make me not want to play it. For instance: Where did the large arsenal of vehicles go? The small amount of vehicles in a game so large is a massive blow as variation is key to making a good game. However, the guns in Arma 3 are much more diverse and it does take a bit of use to find your &quot;golden gun.&quot; The UAV system is nice, I like it a lot more than the ones in ARMA 2. But the thing I feel that lets this game down is the lack of campaign mode, and that most of the most popular game modes online are mods, which doesn&apos;t say much about Bohemia Interactive&apos;s skill to make fun game modes. Overall I give this game a 7 because there are some faults still in it that need ironing out but other than that the game is actually pretty cool.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3632778">Expand</a></span>

You feel the adrenaline whenever you start getting under fire, and you actually have to work in team if you want to succeed. It&apos;s a simulator, and as a simulator, it does it to almost perfection. There&apos;s no fake environment sounds, every bomb you hear, every step you heard, every bullet you hear is actually being shot by another player, and that&apos;s what I love about this game. It feels REAL. If you like fast paced, rambo, non-skills needed games you won&apos;t enjoy ARMA 3. It also has a lot of fantastic mods, you can either be on a zombie apocalypse, or you can be the next Hunger Games tribute trying to survive agaisnt 30 other players on a vast map. At first, I though this game was all about luck, because I couldnt kill anyone unless I saw them first, but after playing for a month, I can now say that I am pretty solid and I can take care of most situation. Either way, this is one of top my favorite games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4282445">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s been an early access game prior to launch so I think some of the COD and BF Nutswingers might have down voted the game because it&apos;s not a twitch shooter.

It have the biggest map of any game done. It is almost 2x washington dc. How can you say othewr game have better fps when the map is 100x smaller and you cant snipe someone from 2.5 km away. With the map full of AI to process on a gigantic map. Dont be stupid and compare a little BF map of couple meter to a whole living world. Sure arma coulod be better optimised, but no other game is offering what we have with arma 3 and no with 10 of dlc after or whatnot</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3712660">Expand</a></span>

While we are constantly fed with arcade style games such as Call of Duty&apos;s and Battlefields, Arma III gives the most realistic gameplay, the only thing more realistic than this is to go out and do Airsoft, or join the Army and fight in a real war. Game improved complicated interface that frustrated many players in Arma II but also improved photo-realism graphics (hands down some of the best graphics around) and animation. The amount of detail is astonishing. While Infinity Ward tries to amaze Call of Duty fanboys with fish AI, Arma III has amazing environmental AI from birds to snakes and onward. Animation detail is amazing with little details such as different reload animations for each rifle to add more realism into a game.
<br>
<br>The only problem I faced with this game is the controls. You get used to them but they are painful if you just started playing a game. This is majorly because of what you can do. Call of Duty limits you to running, unrealistic diving and shooting, Arma III enables you to actually do techniques real soldiers do. The way how most players play the game is so realistic, that I actually recognized them as I used them in professional Airsoft skirmishing.
<br>
<br>To conclude, the game is purely amazing with inspirational amount of detail, things to do and realism. Realistic game with charm gameplay and character, DICE and Infinity Ward could only learn from Arma III.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3675227">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t consider it as a game, consider it as a platform that can be fully expanded. If you look back on ArmA2 you&apos;ll find that player created mods are actually  more fun then this game it self. You wanna realistic, you can use ACE mod, you wanna play zombie game you can play DayZ mod, you want WW2 game, there is Invasion 1944, and not to mention all the addons from different country&apos;s military, and all the player created MP missions, SP missions, Campaigns, huge maps etc. So if you see this game a little empty, believe me it will get a whole lot more playable then you can imagine,
<br>
<br>The more important thing is, ArmA3 as a platform is already way better then ArmA2. When people see ArmA2 they don&apos;t wanna play it more or less because of its graphic is quite outdated. But if you look at ArmA3, it has pretty much no different then the other FPS games today. Plus the view distance and map size, I&apos;ll give ArmA3 a top mark on graphics.
<br>
<br>I myself is a little bit disappointed that BIS released a version is not fully developed. The first released version didn&apos;t even has a campaign. As a programmer I will personally consider this game still under a beta version, maybe they&apos;re under some kind of pressure, I don&apos;t know, but I&apos;m pretty confident that this game will get better and better. So if you don&apos;t like game now, just occasionally check out on armaholic website. You may found more and more mods you&apos;ll enjoy. And not to mention BIS will release official DLC and expansions as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3672331">Expand</a></span>

The episode of the campaign released is great, much better than I expected. The multiplayer is really good, with lots of gamemodes, and the maps are huge and fun to play. The most important thing is that it improves every aspect of ARMA 2, so if you liked that, its definately the game for you.If you, like me, could se the potential but couldnt get into the previous game, you&apos;ll love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3757798">Expand</a></span>

<br>++++ alot more things but ill keep this short
<br>
<br>Overall its same quality as arma 2  but that new movement fluidness and difirent stances make it better for me .
<br>
<br>Also people saying that it shouldnt cost as much as AAA games  well you should have bought it when it was in alpha  for 25    Stupid ppl will be stupid</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3599198">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The weapons and vehicles are all fictional (due to royalties restrictions), but they all feel real and there is a good balance between the factions&apos; gear. The community  no-doubt  will fix this. There are already quite a few of &apos;replacements&apos; like the SA80 assault rifle and a full US/Russian weapons. Many more are in the pipeline.
<br>
<br>Recently, the first chapter of a campaign has been released as a free DLC  with very well done, really enjoyable game-play.
<br>
<br>You do need a fairly powerful PC, but the game is less resource-intensive than ARMA2. I can run almost everything maxed up on a 2 year old machine (only turned down shadows and removed AA as I run it at full resolution).
<br>
<br>To enjoy the game play you need to spend some time to learn the controls, not just for the soldiers, but also for the different vehicles, UAV, robots etc. There is also a command set of instructions where you don&apos;t need to get into the fight, but manage the battlefield groups to fulfill the mission. Aslo, don&apos;t forget the scuba divers  a first in the ARMA environment  under-water warfare!
<br>
<br>The mission editor is even more powerful than ever and there are plenty of community-created missions available to download either via STEAM or from various websites. You can create large multi-unit battles or smaller building-clearing type of missions  the last now works better than ever as it wasn&apos;t a strong point in previous ARMAs .
<br>
<br>This game has got some quirks, but for the kind of scale it covers  huge terrain, multitude of units, weapons, vehicles etc.  it is a truly enjoyable battlefield simulation off-line or on-line.
<br>
<br>Bohemia Interactive&apos;s constant support for the game, dedicated server files, modding tools brings a breath of fresh air in the FPS world at a time when other FPS games (BF and CoD) are now console games, a constant  more and more expensive re-hash of the same, with a very closed server environment.
<br>
<br>Well done Bohemia Interactive! And thank you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3713401">Expand</a></span>

The options are limitless, its a very complex game which takes military FPS and converts it into the most real experience a game can get you into. It has everything, from complete infantry movement, to vehicle driving, helicopter flying, tactical gameplay, action gameplay, diving missions, sniper missions, support calling etc. You can choose from various roles, like AT soldier, rifleman, squad leader, combat medic, and so on, and explore in multiple ways each one. Its impossible to describe the complete experience on a review.
<br>
<br>Graphics, I dont have to go into any detail here, they are simply gorgeous. I run with a AMD 9750. You can tweak the graphics to fit your current graphics card also. When running on ultra, I uploaded some screens on my G+ account, and some friends thought the pics were real, until they gave a closer look. Honetly, this game brings up the power of PC gaming.
<br>
<br>Content. Many people review this game as bad, because it does not have content. My response to that is that they are lazy as hell. You just need to open up the steam workshop and shuffle though the hundreds and maybe thousands in a couple of months, of user created content. Missions ranging from singleplayer, coop, multiplayer, infantry, vehicle, flying missions, diving missions, combined tactics, sandbox missions, etc etc etc etc.  As I said before, cant explain the wide array of options in a single review.
<br>
<br>Conclusion. If you are looking for your typical FPS, dont buy it. You will just be disappointed. If you are lazy, or you dont understand how a tactical game is played, or dont have the time/energy to invest into learning how to play (very steep learning curve here guys), then just dont. But if you are looking for a the best military, tactical experience, then give it a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3594618">Expand</a></span>

<br>There where some issue&apos;s with Altris, but that has been solved. Both maps plays smoothly.
<br>
<br>There bugs, like every game and yes that is on this also. Do not forget this is not a company that got a major budget.
<br>The main focus is that it is a sim.  The support I didn&apos;t have to use. The community for ARMA is big.
<br>And on what other game can you bring in a issue that will be please on a backlog where everyone can add information to it. And then the problem has been solved that you even can read it in there.
<br>
<br>Modding is great (Laxentis, you do need to do something for that.. there is more then enough tutorials on YT).
<br>
<br>Anyway, if you like to run and shoot, then I think this is not a game for you.
<br>
<br>If you like:
<br>- teamplay
<br>- Taking command of a squad
<br>- Flying with 700 Km/u on low altitude
<br>- Drive all kinds of vehicles
<br>- And have fun in building up a mission with some friend..
<br>
<br>Then this is the game for you.
<br>In our clan more and more COD players joined ARMA.
<br>At the moment we run 2 ARMA3 server (with a bunch of other COD/RO/Sniper Elite servers).

<br>
<br>The negative reviews focus on lack of content at launch  a situation that will undoubtedly improve as BIS release 3 FREE DLCs shortly after release to rectify this. The massive amount of player made content is also ignored in these reviews, with over 1500 player made missions before it had even gone gold, and a community that has been around since 2001&apos;s Operation Flashpoint happily churning out new islands, vehicles, weapons, missions and oodles of other content.
<br>To say that the game is lacking content from an alpha/beta build is like moving into a house before it is completed and complaining about getting wet from rain because you don&apos;t have a roof yet.
<br>The Arma series have always been about player modding, and there will be literally thousands of player mods coming that will transform the game into pretty much anything you desire.
<br>Consider also that BIS still release patches for Operation Flashpoint, a game from 2001   so dev support is second to none.
<br>
<br>My advice is to ignore the naysayers and give it a go  it will reward you with a vast sandbox that will never run out of steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3667451">Expand</a></span>

<br>You can set up all kinds of different combat scenarios in the editor and give it a try in singleplayer or multiplayer.
<br>Once you have learned how the AI wants to be controlled, it is pretty good. At least the AI can give you a hard challenge on the enemy side, but propperly used it can be really deadly on the friendly side too.
<br>Multiplayer is best played in a clan where everybody sticks to the plan. But thats the same with most games.
<br>
<br>But now and then you find little flaws that make you frown. Some of them are the players fault caused by lack of experience with the game mechanics or unrealistic behaviour in hot combat zones. But others are real bugs that will be fixed in the future.
<br>Arma 3 surely has some kind of high-angle learning curve until you fully understand the mechanics. But after that you can have tons of hours of fun. Most of the people i know have stacked 200+ hours.
<br>At least Arma 3 is 10 times worth your money and absolutely worth your time. You should try it. And if you have problems playing it, ask experienced players for help.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3619456">Expand</a></span>

I give Arma 3 a score of nine because giving any game a ten would mean it was perfect. As any Arma series player would know, there isn&apos;t one Arma game that is free of bugs or glitches.

I fell in love with this game, it simply rocks, though one should be aware this is nothing like the BF series etc, you either love or hate Arma, as simple as that.

If you like games like AA3 and Red Orchestra etc. chances are you will absolutley love Arma.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Highly Recommended

<br>Do not buy if you&apos;re looking for a shooter (CoD, Battlefield, CS). Arma is a military simulator - and the best there is.</span>

Returning fans can expect the same military sandbox trappings of ArmA 2 but in a near-future setting. Some notable additions make movement less clunky and more intuitive, like the multiple different stances infantry can assume, which allow cover to be negotiated accurately and without exposing yourself any more than you need to. The game is lacking a proper campaign at the time of this writing, but user missions provide more than enough content both for single and multiplayer. The greatest problem with the series has always been Bohemia&apos;s shoddy workmanship, and this game is no exception. For all its heart and promise, ArmA 3 should only be recommended to fans of military simulation or those with the patience and disposition to get the best out of ambitious games full of technical issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3598476">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There is some issues with multiplayer, getting low fps and performance. It has been fixed slightly since release, but still needs some work. With the nature of a huge sandbox environment, there are some bugs, most of which has been/currently being fixed.
<br>
<br>This is not everyone&apos;s game, either you like it or don&apos;t. Even though there are blind cod/bf fanboys who gives this game a 0.
<br>
<br>Nether the less,  BIS needs to be supported, there is very little PC dedicated devs out there.

While I know that everything in the game is possible, the fact remains that most vehicles and weapons are pure speculation. The equipment not being used in present day armed forces partly kills the immersion for me. Hopefully ACE mod will fix this.
<br>SP content: The campaign (so far) is awesome. BI managed to improve the storytelling and the gameplay as well as the realism.
<br>MP: performance in MP can be horrible, depending on the gametype and server. I don&apos;t often find populated servers with interesting gametypes, as there only seem to be 2 popular gametypes on public servers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3935646">Expand</a></span>

Arma 3 is a simulation game, where is tried to reassemble a battlefield in a future war, themed on Greek territory in a major conflict. On the issue of simulation is the best that currently exists in the market, doing the work in a great way and being artistic, tense, realistic and colossal.
<br>The game&apos;s graphics are beautiful, refined and pleasant to look at, and even is possible to higher the sight distance from your character to more than 10 kilometers. Sure, there are better graphics on the market, but considering that the game has, on one of the maps, a greater extent of 230 square kilometers, the graphics are more than excellent.
<br>The gameplay is heavy in all its routes making it realistic, it is possible to customize the control and even the position of HUD and its colors. The game has a wide variety of land, air and sea vehicles and also a great personalized content of the equipment of your character, with items such as binoculars, flashlights, night vision goggles, thermal vision for weapons and more.
<br>The game&apos;s campaign is like the same promises, being realistic, while maintaining a great cinematic look to those who enjoy a loyal combat. It is complete, with the history of the conflict and having alternate factions involved in it.
<br>But like all games, Arma 3 also has its cons. The game has an editor mode, which is very good, but it is difficult to use, and limited to those who have more skill in logic and even a bit of programming. For those who like games with plenty of action as the Battlefield series, the game is not recommended, as it seeks a target audience that turns to a more real experience, which of course, need to have patience to play something like this.
<br>I give to eight note to the game, as this remain firm in reality and true to their fans, and for me the best market war game. I hope that through this analysis I have been clear enough and thank the attention of the reader. Have a good game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4896603">Expand</a></span>

<br>I downloaded the mod called DUWS yesterday and it makes Arma III 9.5 out of 10 instead of 9, it&apos;s addictive and endless replayability, unlike many other games... most.
<br>Great graphics, great gameplay, like I said endless replayability and (as an ex-military) awesome sound effects.
<br>Don&apos;t listen to haters (mostly kids) or people with poor computers claiming it&apos;s bad optimised, I&apos;ve played 18 hours already and no lags, no glitches, nothing, just plain old good war simulation as promised by Bohemia Interactive, I repeat this is NOT for CoD fans, so get the hell out of here kiddos and go back on your crappy console, peace!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3521903">Expand</a></span>

I rate games based on fun factor.  Arma 3 is a really, really fun game.  The graphics, physics, ability to mod, etc are great.  The fun factor is out of this world.  This game will keep you preoccupied for a loooong time.  The term &quot;Armaholic&quot; exists for a reason.  But I&apos;m hooked not only because of the gameplay, but also because of the editor.  The editor is a blast (once you learn how to use it.  And if you want to learn how to use it, watch a few Youtube videos...I suggest watching Jester814&apos;s videos.  That dude knows his   It&apos;s doesn&apos;t take long to learn how to create your own missions, mod bases, etc.  You really can do anything you want in this game.  It&apos;s a true sandbox simulation.  Add the realism, fun factor, etc and you have a fun game that is well worth buying.  Now the negative.  If you are new to Arma (which I was), you&apos;ll jump into this game and after you say &quot;gee whiz&quot; to all the cool stuff, you&apos;ll start playing and then say &quot;what the f*%k&quot; to all the complexities.  Arma has quite the learning curve.  And yes, some of the muliplayer missions are crap (or you just don&apos;t know what the guys in charge want from you).  I didn&apos;t know whether to take a  or wind my watch on most of my first missions/sandbox games.  It&apos;s easy to feel lost, but invest some time (and again, I recommend finding some great tutorials on Youtube) and you&apos;ll start really having a good time.  Also, once you figure out the editor, playing your newly created masterpieces gives you a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, especially if you play with friends or people who are serious about the gameplay (aka NOT CoD hacks).  However, the Arma community seems pretty welcoming to noobs.  In fact, based on the Youtube help videos, they&apos;re all about getting you caught up so that you can add to the fun factor of the game.  It&apos;s a good philosophy.  The more educated you are about the game, modding, etc, the better the experience for you AND the rest of the community.  Lastly, Arma is a big motherf*%king game.  If you insist on running it on ultra, you&apos;ll have to have a beast of a machine.  I have a pretty good rig, and it runs fine on mid-range to upper mid-range settings.  That doesn&apos;t piss me off.  In fact, if anything, it makes me want to start saving for a new PC.  This game has so much potential, that I think I&apos;d be more than willing to drop some cash on a badass gaming machine down the road.  We&apos;ll see.  In the meantime, I&apos;m having a blast with this game and I&apos;m pretty sure most people would, too.  It requires some &quot;fixes&quot;, but this game is all about mods, so I am sure these problems will get resolved.  But in reality, it&apos;s a really well put together game.  Buy it...you&apos;ll like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3524144">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sorry had to get that out of the way
<br>Improvement on the arma 2 engine, it feels a lot smoother. Great gunplay and awesome tactical situations. These games seriously ruined all other shooters for me. Modding community is awesome, and it&apos;s only gonna get bigger. Altis Life and DUWS is what I&apos;m playin right now. Can&apos;t really rate the base game, because I&apos;ll play the campaign once and then put 120 hours into various mods. So I&apos;ll give a 9/10 for the hours of entertainment I&apos;m getting</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3590709">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Apparently some people can&apos;t read. A failing of our education system perhaps or maybe its just chronic onset juvenile attention deficit disorder rearing its ugly head. Arma is not a game you play through and beat X number of times. Additionally they announced that the DLC was coming after the release.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>Great graphics
<br>Huge Maps
<br>Killer weapons
<br>Great variety of game play
<br>The best is still coming from the A3 community
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>Bugs and glitches need cleaning up (happens with every game on the market)
<br>Low FPS on multiplayer
<br>Game engine needs optimization
<br>Needs professionally developed game types
<br>Altis is large flat and needs variety. I miss the mountains and forests
<br>
<br>Wait and see list....
<br>DLC still to come
<br>I miss the Arma 2 content, maps, weapons and vehicles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3527201">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Im sad actually, as a big ArmA II player i thought things could only get better. I was wrong. The lack of polish is astonishing, the game has NOT CHANGED SINCE ALPHA! Only new content, but the FPS bug i was so annoyed with stayed the entire way. This is pretty much ArmA 2 with better graphics and less gamemodes. Buy ArmA 2 instead of this waste of money</span>

<br>This game is NOT for the run and gun Cod fans!  It takes an investment of time to become proficient, but when you do, it is damn enjoyable.  The mission editor is also very easy to use and great fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3838931">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Its true we don&#xEC;t have many of  the most requested features by the community but the game all in all is enjoyable and what is there is polished .
<br>then we can be sure that more cool things will come in the future  this game will keep improving with patch after patch now that they released it and they can risk more
<br>
<br>I give it a 8 because there is a lack of main features requested by the community   if I had to consider just  that I paid it  25  then quality/price I would give this game maybe a 9</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3516936">Expand</a></span>

Although the optimizations are a bit patchy, and the game having a few strange bugs, it is significantly better than ArmA II. The new movement system, animations, weaponry, sounds, textures, lighting are amazing. The only problems I have with it is the difficult to use mission editor and the lack of hardcore, militaristic servers. It is a game that you can mess around with, and go scuba diving with your friends in, but at the same time one where you can be super serious and help be part of an invasion to liberate an island from tyrannical forces. Everything about it is better than ArmA 2, apart from the lack of community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3795720">Expand</a></span>

There are many great moments, but they are often squandered by glitches or poor design. Compared to Arma 2 I think it is a big step forward. Both in graphics and gameplay. I hope the Bohemia keeps working on the issues in order for Arma to reach its true potential.</span>

<br>
<br>the scale and attention to detail really brings this game to life.
<br>
<br>It may not have a fantastic campaign, but the sheer diversity of the coop/ multiplayer sets it apart from the rest. Although for someone new the ARMA, it may take quite a while to get used to it.</span>

<br>
<br>I play this game everyday, and I havent even touched MP yet. The editor limitless fun. Right now Im enjoying making CAS missions for the buzzard. It is amazing.
<br>
<br>Note that this is my genuine score, it is not meant to balance against anyone elses opinion.</span>

This game enabled more freedom and more playstyles within the game, and actually requires military tactics and critical thinking to avoid or engage your enemy. The modding community stays as strong as ever, not that this affects the score. One of the game&apos;s biggest strengths is that is really is simulating what is is like to be in a real war, and how you would think and do in an actual war. But this game is held back by it&apos;s graphical performance and it&apos;s sometimes frustratingly stupid AI. But this game clearly is meant to be played in a co-op mission to maximize the amount of hours you put into this game. There is something here for everybody, whether it&apos;s over the top action guns blazing, or it&apos;s amazing tactical warfare and massive scale battles that Arma is known for. This is a must have for PC if you have really ever wanted to play a shooter with ultra realism at it&apos;s finest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3527476">Expand</a></span>

<br>In fact you need a better computer to run this, than bf4 :)
<br>
<br>It is true that it&apos;s lacking a lot of content, and there are some bugs. There are bugs, because it&apos;s an open world sandbox game. Can&apos;t people realize that??
<br>
<br>Garry&apos;s mod has a bugs too, but the map in ArmA 3 is so big (PROBABLY TWICE AS BIG AS IN GTA 5).
<br>
<br>ArmA 3 is an open sandbox miltary simulator. SIMULATOR FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!!
<br>It&apos;s meant to be as close as real as possible.
