The excitement of riding into battle knowing that all it takes are 2 or 3 &quot;lucky&quot; hits from your opponents to take you out is unparalelled. The castle siege is bland, indeed. I mean, who in their right mind would attack a castle with just one siege tower or ladder? To the complaints about this however. You call yourself gamers, but can&apos;t adapt to a simple challenge that a game offers to you? Maybe try using your head a bit. You know, charging up that ladder headlessly isn&apos;t the only option - here&apos;s a tip: get a force weighted towards archers, tell them to hold position, get a crossbow / bow yourself, shoot down most of the defending army&apos;s archery force and THEN storm the walls. I guarantee, you won&apos;t be slaughtered like ducks then. I reckon most of those who gave this game a bad review didn&apos;t even try to work around it&apos;s flaws, while it&apos;s entirely possible.

It lacks several important things such as diplomacy which is very weak, story which is almost nonexistent, good graphics which is aging, multiplayer which has none of that for a strategy game or even roleplay. The most frustrating area of this game is the sieging process. Helplessly getting slaughtered and butchered while trying to fight at the wall on a one ladder is no amusement. The only strength of the game lies with its cavalry gameplay, but still, the excitement fades rather quickly. For an indie, it offers a well deserved entertainment to the new player, but for us more experienced gamers, little. Credits should go to the well talented modders NOT the makers as the game strongly relies itself to the modding phase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=423066">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve played a game that could reproduce that time travel affect where you check the clock and wonder where the heck those 6 hours just went. It&apos;s definitely not a game for everybody though, if you don&apos;t want to be a character in a medieval world than don&apos;t play it. If you&apos;re looking just for a hack and slash don&apos;t play, it&apos;s a big part of it but the rest will drive you nuts, if you&apos;re looking for an rts it&apos;s probably not for you also. It&apos;s very nice. That said the quality is there, they&apos;re not super advanced graphics but they&apos;re done well enough and the animations are bang on which is so much more important. The audio is great also. I love this game and for the amount of fun I&apos;ve gotten from it I almost feel bad for having got it on sale on steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=421564">Expand</a></span>

Mount and Blade has already achieved a cult following, and, like many other cult classics, features some amazing features along with some crippling issues. Of all the positive things that could be said about Mount and Blade, the titular mounted combat stands out above the rest. Nowhere else will you find mounted combat handled this well and as entertainingly. On the negative side, the game contains a relatively bland and harshly unforgiving environment (proponents will cite this as &quot;realism&quot;) as well as some mind-blowingly unintuitive mechanics. Mount and Blade is extremely newbie-unfriendly, as there is little to no indication as to how dangerous many of your enemies are. An inexperienced solo-adventurer without troops is guaranteed to have a short life. Some mechanics are curiously inconvenient, like the inability to sleep in a town if one is not a nobleman. Others are downright maddening, like the frequent inability of one&apos;s character to withdraw completely from combat even if the character is mounted and his or her opponents are not. The openness is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the freedom can be invigorating, with several potential avenues for success including trading, looting, participation in the arena, and vassalage. The openness can be completely overwhelming to a newcomer, however; a new character enters the world with literally no objectives whatsoever. I have been following the game since .6-.7 and while it has improved greatly in many areas (most notably the graphics which are fantastic for such a low-budget indie production), other areas have remained completely stagnant. As it has now finally reached gold, it is unlikely to change drastically and will remain a quirky, enjoyable title to get out whenever one feels a craving for what it does best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=417876">Expand</a></span>

This game exists because of their passion for game design and their many, many hours of hard work. I am not affiliated with the company, mind you, I just know the backstory because a friend of mine interviewed them for GamerGod/OGX a few years ago, and was so energized by the earnestness and grassroots nature of their effort that he evangelized the title to everyone he knew. It worked. I gave it a whirl and, graphics not withstanding, was very impressed. No, it&apos;s not Oblivion. No, it&apos;s not Titan Quest. If you are disappointed by that, then you are probably under the age of 25 and have no context for your critique. The fact of the matter is that Mount and Blade pulls off mechanics that millions of dollars worth of market research and computer sciences have failed to produce (for one reason or another) in twenty years. If there is any justice in the world, the man and woman responsible for this will be hired by Bethesda and made Game Directors for Oblivion Online (the game I dream about at night). Sadly, there is little justice in the world and this will likely never happen. Instead, the ignorant (like some of my contemporaries here in the comments section of MC.com) will likely ignore this title because it is &quot;ugly&quot; and continue to play the same game over and over (read: Warhammer Online or Diablo, or whatever). I&apos;m giving this game an 8 because it is not perfect. Obviously, it would have been nice to see an Unreal Engine used or something of that nature, but I fully understand why this wasn&apos;t possible. Nevertheless, I like to vote on an absolute and objective scale and not one that makes allowances for situational data. That said, the fact that everything aside from the graphics is so amazingly engrossing and well-thought out still warrants a very, very high rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=417438">Expand</a></span>

<br>Enjoy it.</span>

Sure the AI can be horrible and the graphics are dated, but when a game is this fun and addictive who cares. I&apos;ve been playing the game for about a year now and have been able to see it grow and expand under the development of its large fan community and it&apos;s relatively tiny development team. Yes, this game is an independent game that pretty much just got picked up by Paradox as a publisher. The combat is both fun and challenging to master (especially horse archery), the overall game play is addictive, and there is a gargantuan host of modders who have been working with this game for a few years and will help to improve it even more. If you&apos;re looking for a fun game to last you a long time, want to try something new or just want to help independent game developers out then definitely check this game out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=417862">Expand</a></span>

First of is the Story well there is none, which some people may like as you can create the story, making this one of the most free roaming games ever. But some people need some guidelines or what not. The second down fall is sometimes the game can go slow and also say if you have a party of 50 and you get defeated, and get takin prisonier well, your 50 men are gone unless you think you can take on the army again and get them back its impossible to get them.

But enough with the flaws. The high point is the combat its fun, and sometimes with mods you can have up to 1000 men on a screen in your right in the middle.

You must make the story. A bad choice in combat means losing what you&apos;ve spent hours building up. What other game has a level of reality like that. The combat has to be experienced. It cannot be explained. Try the demo.</span>

As an indie release, M&amp;B is quality, but not anywhere near as polished as a large gaming company release (which is to be expected of course!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=417410">Expand</a></span>

Swear fealty to a king or back an usurper, or even try to carve out your own kingdom.

Truly a victory for Indie devs everywhere this game has truly come through to provide one of the most addictive and exciting games ever. In terms of the medieval combat system M&amp;B has no peer, it requires a huge amount of skill and timing, but it pulls it off beautifully, giving the player far more control and a far greater challenge than any other game of its type. It really puts the combat in Oblivion to shame. Although the game itself is a tad buggy, doesn&apos;t have a true central-story, and is perhaps a little lacking on the graphics side of things, the overall experience of this truly open sandbox is amazing. I&apos;ve been with it since the beta and loved every minute of it. Ps - if in doubt try the demo, its essentially the whole game, but you&apos;ll be capped to level 8 until you purchase a key, this should give you plenty of time to see if the game is for you and you won&apos;t have to d/l anything extra if you decide to keep playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=417508">Expand</a></span>

Next thing I remember, is waking up on Monday morning. Don&apos;t know what happened but it was awesome! Highly addicting, I mean HIGHLY! It is awesome riding with your king&apos;s party battering down foes, capturing enemy lords and demanding ransoms from their families, being assigned a lord of a poor, small hamlet in a war-torn border region, slowly building it up into a prosperous village. Even the inevitable loss of your entire army in a hopeless battle and you being imprisoned can be fun, traveling around the kingdom looking for recruits to refill your army and seeing them advance day by day is a nice refreshment. This all however, pales in comparison to the combat. This is hands-down the BEST medieval-style combat I know. It feels even better than Might&amp;Magic Dark Messiah (even though the game was overhyped, melee combat did own), and a lot better than Oblivion. It just feels so nice riding with your lance down among your fellow knights, breaking the line of advancing footmen. Archery is also pretty awesome, if you know how to do it. The emphasis is of course on mounted combat, as that was the main style in medieval Europe. Why do so many games of that time focus solely on infantry? There are some bugs, the graphics are weak, quests are monotonous, but all of these can be changed by modding. Overall, I highly recommend it (not if you have to write a paper and the deadline is somewhere in the next month, of course).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=417778">Expand</a></span>

As is the case with Oblivion, the mods are getting to be as good as the game, and almost make the game not worth playing without them. I give this game a perfect 10, its really really awesome.</span>

The sheer amount of stupid fun this game generated, was almost overwhelming. -The sick, almost perverted pleasure of bashing a fellow combatant in the head with a giant, bone-cleaving axe and having him slowly, but surely slump over and fall off his horse never got old. I would go as far as to say that this game will be treasured in my household for years to come. If you are reading reviews in order to decide whether or not to buy this game, take in consideration that the expansion for M&amp;B will be coming out soon, and the models will be updated/replaced, along with some features of the game play itself. Play the demo, and decide for yourself if this game is for you...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=83446">Expand</a></span>

While the overworld contains a dynamic faction system that is somewhat engaging, the game really shines when you enter the procedurally-generated combat mode. Swinging a sword, shooting an arrow, and other weapon uses have directional, damage, and time variations that simply don&apos;t exist in other &quot;press-A-to-shoot&quot; games. Additionally, once you&apos;ve accumulated 20+ members of your party, you&apos;ll find yourself giddy with the possibilities of how you can approach battles. In no other action game that I&apos;ve played can I tell my archers to occupy a specific hilltop, place the infantry slightly in front of them to guard against approaching enemies, then swoop in on the advancing enemy with my cavalry on their sides or flanks. It really is such a dynamic, original experience that I would encourage anybody to at least download the trial.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=419844">Expand</a></span>

Fantastic role playing with enough character statistics to keep you busy for hours. The combat is 2nd to none. For those that say this game isn&apos;t pretty, or visually appealing, I beg to differ. I think it looks great. In fact, give the visual enhancement mods. a try, and get a big boost in color and textures. There is a wide variety of weapons to chose from, each weapon having a unique purpose with advantages and disadvantages including speed, reach and damage factors. Since you get 4 wpn. slots to chose from, you have to chose wisely for each battle. Basically you can be a mounted warrior or a battle hardened foot soldier, the choice is yours. The sound effects are fantastic. From shields breaking to your well placed axe, swords clashing, arrows thumping into you or your shield and of course blood curdling screams from your fallen prey. You can hire &apos;Heroes&apos; to join you [no probably not the cheerleader], or recruit from villages or towns to build up your army. If you&apos;re into blood, well...it&apos;s got enough to thrill you....but, sorry no decapitation or limb removal animations. Ok, so I like it...but there&apos;s always something odd with many games out there....this one not excluded. When you first start the game...you are utterly lost, aside from a training area that you&apos;re close to...go there and begin..then check out some towns,castles, villages etc...and begin doing Quests. Soon enough, you realize what&apos;s going on...and what the purpose of doing Quests are. Once you get the hang of it..eventually you&apos;ll be granted a village, and after invading enemy territories etc, eventually your King may reward you with a castle or two. That&apos;s when the next round of fun begins. Sieges. Invade enemy castles, towns, villages or vice versa...protect your own from invaders. Everything seems to have consequences, so don&apos;t forget to buy food for your party and be active in killing enemines.... or the &apos;morale&apos; will decrease and your Party Heroes may start leaving. There&apos;s an active community that have made many,many mods. for this game as well. Anyway...2 points off for a confusing start to the game, [i.e. lack of storyline] requiring a great deal of patience to understand what your options are. Don&apos;t be dissuaded initially by how difficult it actually is to land an arrow or a well placed sword/axe/club/polearm etc. It takes time and practice to increase your character attributes and to understand angles and arrow flight patterns etc...fun stuff. Think of it more like a simulator where the speed of your horse, angle etc...play a definite role on how much damage you&apos;ll exert to your target. You&apos;ll be pro in no time, have fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=419207">Expand</a></span>

However, I must admit there are still issues with the game. Combat is this game&apos;s biggest pro. It feels realistic, brutal, and dangerous. You&apos;ll have to learn the nuances of each weapon, but this is a fun process. Going from a solo adventurer to a commander is also a learning process, but once again a fun one. Building your character is a fun and rewarding process that makes a real difference you can see on the battlefield. The world is interesting, and there is an overwhelming amount of options. That brings us to the game&apos;s primary downfall: You build up your character, your equipment, your troops, your reputation... and then what? It&apos;s nice to have been able to explore the world, but I wanted a story, a challenge to work towards. Mount and blade, despite its wonderful underlying system, begins to feel pointless. Once you can beat most of the guys out there and afford expensive equipment, you&apos;ll begin to wonder what you did it all for. In the end, I never felt like I finished the game. Because the game has no big &apos;baron von evil who killed your father&apos; or &apos;win the war for your people and be lauded as a hero&apos; to work towards it and I just slowly fell out of love and drifted apart, and now I have no sense of closure. Overall certainly worth the $11 I paid for it at an early stage of development, and probably worth the price of a budget game. It&apos;s one of those games I keep returning to for short flings time and time again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=418268">Expand</a></span>

Of course that the grapihics could be better and bla bla bla. But the core of the game, the idea of the game, to bring the player to a medival world in witch we can be a almost everything, is fantastic and well built. You can raid citys, conquer forts, help kings in his conquest. This game has no story or script u make your one story and i love that kind of game- i like games were i can be me in a new world, were i can dream. For me, the battles in this game are great a i even think that the battles simulations are the best you can try in pc games. Plus the game have many new modes created by other players [and you can creat one to ;) ] and it can give you so many hours of playing (naturaly my girlfriend hates the game LOL). Take it for me, try the game and i&apos;m sure that you will love it (you can try it first). I don&#xB4;t give 10 because i never give 10 (you never know whats comming in the pc games).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=418421">Expand</a></span>

First let&apos;s discuss the graphics that seems to pop up so much in these reviews. They are dated a couple years back... sure. They might be comparable to say City of Heroes. They both have the same texture styles. But, this game has more than Person99 gives credit to. Looking closely at a figure you can see his beard, unshaven cheeks, and various hair styles. All of which you have access to when you create your character at the start of the game. So there&apos;s definitely more than &quot;textureless skin&quot;. If the graphics don&apos;t appease you, you are more than welcome to join the Taleworlds forums and download a mod for enhanced graphics. These will be more crisp and higher definition than the stock. Which again, is not lacking. It most definitely is more superior than say, Rome Total War, or other combat/battlefield games of the genre. Now to gameplay. Easily the most innovative combat system for a game of this type. You control every aspect of your character. You can choose which direction to block or strike with the mouse movement, and control his movement on foot or horse by keyboard controls. Easily the best feature is the fact that you have directional attacks. For example, moving the mouse up and striking (left mouse) is an overhead strike. Left and mouse button is a left sweeping cut. Down and right also have unique attacks which are different for most weapons you can get your hands on. It makes for a very fun and exciting combat system. You&apos;ll see the normal RPG system of upgrading your stats. But, due to this being a player controlled combat system, stats affect only things like increasing power in strikes (more damage) or speed. They wont make you overwhelmingly superior... that&apos;s limited by your actual in-game skill. The environment in-game is fun and fairly large. You&apos;ll have the freedom to go where you want on the map, and do what you want. If you want to fight as a Knight for the Swadian kingdom... go for it. Want to be a lone archer on foot... go for it. Lastly the modding community is fantastic. You have mods for almost every time period (from the BC&apos;s to Star Wars). They developers were nice enough to support the modders and give them just about every tool they need to make a functioning mod. I highly recommend this game to anyone who might like the medieval time period, and enjoy combat games. I only went with a 9 instead of 10 because there are slight bugs or unfinished elements... but nothing that makes this game breaking in anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=420515">Expand</a></span>

For what it&apos;s worth, Mount &amp; Blade is a very entertaining title. It was developed by a husband and wife team on a nearly negligible budget, garnered out of pocket and with the support of its fanbase. Combat, being the central point of the game, is done rather well. It&apos;s grin-worthingly satisfying to loose an arrow into someone&apos;s skull from 100 yards away, or to charge your armored mount recklessly into a mob of bloodthirsty raiders. But this can only be entertaining for so long for some people (like me). With hardly any storyline to follow, and no real goal or purpose to the game, it does tend to get dull very quickly. This usually makes for a game you play for a few days, then forget about it for a good six months or so. Bottom line is that it&apos;s a wonderful indie game made on a tiny budget by people in their spare time. If you need a quick combat fix, whether it&apos;s sniping with a bow, charging the front lines with a lance, or rushing into combat wearing nothing but a hat and swinging a claymore, then Mount &amp; Blade will probably satisfy your violent urges.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=417452">Expand</a></span>

Its not Oblivion, nor does it want to be, so please stop the comparisons. Apples and oranges. If its anything, its a medieval version of free form space sims like Escape Velocity or Freelancer. Mount and Blade has incredibly well-tuned combat that is unlike anything else out there. It also has some of the most useful skills I&apos;ve ever seen put in an RPG, skills that make leveling incredibly addicting. It can be brutally hard when you are low level, but this only makes your future triumphs all the sweeter. This game is an example why PC gaming will always be at the cutting edge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=417809">Expand</a></span>

Sure, if you look at the graphics, it might look a little bit outdated, but it&apos;s actually still more than decent. The lightning and shadow effects are actually well done, and the textures aren&apos;t too bad either. So those who complain about graphics, seriously, please use your eyes. Secondly, this game is excellent in gameplay. The amount of gameplay it offers really is unexpectedly high. Sure, to some people it may just feel like an extended beat &apos;em up, but if you take the time to realise how many functions there are in this game, you&apos;ll have to admit that a game on this level made by lower resources is still amazing. The physics are also amazing, bodies roll downhill pretty good in comat, which I can&apos;t even say of many modern games. So once more, stop complaining about such things because it actually manages to do things really well. It really keeps me wondering, what could Taleworlds produce with a high budget? Because what they show in this game is simply amazing. This game is the most underrated game by official reviews I have seen so far on Metacritic, all reviews rated under 90% are not worthy to be called reviews. If you really play the game fully in all it&apos;s functions, every person comes to understanding that the game is more than great. You are truly missing out if you don&apos;t play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=422182">Expand</a></span>

Will it get old? Sure.. all games do. It&apos;s still the kind of game you can pick up now and then for an addiction, and if it gets too easy can be upgraded to levels of increasing difficulty. This game is of extremely high value in relation to it&apos;s price vs. how many hours of entertainment can be gotten out of it... just watch out for carpal tunnel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=422214">Expand</a></span>

Some reviews complain about the graphics but with a single mod it looks fine. So many reviews have totally missed the mark with this game. (On that note I think the PC zone UK review should be removed as it gives no basis for the comments it makes) This is a amazing game.</span>

All part of the fun tho, because makes it more of a challenge to build your own decent army. when you finally have built yourself a decent army thats when the real fun starts. ploughing trough 200 man armies with 60 knights is just epic. The mounted combat is unique and fun (alltho the different kind of attacks and animations are very limited) and be able to have special companions adds to an allready very good game. The main downside of this game are the animations. they seem really unnatural and are very limited. But the downside is completly overshadowed by the mounted combat wich is absolutely mint. This is the kind of game where you will need to invest time in in order to fully experience it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=83404">Expand</a></span>

Oblivion is a fun RPG in it&apos;s own right, but the combat isn&apos;t nearly as intense and rewarding as that offered in Mount &amp; Blade. Fighting on horseback never felt this good. Battles really feel big and you&apos;ll often have a hundred men filling the map at one time all screaming and clashing steel... You won&apos;t find that in Oblivion.

It focuses on a more realistic approach to combat. Everything has its strengths and its weaknesses. Ranged units can pick off infantry easily, which can tople cavalry with their pikes, which can ride ranged units into the ground. A variety of third party modifications and worlds ensure a great potential for replay value, and the game sports a simple and easy method for (dis/en)abling them at-will. It does have a few issues however. Some of the RPG elements of the game become repetitive (perticularly NPC dialogue could be developped a little more) and there are a few skills which seem (to me) to be all-but useless, and the lack of any sort of multiplayer playing mode really hurts. It&apos;s a part of my recipe for the perfect RPG/strategy hybrid: M&amp;B&apos;s combat system, matched with the world of The Elder Scrolls series, and a decent multiplayer mode of gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=419642">Expand</a></span>

Some of these people will lay claims of playing this game since BETA stage and that they&apos;ve played video games for over 15 yrs. I have this to say to them: who cares! You&apos;re simply not in a position to give a game a 10, when you&apos;re clearly overlooking its quest flaws. So before you lay claim to your BETA fame, keep in mind you&apos;re speaking to someone that has played games long before Atari, Commadore 64 or IBM compatible games were even heard of. This does not make me an expert, but it does give me an honest look at what the game designer could have improved upon prior to release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=419678">Expand</a></span>

It just has so much to offer- battles that feel real, an open living world, and of course EXCELLENT mounted combat. Compare the riding in this game with that of TES: Oblivion- it puts it to shame. There are still some annoying gameplay issues (a rather silly skill system, some buggy sieges) and some features that seem half-implemented (town/castle improvements, rebel factions, wooing ladies) but it&apos;s more than just a sandbox game. Definitely give it a try if you&apos;re a fan of the escape velocity series (one of my favorites) or if you like completely non-linear games and/or medieval combat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=418181">Expand</a></span>

Also, the community is not paid to advertise it, the guy who made it has no income other than the sales, which isn&apos;t much, so he can&apos;t afford that bullshit like big companies can. Reviewers who give it 1 instead of 10 probably just played for a few hours on the easiest settings and thought all you basically do is find bandit groups to kill so you can buy better stuff for your character. They&apos;re simply not smart enough for this game. I&apos;m sure you, dear reader, have higher intelligence. The game has a lot of depth and neat details everywhere, especially in your relations to other NPCs and nations. You&apos;ll discover many cool details in how people, enemy parties, potential allies, etc respond to you. Open ended role playing at its finest. Please don&apos;t expect Oblivion when you play this. Compare this game ro Sid Meier&apos;s Pirates! Instead. Put that in a realistic medieval setting (yes, no magic and elves here, so the LOTR/Oblivion comparisons are stupid) add amazing realistic melee and ranged combat, add a LOT of depth in regards to the things you can do and your relationships to NPCs and nations (imagine if Pirates! allowed you to be a governor, make and break alliances, wage wars, large scale battles and sieges, do interesting quests, and many more things), and you will have a vague idea of this game. Simply? Pirates! but with depth. If Pirates got so good reviews, this should get tenfold that. Anyone who can&apos;t see it either didn&apos;t give this game a real chance, or has been playing it for way too long and forgot all the cool things now he focuses on just making a super duper character with the optimal exploiting paths he discovered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=417528">Expand</a></span>

Understanding that this game is from a small up start dev team (It started with just two people) you can&apos;t expect to have modern day graphics but over time they have provided some good graphical updates since it started.

The developers are still  updating and working on the game and plan in the future for multiplayer support.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=77770">Expand</a></span>

For one the gameplay is fantastic, starting out as a lowly peasant and working your way up. The combat was pretty fun being able to parry strike depending on the direction of the attack instead of one parry for all strikes like allot of games. Horse combat in this was very fun. The horse combat also adds in your choices to ride with heavy armor or light armor but the speed bonuses give you extra damage. There are lots of choices like this you must decide. On top of all this fantastic, fun gameplay it lets you conquer lands and become the lord of castles, towns and villages. It even has medieval tournaments like jousting and random rabbling and hacking at each other with axes and swords. Yes, yes the graphics are out of date but the amazing re playability of the whole game makes up for all of that. I highly recommend this game 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=739944">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is almost spot on, sometimes the hitboxes are off but for the most part they are spot on. There are a few things I would change in the game but they are not big things, for example when you press Q to bring up the quest menu, you are not able to close the quest menu by pressing Q you would need to click on the close button. A small thing but something I look for, buying items took a while until I found out that pressing control key immediately brings the item over, or when selling prisoners using the control key will sell all units of that type. Overall a good game, graphics are no Oblivion but I wouldn&apos;t consider it that outdated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=740310">Expand</a></span>

The combat system is amazing once you get the hang of it. There are both player skill and character skill levels involved. The graphics is not the best but that should not be a problem for a game like this. There are RPGs/Strategy games out there wil a lot less graphics than this that score full pot.</span>

On paper, it has good user reviews, is an innovative tactical game, and support linux... I jumped in too fast. While i can confirm all those pros, it is not enough to compensate various limitations.
<br>
<br>First, the graphics seems as old as the game theme ;) With every option activated, think about an engine like an high res quake 3 (1999), with low poly count, worse lightmaps and a lot more repetitive texture. I&apos;m not usually very judgmental about graphics, and I can play most retro roguelike games or &quot;smartphone 3D&quot; games but M&amp;B fail to provide the minimum imersiveness that i can tolerate for 3D.
<br>
<br>Then, the controls and activities are neither newbie-friendly (I could not complete the TUTORIAL without using google), and character combat is clumsy without giving any depth to the gameplay in my humble opinion. I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s hard, I like hard tactical games (XCOM...) or TES series action-oriented combat but I dont like them frustrating.
<br>
<br>I had unrealistic expectations when I saw the regular price and reviews. The regular price is quite extreme for an indy game with flaws that only medieval combat fanatics will be able to overlook.

SInce then, this game has seen many modifications with the help of its community and to this day, we finally can see the results. I&apos;ve been a gamer for most of my life so far, and I&apos;m a bit disappointed with the final product. After so many suggestions on the boards to implement and strenghten many areas where Mount and Blade could have shined, they were never introduced, but given a pink slip. One of the main gripes is the siege. With a repetitive castle/town siege, you wind up having to fight an entire enemy on the walls using one single ladder. Your army must somehow climb it and defeat the enemy who shoots you down helplessly like ducks. It&apos;s quite fustrating to watch. And that&apos;s not all. There are myriads of other AI glitches that completely make the game unplayable from the start up. Will be the last time I&apos;ve spent money on titles such as this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=418102">Expand</a></span>

Game is great with horses and riders and you&apos;re able to shoot and stuff, but there&apos;s not much else. There are taverns where you could do a little RPG like getting a drink with your men and chat with the barmaid with your adventures, but there&apos;s no such thing either. It&apos;s an empty tavern with a innkeeper that keep saying the same over everytime you visit the taverns! The towns and villages add to the monotony of the landscape,but even in those villages and towns, you only see npcs roaming around like zombies and they are few. There is not much to do in them either. Almost everything is eye candy. The only thing you really interact with is with your own character! Another thing that bothered a lot is with that single ladder siege...I mean what the heck is that?! If my memory recall, middle ages sieges are supposed to be fought after ramming the gates and destroying section of the wall so your men could rush and waste the enemy or climb multiple ladders, MULTIPLE, so your men have a chance at winning! The other thing I remember seeing are mounted men climbing steep mountains! What the heck is that?! Men on horses weighing more than 200+ that can climb steep mountains??? My jaw just dropped. I&apos;m still kicking myself for getting this game. They claim this game sticks to realism of the medieval times. I think it stinks unrealism at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=418517">Expand</a></span>

Now I like Strategy, RPG and 4x games as much as the next person, and plan to make my own one day (hence the purchase), but right from the start, this game is so unpolished, and the graphics are so bad that it really puts me off. But despite this I struggle through to find the good Sandbox Strategy gameplay that I&apos;ve heard about..
<br>I enter a battle and can either look for them or run away cause enemies are miles away (but somehow upon leaving I still must surrender to them???); so I re-enter and eventually find them. I gallop towards them firing off one arrow then my crossbow stops working - literally nothing is happening when I&apos;m pressing fire (the arrow hits the ground several meters below the targeting reticule anyway), so I run them down with my horse which does 0 damage, and they beat the crap out of me, meanwhile I&apos;m trying desperately to turn my horse or run through them; anything (nothing is happening of course as the controls are unresponsive to say the least). I die and immediately uninstall the game.
<br>
<br>The game is beyond poor.
<br>
<br>Ignoring the poor graphics, abysmal animation, terrible controls, and complete lack of a decent tutorial, underneath it all.. the game is just plain bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=2557972">Expand</a></span>

There is a collection of dull, boring, identical towns in the main game, punctuated by a castle. Pretty much every building is the same. The exception is the nordic towns, which have a layer of frost. Upon getting to a town, you can trade with them. Actually, you can&apos;t really do anything except loot them. Buying and selling is really not possible, as only the 1 or 2 rich towns in a provence has any cash to trade with. Buying is also hard, as it is almost impossible to move around much without a high-leveled, instant death raider party that takes your cash and goods. The game grapples with basic collision detection and glitches are frequent. The awful tutorial only describes the action game meat - WASD to move, Left Mouse Button to swing sword, etc etc. It fails to describe things like flasing arrows on the screen. The one attempt at making a worthwile game was horse combat, which is much to easy - Hold Button, Run Up, Pray. And usually your prayers are answered by one-hit kills. The entire thing (bar horse combat) is like Oblivion on a somewhat larger scale. If you consider buying this game, know that your hard-earned $30.00 will be better spent on The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion -- it&apos;s the same game, only WORSE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=425471">Expand</a></span>

It does not support any multipleplayer either, which is so not hip.</span>

This game is utterly boring to play with even at its latest pre final version. Save your money on many better titles out there ie Empires Total War, epic and strategic. Mount and Blade is another mediocre attempt to be a RPG/strategy that fails horribly on many aspects; poor old graphics, AI sucks both your own and enemy, siege is a total joke (your army gets slaughtered trying to assault the enemy on a SINGLE ladder!), The gameplay doesn&apos;t help either. Poor thoughts into the interface too, it looks like an old VGA game. On top of it all, the tiny community that supports it are mostly paid to tell you that this game rocks when in fact it sucks big time. The first impression you&apos;ll get is that this game seems great, but after you played it, you&apos;ll see its ugly head. The devs simply wanted to put a game out there to make a quick buck. Playing it, you&apos;ll get the idea why. This game was created on a low budget/resources and it shows. Support better games, this is NOT one of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=416858">Expand</a></span>

The game itself is unfinished. It&apos;s nowhere near &quot;revolutionary&quot; as some claimed it to be. The graphics is outdated. The gameplay is mediocre at best. There is no story, and therefore, no point. It&apos;s non-linear, but that&apos;s its downfall. Sieging is downright appalling as there is no real strategy and no resemblance to the dark ages period where sieging equipments were often used to great extent to batter the gates and scaling walls from different angles to overwhelm the adversary. It&apos;s a butcher affair to siege at all. The most intriguing part of this game is when I see mounted men cross unpassable terrain like mountain ranges during certain mountaineous areas on the map. It looks so silly and almost unbearable. The sequel to this is called Warband and looks identical from the trailer. Of course, certain &quot;new&quot; elements are shown, but they definitely should habe been included to this installment. The AI curiously is as dumb as the one found with the TW series; units will ride into trees/stones/walls to get stuck instead of going around them. To do some justice, the saving grace of this title lies with the modding community who with extreme talent has saved this game from catching dust. I certainly will stay away from warband as it will be the same silliness with extra grease to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade/user-reviews?user_review_id=85235">Expand</a></span>
