<br>Most of the story it&apos;s cliche but the MC voice is on point every time and makes you care, although some of the secondary character voices are really off.</span>

Pro&apos;s -

&gt;  Really good script and voice acting
&gt;  Love the art style and UI etc
&gt;  Easy to start micro-management, feels rewarding when you bring a wayward cop out of the Dark side!

Cons

&gt;  After day 60 it&apos;s pretty repetitive, the story is still there, but you feel the grind!

<br>Cons
<br>
<br>&gt;  After day 60 it&apos;s pretty repetitive, the story is still there, but you feel the grind!
<br>&gt;  The Mayors office requests are ridiculous!!  By day 4, when your still getting to grips with your new role and the game on the whole, you&apos;ll be asked to FIRE all your BLACK cops to HELP reduce racial tensions (which by today&apos;s standards is crazed, I think #BLM may be slightly pi55ed with the idea of not being represented at all in the force - I&apos;ve had a google and I can&apos;t find any record of this ever happening - granted - it would probably have been brushed well under the carpet, but I just feel it&apos;s a really odd thing to add into a game.  You then get punished for NOT doing what your told by the corrupt mayoral office.
<br>
<br>Overall, as an indie game, this is a great little buy, will burn at least 30 hrs + into it, but has it&apos;s flaws.  The narrative is great, really good story and likeable characters.  It will get repetitive, and feel more a grind in later stages.  If you see this on a steam sale - go for it though!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-is-the-police/user-reviews?user_review_id=6648855">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you love the atmosphere from movies like mob city and dick tracy this game was made for you. The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant, i do not listen to modern music at all so songs like Ben Matthews, Holli Scott - No Good, was just another reason to dig into this game.
<br>
<br>Why i give it a 9 and not a 10, There are no rng at all, everything is the same when you fire it up again, even the cops look the same and have the same names like the first time, i know this is not one of those games where you keep playing over and over but still i couldn&apos;t help but feel slightly disappointed even with the 13,49&#x20AC; pricetag.
<br>
<br>When you love a game you just get these ideas in your head on how to make it even greater, for me some rng on cops and assignments and investigations would have been refreshing and maybe some random stats and backgrounds for cop cards that could affect how well they do their job.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-is-the-police/user-reviews?user_review_id=6595006">Expand</a></span>

This game dabbles in some serious subject matter, but it gives you an option to either be a good or a bad person, along with very serious consequences for your actions later on in the game. It&apos;s not meant to stand on the side of social justice (i.e. Giving you the option to fire all black cops for a corrupt mayor), but it&apos;s up to you to do what you think is right (Be it morally right or wrong).
<br>
<br>The way the story is told screams Max Payne and is very effective, although I always expect the protagonist to say something like &quot;I&apos;ve got balls of steel&quot; because it&apos;s the same voice actor as Duke Nukem. But the story is enough to send shivers down the spine at time, not to mention just some of the deprived things that you have to deal with playing the game. They exist mainly in text and frames, but those with imaginations who are easily disturbed will be.
<br>
<br>The simulation aspect is a little mindless at times, although there are times where you need to select a course of action for your officers as they&apos;re on duty to either defuse bomb threats, negotiate with people trying to jump off bridges, and allocate the correct resources to keep your officers alive. Also what&apos;s also included is an investigation ward of your police force. Occasionally, some kind of investigatable crime will pop up and you can send your investigators. Over time, they&apos;ll uncover what happened from the victim being alive to the victim being a corpse in the course of uncovering pictures of what could possible have happened. You, armed with the pictures and witness testimonies, have to correctly piece together the timeline of events, to which you can arrest the perp. You can also find after you arrest the person that they&apos;re in a gang and you can further investigate that. It&apos;s a welcome system that is a good distraction to the bump and grind of the base game.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s also a lot of replay value in the game: you can veer on a different path to play a corrupt cop and see if you can get though without getting legally chewed up and spit out, or ignore mafia presence and how long they&apos;ll go before they get impatient, but what&apos;s certain is there&apos;s different ways to roleplay in this game.
<br>
<br>There are definitely some gameplay flaws, like how cops have to come back to the police station across the city and cannot respond to a call a block away from their location and the fact the investigation frames can be a little confusing to understand what&apos;s going on. There&apos;s still some typos to offend grammar Nazis, but aside from that the game is pretty sweet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-is-the-police/user-reviews?user_review_id=6585136">Expand</a></span>

<br>And yet.... identity politics critics:
<br>
<br>official review contains trigger warnings. &quot;Freeburg may be a generic Western city, but not all of humankind lives in generic Western cities. I have no idea what a game called This Is the Police would look like if it was made in Singapore or Iran, but I suspect that it would be very different. This game probably wouldn&#x2019;t be made in Canada either, at least not in its current form&#x2014;the sheer proliferation of derogatory language and identity-based violence would be unthinkable in today&#x2019;s climate, and for good reason. &quot; -KS
<br>
<br>&quot; This Is The Police is simultaneously a rich video game and a poor depiction of its subject matter. Whether the game&apos;s creators welcome it or not, at times like these, when police officers in the US are under intense scrutiny, This Is the Police&apos;s representation of their work bears similarly close examination. By that measure it falls short of relevance and borders on removed.&quot; IBT
<br>
<br>&quot;Despite having only previewed This Is The Police at PAX East just a few months ago, so much has happened in the US and the rest of the world in that time. It&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s impossible to ignore when examining a game where you play as the Chief of Police in a city full of racial, gender, and sexual prejudice -- where you make decisions every day that affect citizens of a fictional city.&quot; Destru
<br>
<br>&quot;And worst of all, you&#x2019;re all but forced to partake in some decisions that have morally repugnant real-world implications, especially while police brutality and government surveillance are directly in today&#x2019;s spotlight.&quot;WGTC

At first there is a story that you can influence by making choices, a bit like the telltale games. Then there is the cop management and finally the detective management. These three elements give the game a lot of variety and al the parts have depth, they are worked out very well in my opinion.

<br>Pros and Game information

This game</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Don&apos;t read or take for granted the score of the payed reviewers are giving, some reviewers are so **** that they take offense for having in this game a Feminists Movement that make illegal protests and where you can suppress them by force or crimes that are committed by criminals that use ideologies to justify their crimes just like in real life.
<br>
<br>Pros and Game information
<br>
<br>This game does not spare any side from LGBT, Black Movement, racism, homophobia, profiling, rape, mafia, pedophiles, women that are serial killers, corrupt police, corporations paying policeman, church asking for police favors, pornography, conspiracy..
<br>It is as police officer and detective that you see the worst in society which this game shows.
<br>
<br>The game is set around the early 80&apos;s but has some modern issues that we face today, for an indie game it has a significant number of choices and approaches. The main objective is to earn half a million in 180 days, the time when you will be forced to retire from the police force, it&apos;s much easier to earn that money with illegal or less moral choices but it can be done avoiding the most serious stuff, the game will take you around ~30h to complete.
<br>
<br>For me the game is on the level of &quot;this war of mine&quot; it has an interesting art style that goes well with the game but focus much more on story with a dialogue like a noir detective film with some dark humor but it&apos;s always believable and realistic.
<br>
<br>It has really good voice again especially the character you play with, I think he is voice by the Duke Nuken guy but his voice here is a perfect fit.
<br>
<br>Cons &amp; Wishes
<br>
<br>The only misses I can point out are small like when you choose a snitch he gets kill randomly and his skill and rank seems not matter, some decisions seem to have no consequence in the game for example I order one of my policemen to be ambush by the mafia I then took down the mafia and it&apos;s boss, I&apos;m pretty sure in the real world he would have release evidence that showed that I payed to kill my own officer as well reselling narcotics or guns taken by the police from committed crimes.
<br>
<br>I also wish you had more information about your police officers something you unlock or earn by events or by having them work with you for more time and some of the events associate with them were less random.
<br>
<br>In some cases the game has very few feedback on what particular perks do or their effects.
<br>
<br>Also sometimes the art style is so simplistic that you it&apos;s difficult to understand what the frames mean which make find a sequence to solve the crime can be frustrating.
<br>
<br>I would also point out that if all crimes that are reported had a 911 audio clip associated with them from the witnesses would make it so much engaging and add much to the immersion of the player.
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>
<br>But these are minor issues on a indie game, that went to kickstarter raise what It need to complete the game around 30k and launch DRM-Free at an affordable price and it&apos;s more polish compared to Darkest Dungeon at release, it deserve a full 9 for all of this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-is-the-police/user-reviews?user_review_id=6590214">Expand</a></span>

The story is interesting, but full of cliches (latest day I&apos;ve got to was around 30 atm), however what is not so interesting is that you always have 2-3 really simple options (simple from the point of view of a Chief of police) like will you be with gangster or with this other gangster? And this is main story, you simple can&apos;t be &apos;neutral&apos;, or backstab someone, or anything like what you can see in eg. The Wire. You can&apos;t even conduct an investigation in the mob, because.. well because you know what. You know there are gangs in the city, yet you can&apos;t do anything about then until.. until I don&apos;t even know what. Like halo, THIS IS THE POLICE.
<br>The gameplay itself is.. boring I would say, it is one of those games where you do nothing for the majority of &apos;gameplay&apos;. Your daily routine is sending 3-8 patrols to various crimes. What it means is you click on &apos;bubble&apos; assign 2-3 cops, click go and wait. rinse and repeat. The cops have no &apos;soul&apos; at all, they are just numbers which are basically theirs &apos;stat&apos;. When someone dies, you don&apos;t really care, you just hire another one, often with better stat. Btw the stat system is also strange, game tells you at the beginning that 150 means &apos;good&apos; cop, but what does it then means if a cop has 700 rating? Is he some kind of superman? Game doesn&apos;t explains it at all. My feeling is that every crime is just numbers comparison - assign enough stat points and you are fine.
<br>There are some other mechanics like detectives, city hall and mobster interaction, but everything feels so much restricted and limited, that it&apos;s more like they put it there just to be there. Mayor will often ask things like &apos;Fire all black/old/asian&quot; policemen, like what?
<br>Recommendation? I don&apos;t know the price (was founding it on KS) but if you can get it bellow 10 it may give you some hours of fun, but otherwise..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-is-the-police/user-reviews?user_review_id=6577174">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-The game&apos;s graphic style while not brilliant it&apos;s certainly unique. It kinda mixes cell shaded with cartoon graphics and it manages to look if not good at least decent
<br>-the gameplay is really good. In this game you play as a CEO of some sorts of a police station and you need to gather enough money in 180 days for your retirement. Will you do this by solving crimes and helping people which will literally take for **** ever. Or will you help the mafia do murders and kill cops so you can get that paycheck as soon as possible. it&apos;s all up to you and the game makes you do some really **** up decisions when times get desperate. unfortunately it&apos;s not all bread and butter here.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-I might be the only one who&apos;s gonna admit this but the game can get super repetitive after a while. You&apos;re just doing the same **** over and over and while the crime scenes or the way the crime happened might be different the way you react to it is the same. you send a cop car to investigate and depending on how good your officers are you might  get or you might get ****.
<br>
<br>So in conclusion This is the Police is a really fun and though provoking game at certain aspects of the story. if you like mature storytelling mixed in with a pretty fun all though sometimes repetitive gameplay the this is the game for you</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-is-the-police/user-reviews?user_review_id=6673306">Expand</a></span>

The only reason why I looked at Kotaku&apos;s review of this game is the fact that people here slammed them for being PC police. I read the review and it gave me instant cancer. The level of moronism in mainstream media is overwhelming. How people fail to understand that making a game that touches difficult subjects is pro-PC, and not the other way round, is beyond me. Especially that this game clearly states that some of the choices you might make are morally and legally wrong. Like the LGBT/Black/Pro-life supporters protests that you might be forced to quench - just before you make the choice to disperse the protest by force your deputy often states that people have the right to protest, and that their protest is proceeding peacefully. Only then you get to choose if you want to use force, and what&apos;s important - YOU DON&apos;T HAVE TO USE IT. The game gives you a choice. After you decline to beat up the protestros you will get a call from the bastard-mayor, saying that they will make your life miserable, but if you&apos;re doing a good job managing your police officers and detectives, solving cases and keeping the crime in check, you are fine. Just like in real life. When you&apos;re at the very top, it&apos;s impossible to stay true to yourself and not step on someone&apos;s toes. FYI all you PC policemen - hate is a part of human nature, not talking about it won&apos;t make it disappear. Only cowards fail to meet the problem head-on, trying to sweep it under the rug.
<br>
<br>Oh, by the way &quot;This is the Police&quot; is a really cool police-themed micro-manager with an excellent visual novel-style story, nice voice acting and some fabulous jazz music. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-is-the-police/user-reviews?user_review_id=6644240">Expand</a></span>

I was absolutely delighted being by a main protagonist - Chef of Police.

<br>
<br>Strategy part of the game when we have our police station and must send our crew to cases and other things is also very interesting but sometimes is to many random deaths of our crew. Graphics is specific but I like it, music is fantastic and voice acting good :) So if You like films like &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; or want participate in  very interesting  plot so its game for You.
<br>
<br>So have a nice day :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-is-the-police/user-reviews?user_review_id=7194101">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In the end, notihng you do matters, you get a **** ending and you are out of the game, you can&apos;t continue to play unless you start from scratch. It doesn&apos;t matter how you played, how good you did or anything, you get thrown out and then you can uninstall or play again. I uninstalled.
<br>
<br>Apart from that, there are a lot of errors that made playing quite annoying, like typos on investigations,,, those BROKE the game, as it made it impossible to figure out the frames you had to put in unless you looked it up or played with all of the possible combinations. Some investigations just give you **** all info that are no help at all, but I guess that&apos;s realistic, so I&apos;m not TOO mad about it.
<br>
<br>Another huge design flaw is the fact that the ACCEPT button is RED and REFUSE is BLUE... how does that make sense? I almost clicked the wrong button many times and I&apos;ve seen some youtubers actually **** up a lot because of that, and it&apos;s obvious as to why, the colour code makes no sense.
<br>
<br>In the end, it&apos;s a fun game that lasts for a little while, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s not worth the money nor time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-is-the-police/user-reviews?user_review_id=6645124">Expand</a></span>

This is the police is every bit a management simulator as it is a neo noir police drama. Striking and unique art style (all main characters have an universal lack of...eyes) smoothly slide in the cut scenes. These cut scenes scatter throughout the game and strings together a complex and intriguing storyline.
<br>You play the role of Jack Boyd, a police chief in his 60&apos;s with 180 days left on the force, and you need to decide if and how you will obtain a sizable retirement fund through some less than honorable means.
<br>The game conveys the suspense subtly as the protagonist spirals out of control, and despite the choices players are given in attempts to change the inevitable path Boyd is going down, every decision will have consequences.
<br>Mechanically, the gameplay presents itself as a real time strategy and management game, which can prove to be repetitive at times and some random events which can be frustrating. Although the repetitiveness can be intepreted as the cynism in Boyd growing as he begins to find his job tiresome.
<br>The game features a stylish soundtrack of swing jazz and soul music, well known artists like John Sangster adds a layer atmosphere to the game that makes you want to light a cigarette and start speaking like a 1920&apos;s gangster.
<br>Voice acting is excellent throghout the game, capturing the essence of each characters through professional acting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-is-the-police/user-reviews?user_review_id=6679726">Expand</a></span>
