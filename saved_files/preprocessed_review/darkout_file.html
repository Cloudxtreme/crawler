<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played Minecraft and Terraria before, and I really liked them both for what they are, but Minecraft lacks focus and Terraria is more in line with a &apos;Metroidvania with crafting&apos; than a survival game.
<br>
<br>Darkout&apos;s highlights are its graphics. It is a very beautiful game, brimming with atmosphere and with breathtaking landscapes. Light effects are superb, and while some clunky animations sometimes break the illusion and makes it feel more of a pre-rendered 2D platformer it doesn&apos;t happen much. It&apos;s a very solid an impressive effort on that aspect.
<br>
<br>But Darkout is not only about eye candy: Light management is actually very important in this game, and while standard torches have a 2-3 tile light radius, other kinds of brighter and more powerful (if more complicated to build) lights will become available later on. The inclusion of electricity, along with various lights, devices and generators really stands out among the game&apos;s features. Its crafting system also encourages the player to make safe routes, build a hover-sled network and make outposts along the way as they keep scouting ahead to try and make sense of their situation, and survive. New crafts unlocks new research that unlocks even more crafts, giving the player so many options to build and decorate bases it&apos;s a bit overwhelming at first.
<br>
<br>You will find camps, leftover supplies and ruins as you scout, and from there you can get data sticks that you can use to hear another survivors&apos; stories as you try to fix your distress beacon and attempt to get rescued. Story is not very fleshed out yet, but as it stands right now it can last you for a long time, while still being completely optional. Reminds a bit of how Half Life treats its plot, in the sense that it&apos;s there, you know what you need to do, but there are no briefing pages or objective markers, and it gives the player an objective to focus on, as well as freedom to do it however and whenever they please.
<br>
<br>Any defects I can find to this game are quickly dismissed by its 10&#x20AC; price tag and the fact that it&apos;s clearly described as a work in progress, such as the relative meager variety of enemies (still, 8 different enemy types thus far is pretty impressive), the fact that you sometimes &quot;drop&quot; your inventory while rearranging your stuff, that falling on a tar pit can sometimes be a long and unscapable death, and minor gripes such as being unable to switch the suit&apos;s lights on/off with a keystroke or taking a sled from a line without having to disassemble the whole thing, pylons included. Game only crashed once on me in 20 hours of playtime.
<br>
<br>Intel I7 3700
<br>Nvidia GTX 650 2G
<br>8 GB RAM
<br>2 TB HDD
<br>Gigabyte Motherboard.
<br>
<br>Absolutely recommended. Even if you don&apos;t like survival games and especially if you like sci-fi. It drags you in and doesn&apos;t let go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3855314">Expand</a></span>

<br>The lack of hand-holding and having no idea whats going on (you know those things that &quot;critic reviews&quot; despise) make Darkout so is rewarding and enjoyable to play.
