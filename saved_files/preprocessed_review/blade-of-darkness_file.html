<br>Mixing light exploration with a fantasy setting and, as above mentioned, some of the best combat mechanics ever developed, it&apos;s only real flaw can be pointed at the lack luster game story and overly simple multiplayer. But I garantee you&apos;ll have a blast hacking and slashing your way through hordes of goblins, orcs, trolls and many more dificult opponents, along with some trully challenging boss fights that today&apos;s games so often fail to deliver.
<br>Here&apos;s to hoping that someone will take this gem and release it via DLC on xbox live or PSN.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blade-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=2717678">Expand</a></span>

Hack n&apos; Slash mayhem with a universe of options and combos using relatively simple key coordination makes it a user friendly wonder, and not to mention incredibly satisfying when you manage a more complex combo to utterly destroy a more difficult enemy (Oh, and the AI is amazing for such an old game, best of its time for sure).
<br>
<br>The game has flaws, such as forgettable, generic and uninteresting story, a few inconsistency bugs, sound glitches and few other flaws that really just show this game was made with a small team and limited founding, and because this is obvious, you can&apos;t help but be more impressed by how amazing the game is.
<br>
<br>The replay value is off the chart, either be it by playing the same character a different route, or by playing another character entirely (with new combos and weapons to master!), you nearly always end up finishing the game 3-4 times before getting saturated by it, and even then each time you look at the game on your shelf, you nearly always have to re instal it and repeat the adventure.
<br>
<br>For it&apos;s time, very clean graphics and actually impressive maps to explore, you always end up having a favorite map to cruise around and love because of the challenges each one of them place individually, mind you it&apos;s not over the top mind blowing beautiful, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s a honest portrayal of a fantasy world, that leaves you well soaked in to the world you&apos;re playing without getting too confused of where you are, or where to go, or whats going on. (problems often found with more recent fantasy titles that over hype the beauty of a world, only to make it confusing and frustrating) I actually find this to be a more important feature then most people would give it credit for, because it adds to the replayability of the game, and it heavily compensates the games lack of depth and story.
<br>
<br>Amazing soundtrack. The few bugs the game has fails in comparison to decapitating a minotaur with a theme that enhances your feat to demi-god stature, even though there are a lot of silent moments in the game where the footsteps of your character is all you hear, the key moments where music kicks in and action starts makes key fights much more dramatic and enjoyable. (After all, hearing the &quot;end of days&quot; orchestral piece each time you step on a goblin would get annoying)
<br>
<br>A must have game for game lovers, a textbook of how to develop a game above it&apos;s time for developers, and a piece of gaming glory that should remain in history as one of the best games ever, and definitely a hack n&apos; slash that would put many, if not all recent titles, to shame. 9 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blade-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=2738534">Expand</a></span>

<br>Such a shame the Spanish company rebel act studios closed soon after ..... this for me was the most immersive and atmospheric game i ever played never mind how difficult it was to play ...that what made it very challenging.....such a shame the game failed because of marketing  ..THIS IS A TRUE CLASSIC
<br>
<br>I quote ..
<br>
<br>This game is the first and only game, which can perform water reflection wave effect only using Directx 7.0 hardware (Geforce 2 or Radeon 7500; perhaps even Nvidia Riva TNT is enough to perform water effects at the same quality level like in DirectX 8 or higher).
<br>
<br>However, the game failed to become popular, mainly due to bad marketing. Other reasons for the relatively low sales were the untimely publication (neither the code nor the storyline had been finalized) and the lack of gameplay difficulty levels - the game proved to be too difficult on &quot;factory&quot; defaults for many players. Nonetheless it did establish a large cult following that still exists today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blade-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=5419422">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re not a &quot;eew the graphics are not as good as Crysis-whiner&quot;, PLAY THIS THING!!!! One note on the audio though: There&apos;s a reason the music is fantastic. Most music tracks are live orchestra loops, coming from a premade CD. These loops can be found in numerous budget titles. With this in mind, you could say the audio is the only thing in this game not up to par with the rest. It still is functional though. Also, these loops are converted to mono, degrading the loops in quality. in Stereo, they sound FAR better. I do have one more thing to say: the loops are &quot;beefed up&quot; with additional sampled instruments. Here you can see a hint of the &quot;composer&apos;s quality&quot;. These additional melodies are outstanding. The tracks where he added horn melodies dubbed by a tenor singer are outstanding en very immersive. Let&apos;s hope the composer did better in other games. Conclusively: This game is worth every penny. Pick it up, you WILL NOT regret it!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blade-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=390380">Expand</a></span>

On top of that the fighting system that uses wepaon specific combos and a lot of timing your attacks, makes this a VERY great game. While the four characters (Knight, Barbarian, Amazone, Dwarf) only have one different level each, they all have their own set of weapons. The most fun part of the game is training yourself to use a huge combo and apply it to the goblins at hand. I love this game, the closest I can find now is Enclave, but that does not have half the charm or wit that BOD has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blade-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=369251">Expand</a></span>

I truly cannot remember how many times I played this game, it is that great. This is the only time in my life I&apos;ve played any game so much and yet loved every second of it. If you&apos;ve played fighting games and have always wanted something more deep and thoughtful, look no further. Above all else thing game excells at it&apos;s melee combat. Far better than Dark messiah and Oblivion is a joke to this game. You don&apos;t just randomly attack your enemy clicking the attack button, every swipe of your sword must be a planned maneuver. If you attack to early, or you use the wrong combo you could easily find yourself in a bad situation. That brings me to the other incredible feature of this game, the AI. In most games your AI will simply run at you attacking wildly. Well there are some enemies that do that here, but those are the worst. Knights for example are some of the hardest, they will strafe slowly around you shield always at the ready only attacking when it is absolutely best for them to hit you. The AI dictates the difficulty, unfortunately there are some over sights by the developers and some of the enemies they seemed to design to be &quot;hard&quot;. I&apos;m talking about golems, they&apos;re attacks are some of the easiest to dodge and because of that they are easy to take down. But then there are moments where the AI shines through, enemies with health potions will wait until they are far enough away from you to heal instead blindly healing. Oh yes, healing takes time, it is part of the strategy of the game. You always must ask yourself, heal now or risk having to risk healing in battle(bad). And potions are not easy to come by. Even as a veteran I found my self barely able to stay alive as a dwarf nearing the end of the game. The game scales with difficulty perfectly. Although at first the game may seem clunky and complicated, it eventually unfolds into an epic adventure with you as the hero. Now if you do not like melee combat, I mean real melee combat as I described you&apos;ll get bored or frustrated very quickly. There is archery, however it is essentially pointless because you can do maybe 50dmg with a bow to enemies with 1000+hp that charge at you. So if you like a good, real, in-depth melee hack and slash game Severance is definitely for you. And for those who were hoping for a sequel, I hope I will be able to work one out. I&apos;m an upcoming independent developer and I&apos;m looking into making a remake of Severance, this time with archery and without the lock-on control.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blade-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=742268">Expand</a></span>
