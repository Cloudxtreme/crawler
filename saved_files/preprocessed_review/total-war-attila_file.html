It builds off the basic Rome 2 system and, while throwing out broken features and poor balance, it adds new features the greatly improve the look and feel of the game.
<br>
<br>The battle AI is much improved, with fewer path finding issues and new siege mechanics.  Even unwalled settlements are defensible and the AI is effective at both defending and attacking the new maps.
<br>
<br>The campaign map is also significantly improved.  All provinces contain 3 regions, making each province a little more balanced, while making the actually building system more of a balancing act between food, squalor, happiness, and religion.  It becomes very difficult to keep your settlements in order and continue to progress to the next building tiers, but all this ties in well to the feeling of just trying to survive.  When you demolish buildings, it just drops them down one tier at a time, because as the game progresses, you will find that you need to step back and actually decrease the size of some settlements in less fertile areas.  During this time period even Rome decreased in size as more people dispersed in order to better survive on what little each acre of land could provide.
<br>
<br>As the game progresses you will not only have to contend with Huns, a force to be reckoned with, particularly after the birth of Attia, but also with global climate change.  Driving the food shortages at the time was a state of global cooling.  as the snows advance southward, your lands will become increasing less fertile and you will have to fight to survive.  You really feel the pressure to advance toward the south and west into more fertile lands, regardless of who may already be there.
<br>
<br>The family tree is back, and also sees significant improvements, being far more engaging and interactive than ever before.  pulling from some ideas within the politics systems from Rome 2, CA clearly threw out the old system and kept only the handful of things that really worked.  Managing influence and control in order to maintain the appropriate level of power can be very difficult and sometimes trying to juggle it all is daunting.  Fortunately things won&apos;t slip out of control too quickly as long as you&apos;re paying attention to your internal politics.  It&apos;s definitely worth popping in every turn just to keep on top of things.
<br>
<br>There are several types of factions that can be played.  There are the large empires of Western Rome, Eastern Rome, and the Sassanids.  The Sassanids are relatively easy faction to play with ample cash, easily manageable squalor, high religious tolerance, and a secure starting position.  If you&apos;re looking for a good place to get you&apos;re feet wet without drowning in all the new mechanics, this is the place.  The two Roman Empires, though, are only for the veteran players as they are floundering empires, in a state of decay.  Both will lose territory before they can begin to expand again and regain their former glory.
<br>
<br>You may play as several barbarian factions playing through a more typical Total War experience, beginning with one province and expanding outward, often into the more established empires.  Each faction has similarities with the other factions, but they each also have their own flavor and will play a little differently.  The only factions I lament, are the Celts lack of individuality,feeling more like Romans than Celtic natives.  However, hopefully they will fix this in the future with another culture pack.
<br>
<br>You can play as one of the migratory tribes and march across Europe in order to find your new homeland, fleeing the destruction and cold of the north east.  They play similarly to the other barbarian factions but start in horde mode.  All barbarian factions may enter horde mode when they lose their last settlement, but the migratory tribes start on the run.  You&apos;ll have to rampage across the Roman Empires, and probably take a nice chunk out of one of them for your new homeland, in order to reach relative safety.  However, while on the march, your armies are your cities, and as such, you will periodically have to encamp them in order to build more structures to produce food, wealth, and troops.  Eventually you will need to settle as no one wants to run forever...
<br>
<br>...unless you&apos;re the Huns.  The Huns are like a migratory tribe that can never settle.  You will burn the world, desolating entire swaths of the east, driving into Europe, killing and burning all that dare defy you.  The horde mechanic creates a distinctly unique experience even for Total War veterans.
<br>
<br>I gave this game a 9, because while it is not perfect, it is a big step in the right direction, making one of the best Total Wars to date.  From it&apos;s minute details of allowing you to rename each individual settlement, all the way to the sweeping new mechanic of being able to desolate regions, leaving charred and uninhabited craters where once there had been a thriving city, Attila lets us truly experience the dark ages.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5000430">Expand</a></span>

It is polished, with well-crafted campaign and battle mechanics. The unit and building design is complex, requiring careful planning both in army and building construction. The game has a central theme of decline and destruction, which is supported by the game mechanics and the art design that allow the game to mirror a world in a state of disheaval. The music in the game is also atmospheric and the battle maps look like they belong to a living world.
<br>
<br>The game is complex, but the UI copes with added complexity well and the game manages to cram a lot of information to the screen that was previously completely inaccessible.
<br>
<br>In all ways the single player is superb, offering probably the best campaigns in a Total War to date. Depending on your faction, the experience will vary wildly. However what drags the score down for me is that multiplayer has yet again been overlooked in terms features. The battles are great, but the MP infrastructure is unchanged from Rome 2 and that is a great shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5000109">Expand</a></span>

Let me guarantee you that I own and have played all the other Total War games - vanilla, modded, etc.  Attila has broken AI that sucks all the fun out of the game for me.  It isn&apos;t that it is &quot;hard&quot;.  It is that it is unplayably unfair.  Let me give you a few examples:
<br>(1)  Apparently you can have an empire of five territories, but can just barely afford to field 3 full armies.  Meanwhile every AI empire consisting of a single territory can field 3 armies as well.  How?  Who knows?
<br>(2)  The AI knows where your armies are, even when you are out of line of sight.  I can save the game, and move my armies to one side of my empire, and an enemy will pop up and attack the city I just left.  Meanwhile if I load the game and move my armies in the OTHER direction, a DIFFERENT enemy will pop up and attach the cities I left on the OTHER side of the map.
<br>(3)  Because the AI cheats, there is no way to &quot;surprise&quot; the enemy.  For example, if you move a single army (from out of line of sight) to an enemy city, you will find it strongly defended.  Reload the game, and move TWO armies to an enemy city - and you find it abandoned because the forces fled before you were even within line of sight.
<br>(4)  The AI will declare war on you - even when outnumbered.  Then they will abandon their home territory, march their armies through four or five enemy empires - untouched - and attack you.  Meanwhile their home empire is never touched even though surrounded by other enemies.  If you defeat them and try to pursue, every AI empire you try to pass through will attack you, and the MOMENT you are one turn&apos;s move away from your home empire, every one of your neighbors (who are not supposed to know where your armies are) will raid your empire.
<br>(5)  AI enemies will come to each other&apos;s defense, even though they are enemies.
<br>(6)  I can trap an enemy army on a peninsula, and when I attack them they can &quot;magically&quot; retreat off the peninsula into deep woods three turns of movement away.  While I am trying to pursue them through the deep woods that they magically teleported into, they are free to pop out the other side and raid my cities.
<br>It goes on and on.  There is nothing more disappointing in a strategy game than cheating AI.  Everything the AI does is supposed to be based on the game environment and evaluations of risks, rewards, and relationships.
<br>
<br>There are other glitches and problems in this game, and I have had one crash.  Given that it is brand new, this is not too bad, and I assume they will patch the small problems.  But until they fix the AI, this game is dead to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5021117">Expand</a></span>

I couldn&apos;t stop giggling while I lost my first battle it was amazing fire arrows raining people dieing in the ditches while Norsemen chopped at each other in a boat battle. The burning buildings in the sight of the setting sun and the general carnage are an amazing up from rome two. Its makes rome look like sims, and the whole coloring is like those visceral nineties medieval movies with spit and blood. Sadly you&apos;ll have to wait for the blood dlc because ratings and what not, but it already is brutal. As for the campaign it hasn&apos;t been out that long but already I can see a lot of quality changes. neighbours readily do diplomacy with you and attack you in the back and they generally use every option thats aviable to the player.
<br>Other random points: Boat battles are fun finally really fun. Your troops will fight to the end if they get a moments rest after each time they break thus making the roman chess board formations useful. This is same for your enemies need to finish them utterly or they&apos;ll come back suddenly. Towers are strong now. Game is generally harder than rome 2, think shogun 2. Battles do not feel like a chore as I had to use more tactics in just my first few than in half a campaign for rome. also you won&apos;t really have time to use battle animations, but I&apos;m sure that some people will come and say how easy it is for them and unlike &quot;random other rts from the rose tinted past&quot;. This is not a dlc or expansion this is a standalone TW game that happens to be in Europe. Them battles are the most cinematic I&apos;ve seen from a TW game yet. Also I dont understand why 39 people (at the moment of writing this pulled the score down when I haven&apos;t read a single negative review from those who played it...
<br>This is my first ever review I felt motivated to write, go figure... :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5000074">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Those players who played total war just for an eyecandy and battles may not like the new complex political system, but those of you who really enjoy strategies like CK2 or other paradox games, will love it.
<br>
<br>The Attila is a step in the right direction for the franchise.</span>

<br>I have a Geforce NVIDIA GTX 970, Intel Core i5 4670K 3.8 Ghz and 8 GB of ram. This game can&apos;t run near 60fps in a big battle even if I choose the next lowest settings on everything and with very few filters, and also those on the lower settings. I can&apos;t play the battles if they turn to big and therefore all sieges and larger battles are instantly unplayable for me. Game looks to be a step up from Rome 2 but I can&apos;t deal with this. As fast as you hover over a lot of units the framerate just drops like hell. So if you have a real solid rig and can deal with playing around 30 fps I guess it could be fun. But not for me. 30 euros wasted.

That being said, when you are lucky enough to play the game on an optimized rig it looks  great and the battles look amazing. However the game has broken mechanics like Diplomacy penalties way too early, overpowered small nations (we&apos;re talking 3 army stacks for a single settlement nation), and relentless AI attacking behavior that chases you through the fog of war, over enemy terrain, no matter what. Overall 5 for being fun for a couple campaign tries, and then not when you realize it&apos;s broken.

The layout of the Technology and Building pages are poor. Fog of war very useful to AI to appear from with huge armies against your meagre resources, and on and on...game looks great.

<br>Thankfully. this isn&apos;t a broken mess like its&apos; predecessor was - but it also lacks the spark of imagination that the series sorely needs as a whole.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, a lot of this game can be applauded, as it has got rid of a lot of the flaws of Rome 2 and went back to basics, making it almost as good as Shogun 2... but it just feels a bit lacking to me in innovation. It also feels that the difficulty has been artificially inflated - it&apos;s hard for the sake of being hard, rather than hard through any particular challenging strategy in the game.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s little to no &quot;charm&quot; in the title - whereas in the older Total War titles you could play your own story out, with your generals in the game feeling like they have a life and tale of their own... In Attila, there&apos;s none of that. It feels you&apos;re playing a well-tuned but soulless game that has become a by the numbers AAA strategy title that mimics what it did well in the past, rather than enhance those features.
<br>
<br>You won&apos;t regret buying this as such if you&apos;re new to the series, but if you&apos;re an old hand you&apos;ll be hankering for Shogun 2 within a week.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5205546">Expand</a></span>

Total War stepped into a new age with Rome: Total War and lived its golden age with Medieval II: Total War. Ever since it&apos;s declining so fast, and yet this Total War: Attila is nothing but another disappointing sequel in Total War history.</span>

                                        <span>Attila is the game that Rome 2 was supposed to be. Probably it&apos;s the best game in Total War series. It looks perfect, game interface is well organized, and bugs are not disastrous. Attila doesn&apos;t add anything new to the Total War (plus CA&apos;s marketing policy is just annoying), but this game is very well done in conditions of current TW engine.</span>

In comparison to the previous installment in the series it is the second coming however, only because the previous installment was a hollow shell of what it should have been.
<br>
<br>Total war Attila on it&apos;s own merit gets a 9 out of ten.
<br>
<br>Why the final verdict comes so early in the review you ask? because I like to give games a subjective and objective review and give the highest of the two. If you think that this is not fair then think it through and you might understand why I do this.
<br>
<br>The previous Total war was in my eyes a complete failure. Mountains of bugs, bad AI and less content than any of it&apos;s predecessors. And I do mean any even the first first installment which released in 2000. All this was an even harder pill to swallow considering how good the installment before that was.
<br>
<br>The fact that Attila remains party unchanged since the last installment makes me feel like this is what Rome II should have been on release but wasn&apos;t what we got. That puts a sour taste in my mouth and leaves me no choice but to give this game 5.5 out of 10 subjectively.
<br>
<br>But since I go with the higher objective rating of 9...
<br>
<br>The games graphics are amazing. The sight of up to tens of thousands of soldier fighting on the battlefield in real time is still a sight to behold and the actual graphical fidelity only enhances this.
<br>
<br>Combat is great with an almost rock paper scissors approach to units. It takes a good amount of strategy and planning to beat the extremely competent AI. The campaign plays oddly asymmetrical with the migratory factions seeming to be almost purpose built to destroy the much more defensively oriented Romans.
<br>
<br>All the side features fans have been begging for for a long time done extremely well. The family tree is back and it really gives a feel of political instability to factions that might be completely impervious to foreign forces. This leaves an hidden layer to everything you do. You might not land up sending an extremely competent general on the war path simply because him gaining fame might upset the delicate balance of power.
<br>
<br>Final verdict 9 out of 10
<br>The game plays great and looks great. Any grand strategy fan ought to enjoy the hell out of it. The reason it doesn&apos;t get a ten is it&apos;s surprisingly small unit roster which leaves little room for diverse army composition and it&apos;s horrible DLC practice. They try to sell you the occasional man vomiting on his armor... for 2 euros... alongside stuff that&apos;s already in the game. All in all they seem to be taking one too many tips from capcom Japan.
<br>So should you buy this game...
<br>If you bought Rome II and feel swindled then no. Save your money because this is the game Rome should have been. (unless you&apos;re a die hard fan)
<br>If you didn&apos;t buy Rome II then yes pick this up the game is amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5351043">Expand</a></span>

Campaign is amazing. Some may its the same exact game as R2. I would say its not true, so many new features, slick ui, and a brand new way of playing total wars. You need to survive to win and not conquer the entire world!!
<br>However, if you are gonna buy it for the online games and quick battles then you are at the wrong game. The battles barely last any time giving u no real tactics to finish off. Quick battles are filled with droppers and wannabees. Every single F***** faction have the same exact unit roster. You would think the huns are good but no they are useless. Known for their cav power you would expect them to have a strong cavalry advantage.
<br>But no!! Their cav is so bad they cant even compete with other faction&apos;s cavs. Yet, their infantry  is very powerful. WTF???? Sassanids are also so bad its quite unbelievable considering they were a powerhouse back then. They have ele, which cost 1/4 (!!!!!) of ur army but barely do anything. Tagmeta cav can kill them without losing more than 15 soldiers. WTF???? You can even recruit units that cost less and completely decimate more expensive units of the same kind. And to add to all this pile of ****, every single online game consist of cavalry charge at the beginning, its so f***** repetitive, and battles barely last for more than 5 minutes. How the hell does an entire army route in 5 minutes???
<br>This doesn&apos;t mean u cant have fun at some times, but u would have to know people before to find some fun battles. Im in a clan so I can find them battles but for newbies, I wouldn&apos;t recommend joining the mpo scene.
<br>Basically the mp is so unbalanced, so repetitive, so lackluster, so boring, so stupid that I would never recommend players to buy this game for the multiplayer. Considering the amazing campaign, i see no reason why anyone would play online battles.
<br>In all, I would give an 80 over 85 for the campaign mode and a 2 out of 10 for the multiplayer side of the game. Adding 5 points for the replayability of the game and the nice historical battles included, that would make a total of 87.
<br>However since CA f*ckn loves money and have their eyes stuck on gold with their f*kn DLCs, (not even 1 week and we have more faction DLCs?????) i&apos;m taking off 10 points for a GRAND TOTAL of 77.
<br>
<br>p.s. I have always purchased DLC like a dumbass but this is going way too far. At this pace, we are gonna see more than 50 (!!!!) factions in the game. Adding the useless unit packs and the short campaigns, this game will turn out to cost around 200$. 200$????? WTF??? This needs to stop!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5038423">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Game is horribly optimized. Even though I have a great system I still have a lot of freezes and low frame rates
<br>-Cheating AI - what is the point of hiding your army in a forest in Norway if the AI in Africe knows your exact location. All your moves are against an enemy that can see all the map. Not to mention a small faction with 1 settlement can afford to have 3 armies of 10 heavy knights where I cannot afford half of that with my 6 region kingdom...
<br>-It just feels very unattractive. I am used to playing strategy games with just numbers, hexagons and stick art as unit figures, but even with all these fancy 3d animations and graphics the game feels very boring after 2 days.
<br>-DLC fest: can you just add a few scenarios and content to your already overpriced game instead of coming up with more stuff we have to pay?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5086904">Expand</a></span>

<br>AI are so foolish with some skill and reduced army size, level 2 town can defeat a full stacked army not to mention about land combat and fort. And worst of all is Huns never defeated until 420 when Attila can be killed. You will wish to see Attila and kill it instead of running away from them because the only way you can defeat Huns which is extreme stupid. It will be like waste of time even you can defeat the Huns army over 50 times within 46 turns they will instant respawn at the eastern europe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5202030">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Also, there is the possibility they could balance and patch this game, and it might become a good game with time.  Right now the AI is horrific.  It is the worst kind of cheating AI - where one faction knows what the other is doing on the far side of the map.  Worst, AI enemy factions will ignore each other to throw 100% of their forces against you, leaving their home provinces completely unprotected - but who cares because the AI knows another AI faction will never attack them.  Enemy factions will support each other in combat if you attack one of their armies in support range of the other.  There are all kinds of quirks in the game - you can have a conquered territory that insta-generates a rebel army that in turn insta-conquers a city.  One minute there is nothing there and the next minute there is an enemy army and a conquered town.  I even had a time when I had TWO different rebel factions conquering the same town - backing each other up - even though they were both enemies.  The final straw is the broken diplomacy system.  Once you get three territories, just ignore diplomacy because NOTHING you can do will improve your diplomacy status.  This game reminds me of the early days of computer gaming when one AI opponent would declare war and you would watch as ALL the other AI opponents would jump on board, zerg rush from the far side of the map, and ignore all odds (and all other enemies) to overwhelm you with wave after wave of suicide attacks.  The AI enemy can&apos;t catch disease.  The AI enemy can&apos;t starve.  Those are just for the PLAYER armies.  Oh and the best part of all, if your empire is short of food in aggregate, your armies can&apos;t heal - regardless of the local food situation.  So you might be in Egypt, watching mountains of food rot in the sun, but you can&apos;t eat it because people are starving in Britain.  Yes, it&apos;s that stupid.  Give this game some time - right now it is VERY raw.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5048241">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been a fan of the series playing every game since Total War Medieval. I&apos;m also a fan of grand strategy games as a genre and have played many different iterations from my first love of Star Wars Rebellion to modern iterations like Total War Rome II and Hearts of Iron III. Through all those games I&apos;ve followed a methodical plan of action. Secure a resource base, research technologies and send out a large force to secure and hold territory. Total War Attila doesn&apos;t let me do that. The game held a fire to my feet and forced me into action.
<br>
<br>The game starts with the Roman Empire in decline and various factions vying for territory. Playing as the Geats, one of the Norse factions, the game turned against me quickly with famine and a harsh winter that meant I simply could not sit still. So, I gathered my forces, sailed across the sea and did what Vikings do, I invaded the British Isles. Within ten turns I was feeling the same intensity it took dozens to feel in Total War Rome II. With food shortages at home and forces suffering from attrition after the journey across the sea my options were to secure land or die. My first battles were almost as nail biting as a march into Northern Africa with legions of Roman soldiers to face down Carthage because there was so much at stake.
<br>
<br>There are some notable improvements, if you want to call them, to the battle system to make it more realistic. It&apos;s the little things like having to actually have siege equipment to assault a fortress or having units be able to return to the fight after breaking. The combat, as always, is intense and a joy to watch up close.
<br>
<br>One of the more notable aspects of the game is the new horde system that allows you to pick up your faction and move it. You uproot your civilization, losing all you&apos;ve built up, and move your people into a new area in order to conquer and re-establish yourself. There are four playable factions that start out as hordes. I don&apos;t love the feature, but it really is a child of the concept of the game.
<br>
<br>The game starts chaotically. In the north harsh winters grip the land forcing the Norse to move south to not starve. Nomadic hordes are moving in from the east to attack the crumbling Roman Empire. The game is very much in flux and, unless you&apos;re playing as one of the three established factions (the Western Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire, or the Sassanid Empire) you are pushed to move either from others moving into your territory or harsh environments. I experimented with the horde mechanics, but I&apos;m admittedly a settle and build up type of player so I played intentionally trying to not have to use them as one of the Norse factions. It can be done but it requires building up in other areas to support the motherland, so to speak.
<br>
<br>The menus and interfaces are much improved from previous iterations. After the initial confusion from years of Rome II&apos;s interfaces I grew to like the much more accessible UI.
<br>There is a much more in depth internal political system that those who have played Crusader Kings would recognize, albeit in a lighter version. The system is more in depth than in Rome II and I felt like I was in a precarious position quite often trying to maintain loyalty among my members and still retain the influence. Rather than the fairly basic senatorial system in Rome II there is a dual system of dominion and control. Dominion is your influence over the people of your faction while control is how the elite view you and can be lost or gained through political intrigue. Influence is spent on political intrigue to further your goals or secure loyalty.
<br>
<br>The game looks great and sounds great. It&apos;s a joy to watch the battles unfold and the campaign map is aesthetically pleasing enough to be worth looking at for extended periods of time.
<br>
<br>Overall the AI does a good job, but can make strange choices. It will decline political treaties that seem favorable or offer non-aggression pacts with a large payment when I&#x2019;m not even close to them. Or it will park an army that could easily wipe out the defenders at a settlement a short distance from the settlement and just sit doing nothing for years.
<br>
<br>Total War Attila isn&#x2019;t the perfect game. And at the end of the day it may just end up being a novelty for me. I like being a plodding, methodical empire securing territory and defending it before moving on. What Attila is, is different. It forces me to play a way I don&#x2019;t want to. It makes that small empire in the distance playable. And sometimes, what you really need is something different. I&#x2019;m not still playing Star Wars Rebellion, after all. I would recommend Attila to anyone who enjoys grand strategy, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Total War games like myself. It may not be a perfect step forward, but it feels fresh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5003816">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In Attila, they butcher history and leave you with only two horse archer factions worth playing; the Huns or the Sassanids.
<br>
<br>The Sassanids are not a good faction to learn to play with due to their starting size. I like playing as a smaller faction and discovering the game as I grow larger rather than having everything from a large empire thrown at me in the beginning. They&apos;re out.
<br>
<br>I have no interest in playing a culture that can&apos;t settle down and is forced to remain nomadic no matter what you want to do. The Huns are out.
<br>
<br>The last possible faction of potential interest is the Alans, the descendents of the Scythians. And oh boy, did CA screw THAT up! They get only two horse archer units and neither are available while migrating. This makes absolutely no sense on its own. The far worse part is that their horse archers are crap. They can&apos;t shoot 360 like the Huns and the Sassanids which makes absolutely no sense. They were descended from the freakin&apos; Scythians!
<br>
<br>So there is no one interesting to play at all in the whole game. Bad enough that every Total War game makes horse archer ridiculously under powered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5351027">Expand</a></span>

<br>

Granted you can buy it for about 24 &#x20AC; outside Steam - and legal too - at a lower price Attila is worth it and works out. What does not work out is the optimization.
<br>
<br>Attila is more demanding than Rome 2, but offers also better graphics, including MSAA, and more detailed units. While vanilla it looks like it is modded but it is not.
<br>
<br>Attila is Rome 2 2.5, without a year of patches. It is much better and whole, but still not worth a 8/10 that was given by the most of the reviewers.
<br>
<br>Rome 2 was about civilized scam, Attila is about barbarian scum. Armchair generals will love it. Also the multiplayer works much better and fluid.
<br>
<br>I can recommend a buy but not full priced. Look for legal alternatives instead and be prepared you have to lower the graphical settings even on high end computers.
<br>
<br>This all has a high price though: People with AMD processors (not graphics cards) will suffer a lot as they did in Rome 2, on quality settings or below Attila becomes barely playable. I am currently collecting results in the TWcenter benchmark thread.
<br>
<br>Warning: 7 DLCs are already reported on SteamDB.info, so get yourself ready for a DLC fest!
<br>
<br>+4 many &quot;new&quot; features that people wanted to have in Rome 2
<br>+1 better music but still repetitive
<br>+3 much better graphics, vanilla it looks like modded!
<br>+2 multiplayer has been improved alot, stability, chat and lot less lag, no slow motion units so far
<br>
<br>-2 on the flipside very high requirements, that are either very GPU limited even on HIGH-END computers (maximum quality preset or extreme preset and even quality preset) OR CPU limited on lower settings like performance and high performance
<br>-1 still severe lack of optimization for AMD CPUs, which now kills the game at all for people that have AMD processors.
<br>- to high priced as it contains a lot of features that were (intentionally) missing in Rome 2, 7 DLC listed and hidden zero day!
<br>
<br>I rate Attila with a mild 7/10 and can still recommend the game without serious pain.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5026975">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Fear not though, Szlomo is here to deliver the soundest advice possible:
<br>
<br>Option 1 for those who never played any totalwar game... BUY ROME 1 or if You really must try the newer gfx engine try the broken but playable Shogun 2.
<br>
<br>Option 2 for those who are avid followers of the franchise and have played the previous titles to death... GO PLAY TETRIS! Plenty more strategy in the russian grandaddy of games than in this steaming pile of rotten, promoted to the point of vomiting, bile. Delivered in an excruciatingly expensive package (think of buying all the DLC for a complete game) coupled with taxing requirements, unwarranted by anything You might experience.

I have been playing this game for a solid eighteen hours now and it has yet to freeze up. This iteration of total war even alt tabs well. That being said this game is a wonderful historical battle map for the fall of rome and the rise of the barbarians and persians. The only gripe i have is the ill representation of celtic civilizations in this time period as they were major players. I assume this will be resolved by dlc fully if not with fully resolved with the viking forefather dlc. The political system is confusing and the control always seems to teeter within the fifty to fifty six percentile range regardless of user actions taken. It seems hard to improve but also hard to make worse. The unit combat is much better than that of rome 2 but still struggles with AI during siege. Dancing ladder syndrome is still apparent but no boats fly through the map and no units seem to aimlessly walk in circles. Overall I am impressed and the addition of more unique gameplay with the nomadic factions is enough to keep me coming back for another campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5037005">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played hundreds of hours worth of Total War games and this is most definitely my favorite yet. The fact that it is fully playable and working quite well at launch is one that really not many saw coming.
<br>The campaign is my favorite of any game so far. Not only is the map much more detailed and beautiful, but the AI is also much smarter than what I&apos;ve seen in past games. Diplomacy is actually useful and quite necessary here. If we take into account the creeping cold from the north that extends south and ruins fertility as the game goes on as well as the inexorable wave of Huns heading ever westwards, there&apos;s more than enough reason to get one up and moving to better lands as opposed to Rome 2 where typically where ever you start is more or less where you&apos;re going to be in your possession unless flipped by another nation. Here in Attila, if you see the unbeatable hordes heading your way you can even abandon a settlement, giving you a short income boost and completely razing the land you own making it  useless to your enemies. At that point I would consider heading south and west to better vacation spots. I hear the north coast of Africa is quite fine this time of year.
<br>Province and Settlement management is similar to Rome 2 but there are small changes that really shine such as you can now issue an edict in any settlement that has a governor instead of needing to take over the entire province first as in Rome 2.
<br>Generals and forces have better laid out trees so you can actually plan ahead how you want to build your character or army/navy. Family trees have also returned for those that missed them so much from Shogun 2.
<br>The battles are quite a sight to behold. Volleys of crossbow bolts cast shallow arcs as opposed to traditional bows which fall very nearly vertical after they reach their apex. Men catch fire and *scream* bloody murder. Bare-chested barbarians wielding the falx charge to bring their weapons to bear on their once Roman overlords as their warhounds bound beside them teeth bared. This is Total War. The AI for the battles is slightly improved perhaps from Rome 2. Was is definite is that the updates Rome 2 received  for over a year have all found their way home to Attila as well.
<br>There are some issues that the game faces. Some report that enemies raze settlements far too often creating large swathes of wasteland that cost ridiculous sums of money to repopulate. Another issue is that upgrading a unit through research makes it so you lose the ability to further recruit the lower-tier unit you replace. This wouldn&apos;t be such an issue if the units you were upgrading didn&apos;t change their role completely. Optimization is another problem, albeit a very slight one. I run the game on a fx6350 and HD7850 at the preset medium/quality settings and a beautiful run she is. One thing to note however, I did customize the anti-aliasing to MLAA instead of the other AA choices. After this change, the game not only looked a lot better (duh) but it surprisingly ran smoother as well.
<br>Creative Assembly is seems have really outdone themselves this time around. The issues the game has can and we can almost be guaranteed will be patched in the coming weeks and months. I almost feel bad for modders this time around as the game has so few faults for me personally that I don&apos;t feel like I need certain mods just for the game to be playable a la Rome 2 pre-EE.
<br>If you are a Total War fan, stop reading this and just get it already. If you consider yourself a grand-strategy fan you need to do the same. Just like watching guys on fire as you send in the dogs to finish them off while their city burns around them? Yeah, you get the idea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5011019">Expand</a></span>

<br>There&apos;s obviously some polishing to be done but the only complain that i can do for now is how the unit mass works. Everyone in combat is too close to each others so it makes a giant single mess.</span>

<br>Here you can fight and build up your empire or can make mistakes and fall.
The AI is good (some smaller issues but those are bearable).
Graphics would be amazing if you had 4000 dollars for a computer but it also runs smoothly on weaker PCs and runs perfectly on my MAC (the game is still nice).
Music: meh...
One thing though! Magyars are not mongoloids...LOL</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">FAR BETTER than Rome II

<br>Things I liked:
<br>=&gt; Visually appealing.  It&apos;s a nice looking game.  Visually better than Rome II.
<br>=&gt; Seems to run smoothly.  At least on my computer (high end 3 years ago).
<br>=&gt; Some improvements from Rome II.  Better speed on encyclopedia.  Runs a bit faster.
<br>=&gt; More interesting time period.
<br>
<br>Things I didn&apos;t like:
<br>=&gt; City building GUI is asinine.  Pictures instead of easy-to-read icons (like in R2) for buildings make it MUCH more difficult to tell what buildings you have in a city.  Unless you spend 50 hours and memorize them, I guess.  A terrible design decision.  MUCH more time spent on city management simply because of poor GUI.
<br>=&gt; Documentation is absolute garbage.  An embarrassment.  Wanted to change a governor.  30 wasted minutes later and I still have no idea how.  Wanted to change a legion name.  Can&apos;t figure it out.  Can&apos;t figure out what religious building stats do.  Etc.
<br>=&gt; Some silly bugs in combat.  Can&apos;t land your ships on a beach 10 meters away if an enemy ship 1000 meters away has already &quot;claimed&quot; the landing spot.  Stuff like that.  Nothing game killing, but obvious and annoying.
<br>
<br>Anyway, don&apos;t think you are going to just jump in because you played R2.  You need to start with a small country.  There are no civilized small countries, though, so it&apos;s either start with the massive Romans or play some tiny barbarian nation out of the gate.
<br>
<br>The game is much more challenging...but it&apos;s the bad kind of challenging.  Poor GUI, poor documentation, etc.
<br>
<br>If I didn&apos;t have a job I might be interested in spending the time necessary to master this game.  But unless you are unemployed, unmarried, or otherwise unengaged, you might be better off spending your time on something else.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll probably just leave it for a couple of months and wait for the community to do the work of documentation that the developers failed so badly on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5031671">Expand</a></span>

The simple fact that Total War was able to pick up the shattered pieces that was Rome II&apos;s failure and put this together is a phenomenon in and of itself. The game plays much better than it&apos;s predecessor and looks just as much better. happiness is much easier to deal with as there is a wider variety of structures and buildings that provide smiles to the populace instead of the single religious building for R2 that did that and nothing else. AI in the game is not so easily fooled this time around, as simple strategies may work against low level generals, but not against battle hardened veterans. Fire adds a new addition to game play. Have not tried online yet, so I cannot voice my opinion on the problems and whether or not R2 problems were addressed. While Shogun 2 is still the best Total War title to date, this should have been the game that succeeded Shogun 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5048080">Expand</a></span>

The AI in ATW, as in R2TW, is absolutely awful and continues to rely on varying degrees of cheats/handicaps to give the impression of a challenge. This is no longer acceptable; AI should have historically and situationally based strategic and operationally based objectives at this point in the series, unlike the wildly chaotic (and historically/strategically ludicrous) and nonsensical AI on display in this game. A good example of this is the tendency of hordes to commit faction suicide in senseless attacks. Crappy battle AI is still a factor, with AI units sometimes continually exchanging places (re: milling in confusion) or standing still next to a wall while getting machinegunned by archers. If anything the focus of graphics over substance is indicative of the CoD approach the Sega/CA are adopting post-Shogun. The lack of significant AI improvements is pathetic. I have tried many, many mods and put in a lot of hours in the hopes of this game being a worthwhile addition to the series, but nothing can repair this level of deficit. This will be my last Total War game, a sad thing coming from a fan of the series since Shogun I, as this game put the nail in the coffin for the series in tandem with RTW2 with the massive lack of substance and innovation, a poor parody of Barbarian Invasion to RTW I in this case. In the end I would recommend the EBII mod for MTW2 over this game, at least the EBII mod put some effort into the substance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5969129">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with the graphics. Even on a high-resolution monitor, all of the terrain looks like it came out of the mid-1990s. Villages look more like a collection of mushrooms. Fortified cities look like a case of ringworm. The forests and plains of Europe look like a badly-done miniatures wargame board with artificial flocking. There can be far more realistic, compelling landscape maps done in 2015. Everything on the screen, from faces to national symbols to text dialogue boxes looks a bit mushy.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not going to get into the tactical combat management because I loathe it. After you go through the tutorial, you need never have to watch your units flail around trying to find the enemy standing a few hundred yards away again. For years I&apos;ve found the battlefield micromanagement of Total War to be tedious and unnecessary. Although I like the idea of battle management, I&apos;ve never been impressed with how the system actually works. You create these wonderful lines of troops, you have this wing here and that wing there, and it all ends up smooshed together in the center regardless. Oh well. Plus, whatever I am doing tends to do worse than autoresolve would result in, so, whatever. Hence, I always auto-resolve battles. Thus to me, the only thing that is of interest in TW games is nation-building.
<br>
<br>There are some interesting possibilities for the political system, and I kind of like what they were trying to do with it, but all of that is buried under a hugely punishing system for basic economic growth, development and conquest.
<br>
<br>If you start as a small state, you are nearly constantly-starved for income to even conquer and hold one or two other cities before everything ends in financial ruin and rebellion. If you do conquer what you think of as a rich Roman city, the buildings are culture-specific, which means you can&apos;t use them. Thought you were going to conquer the world? Nope. You&apos;re stuck in debt with rebels spawning.
<br>
<br>Moreover, turns take forever to resolve cycling through all the nations. (And I thought Civ V was slow...)
<br>
<br>I kept trying to start over and over -- Was I missing something? What can I learn from my prior starts? But the turn delay. Oof!
<br>
<br>That&apos;s when I realized: I am not enjoying this regardless.
<br>
<br>Rated Meh for much better things to do instead.
<br>
<br>Mind you, I really, really wanted to like this game. After trying to play a few times, I felt underwhelmed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5396535">Expand</a></span>

Good job CA - you&apos;ve really listened to the criticism.  The campaign is challenging and complex - there are so many mechanics at work it really takes some mastering (I&apos;ve only played 6 hours or so but that&apos;s usually enough time in TW games to pretty much &quot;do&quot; all the features - not this time!) and its actually &quot;polished&quot;!  Its atmospheric because of the music and the map.
<br>
<br>Return to form for the series - because its gone back to its roots and hasn&apos;t tried to appeal the arcade crowd.  Probably why its getting better user ratings than reviewer ratings whereas in the past the reviewers have rated games higher than users!  Because they seem to like arcade clickfests!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5002918">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But at the moment, we need a blood and gore DLC (with new and more animations than rome 2!)

<br>Thanks CA, you learn from Rome&apos;s 2 failure!</span>

Maybe the developers wanted to create a historically unacurate feeling of impeding doom, but thy have done it in an extremely cheap and ill concived way.
<br>As a Roman empire you preside over a vast expense of towns and villages with mostly LEVEL 1 buildings. This rag tag empire has big problems keeping itself fed and keeping the order. All of your armies are crappy LEVEL 1 units. Looks like Rome managed to conquer the world using inferior troops. Then the barbarian armies crawal out from under the rocks. They don&apos;t have crappy level 1 troops, no sir, they got good troops and they got a lot of them. You need to fight them off. Autoresolve gives you no chance. The only thing you can do is park next to the arrow tower, activate defensive testudo and hope the tower kills enough enemies to break them. Masterpiece of strategy? More like ill concieved, unplayable garbage.
<br>And yes, now every miserable character, and you will have a lot of those has his miserable skills, that you need to click together and again and again and again. There is some lame family tree I don&apos;t care about, but the game will keep on reminding me to click their stuff around.
<br>Overall you fight an uphill battle against highly advanced and omnipresent &quot;barbarians&quot;, together with the rebels and neighbors that want a piece of your inept empire.
<br>
<br>Dear developer: I&apos;m sorry I&apos;ve bought this game, mechanics are a bit better than Rome, but naval battles are a joke, tower mechanics are as crude as it gets and overall can you please lay off boring spies and heros and Crusader king like family tree that doesn&apos;t belong to a strategy game and give me something playable?
<br>Not recommended at all. Waiting for mods.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5020076">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have found performance to be better than Rome II, not a single crash in 4 hours of continued play everything near maxed and it looks better than Rome II too. I am currently running it on an I7 4790k, 8 gig of ram and an Nvidia GTX 680; fps in full twenty stack battles is around 60 fps and the campaign map runs around 40 fps zoomed out.
<br>
<br>As for the game itself, the campaign and battle ai are much improved as is the siege ai, a problem in several earlier games from the series.
<br>
<br>Ignore the bitter haters, many of who clearly do not even own the game, if you have any doubts head on over to twitch and watch a few streams, see that there are no performance problems and make up your own mind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5002366">Expand</a></span>

<br>Solid game, but there is lots of space to improve it expecialy AI. Yep AI best so far but if you take closer look you will see that Ai do very good job at positioning units right before he charge/counter charge and if you counter it he still folow the same path. I saw no units rotation at the heat of battle, no fake retreat/mini ambushes. Thats is crucial. Break AI formation, battle plan (pretty easy to find out) and thats it, if you know what you doing, IF you follow SUN TSU rules of ART OF WAR AI no match for you, but if you go straight you will be SLAIN as newer before. What i noticed that now AI likes split his formation, make larger gabs, not like old one with his monolite formation that is cannons meat. Now its much harder to devastate AI with catapults etc. need good timing. But common battle rule is that if you make gaps you must move a lot more that is hard for this AI, he just cant handle it, but stil creates a  chalenge if you are 1:2 and in 1:4 you need good position and army composition to actualy try your luck that in most cases ends very bad, better avoid this :) also i talk only about legendary difficulty.
<br>
<br>Solid game.
<br>
<br>Buy
<br>
<br>Slay
<br>
<br>Be slayed (most likely)
<br>
<br>And enjoy!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5015847">Expand</a></span>

It has a superficial resemblance to its predecessor, Rome II, and obviously it uses a development of the same engine, but whereas Rome II had a certain predictability about it, Attila has moved beyond that. On campaign or on the battlefield, it is full of surprises, and even on lower difficulty settings it&apos;s almost a certainty that at some stage you&apos;re going to have to reload an earlier save and start over.
<br>
<br>The game captures superbly the grim onset of the Dark Ages, as Rome collapses, the barbarians arrive, and the landscape is littered with empty, desolate settlements that signpost the savage passing of the hordes, chief among them the massive, seemingly unchallengeable might of the Huns.
<br>
<br>This game on release is a huge advance on Rome II, which itself was a work of flawed genius, in my opinion. It&apos;s definitely worth wheeling out the General&apos;s armchair and sallying forth to remake the ancient world in whatever image you care to try and make it in.

<br>Combat is fine, just like the other TW games, and the best thing: The AI isn&apos;t as dumb anymore. It now actually does things that makes sense.
<br>
<br>So why the 6?
<br>
<br>Simple, the game is very heavy. As in very very heavy. I can play BF4 on 1080p, medium with a stable 125fps. But TW:A on low can&apos;t run higher than 60. This would not effect the grade too much, but the loading times are quite long. I didn&apos;t install this on my SSD, which I should have, and that resulted in loading times up to 20 seconds for a battle. In 2015, quite unacceptable.
<br>
<br>Now that is also not too bad and can be played with. What cannot be played with, it the unstability of the game. I have yet to finish a combat in real time, because every single combat, the game &quot;stops working&quot;. I did every single thing to prevent this (googled it), I put every single setting to low. I basically prevented everything that could make the game crash. Once or a couple times is OK. That can happen. But from the 10 battles I tried, all 10 crashed. And battles in TW are not 2 minute clashes. They can take a long time. And to lose every single perfectly executed statagy to a consistent crash is the worst thing this game can do. And it does it.
<br>
<br>And before you think, &quot;omg ur system suckz&quot;, I have never experienced more than 3 crashes in the first 30 hours of any other game, even the ones that are known for crashes. My system is better than the recommended system and I can play it above 60fps. Yet the crashes are gamebreaking.
<br>
<br>Would have been a 9 if not for these issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5013629">Expand</a></span>

I bought them for 5000 &#x434;&#x438;&#x43D;&#x430;&#x440;&#x438;&#x435;&#x432;, without war. I saved up troops (magenta ugly troops...). I broke 2 armies of east Rome and already without resistance I destroyed, I could not be at war generally with Rome, my satrapies would consult without me..........

<br>What I mean is that if your computer cant run the game, your game crashes, or it freezes this does not mean the game is bad. Clearly we know that there are people who run this game fine correct? I do with an i4 and nividia 770 so with this in mind just because your computer cant run this game does not mean it deserves a zero. Did you attempt to see if you would be able to run it prior?
<br>
<br>Next dlc yes it is awful how  developers bundle dlc on a games release, yes it would be nice if it came out already in the game on launch. Does that make the game bad? No most certainly it does not it speaks nothing of the finely crafted graphics, gameplay, and new roving cultures system. My point being you arent objectively looking at the game for its own inherent value.
<br>Example would be if say crash bandicoot one of my favorite games had released exactly as it did but then released 10 dlc levels you would say it was a micro transaction piece of **** My point is by itself Crash bandicoot by itself is still a wonderful game but by including dlc albeit poorly it some how makes the game worse which is absurd.
<br>
<br>Sorry that I did not in too many ways address the game itself I had to go on a mini rant about misdirected anger and undue hate. The game itself is very fun definitely worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5232828">Expand</a></span>

The new algorithm they use with the battle auto-calculate needs adjustment, and they need to fix the lag and crashing. And the AI behaviour with just sacking settlements instead of sack&amp;loot. Only uprisings seem to take cities. When they fix the AI issues this will be a solid 9/10</span>

<br>
<br>But don&apos;t worry this time, I have a great feeling that there will be tons of high-quality DLCs available for us in this installment.
<br>
<br>Developers, don&apos;t keep us waiting, release more DLCs ASAP please!!!

<br>Total war fans have already accumulated a high expectations on DLCs, and are demanding them aggressively in Steam store page.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5104827">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game is horrendously optimized at the moment so if you haven&apos;t got some uber rig to run this game please do not buy it. At this point some might think game must be  amazing looking because &quot;uber&quot; rig required, sadly that is not true. Well they used Rome 2 engine on this game clearly they should try to make new less taxing engine. Two products in row same optimization problems (Attila and Rome 2).
<br>Strategy wise game has really potential they actually listened players at this time. So i give 2/10 because at least they tried to make decent game. Sadly there are loads of more polished strategy games at market at the moment. Played little bit of tutorial and AI seems to be at same moronic level as in other games in this series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5001759">Expand</a></span>

However, I recently picked it up during a Steam sale and have played through two different factions grand campaigns.   Based on my second time with the game I see where I messed up initially.  The new horde mode really adds a ton to the game.  Playing with the Huns is almost like playing a completely different game.  Additionally, almost every faction has vastly different units and building so using the same strategy that worked for one faction may completely fail for another.  I am very satisfied this time around with the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5352699">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>In short Attila is really good. Its challenging, beautiful to look at, has some very smart additions, and whats most important its fun to play.
<br>
<br>It has some issues though like optimization, balance, exploding captured towers etc. but on overall its definitely on par with STW2 in terms of quality well in my opinion its even better, because of greater unit variety and map detail.</span>

Actually feels like a new TW title, being nothing like just a DLC for ROME II. All the factions have unique troops, yet they start with the basic Levy, archers etc. If you want the most unique and fresh experience with TW, play either with Huns or Western Rome.</span>

<br>unreadable map, terrible ai both on battlefield and on global map. bad upgrade system for military units. You will complete whole game with basic ones. Bad system for civil unrest and so on and so on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5371828">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>With Attila, it&apos;s the other way around. While Rome 2 was great, Attila (which is similar in context to the barbarian invasion) is 10 times greater.
<br>
<br>The AI is now a **** unlike its complacent predictable predecessors. The graphics are even better. The soundtrack is amazing, but the real kicker is the reintroduction of some of the original Rome concepts (improved and evolved of course). You do feel like managing an empire more with the family tree concept, political dynamics, and with generals having a more direct impact on warfare.
<br>
<br>Attila will make you refine the choice of the composition of your army with a variety of melee, spear, cavalry, specialist, range, and artillery units. It used to be a monotonously simpler composition in earlier games.
<br>
<br>You can also utilize combined might of naval and units more effectively and the battles are simply more fun.
<br>
<br>The new features are great. This is a great game.
<br>
<br>I will only ask CA to give us enough time to learn and enjoy this game in it&apos;s totality before you release the next TW title. There is no hurry. At least give us 6-12 months.
<br>
<br>Another 1000+ hours reserved for pure total war!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5080677">Expand</a></span>

Total War: Attila takes you back to the Dark ages, way back to 395AD. Total War: Attila is what Rome II should have been, with its dynamic gameplay, this add on is so much more compelling.
<br>
<br>Total War: Attila focuses on the fall of the empire, the player chooses from a selection of tribes, each tribe representing different campaigns, which means each tribe offers their own challenges and advantages for the player. With the chosen tribe,the player must try survive and profit from the collapse of order. Trouble comes in many forms, bad weather, court intrigues, diplomatic crises with others and plagues, all of which makes surviving a struggle. The life like battles are thrilling.
<br>
<br>With this new add on comes some cool new abilities. It&#x2019;s now possible for horde tribes to survive out on the road without having to have a static base. The life like battles are thrilling, there are quite a few menus and screens, which take a while to get used to.  Even though Creative Assembly have worked on their menus to shorten and simplify them, they are still quite complicated and can be frustrating at times.
<br>
<br>There are some technical difficulties and we had trouble getting the game to run smoothly as its such a large game but as soon as we got past this, it was a great, fun game and definitely the addition to this brilliant series that we&#x2019;ve been waiting for. It can be very difficult and frustrating at times but overall we did enjoy playing Total War: Attila.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-attila/user-reviews?user_review_id=5057891">Expand</a></span>
