The &apos;game&apos; part of the game is 3rd person &apos;avoid the monster&apos; and a few chase scenes. No puzzles. Nice story, but adds nothing new to the lore genre. The scenes where you find journals are very cool. 3rd person VR works well - especially when you can see the spotlight moving with your head. Maybe the best looking game I&apos;ve played in VR, but I still don&apos;t think I could recommend it at more than $5. I look forward to seeing what Insomniac can do with a full budget behind them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/edge-of-nowhere/user-reviews?user_review_id=6595040">Expand</a></span>

I am not the fastest player in the world, and I easily finished this in about 4 hours, not counting the time it takes to get it working. It is a lot like the introductory or training level you might find in a real game like Tomb Raider. Just about the time I was confident of all the controls and tactics of sneaking around, climbing with ice axes, shooting a very slow gun, and slashing goopy creatures (all look about the same) with the axe it is over.  It&apos;s like, OK, we got them into a lot of trouble, we know what we&apos;re doing now...where&apos;s the rest of the game?
<br>
<br>Graphically it is reasonably beautiful. The RIFT is capable of more, but these graphics run smoothly and and the controls obey with reasonable accuracy. There is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with it at all; good story line, good effects, smooth playing...and over almost before it gets started.
<br>
<br>Had anyone had the decency to let me know I was spending $30 for a few hours of play, I would not have. This is a good start in the VR gaming world...but it is only that. I have played demos that ran longer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/edge-of-nowhere/user-reviews?user_review_id=6556944">Expand</a></span>
