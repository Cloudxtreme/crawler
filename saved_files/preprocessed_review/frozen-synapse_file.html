The game is not for anyone - that can be said about any game out there. But in this case what I mean is that unlike other games where you just rush and kill everything in sight, in Frozen Synapse you must take a slower and more tactical approach. You are in command of a squad of soldiers, each equipped with different weapons, from shotguns through sniper rifles all the way to rocket launchers. The game has a good tutorial which can make a person understand the basic and more advanced tactics - from the standard take cover tactics to the more advanced search and destroy where each member of the squad covers the blind spot of the other and thus advance in their search for the enemies. Afterwards people can chose whether they want to advance to the campaign, practice against the computer in skirmish matches or go online against other people around the world. This is a game which would be more suited to the gamers which favor brains and strategy over the standard gamers which know only how to react and rely on reflexes while gaming ... If you are of the first type - I recommend buying this, if you are from the latter one - prove us wrong, joins us and show us ! :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=2374843">Expand</a></span>

<br>Basicly, you take full control of a squad of infiltrators, and have to eliminate the opposing force. Micromanagement is a must if you want to succeed in this game, and this makes the planning sequence of the game crucial to your success.

FS sacrifices pretty graphics and fast action, for a more thoughtful, bare bones experience. The soundtrack is very good, and fits nicely to the mood of the game. The single player campaign is long and challenging, but it&apos;s the multiplayer mode that really shines. The secret sauce for this game, in my opinion, is that both players&apos; turns resolve at the same time. You can plan out your own moves, and then endlessly simulate what you think your opponent will do until you get your plan just right. You not only have to account for what your opponent has done, but also what you think he might do.  After both players submit their turns, you get to see the results. The anticipation of waiting to see if your plan worked the way you thought it would is awesome. Games can take from several minutes, to several days, depending on how fast each player submits their turn. You can get email notifications that it&apos;s your turn if you are offline, which is a neat feature. The slow pace and fairly high learning curve may turn some people off. It took me about 5 hours of playing before I really had any clue what I was doing. It&apos;s a different kind of strategy game, but potentially very rewarding if you have the patience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=2305118">Expand</a></span>

There are a few things that bug me about this game, first is the music seems to be rather repetitive, the second is the fact in single player after you get past the newbie missions the AI seems to psychically know where your guys are. Psychic AI is a bad idea, it makes AI appear to be smarter than it is, I put 1 guy in the corner on his own and didn&apos;t move him for 10 turns, instantly after the other guys were eliminated, all the enemies flocked his position, he was completely out of sight in a corner with his back to them, they didn&apos;t vet out any of the other rooms that had not been occupied. I like to play strategy games but ones that are not reliant on an active user-base (I think of Defcon again because it&apos;s pretty much a dead community now), so a decent single-player is essential. I like reactive AI instead of AI that knows where all your units are and just employs strategy to fool you into thinking it doesn&apos;t. It needs to experiment with techniques during a game and learn from it&apos;s mistakes. Sure if you give away your position with gunfire or fast movement, you could expect an enemy to know where you are, but this is just ridiculous!<br>6/10 for the psychic AI but 7/10 otherwise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1670959">Expand</a></span>

I rather like being able to equip individual soldiers with weapons and gear, but this game doesn&apos;t allow it. It doesn&apos;t have equipment at all, just soldier types. But this formula works, snipers do great at long range, rifle men at medium ranges and shotgun soldiers for close combat. It&apos;s like a rock paper scissor formula. BUT my love of customization of individual soldiers comes from X-COM, and this game doesn&apos;t try to be X-COM. Other than that, the game is well worth the price tag and will provide plenty of entertainment to those willing to play!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1698141">Expand</a></span>

Dont expect fast gameplay, its more about planing the best moves... a bit like chess. The singleplayer is challanging and fun and the multiplayer even more with a lots of features like rankings, stats, socialmedia integration (Youtube uploads, Facebook, Twitter), integrated IRC client. The devs seem to be realy active, they answer in IRC chat and listen to the wishes of the community.

This is RAW TACTICS, NO LUCK, RAW TACTICS. No idiots are aloud near this game. This game is for people who are smart, because this is a hard game to learn. But its good when you have learned the game. There is over 45 missions in the campaign and its got a half descent story line. But the main focus is the multiplayer. You are able to play loads of matches at once. Mabey over a thew minutes, or going over a thew days. You need to buy this game, its good, a great game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1670426">Expand</a></span>

But after a while you understand how to work it (lol that semi-opaci means that it can be crouched under for instance) . I haven&apos;t even started on the online! The story line is actually rather deep tale about an abusive government that is told bit by bit. The characters are actually interesting. But the combat is the best part.<br><br>The game is simultaneous turn based battles. Each player creates their turn, then they both see the out come. This means the game is very much like a chess game. Don&apos;t come into the game expecting fast pased cod like game play!  An eventual tool is the space bar. When pressed your troops will act out their orders this allows very precises tactics (such as popping up from 2 different angles at the exact same time).<br><br>Even who shoots first is deeply thought out, a mix of timing (who sees who microseconds first), if one has been waiting and weapons (e.g. close range=shot gun win generally etc).<br><br>So look, i could prattle on all day about how great this game is and you will all probably just look at the end score so ill wrap this up.<br><br>Although Frozen Synapse looks and sounds lame and old school, the game play is fresh and really interesting ! I could easy see myself playing this for a very long time with friends (especially with the Facebook integration). I would recommend that anyone who loves a bit of slow but intelligent strategy would love this game !<br><br>10/10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1694463">Expand</a></span>

I used some of the single player levels to learn about the game.  braved up and tried multiplayer and never went back to the story mode.  no need.  The music is amazing, the graphics are fitting.  all around this time sink got way more out of me than I paid.  and I still have a smile. so..  high score from me.</span>

Once you do master the gameplay, the game is put down by repetitiveness and bland level design. The minimalist glowing neon art style is interesting at first, but soon turns to boredom since levels all look pretty much the same. The amateurish looking UI tends to overlap the gameplay area, making it harder to see what&apos;s going on. This is made worse by the fact that you need to use the keyboard to scroll the area. The absence of a mini-map doesn&apos;t help things either. Overall, a bland, repetive game with a cumbersome interface. Put your money elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115026">Expand</a></span>

This review will focus on what the other reviews don&apos;t describe. To ensure constant action in this turn-based game, you can even play multiple games at the same time. You can watch replays of other games just for fun, or to learn how others play, by showing the commands they did. Contrary to single-player there are also &apos;dark&apos; games (the most common online) where you only see the opponents when they are visible to your squad. The commands at first seem a bit intimidating, but you soon realize it is nothing more telling each guy what he will do for the next five seconds:run, move, aim move aiming (as in walk one way while aiming in another direction), shoot rocket, throw grenade (bounce off walls), duck, stand, and wait. Opponent taking too long? Play another game simultaneously and switch back and forth. No time to finish now? Being turn-based this means you can just come back, play a turn, and if your opponent is not there, he will do the same until the game is played out. It IS turn-based after all. Nice community and a fun game that really grows on you (even when you lose). And I&apos;m only about 50-50 online at the moment so this is not being written by that guy who is wiping everyone out, trying to convince you to be more fodder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1648733">Expand</a></span>

The flaws in this game were so many and so immediately apparent that after 20 minutes of &quot;play&quot; I needed a break. For starters, the user can&apos;t customize the controls. This may not be a huge concession for most players, but in the year 2011 it astonishes me that developers still can&apos;t grasp the most basic of needs. It isn&apos;t hard to program customizable controls and almost every user will want to change at least one aspect of a control scheme. In a complicated strategy game the last thing a user should have to do is hunt for the proper key. Not to mention the fact that there is no reference for the control scheme, which brings me to my next point. The tutorial system is horrible. Not only does it baby the user with overly simplified instructions, it goes so far as to assume that the user is a moron and needs to be told that &quot;doubling clicking&quot; means &quot;to click the mouse button twice in rapid succession.&quot; The worst part? You can&apos;t skip ANY parts of the tutorial. It isn&apos;t broken down by chapters or subjects and there is no way to skip forward or backward. You have to do everything step-by-step and if you want to review something you just did you have to start the entire tutorial over. This includes trying to figure out the how the computer interprets your commands. Trying to make the AI do one specific thing? Run through the entire tutorial and pay extremely close attention, because if you miss it you&apos;ll be doing it all over again. Finally, there&apos;s the AI. Absolutely horrible. No matter what you do your team will never spot the enemy first. In fact the enemy AI will often avoid your line of sight as if by some magical psychic power. Set up the perfect trap? The enemy will never go near that section of the map. What&apos;s worse, the game starts you out with short range guns. Good luck trying to get within the required twenty feet to actually shoot at an enemy. This game is frustration incarnate. I will admit that the premiss behind the game is fantastic. However the execution is so poor that the most fun you&apos;ll have with this game is uninstalling it while you scream at your monitor. Don&apos;t waste your time or your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1692445">Expand</a></span>

Idea seems good and the art direction is recognizable but entry barrier is too high. Sorry.</span>

First minutes were pretty hard, you can easily get discouraged... Controls does not seem clear, but when you get hang of it - it becomes easy and intuitive. Gameplay is tactical driven, but you&apos;ll mostly find rock-paper-scissors mechanics here. In every mission you will take control of soldiers, in random generated scenery. There&apos;s always an objective, but nothing will surprise you - attack, defend, take hostage, rescue hostage.. and so on. In most situations you&apos;ll have limited turns to complete you task, so no messing around. Gameplay involves planning phase, when you give orders... then you can test your plan and finally - execute it. The other side is doing the same thing so you need to think ahead of your opponent. So where&apos;s the rock-paper-scissors mechanics? Your team operate in simple ways - soldier in cover always beats exposed unit, shotgun wins with everyone in close quarters, sniper always beats every unit in distance ( vice versa he gets killed in close quarters in a second) ... and so on and so on. You&apos;ll at least hour to get a grip of it and think about every possible situation and its outcome. Then you can really enjoy the game ! :) Single Player Campaign is about 50 (!!!) missions long... I guess im not far than 10 and it&apos;s getting seriously hard. Nevertheless, multiplayer is the most interesting feature in Frozen Synapse. Playing with live opponent is far more exciting. The mechanics allow you to participate in 5 or more matches in one time, you just conclude your turn and while waiting for other player - play another skirmish. Of course your can compete in leaderboards or even upload your replays on youtube...  instantly.  What else can i say? Buy it.  It&apos;s great. Support indie developers. Support GOOD games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1981836">Expand</a></span>

I played the demo for 20 minutes and beat a few skirmishes, enjoyed the ambient music and decided hey I get a free copy with this game once I buy it too? Sweet. Gift for a friend. This game is meant to exercise the brain. Its like that Sudoku but with guns, and instead of numbers you have infantry. It is very addicting and I have a hard time putting it down.

                                        <span>Like chess, it&apos;s fairly easy to learn, but impossible to master. The gameplay is fun and rewarding and has a clean style. Planning out your moves to be executed simultaneously with the opponent can lead to amusing clashes. The only thing I feel it lacks is COOP vs AI and team battles, which they say they are working on. On a side note, the soundtrack is great.</span>

If you don&apos;t move your guys the computer won&apos;t go near them. If you do move them the computer will flank them in the same turn. You never stand a chance. Most frustrating game ever! Wish I never bought this game. DON&apos;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</span>

Once you learn how to play and move around the maps the fun begins!  I jumped into a couple weeks after the release and feel I can play well against the more experienced players.

<br>
<br>-It&apos;s targeted to a niche slow-paced strategy crowd, so if you prefer fast-paced RTS games or twitchy shooters, you may want to pass on this one. -The AI is hard as balls and is almost psychic. It takes a lot of PATIENCE to beat the campaign. You can&apos;t just pray that the AI won&apos;t make a certain move- you need to position your units such that the AI will be forced into a loss. That being said, it makes winning all the more satisfying =]
<br>
<br>-I couldn&apos;t really understand the storyline. It&apos;s probably just me. Maybe you have to play it a few times, but it involves a lot of strange names that are hard to keep track of.
<br>
<br>-The main reason I gave it an 8/10 is because there are a lot of bugs and frequent crashes. The final mission bugged out on me so I had to watch the ending on Youtube. This is rather frustrating.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re cool with all that, then you really can&apos;t go wrong for the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1719025">Expand</a></span>

Anyway, the concept is simple, you make moves at the same time as your opponent and your goal is to pre-empt them.  The controls are simple, the UI futuristic, soundtrack is worthy of an album and gameplay is up there with the best.  It&apos;s war-chess and I love it.</span>

Just like in the game of chess, it takes very little time to learn what your units can do, and a lifetime to enjoy leveraging them in battle against other tacticians.<br><br>I&apos;m sure there are folks who simply won&apos;t get it, since there are no screams of agony, no explosions, no screen shake and no sex scenes supporting an agonizing romantic subplot. I don&apos;t think the genre has ever appealed to everyone. But I&apos;m thrilled to see the size of the active player base already. Clearly, we are not alone.<br><br>I&apos;m scoring the game 8/10, leaving room for improvement in a few polish issues. Little things that really don&apos;t detract from the core game experience. For example, the in-game IRC window can&apos;t be dragged to a preferred location on screen, and can&apos;t be configured to suppress JOINs and PARTs.<br><br>Be aware that, as of 4 days since the official release, they&apos;ve been having trouble with the multiplayer game servers, because they didn&apos;t expect the enormous uptake. But having chatted to the developers, I&apos;m confident that the teething issues will be resolved soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1648471">Expand</a></span>

Levels are randomly generated and no matter how well you play there is always a factor of surprise as turns are completely simultaneous and you can only guess what your opponent might do. During planning, it is possible to even control images of enemy units and observe different outcomes depending on what the other side might do. There are 5 types of units, each having its own strengths. Shotgunner moves fast and owns everyone in close range. Machine gunner moves at normal speed, has long range and heavily benefits from cover. Grenadier has ability to toss grenades directly or  bounce them on the walls. Rocket soldier is the only unit able to destroy walls (killing everyone in small radius). Finally, sniper is incredibly balanced. It has its place and is very useful but not overpowered. When two equal units meet head to head, their orientation, previous movement and relation to covers decides who will win. Frozen synapse&apos;s rules are deterministic.  I am giving 9 just because rules IMO are not sufficiently well explained in the game and graphics could be a bit more complex. Bare game-play is pure 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1655156">Expand</a></span>

My only complaints are the storyline and the unfair advantage the AI gets. Usually, I start with 1 rocket and two machinegunners while the AI also gets a shotgunner. The story I could not understand, but you don&apos;t need to in order to like this game. Otherwise, it is a very good game that deserves all the respect it can get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1722206">Expand</a></span>

I will agree that the AI in single player can be frustratingly clever at times and unfortunately, the online community is fairly quiet at the moment. The gameplay however is hugely satisfying and addictive. When a plan goes your way, it feels awesome. The music is also great (at first) as well as the cool art style. The fact you get two copies with each purchase is clever, so get someone to play with, and you will enjoy this immensely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=3241945">Expand</a></span>

An over the head, simultaneous turn tactical shooter might sound confusing, but the game is brilliantly put together. You have 5 different types of units, each specialized for certain tasks. You plan out your troop&apos;s movements in 5 second intervals while your enemy does the same, trying to predict where he&apos;s hiding his guys and what he&apos;s likely to do. Then you prime the movement and pray that everything goes according to plan, because it sure as hell isn&apos;t likely to.
<br>
<br>Delightfully unforgivable, FS trains you to anticipate and plan for everything. Is he going to shoot a rocket here, or is it safe to keep your gunner behind this wall for another turn? It&apos;s been 10 seconds since you saw that shotgunner, better lob a grenade around the corner, in case he&apos;s hiding there. Get your sniper trained on that wall and blow it open with a rocket so you can start taking potshots at whoever&apos;s on the other side. Your prerun shows that you can&apos;t get a gunner across this battlefield before he gets his brains blasted. Have a spare unit draw some fire long enough to get both troops to cover!
<br>
<br>Overall, FS is a great game at a great price. Challenging, fun to master, and put together very well, I&apos;d recommend this game for any fan of the slower, more thoughtful strategy game.
<br>
<br>My only criticism of the game is that every match is ranked. Even a friendly practice round with a buddy will affect your overall score. I&apos;d like an unranked game feature, to take the pressure off of winning even casual round.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=3939323">Expand</a></span>

The most interesting part is planning out both your moves and predicting your enemy&apos;s moves, playing it out, and optimizing your turn based on your available information and predictions. LoS and cover can be frustrating with you occasionally you being shot before you can shoot the enemy without explanation from the game. Single player is pretty generic and multiplayer is a bit empty. I assume most people set up their own matches between friends because I get the feeling this is one of those games that a dozen hardcore people play publicly just to stomp people online. This could be a great tactical play-by-email game between friends but I wouldn&apos;t recommend it unless your friends get it or you buy multiple copies for some. Be prepared for 30min-1hr long turns and week long games; this is something you really have to dig deep into.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/frozen-synapse/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822678">Expand</a></span>
