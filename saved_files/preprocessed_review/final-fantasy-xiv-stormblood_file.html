Zone design was improved compared to HW but copying of assets is still pretty noticeable in areas like terrain doodads. I understand buildings having only 1 or 2 varieties but I shouldn&#x2019;t see things like the same rock and tree over and over so easily which can usually be dealt with but just rotating an object. Ruby Sea feels like a huge empty zone given the water doesn&#x2019;t add much actual gameplay either besides swimming. If you&#x2019;re going to add a mostly water zone you should at the very least add some type of gimmick rather than having it be nothing more than a barren land of emptiness and copy pasted rocks and kelp that you swim through. In general some zones just didn&#x2019;t feel like they reached their full potential such as the Lochs and Yanxia while others like Azim Steppe were really well done. The zones still feel dead in general when compared to WoW&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;ll see NPC&#x2019;s actually doing things such as bears hunting fish or predators hunting prey and in general FF14 zone design seems to be nothing more than &#x2018;this is the bear area and over there&#x2019;s the wolf area and this final area is the bird area and the mobs are just all walking back and forth in their little zone&#x2019; and doodads just seem thrown into the game world and rarely are blended in.
<br>
<br>The main issue with SB right now is that once you hit 70 the game is the same exact game as HW. You do the same 3 dungeons over and over (with high DPS queues) to grind out tomes and in general are doing nothing at all actually new unlike how Legion added Mythic+, artifact weapons, and the world quest system (an improvement of the old dailies system). And of course with Omega they are continuing the convoluted gearing system from Alexander. Square is once again relegating any new systems to patches and we have to hope these new systems are well developed unlike Lord of Verminion and Diadem and even things like the eventual beast tribes may just be the same ol&#x2019; 3 daily quests. I&#x2019;m iffy on this thing Square does where they release a &#x2018;skeleton&#x2019; expansion and how they instead put new systems into patches I&#x2019;m holding out hope that they surprise me with the upcoming patches though given Square has been nothing but predictable with FF14 so I&#x2019;m not getting my hopes too high. It doesn&apos;t help that the one new system, Eureka, has already been delayed making the first patch pretty barren for a patch coming 4 months after release with some of the content not even being patched in till a month after that. So 5 months for everything while in that time Legion released 2 patches following a 77 day release schedule that added far more content than 4.1 is adding.  Stormblood is a mediocre expansion and the playerbase should honestly expect so much better from a company like Square.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood/user-reviews?user_review_id=7562241">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Story:
<br>The pacing is tighter and more streamlined than Heavensward, almost no filler or unnecessary detour in the main quest. Although I prefer the setting and setup of Heavensward, Stormblood has various twists and unforgettable moments, I&apos;m excited to see where the story will unfolds in 4.x patches.
<br>
<br>- Gameplay:
<br>The two new Jobs (Samurai and Red Mage) are AWESOME. Tried both of them a lot in Palace of the Dead and they play very fluidly with interesting mechanics. Red Mage in particular seems very enjoyable to play, they got the jack of all trades role right. While Samurai is pure DPS monster with zero utility to the party, skill wise it is a bit harder than other melee DPS since you have to keep track a lot of things. The battle system changes they introduced is also mostly a success and make old jobs more streamlined (a bit dumbed down, but understandable, WoW had worse skill pruning).
<br>
<br>- Music:
<br>No comment needed here. Still reign supreme as the best MMO music.
<br>
<br>- Endgame:
<br>Can&apos;t give full impression on the endgame since raid is not out yet (2 weeks from now). The only endgame content currently is 2 Extreme Primal which I haven&apos;t tried yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood/user-reviews?user_review_id=7371648">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The two new dps classes have left the already unbalanced dps/tank/healer ratios in the game way further out of whack leaving dps players in duty finder queue for outrageous periods of time. A design mistake that everyone has been waiving red flags about for months. I pray SE&apos;s gamble that the population will settle back at an acceptable ratio pays off. Otherwise they&apos;d better have another tank class in the works!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>Yes, there was a technical snafu (bad decision) that left most players completely unable to progress the main story after just a few steps, for the first 48 hours of early access. I myself was furious and still to some extent am. I will never forgive SE for leaving such a short-sighted design choice in place without comment or correction for fully half of the early access period, and still no public acknowledgement or apology for the foolish mistake. That said, if you&apos;re writing your review or quitting the game based solely on that long-corrected issue, your opinion is worthless to me, authors of these raging 1-star reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood/user-reviews?user_review_id=7375413">Expand</a></span>

<br>So after</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I promised myself to never review a Square Enix product: ALL of their games are trash nowadays, and I sincerely have no faith left after they games became hollow shells with nothing in it.
<br>But hatred aside, the reason why I&apos;m writing this review it&apos;s because I was legitimately curious about some of the changes - Bowmage anyone? -  and I had a few friends wanting me to return.
<br>So after Raubahn Hard Mode, well timed &quot;DDoS&quot; attacks, and other issues that I couldn&apos;t care less (It&apos;s not that SE is a triple A company anyway!)  what do we have? The exact same issue that Heavensward had at launch, which is NO **** CONTENT!
<br>
<br>There is NOTHING TO DO, there is just the usual lame raid to do - which only 1% of the entire player base even cares about - 2 primal that are both equally bad (and I give credit to HW: Bismarck and Ravana were somewhat good, but Lakshmi and Susano are just BAD), and NOTHING ELSE. NOOOOOTHIIIING. Not even a relic, or dailies, anything new or different to do - even aquapolis is the same thing with just a new coat of paint and even POTD was not updated with lvl 70 rooms.
<br>
<br>There. Is. Nothing. To. Do.
<br>
<br>But wait, you may say  &quot;There&apos;s crafting, there&apos;s pet collecting, there are the old raids, and there are the old primals for mounts and there&apos;s gold saucer and hunts and-&quot;.
<br>
<br>Well let me spell it out for ya: old content is NOT new content and the fact that I can &quot;do&quot; old primals for their mounts, do old stuff for pets, do old stuff for glamour, or gold saucer for [Insert reason] Is moot because...doesn&apos;t WoW have hundreds of pets and mounts and little **** events all year long, and players always complain that there&apos;s nothing to do there? Jump ship and play WoW and start collecting those hundreds of mounts, pets and attend at each event.
<br>
<br>At least they don&apos;t take a day to complete!
<br>
<br>Crafting is useless since the gear you create is objectively inferior (after the FCOB fiasco) and it&apos;s only used to make glamour costumes. Nice?
<br>
<br>Oh and about hunts: let them die please, this community is toxic already.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sincerely stunned here...I mean the changes for the classes are legitimately good, for the most part, and I do like them but there&apos;s nothing else to do: you&apos;ll basically do the same exact thing you did back in 2.0 and 3.0, except 2.0 was a relaunch!
<br>The story sucks but hey if people enjoy thy olde English dialogues filled with voiceless cutscenes, horribly paced and written dialogues and countless amounts of purple proses (essentially needless descriptions) this is for them. Ultima at least had a reason and was one of the first for doing this stuff but making quirky dialogues don&apos;t make a character more interesting. It makes them one dimensional.
<br>
<br>So no content, few nice changes, a debatable story...the community? Well considering that I was name called, threatened, harassed and much more for simply telling my opinion about the game&apos;s fault well, It&apos;s safe to say it&apos;s as good as it gets!
<br>
<br>Just kidding, it&apos;s toxic and unless you&apos;re an ultra, super mega fan of SE and everything they **** from their anuses, you&apos;ll be hated to the guts. Heck, I&apos;ve been bashed for disliking the main story, despite having countless and countless of RPGs - both western and Japanese - under my belt.
<br>I&apos;m sorry I guess Tales of Vesperia, Digital Devil Saga, Dragon Age Origins or Witcher 3 are NOTHING compared to this &quot;amazing&quot; story.
<br>
<br>Yes I&apos;m being sarcastic
<br>
<br>But whiners aside, even PvE wise the game is becoming toxic: it was never good for sure but nowadays people are overly cranky and will start swearing right and left as soon as someone makes a mistake or something or even attempts to say something different than the masses. In fact, Raiding is the ultimate toxicity shower since the game is extremely meta-oriented, which means that if your class is not wanted you&apos;re NOT going to raid. It doesn&apos;t help either that guilds - SORRY, I mean free companies haven&apos;t got any buffs or changes and still remain as useless as ever.
<br>
<br>Add the fact that many of the older issues aren&apos;t fixed, like housing and crashes to name a couple, and despite their promise of delivering more content after dropping ps3 was a flat out lie, and here we have basically an expansion which repeats the same mistakes of heavensward and, without a single shred of hatred or pity, I see it very grim...after all, HW was such a bad expansion that dropped the player base from 1 million, to basically half, and we might even have a harsher blow.
<br>
<br>But considering players love to waste cash on 20 buck costumes and on a rental service for additional space - which is scummy at best - I don&apos;t think this game will ever die.
<br>
<br>With that said if you&apos;re ABSOLUTELY sure about this, just buy the base game (10 bucks) and its free month: there are 285 main quests in ARR alone and by then you will realize if it&apos;s worth it or not.
<br>SB has HW included, ramping the quests to 522 - which are REQUIRED to play the endgame.

From a new compelling story about liberation from tyranny and the hardships of war, to completely revamping jobs and adding new mechanics, the game has improved by leaps and bounds.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: Stormblood has made several balance changes to PvE and PvP, not least of which is the abandoning of the Cross Class System in favor of a new Cross Role System. This means you no longer have to level something like Thaumaturge in order to be a good healer with Swiftcast, as that is one of your options in the Cross Role menu. PvP has now been given a normalized stat and skill system, resulting in matches that are more heavily reliant on player skill than before, and thanks to the increased potency on almost all skills, PvP has become less of a stalemate fest.
<br>
<br>Graphics: FF14 is still a game that is very appealing to look at and the new zones continue to impress with their level of detail and visual fidelity for an MMO. From different textures to show erosion on rock, to the interesting architecture of Ala Mhigo and Othard, the art team continues to deliver.
<br>
<br>Music: Masayoshi Soken hasn&apos;t let us down as he continues to find ways to take a leitmotif and spin it in several interesting ways throughout the different zones and battles. The Royal Menagerie having one of the most climactic themes of any battle yet was wholly appropriate given the scale of what you are undertaking at the climax of the story. I found myself getting so hyped that I would occasionally sing the small chant from the main theme of the expansion during boss fights.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of MMO&apos;s Stormblood is a fantastic expansion that builds upon an already strong foundation, and with amazing raids like Omega and Ivalice coming out soon, there&apos;s always more content to keep the game fresh on the way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood/user-reviews?user_review_id=7390795">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately, the zones continued the downward spiral started in HW. Most of them are huge with very little interesting things happening. I blame flying. Also swimming was woefully underused. ARR still has the most interesting and unique zones. I was also not a fan of how parts of some zones were completely walled off by the story. Having high level areas be filled with high level aggressive monsters ala ARR is a much better way to go about it.
<br>
<br>Worth buying if you&apos;re already an active player. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s good enough to change your mind if you didn&apos;t like it already.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a lot of people **** about the price change. They are dumbasses. The only change was that Brazilian and Russian players on the Steam version are now paying the same monthly fee as Brazilian and Russian players who played the not-Steam version, which is also now on par with what the rest of the world is paying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood/user-reviews?user_review_id=7506404">Expand</a></span>

A 3 hour queue to log in, broken main story quests, and constant disconnections because Square-Enix refuse to reinforce their server infrastructure during major releases, are all unacceptable considering we pay to play this game.
<br>
<br>The content in the expansion is great the new area&apos;s, classes, quests, story and music are fantastic. If you played a White Mage or Dark Knight sorry, they&apos;ve trashed your class, but other than that, the game is great and well worth jumping back in to once they get their act together and sort their servers out.
<br>
<br>As of right now I&apos;m giving this 6 out of 10 because the issues are so bad.
<br>Consider this a 8 out of 10 once the issues are corrected.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood/user-reviews?user_review_id=7371073">Expand</a></span>

<br>Can we just talk about how far this game has come? This expansion brings the best story yet, two fan favorite classes, gives the combat more options for most classes and expands on the battle mechanics in new primal battles, dungeons, and raids. I&apos;ve tried out Dark Knight through to level 70, Red Mage (simplistic but fun), and I&apos;ve experienced all of the PvE content of the latest patch, I can say without a doubt that FFXIV has only gotten better and more refined with time.
<br>
<br>This game does what it always has but it does it now better than ever, bringing it up to the quality of World of Warcraft easily, and one of the best dev teams you&apos;ve ever seen in a game.  Bravo, well done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood/user-reviews?user_review_id=7392613">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Zones are absolutely gorgeous (especially the Ruby Sea and the Stepp&apos;s)
<br>
<br>The Sound track is very well done as well  (Especially the Lakashimi fight) !!
<br>
<br>Cons: Is the final Trial Duty (very hard even for a veteran like me) the mechanics are somewhat complicated especially when the corners start pulsating and you dont know where the safe spot is (you get hit and its insta death)
<br>
<br>My Initial Review below (was originally 2 stars)
<br>
<br>&quot;After the initial Launch of the game FFXIV ARR they had massive server issues and problems (this is ontop of 2 closed betas and 1 open beta) that was 3-4 years ago , i then gave them benifit of the doubt cause it was their first launch of the new IP but after Heavensward i gave it a 5 because of the same issues aka server and bugs , now with Stormblood with all the issues on Early access and some now affecting official launch , ontop of the developement team not doing anything to resolve the issues only apologizing and twiddling their thumbs this is getting a 2 out of 10 due to the fact customer service sucks and we pay a $15 a month subscription to this game ontop of shelling out another $40 for this expansion , i will write an updated review later but for now this is my review in progress so far !!!&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood/user-reviews?user_review_id=7370941">Expand</a></span>
