<br>A pleasant surprise. For me, better than Dirt Rally, because I do not have to bother to car going straight ahead. Physics also is better, and the tracks are excellent. Oh yes! routes are strongest point of this game. The game is not a technological pioneer, but its cohesion-as a whole is at the highest level. Thank you, Sebastien Loeb, that you believed in Milestone. I once doubted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sebastien-loeb-rally-evo/user-reviews?user_review_id=6059364">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gameplay is great. The special stages are finally just as we ride for 30 years by car. A large number of high-speed corners. Much you can see the contribution of Sebastien Loeb. Very good vertical movements of the camera in the foreground relative to the other. Milestone surprised me. Sounds at first seemed absurd. However interfere only when watching the replay. That may actually be better. The career mode! This is finally it!
<br>
<br>If you do not think he&apos;s better than the master steering Sebastien Loeb, the game will be your best racing experience.
<br>
<br>I am very positively surprised. I did not like the WRC series in the execution of Milestone. I expected another &quot;hare&quot;. You did great!
<br>
<br>I give eight for the excellent physics, It also can be seen in replays, stunning visuals and a sense of speed,
<br>a piece of great history, routes, and cars that do not exist in other games.
<br>Minus two for sound and for the fact that the Polish language version guy reads in career mode pretending to Sebastien Loeb. He should speak Sebastien subtitles only Polish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sebastien-loeb-rally-evo/user-reviews?user_review_id=6055368">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Second, the roads in the game are all flat. sure, there are hills and crests, but even the dirt roads look and feel like  someone simply painted  a gravel wallpaper on a perfectly maintained tarmac road.
<br>
<br>third, this game is absolutely unomtimized. fps slows down for NO REASON AT ALL
<br>
<br>fourth, the camera is broken. in corners, it jerks wildly from side to side.
<br>
<br>fifth, this is actually &quot;listen to some bloke talk&quot;-simulator. this guy&apos;s voice samples constantly come on and go on and on about some nonsense like you&apos;ve never seen a car before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sebastien-loeb-rally-evo/user-reviews?user_review_id=6050102">Expand</a></span>

Input Lag,and a feeling that is simply Arcade, a few people seem to be crying that this game is the best thing ever since sliced bread, but their names and locations are usually found to be Italian, which makes me wonder who really is trying to hype this junk. Just go watch videos on you tube, even when people get great frame rates the stutter is ridiculous. No in depth graphics options either. No support, and a company that is known to never patch their games. Its a shame, it had potential it looks ok and for an arcade game it could have been decent. I5 4690k Two R9390x&apos;s and the game stutters. Family share: Does the same on I5 4690k and a 970. Poor title and not worth the money they are asking
<br>
<br>Updated review:  My 144hz Panel is a part of the issue and milestones poor vsync.  Changed rating to reflect what is  turning out to be a pretty decent game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sebastien-loeb-rally-evo/user-reviews?user_review_id=6073567">Expand</a></span>

<br>What use is a great game if one third of its PC install base can`t play it because of the bugs? For me it works ok but the lack of post release support brings down the score to 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sebastien-loeb-rally-evo/user-reviews?user_review_id=6963492">Expand</a></span>

For me the main problem is the graphics, because they look outdated, and even worse, sound, totally unrealistic. I just spend 10 euros, so in my case it&apos;s totally worth it. From my point of view, WRC 6 is far better, and even better option is Dirt Rally (with less options though).</span>
