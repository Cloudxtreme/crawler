I mean it&apos;s that good. Frictional definitely has the formula for scaring people down as was made clear by Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but the narrative for that game was lost about 20 minutes in. SOMA, however, kept me intrigued from start to finish. In fact, the narrative is so powerful you could write a thesis on it (that&apos;s all I&apos;ll say here). There was never a moment I wanted to stop playing -- I always had to force myself. That said, if you go into the game thinking it won&apos;t be as scary as Amnesia, you&apos;ll be in for a bad time. I&apos;d say it&apos;s a bit more upsetting than Amnesia since it not only throws horrific fleshy monsters at you, but it also messes with your head with existential philosophies and surreal situations.

It might not have the scare factor of Amnesia: The Dark Descent or the Penumbra games, but of course one can&apos;t rate a horror game solely on its horror elements. The story that SOMA tells is well paced and very intriguing. The character dynamics are interesting as well. The subject material isn&apos;t anything new, but it&apos;s always nice to have games that are willing to deal with more complex themes. The philosophical elements don&apos;t quite reach the level of sophistication as I found in The Talos Principle (another puzzle game with philosophical undertones), but there is still plenty of food for thought.
<br>
<br>The gameplay mechanics are quite solid, and Frictional&apos;s unique control scheme does provide an enhanced sense of immersion. I also thought that the puzzles presented were intelligent and arose organically. It seems that some people found the monster encounters tedious or frustrating, however I did not feel this way. I&apos;d say the monster encounters are comparable to the Alien in Alien: Isolation, in that being hit is generally a one-hit kill and small mistakes often lead to your own demise. Like Alien: Isolation, the encounters in SOMA require thorough observation, patience and calculated movements, rather than rash decisions to sprint from harm&apos;s way.
<br>
<br>As one would expect from Frictional Games, the atmosphere and environment is masterfully crafted with fantastic sound design and art direction. From a technical standpoint though, there is definitely room for improvement. Low-res textures do pop up fairly often, and it can take a few seconds for textures to load properly upon loading a save. Screen tearing was also quite prevalent, and what vsync options there were seemed to be mostly ineffective. Not to say the game looks bad, but the visuals do sometimes look outdated. Some other minor complaints I have is that the protagonist&apos;s tone of voice seems very calm given his predicament, and some of the dialogue can feel somewhat contrived.

The world looks awesome, very believable and makes you feel you really are there, in that world. Story-telling and story are on point. Enemies are the exact amount of difficult, balanced with everything else. Just 5 star experience.</span>

<br>Gameplay
<br>
<br>The gameplay is the standard for a exploration game, but the horror in SOMA is done well, with only few enemies throughout each level, and instead of fighting/killing them, you must try to sneak around them. Also featured heavily is the false scares where you will think an enemy should be coming but it something else, and these moments add a lot of tension to the game, and is done well.
<br>
<br>Story
<br>
<br>The story in SOMA was exceptionally done, and focuses and big philosophical questions, which can be a hard thing to do. The questions posed were handled intelligently, and by the end of it, and also throughout, I was swirling with thoughts of humanity, and what it truly means to be human. For a game to get to me ponder like that is a feat that IMO earns recognition. The pacing is also well done to, with a good progression flow.
<br>
<br>Graphics/presentation
<br>
<br>The visuals are nice in SOMA, and the aesthetic designs of the environments give off an eerie feel, which sets the tone for the game. The only gripe I had was that the loading could be a bit of an annoyance, with slow downs occurring sometimes, but this didn&apos;t hinder my experience too much.
<br>
<br>Overall SOMA is a smart, scary, and Philosophically pondering game that tackles big questions, and does so with great intelligence. Even if you don&apos;t like horror games that much such as my self this game is worth a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5528757">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Frictional Games, creators of the Penumbra series as well as Amneia: Dark Descent, brings us the story of Simon Jerret, a brain damaged man from Toronto, Canada. What begins as a journey to hopefully heal and survive his traumatizing experience soon becomes a story of terror and survival under the unexplored oceans of Earth.
<br>
<br>The graphics of Soma aren&apos;t ground breaking but they do a good job of showcasing the different environments as you transition from different parts of Pathos II into the depths of the ocean and back again. Seeing the coral formations, sea wildlife, and the aged buildings in disrepair help to immerse the player and give a sense of dread as you slowly realize what is going on in the world. Pipes burst from the walls seeping black ooze onto the floors and machinery. The dim lighting casts eerie shadows onto the walls painting a picture of dread and fear as you walk through the hallways.
<br>
<br>The game does a good job of giving you enough light to see where you are going and what you need to find without having to resort to cheap pitch black areas where you will endlessly grope in hopes of finding your objective like most cheaply made games do. The enemy design is a well blended combination of science fiction meets Lovecraftian horror and befits the world of Pathos II and the unexplored depths of the ocean floor.
<br>
<br>The sound design seems very simple, with music only appearing after objectives are completed or something important to the narrative has happened. It&apos;s just you, the sound of your footsteps echoing through the halls, and the occasional blare of a computer or air vent attempting to sound relevant in a dead world. It is odd that sounds appear to be the same during the ocean traveling bits as they are inside the research facility, but doesn&apos;t detract from the game too much. The voice acting is hit or miss as the queues between characters sometimes feels flat or out of place. The voice of the main character is probably the best of the cast as he voices his frustrations and concerns within his environment.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is probably what separates this game from many of its competitors. There is no combat whatsoever. At first glance this game may seem similar to Alien:Isolation but the player will quickly learn that no weapons exist for Simon to use. The character can interact with objects found throughout the environment ala Penumbra or Amnesia but there is a lot of clutter that is at odds with the rest of the game. It could be seen that the developers wanted to showcase their physics engine as if this were new technology, but it could be the fault of the game&apos;s engine more than an actual design feature since Frictional Games are using the same engine. The segments between each enemy are composed of hiding in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to pass or using objects to distract them from your position. There is one interesting bit later in the game where your standard duck and hide or throw a bottle in the opposite direction does not work and is refreshing to see at later stages in the game.
<br>
<br>The scare factor will be hit or miss for some. There are a minimal number of jump scares and even these are used to full effect with the game building suspense between encounters or points in the story where it is necessary. Most of the horror will be built with the game&apos;s artistic and sound design and your own psyche using the environment to instill a sense of the unknown as to when your next encounter may be. Soma does not pay homage to traditional modes such as extreme violence and gore. You won&apos;t find blood spattered all over walls or bodies mutilated beyond belief. There is the occasional headless corpse or blood stains where it is obvious that someone was either hurt or killed in that area. The lack of jump scares may deter some people but if you are a fan of great atmosphere and suspense then Soma will surprise you.
<br>
<br>On a minor note, there is one aspect of this game that is a bit troublesome for some. The choices that you make throughout the game do not impact the narrative and are included more for you as the player to weigh the impact of your decisions, to which there is nothing wrong with, but it would have been fun to see if different choices impacted the story at all. It&apos;s a small thing that many have noticed but the overall experience of the game is worth the price.
<br>
<br>Soma was worth the long wait and Frictional Games has proven, again, that they are masterful story tellers and wonderful game designers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5544186">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m a huge fan of the Amnesia series, but like an honest fan, I can admit A Machine for Pigs was... pretty stupid... Had the enemies been something else besides pigs the game might have been perfect, but SOMA is a solid accomplishment for Fritctional Games. At first I hated the setting because it just seemed like a microwaved Bioshock clone, but this game is much more than that. In terms of presentation, it definitely sells the idea of being underwater immeasurably more than Bioshock. I demand a little more from my games than the average player in terms of story because I remember the good old days when Ken Levin was creating &quot;Thief&quot; and &quot;System Shock 2,&quot; and even though SOMA and those games are completely different animals, on the level of depth and effort put into them, they&apos;re equal. SOMA is a slow burn, something you have to let yourself enjoy until you find yourself thinking about it&apos;s eerie atmosphere when you&apos;re playing something totally unrelated. It has this seriously frightening &quot;Leviathan 1989&quot; feel to it, in the best possible way. There was something charming about that B movie, and SOMA just takes that and runs with it. There&apos;s no telling what kind of freak you&apos;re listening to when you hear its ghastly gurgling and grunting in the darkness. It could be anything. The monster designs are superb, especially for a $30 game. There is no doubt about that. The only drawback is the extremely slow pace and... Mr. Wan&apos;s impossibly complex simulation mission... which is soul sucking... but other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, definitely way more than I thought I would. My first impression was &quot;Meh,&quot; but now it&apos;s a favorite; that&apos;s a good game. Only titles like the aforementioned &quot;Thief the Dark Project,&quot; or &quot;System Shock 2,&quot; or the outrageously good &quot;Amnesia the Dark Descent&quot; can stay with you like that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5735767">Expand</a></span>

With such monolithic concepts as what it means to BE, period, what it is to be human, how consciousness works and what the mind is being the primary concepts dealt with by the game, SOMA stands out as a solid horror game with its true scares being the questions and doubts it leaves with the player.  And those are things the player will almost certainly carry with them for the rest of their life.
<br>
<br>SOMA helped me finish (for now) solidifying my understanding of those issues.  I actually did quite well, I&apos;d say, in figuring things out for myself beforehand.  No philosophy textbooks needed.  I would actually recommend SOMA as a very well-put-together presentation of those issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=6008034">Expand</a></span>

<br>But what we have in Soma is a really better version of the Amnesia The Dark Descent.This game has a great story(with a mind **** ending),Great Characters ,Great gameplay,Great graphic,Great atmosphere,Great Monsters and a good music.And The best thing nobody will fight or argue about this game being the best horror game or best frictional games work.It&apos;s a game that you can enjoy without hearing anybody pissing you off with saying this games is the best,or anybody saying this game is the worst.
<br>What I will start with is the Monsters cause I think this is the best thing about the game.(though I loved the story)This Game&apos;s Monsters were different.They thought about how the monsters should be.They can Teleport,They are blind but have a great sense of hearing.It&apos;s not like any regular game that have some things or people chasing you.It was good.
<br>The Story.At first it might look a little cliche but after you come to understand a little about the game you realize how great it is.and the ending was absolutely amazing.It was brilliant.
<br>Characters were great they were Lovable,Cool and Of course REAL.Not Much to say about them you have to see them to realize.There were 2 main character and one other guy who was kinda important.
<br>If I have to talk about graphic (which I don&apos;t like at all)I can say that it had a really great graphic (that&apos;s all I can say!!)
<br>however about the atmosphere.It had a great one.When you&apos;re in the ocean you can feel that you are way down.you can feel that It&apos;s cold,It&apos;s lonely and very heavy.while it&apos;s very calming it&apos;s also feels very unsafe(you can also see how beautiful the graphic is).in the stations you can feel that this place is dangerous.(you can also see how beautiful the graphic is)(AGAIN)And of course the horrible feeling when you see the robots and humans.and at the same time the pleasant feeling of seeing an Apocalypse without any ******* Zombie!!
<br>About The Music,It was a good music.It was a music made for the game.There were Mostly relaxing musics!(you know They weren&apos;t Horror  or anything you didn&apos;t get that feeling!!)
<br>And about the gameplay!Smooth.I didn&apos;t had a single problem with it.the puzzles were good.a little problem with the no inventory thing.(I mean the way Amnesia was)I loved the movement in the ocean.and the freedom in the ocean.you could easily go way to deep in the ocean.I mean if you keep going you will die but you know what I mean!!!!And Also it wasn&apos;t too deep.(you know like IGI!!!)
<br>If I have to compare it to Amnesia,It definitely wasn&apos;t at all as scary as Amnesia(Or any other scary game).however It was better in story and graphic and character and I also think it was better in music.(Amnesia was better with the gameplay-This was better with the rest!)
<br>so if you are in it ONLY because of the gameplay I don&apos;t recommend it however if you&apos;re in it for the rest totally recommend it and you should definitely play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5593952">Expand</a></span>

Although it is a terrifying horror game, it is the story that is so incredibly good.  The story, the atmosphere.  The thought provoking premise will be in the player&apos;s mind for years to come.  One of the best games since computer gaming began.  If you have ever thought about existence, you really should play this game.  It is more than a game.  It&apos;s an outstanding story that is perfectly realized in the computer gaming environment.

<br>don&apos;t read spoilers. u&apos;ll enjoy it more.

It&apos;s a first person adventure game with a sci-fi horror theme and both these themes are utilized to their full potential. The futuristic setting feels appropriately implemented and the various entities in the game feel unique. I absolutely love environmental story telling as a medium for delivering a plot and Soma has this area covered. The way in which you receive information feels natural and believable, never really taking you out of the experience. Writing is great with one or two lines feeling a bit forced but the voice acting was absolutely phenomenal. The main character tends to express his emotions and each delivery was filled with emotion that conveyed such realism.
<br>
<br>The minute to minute game play of walking around searching different areas did start to wear out its welcome after a couple hours but the intense I drive had to continue playing once I stepped away was something I have not experience in a long time. Puzzles felt relatively simple and while I hate to admit it, I did glance at a walk through for a couple sections but I think I could have done just fine without them.
<br>
<br>The two biggest problems with the game are the load times and glitches. The game only loads once on the initial start up and after that it is seamless but man that load time was ridiculous. Glitches mainly had to do with enemies that seemed to be stuck in place. I don&apos;t know if some enemies were supposed to stay in the same spot but when I noticed them doing that, it immediately broke immersion. Aside from that, I&apos;d say this game was definitely worth the $30 asking price for me. While the entertainment did not come from the game play design, the story was one of the most profound things I have ever experienced. The amazing thing is that this story works so well through the medium of a video game so your experience feels more significant after the end credits than it would if it was a movie or book. This game is a classic in my book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5516522">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story starts with you going for a brain scan. After an accident you&apos;ve got little time to live so you go for an experimental treatment where they&apos;re going to take a full scan of your brain. You sit in a chair and the vision goes black. When you wake up you&apos;re somewhere completely different - in a space station looking like environment. And here&apos;s where the real game starts - you go on discovering where you exactly are, how you got there and how will you be able to escape.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not a big fan of horror games but I must admit I enjoyed this quite a bit. Probably because of a nice balance between the horror scary parts and the exploration parts. And there is quite a lot of exploration and puzzle solving apart from running scared from the entity hunting the underwater research facility which you get to travel through.
<br>
<br>Graphics are really nicely done. It&apos;s dark, it&apos;s damp - it&apos;s very atmospheric. The world design is top notch as well. The facility does feel very alien like sci-fi. There&apos;s plenty to discover about the previous inhabitants leaving on the base. A nice touch - you&apos;re able to pick up any object even though it serves no purpose - but it&apos;s fine to do. Looking at numerous photographs also adds to the back story of the full game.
<br>
<br>A bit let off is that it does take place underwater and there are plenty of water levels (ugh!). And while the visuals are really nice I did got lost once or twice in them and did not enjoy them as much as the rest of the games. Though entering the really deep ocean places was impressive and scary.
<br>
<br>The game is driven by two mechanics - exploration puzzles and horror survival. The first part was definitely enjoyable - you go around the bases, switch a lever here, push a button there. The exploration feels interesting and the puzzles are not that complicated. The survival horror is similar to Amnesia - you have nothing and IT&apos;s coming. Not as scary as Amnesia but still too scary for my personal liking.
<br>
<br>The game asks interesting questions about identity, consciousness and what it means to be alive. And answers them almost perfectly as far as I&apos;m concerned. Especially with the epilogue. A really nice food for thought.
<br>
<br>Overall a great game with a great atmosphere. Highly recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=7200304">Expand</a></span>

<br>Oyunun hikayesini fazla spoiler vermeden anlatmam gerekirse Simon adl&#x131; bir karakteri oynuyorsunuz ve... gerisini s&#xF6;yleyemem. Oyunu oynayarak &#xF6;&#x11F;renmeniz gerek. Bu bilginin ilerisi a&#x15F;&#x131;r&#x131; b&#xFC;y&#xFC;k plot spoilerlar&#x131; oluyor ve kesinlikle buraya yazamam.

At first I thought we were in deep space, but when a huge hammerhead shark appear I was revived. The pace of the game is beautiful too, yet I feel the scares could be more intense and last for longer. It is not a game very much like Amnesia, that lives on deep psychological horror, but a voyage instead into the depths of the human mind, raising some incredible thoughts and questions of existence and morality and that for me won the entire gaming experience. The sounds, environments, dialogues, (did I refer sounds) and storytelling clearly survive on it&apos;s own. Fans of Amnesia will feel a bit disappointed after expecting it to be as intense as it, but truth being said I was one of those but the gain in psychological involvement and empiricism cut the chase to which won the ranking. It was amazing, truly, to be immersed in an sci-fi experience that did not lack on eerie and horror packed scenes but was also much more than just that. The no lag experience on my pc added to the experience - it flowed almost flawlessly and I am glad I played this on pc instead of in my PS. The cut scenes and dialogues add to the experience of the game and aid you in feeling a sense of belonging, something I somehow always lacked in Amnesia that felt cold all the time (which was obviously their goal). If you played Alien Isolation you will feel it is similar in so many ways to it, even though not as detailed, but what you lose in detail you gain in opportunity to roam around and endlessly explore, something I always love to do. Also sometimes I felt that I missed some door, locker or something due to running away from monsters, which added to the feeling of being able to replay the game and still be awed. Options and moral decisions also play a part in this and added to the psychological thrill. All in all SOMA is an amazing experience, not as scary as Amnesia but it is also so completely different they lack terms to be compared. It is yet one powerful piece of art and should be played with intense openness and respect. Absolutely amazing Frictional.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=6031575">Expand</a></span>

Long time has passed since I played such immersive, emotional  and thrilling game. As a horror game it isn&apos;t much scary as it is highly intensive game. Just brilliant, I&apos;m thankful for this masterpiece.</span>

Whole story is unique and the environment makes it even better. This psychological horror will make you think about meaning of life.

My only complaint is that the game is a bit too easy, they could have thrown in more/harder environmental puzzles.  Still, it gave me 12 solid hrs of fun over a 2 day period where I couldn&apos;t think about anything else. Riveting and immersive</span>

Yes, I am hungry.
<br>Unoriginality isn&#x2019;t something I generally critique in and of itself- but I couldn&#x2019;t help but feel a bit unsatisfied that Soma&#x2019;s story consisted, dare I say fairly largely, as a composite of &#x201C;key themes&#x201D; from many other stories, theories, or just widely popularized ideas spread throughout all kinds of media.  Simply put, there are a plethora of conditions that usually help filter my mental process of discerning whether or not a story is too clich&#xE9; and I expect they are not identical to, and also vary from person to person.  So I doubt it is the games fault that I found its plot to be, well, a tad unimaginative (seeing as my imagination has already considered simulation theory, Bernard Williams&#x2019; &#x201C;The Self and The Future,&#x201D; I Robot, the Matrix trilogy, works of Descartes, etc.)  For me, I thought that the (actually poor) questions of personal identity composed too much of the &#x201C;main story line&#x201D; whereas the more unique (as I see it) bits- like WAU&#x2019;s monsters, were left on the backburner when they deserved the limelight.  So, the entertainment value of this game was undermined, only partly, by my perception (however misconceived) of this&#x2026;
<br>Aesthetically, I found the atmospheric environment to be quite enjoyable, though also not so innovative, certainly engrossing.  The monster animations needed some work- I caught them a few times moonwalking around.  Sounds seemed solid, voice acting was at least decent, and dialogue was written in a way that seemed genuine or appropriate considering the fluctuating circumstances.  Graphics, in general, were fairly par- though there were certainly some frame drops here and there.  Gameplay had its thrilling moments (though less than what I desired), however, and this is my biggest critique of the game, the puzzles were MUCH TOO EASY.  They were indubitably laughable.  Perhaps the underwhelming horror aspect highlighted their over simplicity, but either way, awful.  Everything else seems nitpicky compared to this particular criticism.  Fairly good game by Frictional, nonetheless (especially if you find the story to be unique or interesting)..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5506530">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game philosophy apart, it ran perfectly on my rig. The graphics, the environment audio and the pacing are fantastic. The story is fascinating and told in an almost perfect way: not too much, not too little, leaving it open to interpretation and exploration. All in all the second best video game story ever told, in my opinion (first place goes to Bioshock Infinity). I don&apos;t give it a 10 just because of the lame-ish voice acting (especially for the main character), and because I think it misses some storytelling opportunity (which I won&apos;t mention to avoid spoilers).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5516186">Expand</a></span>

It never felt that it needs more. It has horror, philosophical questions, huge amount of things to read and listen to. Our main character talks a lot, but it surprisingly works well! The generic character of Simon Jarrett makes easier to empathise with.
<br>About the monsters, there are many different ones, but we don&apos;t encounter with them that much. But those encounters can be really stressful and nerve wrecking. And sometimes frustrating.
<br>
<br>The game is longer than Amnesia, especially if you really check out every little details, notes, logs that expands the story.
<br>
<br>In the first 30 minutes I was disappointed, but at the end, I was very satisfied and wanted even more! Great game in overall, worth to buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5525906">Expand</a></span>

<br>A Canadians worst Nightmare
<br>Soma is a survival horror game where you play as a Canadian in his late 20s
<br>what could possibly go wrong
<br>perhaps you could wake up 1000 years later and everyone around is gone.. or robots.. or both.. or neither and the fate of humanity is in your Canadian hands.
<br>Like Bioshock, SOMA takes place underwater and is terrifying and relaxing simultaneously.
<br>The game is so varied and well-paced that even getting scared half to death is actually fun.
<br>There&#x2019;s no telling what if anything lurks behind the corners as you make your way through sea and buildings throwing switches and solving the problems thrown at you.
<br>There are mechanical monsters of all variation in SOMA, these encounters keep you on the edge of your seat and are forgiving enough to not make the game ever feel frustrating.
<br>While these encounters are terrifying, you&#x2019;ll rarely die if caught, you&#x2019;ll only be much slower and have blurred vision, which leads to a very casual friendly experience.
<br>To shake the blurriness you can find these weird monster mouth things to stick your hand into&#x2026; or monster butts.. or something else.
<br>I&#x2019;m not sure what these are but they heal you.
<br>You&#x2019;re given no weapons in SOMA, if a monsters around, your only options are to turn off your flashlight and hide, try to sneak past them, or run as fast as you can while a fluid thirsty alien looking robot is chasing you down the halls, just try not to run into a dead end, or you&#x2019;ll meet your dead end.
<br>The majority of the gameplay though is trying to create a domino effect of unlocking doors to proceed to the next section of the game and soak in all of the information you can about this world you&#x2019;ve woken up in.
<br>What makes Soma so great though is that the story is always being pushed forward.
<br>Back tracking hardly exists, and when it does it&#x2019;s in a very confined space.
<br>Of course you&#x2019;ll have to run back down stairs to open a door you&#x2019;ve unlocked, but you never have to go back to areas you&#x2019;ve completed in the game.
<br>Which leads me to the sea, the sea sections to me were really the most relaxing sections,
<br>I found the deep blue to be beautiful.
<br>There are very few threats out here and it does a great job of making the entire game feel connected and whole.
<br>I&#x2019;ve never enjoyed being scared by anything until I played SOMA.
<br>If you&#x2019;re a fan of horror in anyway, you owe it to yourself to play this game.
<br>For what it is
<br>
<br>Survival Horror:
<br>9/10

It is more of an interactive experience than a game-game; a few light puzzles, some creeping around to avoid the monsters, lotsa atmosphere and &quot;questions&quot; that get answered by the end.... that kind of thing. The story is solid, if not really particularly interesting or original (or scary). Another take on today&apos;s insistent SF themes along the lines of Matrix and P.K. Dick&apos;s work. But it is done well, as is the atmosphere, the graphics, the sound, writing, voicework... As a matter of fact, everything is.. done well.
<br>
<br>If you like linear gameplay railroading you into a pre-determined sequence of experiences ranging from fear to wonder, if you&apos;re still not tired of the &quot;man vs machine&quot; and &quot;what is reality&quot; themes and are simply looking for a well made and solid 12 or so hours of gameplay value with zero replayability then don&apos;t look further than SOMA.
<br>
<br>Oh and underwater environments are done particularly well, though I must admit the whole sea and rust theme gets old at one point. Maybe the devs should have added some thematic breaks along the way, the story would definitely allow it. And the protagonist we&apos;re supposed to identify with is none to bright as well as lacking any character or personality, a mortal sin imo. I know the devs do it so the audience can identify more easily with 1st person perspective but this is seriously misguided. The very point of fiction is that it allows you to identify with someone radically different from yourself, and perspective has nothing to do with it. At a few points in the dialogue I swear I thought I&apos;m supposed to be playing Fry from Futurama, but without the charm.
<br>
<br>All in all, I&apos;m giving it an 8. A good tight directed experience but maybe just a tad too tight and directed for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5512389">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Where Soma stumbles ist the feeling that it drags itself out for a little too long, much like Alien Isolation Soma doesn&apos;t know when to stop. After the eight easteregg hunt, even the monsters start to get just annoying as they keep you away from what you actually wand to experience. The story and strange world of Soma.  However, at this point i was invested enough in the protagonists story and the one of his sidekick that i carried on.
<br>
<br>In the end, Soma is worth it for it&apos;s atmosphere alone but prepare for some drawn-out easter egg hunts inbetween.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5506315">Expand</a></span>

<br>Not because it covers new ground, or because its particularly insightful (it&apos;s not at all): but more because the story is so layered and there are so many subplots and explored concepts rolled up into one narrative.
<br>It really lets the player speculate on small plot threads and think about the events that transpired. Hell, even if the plot was lame, this game would still get points for having an awesome portrayal of the deep ocean complete with the haunting elements of said environment.
<br>
<br>So this one is kind of weird for me... it is a downgrade from Amnesia for having stripped mechanics, toned down horror, and a less original story. But its just so goddamn engrossing! Not many games have me thinking and browsing forums days after I finish. I&apos;d highly recommend it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5510386">Expand</a></span>

<br>I even consider this to have a better story than Bioshock 1 and 2, and I find it on par with Bioshock Infinite, as well as Portal 2.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been more satisfied with a game&apos;s story as I have with Soma.  I haven&apos;t really said anything about the story, and it&apos;s because I think going in to this game with no pre-conception of what the story is will make it all the more entertaining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5534399">Expand</a></span>

I love sci-fi and I love the whole concept of this game that is extremely interesting for me. It was beautiful and frightening at the same time. Mysterious. A big move forward. Love the game and developers. Thank you.</span>

<br>
<br>SOMA is a excellent game with a really a masterpiece from FG. I will go over what i found really good and what i find less good.
<br>
<br>To start out with the obvious: Graphics and Engine:
<br>
<br>SOMA is using the their all-new engine HPL 3 which add all new features (which i havent seen nor tried to figure out, too into the game to do anything with the editor atm). If you guys have ever tried Amnesia(If not, i can recommend it :)you know that a lot of the rooms were really generic and, tbh, not very detailed, with some exceptions. In SOMA you find different rooms, super detailed, great lightning and just sharp textures. While this is not like the new AAA games out there, it is defiently a good addition to the game. Every room is filled with cables, Structure gel stuff, advanced robotics and i could continue. Every room is unique, which is nice.
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>While I&apos;m really bad at giving summaries and writing a story short and understandable, I&apos;ll just make it as good as I can. You are playing as the protagonist Simon, or should I say, the Protagonists(plural)Simon. The game starts with you in a dream, dreaming about the day you was in a car crash, and a friend of yours die, and you end up with brain damage. You then agree to do a Brain scan. Suddenly you are in the future, scared and confused at the events that has just occured to you. You end up finding that the scan you did, was later put into another body, and weird **** happens(as well as scary) Don&apos;t wont to spoil to much, so ill stop here. Excellent overall, and I&apos;ll come close to this as well.
<br>
<br>New features:
<br>
<br>There is a lot of new features in SOMA: Voice Acting, Choices and all new interactions. The best of all is the voice acting. It is in the top, really, just amazing. Not that we didn&apos;t have this in Amnesia, but you remember that it was only briefly when you were looking back in time, memories, that the voice acting was there. Here you are talking, in the present, with other beings. This really adds to the atmosphere, and you even have the choice to keep talking to learn more of the events thats happening. The choices is a close runner-up to the Voice Acting. The decisions are really REALLY hard. I can say one: Before you is a man called Carl, which is plugged to power source neaby. To get to the next area, you can either risk your own life, by turning off some power, which will let the monster in, or turn the switch in Carls room to bypass the monster, but (pretty sure it probably)kill Carl. Obvious is to go to the power room, but to get to the power room, you have to know that there IS a power room. A friend of mine missed the Power room, though that killing Carl was the only way.. Seriously, kill a Dude instead of trying to find another way? Well, you get the point i hope.
<br>
<br>Now to what i find less good:
<br>
<br>In Amnesia the monsters were really scary, but easy to trick. I tried to stay alive by hiding behind a picture.. Really monster? In SOMA some only react if you move or look at them. Even when the atmosphere is so scary, it really kills it that you can flash and look at the monster, without it really doing anything. People will probably miss the fact that this is a thing (Ermm.. ChristopherOdd E.g.) But this is not that much that I don&apos;t think it is scary. The game is worth a big pile of structure gel for FG&apos;s.
<br>
<br>All in all, this game is just amazing, and if you haven&apos;t bought it by now.. Who knows, maybe the other you did? Let&apos;s hope so.

A lot of the themes are based on the classic Japanese anime &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (brilliant film by the way) and of course The Matrix, Bioshock etc etc and I also found it had a Doom 3 atmosphere about it.  But the story and atmosphere doesn&apos;t really let the game down too much, it throws you in the deep end and you want to continue playing to piece things together in a pretty decent immersive world.
<br>
<br>My biggest problem with the game, and why I&apos;ve decided to knock it back to a rating of a 7 is because the puzzles are far too easy, predictable and the game can be finished in two sittings.  There is not really enough content other than puzzle solving to justify full-price atm.  I guess there are people who will disagree, and find enjoyment opening every single empty cabinet or reading the back of every medication bottle - but I found there was a lack of reward and satisfaction in exploring every detail, especially when the story isn&apos;t a new concept and is a tad clich&#xE9;d.
<br>
<br>To look at this game in a more positive light I would describe the experience as a 10 hour movie.  Immersive, a bit of suspense, progression that leads to development in story and characters etc.  You play through it once, just to experience it and say you&apos;ve done it, and then you move on with life.
<br>
<br>This game is definitely worth a try for the experience, but it&apos;s not enough of a masterpiece to rush out and buy straight away.
<br>
<br>Wait until this one is on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5507116">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I think, therefore I am. Right?
<br>
<br>Even after the ~15 hours it took me to see the credits rolling down my monitor, these are just some of the questions that still boggles my mind. It&apos;s games like this that may make your head spin, and to question your very own existence.
<br>
<br>Even with the above being said, remember that this is a horror game and it may make you s**t your pants.
<br>
<br>Oh well. On to the game itself.
<br>
<br>Aside from being scary, the game offers an extremely deep atmosphere and story. Combine this with existential questions, horrifying gameplay and breathtaking artistic design, graphics and sound, and you should at least have an idea what this game has to offer.
<br>
<br>Without spoiling the story or any plot points, I will just say that if you&apos;re a fan of sci-fi, you will greatly enjoy the story and the setting this gorgeous, yet haunting looking world has to offer. It will also force you to make some very morally difficult choices, unless you&apos;re a cold-hearted human being that is. This is one of those games that sucks you into it&apos;s world, making you not wanting to exit the game until you&apos;ve reached the credits.
<br>
<br>If you ever played Amnesia, the last masterpiece released by the same company, you should feel right at home with the controls and physics offered by this game. Pulling out desk drawers, opening doors, it&apos;s all controlled the same way (holding the mouse button down and moving the mouse) and feels just as good.
<br>
<br>While there is no inventory screen you can still carry some items around with you that are used automatically in their proper places. There is also no HUD for health, but the game gives you very good visual feedback about how close you are to dying. When really low on health you can no longer sprint and instead are limping around and the screen gets much blurrier etc.
<br>
<br>The game ran fine on my GTX970 and I managed to almost always maintain 60fps on the highest settings at 1920x1080 resolution (except when the game clearly loaded the world and it dropped). I found some minor bugs, like places where you could exit the level&apos;s boundaries although they required me  to really going out of my way to jump around looking for them (as I have a tendency to do :P ), otherwise no game breaking bugs to report.
<br>
<br>So, without dragging this out too long, here are my conclusions.
<br>
<br>Would I recommend this game?
<br>
<br>If you like great stories and atmosphere where you can really take your time to absorb and interact with the world around you, then yes, without a doubt.
<br>
<br>If you enjoyed Amnesia, then yes, this is for you as well.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re too afraid of scary games, but still want to experience the story? I&apos;d say stay the **** away!
<br>
<br>Is it worth the 27,99&#x20AC;&#x20AC; steam asks for it?
<br>
<br>After completion, for me, personally, that&apos;s a &quot;Yes, definitely&quot;.
<br>
<br>ps. &quot;robots&quot; can be freaking terrifying. Sleep tight...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5508386">Expand</a></span>

<br>I like the story paving, well layered, integrated/centralized and interesting/weird but easy to understand. At proper times, you get to know bit more that contributes to the main theme. Nowadays, devs like Chinese Room like to use fractionalized story telling which is really confusing and sometimes makes no sense, instead, SOMA&apos;s story telling is like a constant reward during progression to let you step by step know more useful about what is actually happening (You get meaning why you play the game over time!).
<br>
<br>No f**king jump scare. SOMA immerses you only with atmosphere and implied visional/sound effect which are not utterly scary, but keep in at a certain stress level which is just enough for me. (Only the shattered screen is extremely horrible, horrible but still it doesn&apos;t damage neuron like f**king jump scare as you can prepare to choose not to look at it).
<br>
<br>Hum, I would say it is a walk-simulator, but SOMA is just that good to experience, because its story is really worth it.
<br>
<br>Some problems:
<br>I&apos;ve crashed 3times, please fix the issue ASAP.
<br>I have to quit to main menu after manual save?
<br>Some of the textures are out-of-date.
<br>
<br>Overall, SOMA is a carefully crafted interactive sci-fic thriller with nice story, paving and just on spot stress to squeeze your adrenaline in a health way while making you think a bit deeper how our world actually works.
<br>
<br>Plus, some of the most interesting things are the Kill/Not Kill choices you made (They are subtle. You will know when you play). Unknow how they have effect on the end. Let us see. I feel the choices are to test your morality, but either way has reasonable excuse to choose. A real dilemma.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5515820">Expand</a></span>

I did not really like their previous games at all. It was not as scary I expected it to be but definitely had its moments, Which was definitely an upside to me as I dont usually like any kind of horror games. This is a great game, It has some rough sides here and there but it makes up for it with the incredible well made atmosphere where you want to explore every corner of the map while finding more clues about the story. All in which the sound design excels aswell where actors did a great job at making it sound very believeable.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve been so immersed in a game before, I did not expect to be so damn emotional about it!
<br>
<br>I can heartly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for great philosophical horror sci-fi story. While retaining some of the puzzle elements of the previous games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5510404">Expand</a></span>

Not brilliant but well told, that poses questions as to what it means to be human, and the consequences of choices we make to ensure the survival of humanity.
<br>Nothing really comes as a surprise in the story, but the ending in particular is thought provoking.
<br>As a game however I am not so thrilled. What was so great about Amnesia: The dark descent: Atmosphere/Chilling dread of supernatural shadowy forces/unfolding of a story do not quite gel in SOMA.
<br>Right from the get go there is a sense of being disoriented and wandering trying to find either a purpose or a way forward. Initially I loved this feeling of being in a new alien environment, but soon realised that this aspect never sharpened or focused enough to stop becoming annoying.  Similarly, to progress means solving puzzles, which on the whole meant accessing computer terminals and reading through reams of texts . I for one am getting tired with the idea of me controlling a PC to control a virtual PC so  I can read how the story and characters develop.
<br>Graphics in the game are OK. Some of the environments are well developed, but as a player you are desperately searching for something to interact with, and those parts you can&apos;t as a consequence seem flat.
<br>The &quot;Monsters&quot; are unfrightening, and the hide and run sequences which were so thrilling and terrifying in Amnesia are just niggles and unthreatening apart from the frustration of the feeling you are moving through treacle.
<br>All credit however for an original game that all in all is well worth a playthrough</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5538228">Expand</a></span>

Of course some graphic parts and other issues, are really out of these days and that is why the magic in it, is then really bigger, because the terror + atmosphere + great original settings with sound design, can still make a big part of why this video game, is still one of the best &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; video games ever! So the onl,y most bad things in this game, are just it&apos;s enemies, what are sometimes really annoying, but gruesome/scary at the same time! What could also be better, are underwater segments, where you basically cannot do anything, apart of going to your next location.

SOMA is a refreshing take on what it means to be human and the psyche as a means to horror over cheap jump scares. This is a phenomenal bit of story telling and atmosphere people, take note AAA developers, Frictional does it right! So worth the $30, I would have gladly paid more. Amazing story telling and production values. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5504222">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story and pacing of this game are fantastic. Apart from a few sections where I felt my progress was being held back by the devs trying too hard to make me feel uncomfortable or push a bit of backstory, the whole thing flows like a long movie.
<br>
<br>The scares become annoyances pretty quickly, but having said that I never really lost the feeling of immersion and every new chapter had me willing to give the game another chance.
<br>
<br>Pick up this game, play it just for the story. It&apos;s a unique and great concept and you won&apos;t regret playing it through til the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5507464">Expand</a></span>

But as soon as I started playing this game myself I figured out I was understimating it.
<br>Soma is not a great game, it is simply amazing.
<br>
<br>The setting is so well done. It is a complete sci-fi adventure and I really enjoyed the enviroments of all the stations. When you travel through Pathos-II you actually get that sci-fi feeling. Everything is prepared to give you a full immersion in the near future.
<br>Let&apos;s talk about some horror. SOMA is scary, it is not its strenght though. I&apos;ll find some parts of the game where you will be actually freaked out but it won&apos;t affect all the playthrough. Also, when you actually understand how monsters work you can manage to avoid them if you play smart enough.
<br>Anyway the whole atmosphere is definetly horror. You always have the feeling that something went terribly wrong down there, and I really enjoyed that.
<br>
<br>But let&apos;s talk about the strength of this title: the narrative and plot. Soma has a definitely strong plot which is really full of mysteries. The whole story is narrated very well. You get to know it piece by piece, between a danger and the other. The game won&apos;t ever simply throw everything up to your face, but it will say always little pieces of the main story so you&apos;ll keep playing even just to find out more about what&apos;s going on.
<br>But SOMA has even more to offer. This game makes you really think about some topics. It starts playing and messing around with our concept of existence, of life and of counsciousness. It really makes you reflect about who we are.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, you should really buy this game. It is not one of those game you play, finish and then completely forget about. I&apos;m sure you will remember SOMA, or at least, the questions you made to yourself while playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5536043">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s an awesome game with a very mature, thought-provoking story that you&apos;ll wanna see through to the end. I won&apos;t spoil anything but you are in for a treat... Enjoy! 10/10</span>

<br>Of Course is not like Amnesia. It doesn&apos;t have to be like TDD.
<br>If you dont like this game maybe is not for you pleasant to READ.
<br>Maybe you dont read a book like NEVER.
<br>I dont find any better literatura in any other game.
<br>And if you still believe this is not a great game maybe you can CREATE a better one.
<br>Please do it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5510301">Expand</a></span>

Rather than juggle multiple gameplay mechanics, SOMA instead leads players along a linear path sneaking around monsters and performing menial tasks all while learning more about the world and its characters.
<br>
<br>The only gameplay to be found in SOMA outside of interacting with various computer terminals and objects is avoiding detection by monsters.  Monsters patrol on set paths and if you make noise they will come to investigate.  Monsters do not hound the player as aggressively as they did in Amnesia.  This is because you cannot hide in furniture and other objects as you could in Amnesia.  To compensate for this, monsters will only investigate part of a room or simply stand in the door way if you alert them.  The unfortunate result is a loss of suspense and urgency.  It also means you do not get the sense that you are being actively hunted as you did in Amnesia.  Multiple times during my play through, monsters would block the only way through a section and I was forced to get attacked or intentionally alert a monster to my presence just to progress.  When detected by a monster, you get knocked down and black out.  When you wake up, the monster is gone but nearby and you suffer reduced mobility.  If you get attacked again, you die.  The simplistic stealth and primitive monster AI made these portions of the game very tedious after a short time.  Early portions of the game I could simply sprint through, get knocked down once, and keep sprinting until safe or until enemies gave up pursuit.
<br>
<br>Unlike Amnesia: The Dark Descent, there is no inventory system and no need to manage supplies of any kind.  While this makes sense given the context of the story, it removes a level of suspense and desperation, things sorely lacking in a game that bills itself as a horror title.  Instead, items you carry simply materialize in your hand when you near an object they can interact with.
<br>
<br>The story and characters are the strongest aspect of the game.  While predictable, I had a genuine desire to learn more about the events and characters of the station.  The voice acting is top notch except for the player character.  Much like Jason Brody in Far Cry 3, Simon sounds and behaves like a complete douche - especially in the final scene of the game.  Listening to him give voice to the transhumanist themes of the story is like listening to an edgy philosophy student who read Descartes for the first time.
<br>
<br>For much of the game, you travel with another character.  Your character will often question or idly banter this NPC when exploring a room or solving a puzzle.  While a nice way to present the narrative or offer clues, it results in uneven pacing of calm and tense moments and because those tense moments become so tedious, I often found myself eager to rush past them rather than take my time evading so I could get the game over with more quickly.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re ok paying $30 for a story driven walking game, SOMA is for you.  If you were looking for a deeper horror experience with more challenging puzzles and more layers to the gameplay, you&apos;ll have to keep looking.  Wait for a discount.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5512408">Expand</a></span>

This game has just enough scary stuff for people like me who wants more of an adventure than of a horror (Amnesia was too scary for me). Great visual style, great performance and optimization, 0 issues. I still cant force myself to finish MGS 5.</span>

There&apos;s a distinct lack of even theoretical explanation for anything either. Certain mechanics and plot devices are just thrown at the player and neither the player nor the NPCs bother to question them. Sure, hand holding would be bad it is still never clear what rules SOMA&apos;s world lives by. SOMA raises a lot of questions but does not bother answering them or at least showing any kind of author&apos;s viewpoint.
<br>
<br>Another big disappointment comes from the fact that gameplay directly counteracts the story. Attempting to listen to audio logs gets you killed by enemies with 200/20 hearing, for example. At the same time the enemies are hardly interactive and, being also invincible, become more of an immovable object than something you can outsmart. Most of the time the best course of action is to sit until you can no longer hear the enemy and then make a break for the next door hoping it actually allows you to progress, since it&apos;s impossible to have a plan.
<br>
<br>The pacing is also heavily damaged by lack of clear objectives or feedback. While it is realistic in the setting of the game, more often than not it feels like the game simply wants the player to guess what he&apos;s supposed to achieve at any given moment.
<br>
<br>All in all I find it really hard to compliment SOMA on anything in particular. The graphics and sound are okay, it does not crash to desktop... ...anymore, there are no loading screens. Itsa ok, no more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5527796">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played all of Frictional&apos;s previous games before (the Penumbra &amp; Amnesia series) so had a rough idea of what to expect but this is definitely the best so far. It feels like a cross between Penumbra, Bioshock, and System Shock 2 and it works out pretty well. Frictional are probably one of the few devs who know how to make a decent horror game (ie, provide a persistent underlying unnerving atmosphere without over-saturating cheesy &quot;jump scares&quot; and &quot;piano punch&quot; sounds every 20 meters). SOMA isn&apos;t a shooter. It&apos;s a cross between a horror and a first person adventure game, but a much deeper psychological one about slipping away from your own identity rather than a shallow &quot;BOO! HAHAHA MADE YOU JUMP IN A DARK ROOM!&quot; &apos;horror&apos; game which are prevalent these days.
<br>
<br>Graphics are pretty good overall - average to good textures but superb highly atmospheric lighting, shadow &amp; underwater effects that fit the setting &amp; mood perfectly. The environment (like the Penumbra games) is highly interactable and you can pick up and move almost every object. They really have done a great job evolving the HPL engine. Voice acting &amp; ambient sounds are well done. Ambient music is just right - present and intermittent but neither in-your-face or subdued. Level designs are good. Puzzles in the game are easy but also logical. There&apos;s no point demanding super hard puzzles if they end up artificially convoluted and out of place.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a lot of attention to detail paid over minor things too. Eg, the head-bob effect feels just right and not stupidly over-done &quot;waddling giraffe in a surgical collar simulator&quot; as even big budget AAA developers consistently manage to mess up. The game is checkpoint save based but also permits an option for enabling F9 Quicksave / F10 Quickload via an ini file tweak. The mouse &amp; keyb input feel fairly solid, keys are fully rebindable, mouse has sensitivity &amp; smoothing options, etc. Lots of little things like that add up to a sense of polish and design maturity that SOMA actually feels like a PC game well ported to a console, not a console game badly ported to a PC.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s a great example of what a creative and interesting horror game should be like once you move beyond the typical cut-and-paste &quot;formula&quot; of jump-scares, piano thumps, screams in overly dark asylums, flickering lights, etc. There are one or two minor annoyances which preclude a perfect 10, eg, I found the Depth of Field effect even on &quot;Low&quot; is excessive in places and it would be nice to have the option to disable it completely or at least add a &quot;Very Low&quot; option that halves the blur effect again. This game is still a solid 9 though. It has come together so well, is a very fresh feeling gem in a genre of samey-ness, the horror / adventure hybrid feel works perfectly in just the right balance and the above attention to detail paid over minor things, that it&apos;s well worth a play. I sincerely hope Frictional Games continue to develop more of these in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5547115">Expand</a></span>

It could be a good thriller if you just remove &quot;enemies&quot;. Penumbra-like fear of character&apos;s weakness (enemies are like invincible and don&apos;t even try to say that Amnesia was the first game with it) is outdated - game developers are feeding pubic with that for YEARS now and it was newer interesting. It&apos;s just the worst about this game. So overall we got:
<br>
<br>Bad graphics (particle effects were good sometimes yet overall they are crappy and please don&apos;t say that it&apos;s &quot;all about style&quot; and not about quality of 3d artist work; it&apos;s not a five-dollar-indie-game)
<br>
<br>Boring gameplay - puzzles are not very intuitive and overall are too easy, hiding from enemies are boring and ruining the thrill (they are not scary they just extend your playtime don&apos;t you see it?)
<br>
<br>Good and atmospheric level design but we already seen it in Alien Isolation not very long ago and all underwater levels exist only to extend playtime and irritate player.
<br>
<br>Mediocre narrative - not saying that it&apos;s bad; it&apos;s pretty good in a couple of ways yet there are games that are far better at that aspect.
<br>
<br>Mediocre plot - they really could just add a couple of less used twist and concepts; only teenagers haven&apos;t already seen all that a couple of times.
<br>
<br>Sounds were not bad, or it&apos;s just me being a little deaf.
<br>
<br>I tried really hard at wording and I&apos;m really sorry for it still being bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5505297">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So i review the title based on someone that is suspicious of this genre - and mainly looks at the technical and design side.
<br>
<br>The game looks good - not impressive ... but functionally good. The environments feel a little sterile - as in &quot;not lived in&quot; - opposed to lifeless due to an absence of NPCs. So damage and dirt feels carefully staged - and not as a consequence of actions.
<br>
<br>Sound design is &quot;ok&quot; - but more or less standard (it may of course be much better than i have experienced it - since i only plugged in a common stereo speaker system, no headphones, no 7.1 or so)
<br>
<br>In terms of optimization - it runs about as good as expected - but i have seen more detailed games run better - as well as more open games. The game is pretty linear with fairly small areas - or at least that is what it feels like - so i would have expected more attention to detail.
<br>
<br>All in all ... I found the experience not immersive enough. The scares were a bit too cheap - with the VHS like screen tearing, the low bass thumping sounds. It is like a horror movie that plays it a little too safe - and becomes a little boring. The only salvation for such a game would have been a superior story and storytelling - where SOMA kind of does not deliver satisfactory.
<br>
<br>The result is average.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5550260">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Another thing, I didn&apos;t find this game scary at all, I wouldn&apos;t call it horror game. It&apos;s adventure game in very weird and bizarre setting. If you look for tension and scary atmosphere - you might be disappointed.
<br>
<br>On the side note, game is not well optimized. I had too play around until I got rid off screen tearing, stuttering, with fps drops.. It also crashed like 3times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5513682">Expand</a></span>

The environments are very immersive and the sound design is well done except for a few vocal recordings that are muffled and hard to understand. The game&apos;s atmosphere reminds me a bit of Riddick - Escape from Butcher Bay. The pacing is good with a mix of intense moments balanced out by some more relaxing ones. Most of the game is just good story telling, no combat, some stealth, and a few puzzles that are not too hard but just enough to be rewarding. We haven&apos;t had many good single player experiences like this lately so this is a welcomed addition.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=5564478">Expand</a></span>

The best thing about Amnesia was the fact that light was your best source of protection which was very difficult to keep going. Not to mention the fact they hit you with the freaky stuff at the onset and it kept building the white knuckle tension. It had really creepy monsters as well. This go around I guess we have robots. Subtlety today is overused and it just leads to being plain boring if one has played enough of these games. I will continue to play SOMA, hopefully I am wrong, however I doubt this to be the case.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soma/user-reviews?user_review_id=6253425">Expand</a></span>

You need a very special suit to protect you from the pressure, but it&apos;s perfectly fine if one of your very armored gloves is torn off. Space gun built underwater (very, very stupid idea). etc.
<br>Still not a bad game in general.</span>
