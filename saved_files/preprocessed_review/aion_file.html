I play WoW and WoW grinding is lot harder than this one. I dont care if you want to play WoW for rest of your life. Me, I&apos;m just looking for NEW fantastic experience, and that is AION.</span>

There are ridiculous queue times to get into servers, hovever which is why I didn&apos;t give this a 10. For a Korean produced game, it certainly doesn&apos;t feel that way and even feels more &quot;western&quot; than many American MMOs.</span>

Just don&apos;t expect it to revolutionalize your experience of MMOs. There have been some problems with queues, but here is a hint on how to avoid a queue: GO TO A WEST COAST SERVER. Problem solved. From the head start to now, I have not waited in a queue for 1 second. And I&apos;m not sure if queues are affected by the race you play, but I would play Elyos if I were you. There are less people playing Elyos meaning it won&apos;t be as crowded. Those saying it&apos;s a grindfest are simply out of their minds. This game is no more of a grindfest than World of Warcraft or ANY mmo ever made. You can level purely by quests, meaning its not a grindfest. People are letting the graphics style and their knowledge that it is a Korean game bias their judgment. Make sure you level past 10 (which doesn&apos;t take long) to pass judgment on this game. Once you ascend at lvl 10 is when the game begins. I have played just about every major MMO release. This has been my favorite by far. Great story-telling, awesome graphics, great gameplay, great atmosphere, the promise of massive aerial PvP battles. What&apos;s not to like? Don&apos;t believe the naysayers, try it yourself (remember Elyos on a west coast server).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=85134">Expand</a></span>

I love this game. The Bad? QUEUE! They really underestimated the number of the players, they really failed with the number of the servers!</span>

Problems with spam is mostly gone with recent patches and there is not a que ever anymore since two and a half weeks after the game came out. So those who rated this game when you haven&apos;t even experienced half of it is quite unfair to the game and to the readers of these reviews. And to those who have played past 25 and still dislike the game, just remember its a fairly new game, even vanilla WoW wasn&apos;t much different in its tank and spank aspect. So give the game time before you write it off as a tank and spank only game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=738431">Expand</a></span>

I bought it a few days ago and I must say that it is very decent game with potential. Im going to compare this with WoW only because WoW is so popular that for example if I say that Aion&apos;s user interface is very WoW-like (which it is), most people understand what I mean. The first things that made me buy this game was its graphics (hot elf like people? +1 happy customer ^^) and soundtrack, which is very good compared to old WoW tunes which I am already used to. Battle music also gives a real spice (however, if you dont like it you can turn it off from the options). Next is the gameplay. I can say that Aion&apos;s gameplay is very much like WoW&apos;s. If you are a WoW veteran you&apos;re propably going to experience quite a few deja vu moments. Most of people say that all other MMORPGs copy WoW. That in no way is true, because WoW never was the first of MMOs in any way. WoW has just been able to adapt all these systems &quot;the best&quot;. The things that differ in Aion and WoW, are their endgame content. WoW has a lot of PvE dungeons, raids, world bosses ect. while Aion is geared more towards PvP oriented players. On level 25 players are able to enter Abyss and engage other faction&apos;s players in battle (Alliance vs. Horde deja vu). The point of this is get Abyss points which are used to purchase good gear like in WoW. Also your objectives there are not only ganking people with zerg groups, but also capturing vital points (artifacts, fortresses) which grant bonuses to your whole faction different bonuses. (lowered prices at NPC vendors, buffs ect.). There are also these rifts opening around the world, where you can gather groups and assault another faction&apos;s lands through them. I must say that Aion&apos;s PvP is much more well executed than WoW&apos;s, but it really lacks in PvE endgame content. True that the Abyss is &quot;PvPvE&quot; area where there is this third NPC faction &quot;Baulaur&quot; who try to take control from both factions, but it still is an excuse of serious raiding content. Like I first said, Aion is more of PvP game while WoW is PvE. Joining a legion (guild) is a must for players to rip most fun out of Aion. In WoW it isn&apos;t necessary to join a guild to experience some memorable instance boss fights (remember also heoic dungeons). Most people talk of grind, but I havent seen any more grind than in WoW. But I have yet to enter the levels where people talk about that most grinding takes place (Im level 20 templar), so I&apos;ve yet to have right to say about that. What is bad in Aion? The crafting system. While I did not like WoWs crafting system (especially tailoring/leatherworking/smithing. most of the time you get gear you don&apos;t need and you also get the best gear from raids and dungeons and you end up using a lot of money for nothing), Aion&apos;s is very much a grindfest. You get these &quot;work orders&quot; which are repeatable quests. You are given some materials and you have to craft the wanted goods (these are not usable by player). The cost of buying the real materials increases as you level your skill. The bad thing in Aion is that it just takes a very, very LONG time to level your skill. The real grindfest is here, not in leveling your character. Customizing your character&apos;s every body part and face is a nice extra. There are only two races (Elyos, Asmodians), but at least there is about zero possibility of you running into player that looks just like you :). Also, people might or might not like the game&apos;s asian styled characters (anime/manga anyone?). I however took this with a warm hug :). Oh, and flying (outside Abyss) is overrated. So in the end: Pros: -stunning graphics -decent gameplay (leveling) -PvP is suberb (in case you join a legion, alone it is a bit stale) -great soundtrack -excelent character customization Cons: -lack of good PvE endgame content -crafting sucks -delivers ony a little new for the genre -some people might not like asian stylished characters While nothing groundbreaking and not a WoW-killer, Aion is a very refined and polished MMO, which at least gave me good vibes. Forgive me if a forgot to address anything important.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=738220">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t like the crafting system. You have to spent countless of hours to gather the needed materials and when you get to the crafting, you hardly ever get skill ups, and you have a chance of failing the crafting losing materials in the process. Leveling is very slow, it almost feels like work, since the quests aren&apos;t that complex (run 10 min, kill XX mobs, run 10 min), and you don&apos;t get much exp doing so. So my conclusion: simplify crafting, make quests more rewarding, lower the exp needed to level. And i really see point on having &quot;flight time counter&quot; it&apos;s just annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=85180">Expand</a></span>

After 3 years the game becomes F2P and I decided to give a look and I must admit that I left an impression on me, both good and bad. The game lets you choose 2 factions and once you make that choice you can&apos;t undone it unless you play in another server, which can be bothersome. There are 4 classes (warrior, scout, mage and priest), and each one can split into 2 sub classes which resembles a specific talent (Templars are tanks, Clerics are Healers, Gladiators are damage-dealer warriors, and so on). Once you make this choice and after passing a very wide and detailed customization screen (so those who like to make abominations, you&apos;re welcome here). Finally you start the game, and from here it&apos;s basically the same as many other mmorpg: you do quest, sell trash, gain level (60 with the new patch) and hopefully more gear; there&apos;s basically everything from any other mmorpg, including instances, pvp, professions, pets. ingame customization (we&apos;ll get to that later), and surprisingly even houses for those who like to chat in private rooms and etc: these are actually nice things and I really got impressed by the amount of things you can do at the beginning. The game is very similar to others in fighting style, but it adds a small mechanic based on chains, where basically whenever you use a skill others may or not activate, making more consecutives attacks and so on: not a bad idea and can easily &quot;thin&quot; the skillbar from the huge amount of skills by putting only a few of them (since some chains are also activated by clicking the icon near the character). As far as I can go, there is a lot of good in this game, and I really enjoy playing it...but  this is a F2P game in europe (not sure in america), and eventually this detail comes up with negative points that I could not avoid. I want to tell though that I understand this is a F2P so I DO know it&apos;s normal to pay for stuff in game, so I won&apos;t complain that in general, but the problem is that when you start the game as a &quot;Starter&quot; (the f2p version), you are so....SO limited! And I mean a LOT. First off, you have only 2 slots available (in ALL the game) and that&apos;s cruel considering there are 8 classes; you&apos;re limited in how many pieces of items you can gather (like iron, herbs, etc) by 150, which it seems a lot but later it can be easily reached considering that professions require a huge amount of materials grinding; you cannot trade with other characters, which means you&apos;re on your own all the time; you cannot whisper anybody in the game (but you can be whispered); you cannot use the generale channel, which means you cannot ask for help nor ask for informations about anything. And most brutal of all, you cannot use the auction house, meaning that your attempts to get some gold by selling some stuff will be totally useless, since the only item you can buy (I think), it&apos;s the gold pack...which is the whole point of the f2p version, since the shop itself hasn&apos;t a very huge variety of goods except for the customization tickets (not costy, and this is coming from an old WoW player), some motion feature (which is NOT permanent....) and other items like extra wings, pets, etc (all the basics). Honestly, the game is basically all around the gold pack, because it&apos;s like a subscription: it removes the limitation I just mentioned and basically gives bonuses to the player, making this game into a pay-to-win instead of a free-to-play; even though it&apos;s not costy (it&apos;s cheaper than asubscription) and can be bought in game (but it&apos;s so costy that you won&apos;t be able to afford it), the point of a f2p is buy additional content, NOT to limit the content...my guess it that they had to remove some features since the shop has almost nothing useful (except the previous things) and the game would be virtually the same as the retail version, less the subscription, but I didn&apos;t like all of this limitation: I&apos;ve played f2p before and the point in those game is to give additional content without actually removing content...so I&apos;ll give it a 7 mainly because it&apos;s NOT a bad game and I actually enjoy it a lot, but the limitations &quot;limits&quot; the fun factor and the will of continuing the game because someone might be discouraged to go on considering the limitations until they either buy a goldpack or just stop completely. And that&apos;s all I can say.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2568875">Expand</a></span>

It is freaking beautiful! I have played 4 MMOs (IMO major oones), and am happy with it quite allot. The only thing I miss is addons. The quest sysem is great, but finding the objectives can be a little confusing for some of the quests. After you get used to the UI (learning curb is a standard thing in MMOs), you get addicted. I have yet to be flatlined on my enthusiasm, and I have logged over 40 hours so far in it! Love it may be a too strong phrase, but I am on the virge of loving it!, just need to get higher lvl and start using more of the flight aspect in the grind</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724653">Expand</a></span>

Crafting, Combat, Flight, Graphics, all rich in detail and webs intricate patterns into the game that will not be looked over.

I often find myself distracted from any task at hand by the beauty of my surroundings. The character creation is the best the genre has to offer and allows the player to really let their imagination go wild for better or for worse. Ability effects are flashy and the level of detail of, well, everything is impressive. I could go on and on about how visually pleasing Aion is.<br><br>The game play is of moderate difficulty. The &quot;grind&quot; is actually not that bad and has improved considerably since launch. I&apos;ve played MMOs with a far worse grind (FFXI anyone?) and Aion is a pleasure to play in comparison. Most activities your character can take part in offer experience points... That includes fighting, quests, crafting, gathering craftables, etc. This gives you plenty of options on how to gain experience points.<br><br>I don&apos;t give Aion a 10 because the combat is actually not hard enough for my tastes and you don&apos;t need to be particularly skilled to get by. PvP is a bit unbalanced and I wish there was a bit more variety of end game content. Aion has room to grow and I look forward to being there as it matures from a great MMO to an excellent one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2041497">Expand</a></span>

That is Aion. I played the first two months and leveled to 50, cleared every dungeon, PVPed daily, mastered a craft, and went to (as well as organized) nearly every fort siege on my server. Ultimately, I quit because the game remained the same shallow, mindless grind it was from the start, and because the PVP never evolved from the cheap ganking and zerging you&apos;ll encounter as soon as you step foot into the Abyss. Aion lacks any true endgame, and simply substitutes a gear/rank grind once you hit max level. The game feels frustratingly unfinished: there&apos;s an excellent combat engine and solid PVP mechanics underneath, but instead of putting them to good use, Aion resorts to simplistic sieges that end up being mindless, laggy zergs, or Abyss PVP that consists of ganking players who are grinding mobs. The endgame PVE content is more of the same, with too much trash to clear for too little reward. I knew the game was a Korean grinder going in, but was hoping the PVP would be good enough to keep me hooked. It isn&apos;t. Polished, pretty, and empty--don&apos;t expect more from Aion than the mindless grind from 1 to 50 and beyond.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=740967">Expand</a></span>

<br>New 2.0 questlines are gorgeous and the little story arcs are exciting. I could only wish there where more. The community-forums are though are overrun with people who quit the game long ago. I wish they would prevent player who don&apos;t play the game from posting to allow some mature discussions on the forums not overrun with hate and immature trolling. Evading to public fan-forums doesn&apos;t work for the same reason and its toppled by WoW fans who hate every other game they aren&apos;t pampered in like little babies and praised how great they are.
<br>Theres much to do for the community aspect of Aion and schooling to do for the new community coordinators. Especially how to deal with unconstructive hate and immaturity of quitter and self proclaimed critics also known as trolls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1455290">Expand</a></span>

I play 10-15hours a week which is much less then the average and I enjoy the instances and questing. The game overall has the best character balance I have seen since, say the lvl 60 cap in wow (other than Shamans back then). The warrior can tank, the Sorc can destroy with very high DPS(assuming she doesn&apos;t get attacked head on), etc. I am currently only lvl 31 out of 50, but have experienced many things in the game. Like others have noted there is some grinding, but in my experience it was a couple hours total... No more. I only repeated about 3 quest out of the 100&apos;s I have done. So not that bad considering... Some fun facts about the game. You can do every skill at one time~ Alchemy, gathering, weaponsmith, etc. But you can only go to 300 and 400 on 1 skill. So it that helps a lot. Also You do not have to gather anything if you do not want to. You can do &quot;Work Orders&quot; to increase skill without providing mats and then when you get your skill high enough to make items you want to use or sale you provide mats. Very handy feature. Some instances you have to capture the fortress in the PVP area to have acess to it. And of course the flying is awesome, graphics is beatiful and worked on high on a $59 9600GS at 35FPS. Very well polished. Hope this helps some of you considering trying Aion. It is worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=738700">Expand</a></span>

I give Aion a perfect 10/10 because it stands out far more than any other MMO at release. Aion can be on the challenging side but a difficult game never scares any true gamers away! Aion is great; give it a chance.</span>

Aion has managed to pull it off well in my opinion, the grinding aspect can be quite boring, and the end game will probably be updated in time. I have high hopes for this game, good luck Aion.</span>

This game on full graphics 1680x1050, looks amaizing. If you are grinding at lvl 13... you are retarded. Your first lvl needed to grind doesnt come until about lvl 22. Walk around, find the quests. They dont come to you like other mmorpgs. The quests are fun, the music is brilliant, and although I&apos;ve only made it to lvl 40 of 50, this game is an AWESOME package overall. Now, it may deserve a score lower than the 10 I&apos;m giving it, but I&apos;m rating this to compensate for the users ratings of 1-3..

I strongly suggest picking up this game if you are a fan of the genre. It blows the others out of the water.</span>

This game is groundbreaking in the aspect of mmorpg and all game. I played WoW got over it, have played Conan and Lotr but none of them truly stuck to me. I am a huge fps fan and I love my graphics. This game scenery is beyond anything I have ever seen, the game starts of quick and uses fast paced action so it becomes more skill based and not time based like WoW. That is where the game truly comes into action, the aspect of skill in an mmorpg is something no game has truly been able to accomplish now, even though the grinding can seem endless, their is good reasoning because the skills take that long to learn. I recommend this game to everyone. The first levels seem WoWish at first but once you hit 25 and your PvPing in the abyss, the game truly comes to light. So please if your a gamer and want a new experiance, come experiance Aion and keep in mind everything I said.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=85082">Expand</a></span>

Top tier, polished, evidence of abundant time, financing, and art put into the development. While the mid-tiers need a little love in some patches to add a few quests, the storyline is engaging throughout, the graphics gorgeous, and just that little cuteness that turns me on. There&apos;s a deep system underlying the &quot;coating&quot; with mana stones, godstones, cooking etc ... that will leave hardcore gamers studious but casual gamers with plenty to do. While many may say its not revolutionary, it is the MMORPG with the brightest future out there right now .. given a chance to fine tune and an expansion or two (which all NCSoft games have done well), this will be here for years to come. It feels like familiar ground for ex WoW or DaoC fans, yet has a few new things. All games have a grind early on until content develops, but this is the best launch I&apos;ve been in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=85675">Expand</a></span>

Having played MMO&apos;s since UO Beta and EQ Phase 1 Beta, and regularly since, I have a pretty good idea of the strengths and weaknesses of most offerings, and I have high, jaded, standards. My initial take was that there wasn&apos;t much new to the game, and I don&apos;t necessarily disagree with that conclusion now. Still, something about the gameplay has got me hooked again, even though I&apos;ve tried so many other new MMOs and left them shortly. The combat mechanics are cleaner and simpler but still sufficiently dynamic to keep me interested. Progress is quest driven and still mostly of the &quot;Kill x foozles&quot; and fedex variety, but there are some neat new twists that I wouldn&apos;t classify as genre-defining, but still refreshing. The bottom line on gameplay is that it&apos;s ... fun. Inextricably, and with that same elusive quality that is hard to define, but you know-it-when-you-see-it, this one is fun. And then there&apos;s the flyying. Omg the flying. There are two types: flying from a standing start (which is, as others have pointed out, limited to certain areas or fly-zones, Boo!), and there is gliding (which can be done anywhere). Gliding is fun. Jump off any high point and float downward. Beautiful sensation and it will take you some time and finesse to master its subtleties. The game isn&apos;t going to dethrone WoW, but then who cares about WoW? This game is fun, I&apos;m enjoying it, and the PvP is intelligently designed and integrated from the ground up (like DAOC&apos;s RvR).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=738100">Expand</a></span>

Which is terrible, a far and sad drawn out torn lore game, and it&apos;s truly depressing to see children now becoming so conservative, they refuse to see the perfect infront of them. Playing wow and many other mmo&apos;s for years, I say it wins on ever single level, accept to wow in character control, and I don&apos;t even know if that level of finger to button freedom can really be considered better, but it gave ME a better feeling. And thats it. Wow once DID have, &quot;informed&quot;, lore, because all played the warcraft series, but now that they slaughtered it, I don&apos;t know what else to really say.

The graphics are in todays-age and Aion is not a grind-fest, there is enough quests and extras to keep you busy. The endgame in the abyss is to die for.</span>

If you don&apos;t like that style of a game, perhaps you should&apos;ve read into it more before buying it. However with that said, it still is relatively a new game in NA, there are still a few kinks they have to beat out, and who knows, maybe they will appeal more to what some westerners want, an easy way to level, but it won&apos;t happen anytime soon. All MMOs have gold farmers spamming it at first, until they figure out an indefinite way to fix the problem, they are going to be there, but that is the current trend in MMOs, they bring it out and fix things later. A game based on a computer system will never be &quot;perfect&quot; per say, but I consider this very close.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=738107">Expand</a></span>

Flight time is too small, in specific areas only, too much grinding required and demanding cash shop. This game could have been so much better.</span>

                                        <span> Aion has beautiful zones, great character customization, solid gameplay and great lore. It suffers from a few drawbacks and some clunkiness at times from the UI (odd mouse things), but overall it is a very beautiful and fun game. No one expects it to kill WoW and it won&apos;t, but it&apos;s a fun alternative for people who are burned out on WoW and it&apos;s lack of innovation.</span>

You can also PVP freely, although you need a group because most asmos are in groups. The animations are good and they don&apos;t look as if it is a robot (stiff animations). The bad things are the queues from time to time, although should be fixed at the end of October when everyone gets a free transfer to an other server. There&apos;s also the gold spammers. They&apos;re all over Aion, and no GM&apos;s are online to ban them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=85620">Expand</a></span>

It has to be said in it&apos;s defense - the epic feel to the storyline up till the half-way mark is incredible and justifies the box price all by itself (Most high-mark reviewers likely based their views on the first 40 hours of play)....After that though, expect interesting content to be few and far between, delivered in tasty little morsels yet never enough to keep you motivated through days of bashing the same monsters and running the same instances over and over. PvP generally revolves around ganking the opposing race when they grind or removing roaming groups from your homelands, with a fortress siege or defense. Broken damage/defense scaling in the class systems will have you tearing hair out frequently. On reflection, fairly similar to Rising Force Online - without the all-important 3rd race to allow for power politics, alliances and ever-entertaining backstabbing. The end-game PvPvE is balanced to perfection in both small skirmish and large-scale brawls - solo PvP is not advised. Expect hideous degrees of both server and frame lag in massive fights, plus 3-6 months of serious grinding to get to this stage. Pre-level 45, most classes can expect to be killed in seconds without top-notch equipment...Assuming you make level 50, there is a far, far nastier equipment upgrade grind then an even-worse Abyss-Point grind ahead for the end-game items. As each server gets older, any &apos;new&apos; level 50 will still be fodder to a veteran level 50 who is deep into their AP equipment grind. Fortunately, very few players will have the perseverance and lack of other activities to make it this far, even over a period of years. The resourcing and crafting systems are static, much like the combat skills progession - everything is preset from material location to success and critical rates (known as a &quot;proc&quot; locally). All crafting and collection involves is triggering the action, then waiting 1-10 seconds for a success, failure or lucky critical - thats right, no skills to assist, no mini-game action (aka SWG PRe-CU  ATITD). The equipment skin-altering NPC to make your equipment look like other equipment is the single greatest concession made to individuality in avatars. Expect weeks of watching progression bars to &apos;Master&apos; a craft - did I mention crafting is entirely optional? Looted gear and AP gear are vastly superior! Crafted goods are generally only used at lower levels or when you don&apos;t have the looted version. Grinding revolves around the same 2 sets of key-strokes constantly, with occasional alterations to use a long cooldown-skill. In-game macros are fairly useless due to timing problems and individual lag issues...generally grinding is all manual skill-activation. Plagued with bots (both basic and advanced types), the economy is unstable as the critical mass of players to supply resources is not there yet on many servers. The mass-banning of bots that NCSoft occasionally does are welcome, yet the large scale bot operators are unaffected and advertisement stores return within hours, often starting to use &apos;real&apos; names rather than gibberish strings of letters. Ultimately, Aion is a niche game - you will grow to love the grind, hate it entirely or simply get bored and slowly stop playing over time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=743140">Expand</a></span>

Looks like they ported the game to NA/EU market just for the first 25 levels, the rest from 25-50 is the same mindless grind fest as the Korean version.</span>

I bought the collectors edition, loved the beta events pre-release (capped at level 30) and the graphics/char customisation are incredible. I contributed to an Aion blog and posted regular, well-recieved PvP vids, as well as a popular sorcerer guide, so I was definitely invested in the game. The wings are fortunately not a gimmick and after quitting, I honestly believe that every single MMO in existence should have glide. :) That&apos;s the positives. I joined a fantastic legion off the bat and that&apos;s the only reason I managed to last two months. At about level 30, the grindwall hits. By level 40 you&apos;re a soldier if you keep on going. I quit at 46 after forcing the last three or so levels out of me (approx. 1 level per week, playing 4-8 hrs a day). While normally you might look past this and think it&apos;ll all be better at endgame, in Aion&apos;s case... no. There&apos;s no endgame. It&apos;s literally exactly the same stuff as what you&apos;ve been doing on the way to 50, and in many ways there&apos;s even less to do. Aion was released a good year or two too early, which is extremely unfortunate as early game is promising and engaging... capping the betas to level 30 was a very clever trick on NCSoft&apos;s part but that&apos;s about where their cleverness ends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=743193">Expand</a></span>

Combat is utterly boring and it takes way too long to kill a single mob (which is usually followed by a rest period becaus you&apos;ll take so much damage), and leveling up is a very slow process as well. With no equipment or interesting abilities to look forward to, what is the point of all that grinding? The much hyped flying ability is useless as well, because there are few areas where you can use it (and even then for a very short period of time). This isn&apos;t a game, this is a job. A job that doesn&apos;t pay you anything in any way.

For me, having sucked every last bit of joy out of my favourite MMO and not considering going back until the next big expansion a year or so from now Aion has proved a godsend. Not without it&apos;s faults, but then there are not enough of those to prevent me from enjoying this more than I&apos;ve enjoyed any of the alternative MMOs I&apos;ve tried in the last few years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=85354">Expand</a></span>

Graphics scale well ona basic maching and still look great, they also look out of this world on a high end machine. I come from 4 years of WOW and this comes as a breath of fresh air for me and a good replacement for the WOW machine. Its Charming , exciting, complex and thoroughly enjoyable. Give it a try Graphics 10 Sound 8 Gameplay 9 Polish 10 Community 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=85394">Expand</a></span>

Well after 2 weeks of 3-4 hour queues every day, I had enough, cancelled my account, and requested a refund under the Sales and Supply of Goods Act 1994. During my brief time in the game, every 10 minutes you get spammed by gold selling bots, and you cant create a ticket about them out of hours...

I did the quests one after another until now, I have played 3 characters, one to 16, one to 14, and one to 12. True, this game is not like World of Warcraft in the way that you cant just drop any quest you want and go find a lot more elsewhere, but there are few quests in this game that you would want to drop, and none that you would have to. I like the character customization system because its much unlike Guild Wars. In Guild Wars, another NCsoft game, you couldn&apos;t customize much. You pick a preset hair color, preset face, preset skin color, and choose a very limited height. This game&apos;s customization system provides almost limitless possibilities, from 1 foot tall characters with giant heads, or a medium sized person with a regular sized head. You can change your face like the Oblivion face modifier, where you can change almost anything on the face. This game has amazing graphics. Somebody said that the graphics were just a bunch of solidly colored, stretched textures. My question to him is if he was playing the right game... To be fair, this game does have a few glitches and not a big variety in armor and weapons, but it will provide you with a lot of fun. Speaking of glitches, just to show you what I mean, there is one glitch where you can fly down under the main city if you go down just a certain way. The funny thing is, though it is really messed up, terrible graphics, 2D objects, and so on, they actually meant for someone to figure out how to go down there. If you look at this one structure at a certain angle, the face from Saw looks at your character and instantly kills you. They even put towns down under the city which at first I thought was just for somebody in the flying city to see, but when you get down there the insides of the buildings are actually fully designed and painted. The wings bring a delightfulness to the game too, but the problem is that there is few places you can fly. However, anywhere in the game you can &apos;glide&apos; which is just a quick way to move downhill and on flat ground very quickly, and it adds a really fun aspect to the game, not to mention the air to air combat and pvp. I switched from World of Warcraft to Aion, and I will say it was definately the right choice, and I would encourage others to do the seem thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=738511">Expand</a></span>

One of the best character creation there is around, interesting options for weapons (like the ability to take the stats from a good weapon and place them on a better looking one), flying ability is not new but its interesting, good character class choices (Best healer class i ever played on a MMORPG). Finnaly a MMORPG in where we dont mana drain after using 4 spells and we can simply sit for heal/regen mana without the need of having hundreds of potions using up inventory space, and so not depending on those too much when adventuring away from a shop. As for those that stubbornly compare Aion to WoW, they are diferent games, Aion is Aion, WoW is WoW. Grinding? All MMORPGs have it. Same quests over and over? Most MMORPGs have them. Aion has bad PvP? WoW has THE worse PvP i have ever experimented upon! Simply... no. Moneysellers, a lot. Dont WoW have those too? Gets somehow boring overtime? All MMORPGs or even normal single player or multiplayer games get through that feeling (Yes, i got bored of grinding for leatherworking in WoW). Bottomline, Aion is an overall good game. Yes, it has some flaws, as any other MMORPG around, but its fun anyway, as WoW is (except for PvP). If you play Aion as Aion, you will surelly like it, if you start thinking too much about flaws, and end up comparing it to every other MMORPG there is, you will utterly end up anoyed and bored. Want complications? Play EvE online (a very good space MMO game).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=740655">Expand</a></span>

Wait, did you say use your mount? Well you have NONE! No Mounts in the game! and only 1 minute. Thats right 1 minute of flight time and you think flying is cool? Well sorry! You get to only fly in DESIGNATED AREAS. haha! Oh wait you can increase your flight time with enchants, new items ect? Well by the time to get those items or a high enough level you will be so sick of all the boring grinding you will be balled. Also why would i enchant my armor to fly longer when i can get an extra +12 critical strike rating and you cant change armor if you pull aggro while flying. Thank god i bought this game+exsp for only 7 bucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1753084">Expand</a></span>

The PVP is extremely enjoyable. Still a bit &quot;grindy&quot;, but overall very impressive. Worth taking a look.</span>

NCsoft&apos;s support is fast and reliable, and will address most issues in little to no time. However, the Community Managers (those who rely information to NCsoft) have done a terrible job, turning a great concept into a horrible mess. Faction imbalance affects every single server on existence and they have done little to fix this issue, which has lead many players to leave. Currently character creation is open for both factions, and still the majority of new players chose the dominating faction.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless, being on the &quot;dominated&quot; side, Aion brings challenge on certain moments such as PvP instances where differences based on numbers do little.
<br>
<br>Aion might not suit you, but it&apos;s a nice game and worth trying.

The only criticisms I have are: the world isn&apos;t quite open enough, you&apos;re unable to use wings in many of the pre-level 25 zones, and the experience earned from quests needs to be increased.</span>

Graphically-speaking, nothing else can match the beauty of this game compared to any other MMO. The effects and detail are astounding (I say this after patch 2.5 and playing on a machine that can max out every setting). Gameplay-wise, it falls in to some common ground with too many other MMOs in delivering very uninspired quests and backstory. The good thing is there is enough detail given to other mechanics in the game that the detail of some of the content doesn&apos;t matter as much as how much fun you have just playing your character and exploring the world. It&apos;s definitely not for everyone in this regard. In particular for me, combat felt a lot slower then I expected until you gain enough skills to be firing off constant combo moves (improves after level 20). It&apos;s also a very linear leveling experience due to a lot of restrictions in place with where you can go and how long you can fly (if at all). The mechanics for flight are a fun distraction to me, although often times you&apos;ll be restricted to &apos;gliding&apos; instead. All in all, it&apos;s well worth a try and available with a free trial. After some disappointment from WoW:Cataclysm, this has become my preferred MMO at least until I get to try SWTOR and see if it&apos;s better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1716374">Expand</a></span>
