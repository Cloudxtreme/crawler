(stephen russell is kind of a thief celebrity)<br>* IMMERSION - you really become sucked into the Thief world because you constantly have to pay close attention to your surroundings and actions; visual cues, sounds, and lighting all are important sensory inputs in this game and thus to enjoy this game you automatically become immersed in it; just make sure that you play in a dark room with surround sound setup - and make sure no heavy or expensive objects are around - hysterical arm flailing is included in this game!<br><br>THE BAD:<br>* in general - nothing much; if you&apos;re looking for psychopatic mass murdering, you&apos;re at the wrong address; * the -0.5 i dock off for several reasons: first off, no zombies! perhaps the most awesome enemies in the first thief - scary, loud, slow, and it&apos;s possible to blow them up! what&apos;s not to like (unless you have weak nerves); the story - just not as immersive and fresh as constantine&apos;s plot in Thief1 - that one had mystery, betrayal, and revenge in it; this one only a constant fanaticist (karras) and not much more; finally, my biggest complaint - not all the playing styles that were possible in Thief1 are possible in Thief2 - even the second mission is impossible to &apos;ghost&apos; (getting all loot and items without detection or even arousing suspicion); later missions just compound on that<br><br>other thoughts:<br>also used to (and to a limited extent still does) have a very proliferative fan community - check out &apos;thief - the circle&apos; (no longer updated but still accessible) and if at all possible get komag&apos;s DVD sets (i think he offers a torrent somewhere) - tons of those missions are just incredibly well done, some perhaps even surpassing the original missions (calendra&apos;s legacy, T2X, 7th crystal &amp; many more) in immersion, while others give it an entirely new spin (hammerite deathmatch, some of the unreal tournament style missions)<br><br>IMHO, the Thief franchise created a wholly new type of gaming style and as such revolutionized pc gaming; much more so than other hallmark games such as crysis or half life ever did (for me at least); how good is it? i&apos;ve played through Thief1&amp;2 countless times with different styles in mind and the very first games that always get installed on any new computer of mine are the thief and system shock games!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief-ii-the-metal-age/user-reviews?user_review_id=1745886">Expand</a></span>

The originality of the setting, the characters and the story are accompanied by some of the best levels ever seen in computer game history. Places like Angelwatch stand way above any other experience any game in the last eleven years since &quot;The Metal Age&quot; has provided for players. Almost a decade after this release no other game (maybe except Deus Ex 1) even came close to the value of Thief 2. For me this is a masterpiece according to which all games should be made.<br>It is sad Thief 3 failed and Thief 4 probably will fail to recreate the undeniable greatness of Thief 1 and 2. The time such games were made is regrettably a long gone one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief-ii-the-metal-age/user-reviews?user_review_id=1555748">Expand</a></span>

The follow up to the flawed gem that was Thief The Dark Project may seem familiar to those who played the first one; the interface is more or less the same, as are the slightly ugly graphics and overall gameplay. Taking away the irritating mandatory combat in TTDP, Thief 2&apos;s strengths such as the sprawling non-linear levels, engaging stealth, brilliant writing and characterisation shine all the brighter. The characters all feel unique; even the guards have an endearing daftness to them as they flamboyantly make conversation while you watch from the shadows (keep a look out for Benny, especially). In fact, I&apos;m hard pressed to say anything bad about it except nitpicks; the gameplay doesn&apos;t add much from TDP, the graphics are a bit ugly (even for 2000) and it&apos;s not quite as tense or original as the first game. But any criticism I have for the game is quickly overshadowed by the sheer brilliant of it. This is a darn good game, and I urge you to buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief-ii-the-metal-age/user-reviews?user_review_id=2736824">Expand</a></span>

It has an interesting and fascinating scenario and the story is well written. The problem is, that the introduction of the metal elements make this a somewhat sloppy steam-punk experience. The real issue for me was the second half of the game when it became really tedious to continue with the thief-style game-play in a high-tech environment.

I for one am new to the series, having bought the trilogy online during 2012, I was simply expecting an average stealth series, but to my surprise, they are amazing. Thief 2, set in the same City as the first one, follows the events of Garret, the master Thief. He is sarcastic and an utterly likable character who is just scraping by in a dark, brooding, steampunk world. The plot is very deep, as goes the other two... It questions the morality of industry, individualism and religious beliefs, and evolves a massive conspiracy involving a head of a religious sect and a corrupt general of a massive police force.
<br>
<br>Everything about this game is impressive, ranging from an excellent soundtrack done by Eric Brosius, non-linear and exploration based level design, a well written and menacing plot/setting... And not to mention the crazy Mechanists, a fascinating offshoot of the already insane Hammerite religion.
<br>
<br>Positves:
<br>
<br>Excellent ambiance and soundtrack.
<br>Deep story telling and stylish cut scenes.
<br>A much higher focus on actual stealing.
<br>Massive, open ended level design.
<br>Compelling plot and fascinating settings.
<br>Huge amount of detail.
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>A couple of levels that are too confusing to navigate.
<br>Some shoddy voice acting.
<br>Lighting a bit shoddy at times.
<br>
<br>Overall: 9</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief-ii-the-metal-age/user-reviews?user_review_id=4030263">Expand</a></span>

Sacrificing some of the mission variety present in The Dark Project rather than taking the time to improve it, what we&apos;re left with is a section of the original that&apos;s been polished to a fine sheen.  The infiltration and sneaking aspects are at their finest, but at the same time while it&apos;s got a high gloss it&apos;s missing some of the charm of its predecessor.  It feels like a part rather than a whole, like someone  picking the chocolate chips out of a cookie.  The narrative is choppy and incoherent and seems to just facilitate Garrett going to cool locations for levels rather than an over arching plot, and the aesthetics general feel cold and clean, missing some of the dank grime present in TDP.
<br>
<br>A great game, and certainly one I recommend, but ultimately a bit of a let down in the grand scheme of things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief-ii-the-metal-age/user-reviews?user_review_id=4413789">Expand</a></span>

I spent many, many hours looking for hidden loot and secrets while trying to kill nobody. This game highly rewards the non-confrontational type of players and stealthy manuevers gives an immense amount of satisfaction for doing so. There are many new toys for Garrett to play with in these huge mission areas and also some of the encounters are hilarious. The story was amazing; I will not dive in but it has great morals and a few familiar faces will be present. Once again the sound is spot on whether Garret is going down a steep hill or a long climb everything syncs pretty greatly, not to mention the music is very fitting and adds to the overall atmosphere.
<br>
<br>On a side note the visuals in this game can be somewhat bland but in my opinion that is no reason to bring the score down since there are so many amazing modders that keep this game running on par with some games today!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief-ii-the-metal-age/user-reviews?user_review_id=6871644">Expand</a></span>
