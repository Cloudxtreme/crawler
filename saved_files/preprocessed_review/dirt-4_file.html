I really like the new gamer control model, which finally permits to play with a controller in all the weathers. However the small buggy control is just horrible and twitchy. I like the career mode and the build your team, but I am not sure how deep the career mode is really...there is no years, season or aging involved, just unlocking stuff, making more money for your team. So, I am not sure it qualifies to anything near a career. Some of the graphics are quite well done and they fix the short range of vision for night settings. The sounds are very good. The music samples are amazing and various. There is maybe not enough variety in the locations, as you get only 3-4 places (if it&apos;s more it does all look a like). I like that version more then the previous. Now if we could get the real rally license and tracks that would be amazing. I give it a 78%</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=7389645">Expand</a></span>

<br>As an avid Dirt Rally player I was stoked for Dirt 4, but somehow Codemasters really f-ed up:
<br>
<br>1) The codriver calls. Too many nonessential calls, and too many calls come far too late, even after adjusting the Earlier v Later settings.
<br>
<br>2) The suspension physics. Suddenly I am involved in a flat spin because I tried to brake hard, with nt indication of grip lost in my wheel. Awesome! Oh, did you want to turn left? F yourself, time to go off line and into a wall.
<br>
<br>3) Their algorithm is showing. Within career stages there are clearly repeated sections, whose only difference is the van or stop sign or number of spectators on the sides. I was so excited for the My Stage feature, but I never thought it&apos;d be the only way they&apos;d make stages!
<br>
<br>As someone who was super excited for this game, I&apos;m horribly disappointed. Uninstalled, requested refund from Steam, and went back to Dirt Rally for some good fun.

<br>
<br>At the lowest, it&apos;s a great simcade racer. Breaking down its handling model, it&apos;s Dirt Rally&apos;s but with noticeable improvements in weight transfer, braking, jump characteristics and FFB feel, and large improvements in tarmac and rallycross physics. Dirt 4 can feel more realistic than Dirt Rally at times.
<br>
<br>The only caveat is high gravel grip, which restricts the car&apos;s ability to be thrown to the end of a bend sideways (unless its rallycross). Yes, that takes a hit on the game&apos;s realism, but that doesn&apos;t mean it is not fun to drive. The game&apos;s still highly enjoyable to play, sim handling + no assists on a wheel and a controller.
<br>
<br>The stage generator produces fun to drive rally stages (but don&apos;t expect it to recreate DR&apos;s Anglos&apos; complexity). On a scale of Dirt 3 to DR, D4&apos;s generated stages are 75% towards DR&apos;s. It makes online rally very enjoyable because you don&apos;t know the combination of turns ahead, and its up to your skill and your split-second reactions to the pace-notes to determine whose faster, rather than wondering if your opponent practiced that stage a thousand times in custom event prior. Even if you recognise some sections, taking them at 100% pace is still satisfying as driving on a familiar stage in another rally game. ATM yourstage has a solid start, but it has so much more potential and it would be great for CM to improve it for the sequel.
<br>
<br>TLDR: It&apos;s still a very fun game. But if you don&apos;t want to touch anything that&apos;s not a full simulator, just get RBR.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=7352261">Expand</a></span>

<br>Deep but generic
<br>Dirt 4 is a racing game all about rally cars, and this rally simulator gets pretty deep&#x2026;
<br>Before the game starts it asks if you&#x2019;re here for fun or here for simulation...
<br>I chose fun but the game just couldn&#x2019;t deliver for me&#x2026;
<br>Dirt 4 Features a lengthy career mode, an academy to learn the ropes, free roam, free play, trials, and competitive online options with up to 8 players&#x2026;
<br>There are 4 types of event you can do here&#x2026;.
<br>There&#x2019;s land rush which is truck and buggy racing around boring dirt tracks&#x2026; rally cross which is a circuit race around boring asphalt tracks&#x2026; and finally Rally and Historic Rally which are really the stars of this show&#x2026;
<br>The game has a great soundtrack but sadly during races you have a voice in your ear telling you the upcoming turns as there is no mini map to race with&#x2026;
<br>And each race gives you challenges for extra credits that you can use to buy new cars, upgrade your parts, and pay your team that you hire to repair your car more efficiently as you do take damage, which is why it&#x2019;s important to pay attention to the commands from your partner while racing..
<br>Sadly these rally races much like the circuit races also get boring fairly quickly&#x2026;
<br>There are seemingly endless amounts of rally tracks here with different terrain and weather to deal with&#x2026;.
<br>These tracks are endless because they are procedurally generated&#x2026;
<br>In modes outside of career in particular, you choose the length and complexity on a slider and with that information the game generates a track
<br>if you&#x2019;ve been around my channel long you know that procedural generation is my favorite thing in the world...
<br>That&#x2019;s sarcasm&#x2026;
<br>I hate procedural generation and Dirt 4 does a great job of showcasing why this is&#x2026;
<br>Every single track despite being different feels exactly the same no matter the weather I&#x2019;m dealing with&#x2026;
<br>The problem with procedural generation is that it lacks the handcrafted care levels in practically every game need&#x2026; this is especially true for racing games
<br>Its artificial replayability&#x2026;
<br>I&#x2019;ll play the same great hand crafted track 100 times before ill play 100 procedural tracks&#x2026;
<br>This procedural generation quickly exhausts this game for me&#x2026;
<br>And that&#x2019;s a shame because it is so deep&#x2026;
<br>The cars handle wonderfully, there are time attacks and smash attack obstacle courses to finer tune your drifting and handling skills&#x2026;.
<br>There is love in this game&#x2026; just not in the actual tracks where it desperately needs to be..
<br>Again, at the start of the game you&#x2019;re asked if you want fun or simulation...
<br>Those that choose simulation no doubt in my mind will think this game is great or even amazing...
<br>But those here for fun...
<br>Look someplace else&#x2026;
<br>I give Dirt 4

<br>Dirt 4 drives it off the edge of the cliff.
<br>
<br>This release confirms the company is producing nothing more than middle-shelf cannon fodder to shill to unsuspecting brain-dead consumers.
<br>
<br>GRID was the last good racing game Codemasters made, and utterly destroyed that franchise with GRID2.
<br>
<br>&quot;Dirt&quot; is now dead, just like its progenitor, Colin MacRae.
<br>
<br>It is an awful thing to note: the loss of yet another great British company to greed and apathy of the very thing we once, as gamers; held so dear:
<br>
<br>Quality.
<br>
<br>Giving money to Codemasters for this &apos;game&apos; is an affront to quality and the paths we chose to meet it on the road, vying for position amongst the quagmire of dross and disparity of excellence.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=7368494">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Very solid game combining the best elements of the original DiRT and DiRT Rally.
<br>
<br>No technical issues encountered during the first 30hrs of gameplay - 4790K GTX1080 on Windows 10 64 bit, DFGT.
<br>
<br>As a side note there&apos;s a nice soundtrack as well.
<br>
<br>Highly recommended!
<br>
<br>Needs more locations and some extra tile variation added.</span>

I haven&apos;t fully played this but I am going to expose the reasons why I didn&apos;t like it.
<br>
<br>Also I want to first say I enjoyed lots of hours of DIRT Rally and I think is an amazing driving game. I thought this would be an enjoyable experience as well and I saw some good reviews out there so I bought it. Now let&apos;s start with the review.
<br>
<br>The first thing you notice on the first stages is the driving and handling experience is considerably less enjoyable/realistic than DIRT Rally, even choosing simulation. It fees more arcade like, and the car seems to self-adjust itself for more stability, and at the end you having a feeling that you have less control of the racing experience. So driving is less fun that DIRT Rally.
<br>
<br>Second, graphic-wise the stages are too short, simple and very straight with few exciting and challenging turns. Also the views/locations of the track don&apos;t seem original either, looks a step backwards. You won&apos;t notice better quality either in the graphics, but what you will notice is a decrease in frame rate from DIRT Rally.
<br>
<br>Third, there is a lot of in game screens between driving and a lot of stuff like reading emails from possible team offers, create your own team, and **** of style &quot;you&apos;ve done it very well and bla bla bla, now do this and do that&quot;, look at these experience bars growing, etc. I simply don&apos;t get this, I just want a racing experience and I think I&apos;ve spend more time on menus that actually driving and this is a driving game isn&apos;t it?
<br>
<br>So at this point I&apos;ve had enough of it, the game didn&apos;t prove itself to be good enough on what it should deliver: racing. Quite a disappointment.
<br>
<br>Codemasters please, if you want to get cash, do DLCs/expansions for DIRT Rally adding more stages. I will be happy to spend 100&#x20AC; bought of good quality stages. I thought you understood what we wanted after listening to the community and delivering a good game like DIRT Rally was. Now it feels like a step backwards again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=7441255">Expand</a></span>

The physics simulations have been massively improved, the tuning options have been fleshed out tremendously and so on. But I find that very little of what have been added to the game has actually added to the experience. It may feel more realistic, I wouldn&apos;t know as I have never actually wrestled a rally car or stadium truck through a corner at 100 kph, but it does not feel more right. And in my opinion not nearly as fun.
<br>It is more challenging so if that&apos;s your thing, then this might be for you.
<br>A lot of the simulation features does feel as though they have been slightly exaggerated so that the player actually notices the added features. The AI is worse. While it is true, as others have mentioned that the &quot;Your Stage&quot; system does reuse bits of track a bit often, I really think it works pretty well and the pacing notes are always decent even if they are rarely great.
<br>The sound&apos;s still awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=7360976">Expand</a></span>
