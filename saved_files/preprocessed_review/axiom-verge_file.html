<br>Tagged as retro, this shouldn&apos;t pigeonhole your expectations of the game. Like Fez or Hotline Miami before it, this is a love letter to those glorious early days of gaming. Even if you&apos;re not old enough that this kind of game doesn&apos;t make you dewy eyed with nostalgia, the collection of upgrades and weaponry, storyline and exploration should be more than enough to entice you. A huge map that will occupy your first run through for probably tens of hours, where upgrades you unearth make earlier barriers accessible. Metroidvania at its purest.
<br>Some little niggles: Its easy to toggle through weapons by mistake when using climbing controls, and for me there were times when being unclear where to go tipped the balance from &quot;exploration&quot; to frustration.
<br>That being said, you will get a ton of enjoyment from this little gem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/axiom-verge/user-reviews?user_review_id=5923389">Expand</a></span>

<br>As for the whole &quot;Metroidvania&quot; thing, I have to say... I did finish Super Metroid and I believe also Metroid 2. As well as all RPG-style Castlevanias and many other Metroidvanias. But the only game of its kind (Metroid, RPG-Castlevania or Metroidvania) I remember enjoying this much is Symphony of the Night. The art style is fantastic, the music as well and the controls as well as the huge variety of gameplay elements is just great. The only thing that bugs me a little is the fact that effort that it takes to get most pass codes if one doesn&apos;t just Google them. Also that the game does not mark found items on the map. As well as the occasionally inconsistent art style. And most importantly, I can&apos;t stand the fact that it&apos;s Steam-only on PC. This is really what finally made me knock off one point from 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/axiom-verge/user-reviews?user_review_id=5460428">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve just completed it and I feel buzzed. On first impressions it might seem like another Metroid clone. However, the more you play, the more you realise that it has a unique character and personality of its own. I&apos;d say the words spiritual successor would be most appropriate. It utilises all of the strengths of the Metroid franchise and virtually none of the weaknesses.
<br>
<br>The game is challenging, but none of that challenge was unfair. It was obvious the developer could see the game through the player&apos;s eyes when designing it, like having save rooms spaced apart at perfect intervals (and there&apos;s always one before boss fights), the levels being designed really well, the controls being slick and smooth, and you&apos;re never forced to do silly wall jumping manoeuvres that Metroid had you do.
<br>
<br>The visuals worked well. Most of them were just dungeons really, but everything was consistent. And the music was a whole new level of awesome, ranging from gripping atmospheric tracks to adrenaline-pumping boss battle tracks.
<br>
<br>The game throws a variety of challenges your way, there are tonnes of weapons and unique accessories to collect that help you get stronger, plenty of secrets to find, but my favourite aspect were probably the boss fights. They were all challenging to some degree, especially the ones in the second half of the game, but each and every one of them could be beaten with the right strategy. The trick is to simply figure out that strategy and to optimize it. I kind of wish there were more of them in fact. From what I recall, the game only has 7 boss fights in total.
<br>
<br>Since this is mostly a dungeon crawler, the story was in the background most of the time, but it had some cool and unique concepts, and the backstory cutscenes were always interesting, as they always revealed something new.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t really find anything major to criticise about the game, aside from the fact that it&apos;s not for everyone. If you&apos;ve ever liked any of the Metroid games, or any other games with similar gameplay, you wouldn&apos;t want to miss Axiom Verge. It&apos;s slick, fun, and rewarding, exactly as games should be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/axiom-verge/user-reviews?user_review_id=5338540">Expand</a></span>

The first there is the graphics - I am aware that they are made just by one person, but I am just talking about the end result. While they are not in the way and they do the job just fine, they fail to really convey the atmosphere of the game&apos;s world. Next - the story. I tried to pay attention but at some point I didn&apos;t care anymore. It all sounded like a blah blah and nonsensical. I think the story is there, but it demands too much from the player, instead of just being simple and accessible and leave the supposed plot-twists for later on.
<br>
<br>Ok, now that we have those 2 things out of the way, I was quite entertained playing the game through-out. Nice, tight mechanics, a lot of exploration, good amount of backtracking, secret placed that can be find (not extremely hard) and fun bosses, also not too hard (the way I like them). In addition: interesting weapon ideas, varied enemies with specific tactics needed; good game length; interesting soundtrack.
<br>
<br>Overall: highly recommended for all metroid-like game fans out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/axiom-verge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7558140">Expand</a></span>

However, like the best &quot;retro&quot; games, it takes some creative liberties with its source material and does things that devs in the 90s probably would not have thought of, and If they had, the tech level wouldn&apos;t have been able to keep up. It also has a level of mystery and worldbuilding unrivaled in the genre.
<br>
<br>First, I have to address some personal issues I had with the controls. Axiom Verge handles well enough to be quite playable, but it also rather noticeably doesn&apos;t handle as well as Super Metroid or other games of the era, or even some of its own contemporaries: the Shantae games have much more fluid movement, for example. I found myself switching between the keyboard and an Xbox 360 controller on the fly depending on what I was doing, not wholly comfortable using either. In particular, aiming and firing felt much more natural on the controller, but grappling was far easier using the keyboard, thanks to what might be the shortest and most awkward grapple in gaming. It&apos;s like nobody but me played the 2009 Bionic Commando remake. It also has curiously easy boss fights for the genre, especially considering how dangerous some of the regular enemies are.
<br>
<br>That probably isn&apos;t a fair assessment of it, considering it was developed by one guy, unlike any of the other titles I just mentioned. With that in mind, Axiom Verge is an impressive work. It has a staggering variety of weapons that reads like a greatest hits list of shmup weaponry, everything from a basic linear projectile to a three-way spread, enemy-tracking lightning, R-Type-style curving lasers, Castlevania&apos;s fire vials, Ninja Gaiden&apos;s windmill stars, projectiles that bounce or travel along the ground, continuous-fire lasers, an ice-shard spreadfire weapon and more.
<br>
<br>Where Verge really shines is in its setting. You are Trace, a nerdy laser scientist who, following an accident at his lab, awakens in a bizarre, otherworldy place filled with fantastic things that want him dead. Like the many dead worlds Samus Aran has set foot upon, what happened to the world of Axiom Verge happened long ago. But this is different. You are not a power-armored, alien DNA-infused super-warrior. You are a dazed and confused everyman lost in a nightmare. You are treading among the bones of giants and the game&apos;s foreboding, H.R. Giger-esque artwork and eerie soundtrack heavily reinforces this. It reminds me vaguely of Xargon, an old Epic Games platformer from 1993. A central theme of the game, without going into too much detail, is the idea that things are not always as they appear. As one reviewer put it, you think you know how Verge will end, but you don&apos;t. It may not even make very much sense to you when it does, so I suggest you hunt down those notes and pay very close attention to their wording.
<br>
<br>The game makes clever use of &quot;glitchy&quot; textures to represent areas of the world where reality has gone a bit fuzzy, when it is being re-written. What would indicate an error in any other game is a feature here, a potential gateway to elsewhere. With enough items, the world opens up in ways you probably woudn&apos;t have anticipated going in- where the journey of many other platformer protagonists would end, Trace&apos;s is only beginning. The esotericism of its backstory is even reflected in gameplay- some items are so well hidden that there is no possible way to discern their location without literally shooting and probing every wall with every ability, a questionable design choice, I&apos;d say, but easily remedied by a guide and quite in keeping with the games&apos; overall feel. There are even &quot;secret&quot; worlds whose placement and contents are randomized in each playthrough, that are implied to exist outside of the reality of most of the game- to the point where items found within do not count towards your completion percentage!
<br>
<br>If you are as big a fan of Metroidvania as I am, then you owe it to yourself to play Axiom Verge, but even more so if you appreciate quality aesthetic design in games and the ability of them to put you in a unfamiliar and uncomfortable reality. Verge will remain in my consciousness for a very long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/axiom-verge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7315605">Expand</a></span>
