The only advantage this DLC would even have is for those hardcore fans who think it might affect something in Mass Effect 3.  This DLC&apos;s story is one in which I could tell to you in a few sentences.  Those few sentences of story are stretched into a boring length of drone game-play consisting of an hour to an hour and a half, depending on difficulty.   This DLC is a pitiful attempt to prepare one&apos;s self for Mass Effect 3.  The only plus for me was to see my favorite yellow hologram Reaper.  If you insist on wasting an hour of your time, are a die hard Mass Effect fan, and are under the illusion that this will somehow affect Mass Effect 3 (likely only a dialog option or two) then go for it.  If you were hoping for an epic follow up of similar caliber to Lair of the Shadow Broker, steer clear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=1560339">Expand</a></span>

Story is thin, combat is solo throughout the entire DLC, and the whole thing is much shorter than any of the other paid DLC.

<br>Points for the unusual optional stealth mechanic, but that&apos;s about all Arrival has going for it.</span>

Extraction would have been nice on solo, but for the rest it was rememberding of my Killzone copies.. sorry.. again same stuff like with DA2 and Daiblo ? Just continue your own game and special genre. dont fix whats working.. If ME3 is moving to this kind of gameplay (zillions enemies swooping into the rooms, and mostly solo than im done with ME and play shooters online sorry.<br><br>- disliked how shepard came out weak. (second this)<br><br>- disliked the ultimative prostation to the shooter genre. ( i do like pure shooters, but for pure shooters i play other games)<br><br>- no faces, all look same. batarian 2 eyes helmets .. cloned level design.. man DA2 lazyness spreading over.... whats up @bioware..<br><br>scrore 5/10<br>=&gt; Shadwobroker or Overlord was way better</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=1560462">Expand</a></span>

The main fault is that the plot is linear to the point of railroading and at some points, logically inconsistent. There are no new mechanics like the race in LotSB, just hack&amp;slash against generic enemies.  The character of Admiral Hackett appears rather bland and Kenson suffers from an absolute lack of character. That there is no interaction from the rest of your squadmates (you cannot take them with you to the mission) makes it even more pronounced. The voice acting and cutscenes are mediocre, so the most enjoyment you can get from this is one challenging fight, which does not do justice to the RP part of RPG - and if I wanted a straight shooter, there are far better alternatives.<br><br>(The rest of the article will contain spoilers!) My main critique will go against the logic of doctor Plotdevice Kenson&#xC2;&#xB4;s behaviour. If she were indoctrinated from the start, why on Earth would she be instructing Shepard in how to destroy the relay? If she were not, why would her coworkers say she was? If you wanted to evacuate the colonies, why not do that as soon as possible (when you arrive at the base) rather than wait until the end, where you are cut off anyway?<br>Why does the moral decision of killing the colonists play such a minor role? Even if it should lead to an immediate game over with the Reapers arriving, why is not Shepard allowed to not make the judgement call and not destroy the asteroid? All and all, from an RP view, this DLC was a disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=1558511">Expand</a></span>

Now, you have no doubt what is going to be happening in the beginning of ME3 (I&apos;m not going to contain any spoilers in this), as well as how pissed the Reapers are likely going to be that you lent a hand to foil (if only for a short time) their plans of galactic domination. It was a well needed DLC in terms of the ME universe and where the story is headed, especially in a game where story is 60% of the game, but the DLC could have had more story rather than waves and waves of enemies that stood between point A and point B. Also, clocking in at about 2-3 hours (playing through on Insanity difficulty first time through) it left a lot to be desired. Had it been around 5-6 hours, I would easily have given this a 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=1590121">Expand</a></span>

I first reviewed it on 360 and was really disappointed.   Having got ME2 PC for free from a Bioware offer I decided to try the experience again on a different platform.  Im going to be honest. I struggled, I really did struggle to finish it.  Again I felt all personality was stripped from Shepard throughout with the sole purpose of the DLC being of that to thrust a trial on you and create a setting for the start of ME3.  As a result it was totally linear and the end scene of the DLC was all focus on this trial.   I just blew up 300,000 Batarians and my Shepard didnt blink an eye at it... just really poor story telling of a very linear nature.  No choice which is what ME is famous for. Again I played Vanguard and again I couldnt charge in places where it should have been possible.  Fustrating and Poor DLC which a you can watch a youtube video on and everyones experience is the same.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=1623991">Expand</a></span>

It did its job (made us all excited about Mass 3) - no doubt countless preorders were made from the influence of this DLC. Nice to see Admiral Hackett (Lance Henriksen) finally make an appearance too.</span>

Mass Effect 2 is a Action third person shooter first and foremost.
<br>ANYONE thinking ME2 would continue on the deep and compelling Universe and story lines set up in Mass effect will be greatly disappointed. Even the save game transfers from ME are mostly meaningless as all the carry over choices (with exception of 1 but ill not ruin that here) are minimalized and finished off with NO future adventure or interaction (beyond a short conversation here and there).
<br>
<br>In short the Open World Storyline design of Mass Effect is removed and replaced with a singular Linear Third Person Shooter design.
<br>
<br>now none of that is terrible (well other then short length of game, thats unforgivable), if thats what you went in expecting. Sadly EA marketted this game as the spiritual and RPG expansion of the first to up box sales at release. Typical EA.
<br>
<br>Mass Effect 2 is a Sci Fi third person shooter. Its has semi interesting characters and you even get to decide who you romance (WOOT, from choosing if a alien speices lives or dies in ME1 to who you get a black screen with in ME2).
<br>
<br>In the end, If you like the Mass Effect Universe and like shooters, you will like this game
<br>Just dont go into it thinking your getting the next installment of the original Mass Effect RPG. That franchise stopped production after #1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3166855">Expand</a></span>
