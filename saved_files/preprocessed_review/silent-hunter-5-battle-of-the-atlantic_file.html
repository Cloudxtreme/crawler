At the moment it&apos;s incomplete and fairly shallow, with several missing features and unbalances. However, with all the mods already out, and several more on the way, it&apos;s no big leap to believe that this will become a true classic once touched up by patches and mods. It has an incredibly moddability and already features things never found in III and 4, except through mods: milk cows, wolf packs, far more complex AI, and a far more dynamic campaign where the AI responds well to your every move, and to all the other traffic in the world. Sure, it&apos;s got its fault, but Silent Hunter 2, III and 4 were also fairly unfinished when they were released, and look at them now, SHIII in particular with the Grey Wolves Expansion. I highly recommend the review of Neal Stevens, webmaster of subsim.com. He gives a lengthy, honest and unbiased review that really dives (no pun intended) into the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-5-battle-of-the-atlantic/user-reviews?user_review_id=746842">Expand</a></span>

Very unpolished release and current state. Pros: Nice graphics, campaign concept, gameplay ( if you can close an eye here and there). Definitly has the potential.

At the moment it&apos;s incomplete and fairly shallow, with several missing features and unbalances. However, with all the mods already out, and several more on the way, it&apos;s no big leap to believe that this will become a true classic once touched up by patches and mods. It has an incredibly moddability and already features things never found in III and 4, except through mods: milk cows, wolf packs, far more complex AI, and a far more dynamic campaign where the AI responds well to your every move, and to all the other traffic in the world. Sure, it&apos;s got its fault, but Silent Hunter 2, III and 4 were also fairly unfinished when they were released, and look at them now, SHIII in particular with the Grey Wolves Expansion. I highly recommend the review of Neal Stevens, webmaster of subsim.com. He gives a lengthy, honest and unbiased review that really dives (no pun intended) into the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-5-battle-of-the-atlantic/user-reviews?user_review_id=746871">Expand</a></span>

<br>My review: The best and most immersive submarine simulator currently on the market (at this stage it is IMO better than SH3 and SH4). After suffering bad reviews after a buggy launch, the game has been greatly improved by tons of community mods that have made this game a very fun and addictive experience. I would say that around 90% of the bugs have been ironed out since the release. Some minor annoyances are still present, but it&apos;s nothing compared to the stock game (which is a buggy mess to put it mildly). If you are a beginner, search youtube for: How to install SH5 Mods Beginner Tutorial.
<br>
<br>The strength of this game is the simulation aspect, which this game does on a very high level. Certain realism mods (like real navigation) add to this aspect so much, that it is easy to forget you are playing a video game, that&apos;s how good it simulates sub control. There are many different ways to calculate attack solutions on ships, this freedom is what makes it so believable. Flexibility is another important aspect. Don&apos;t want to play with perfect realism? No problem, you can change your settings to have an almost casual point-and-shoot gameplay. If you want just a moderate amount of realism settings, you can have that. Almost every function and setting imaginable can be tweaked and adjusted with mods or in-game settings. To summarize, Silent Hunter 5 is not for the impatient, but don&apos;t let that stop you, because it offers one of the most rewarding gameplay experiences I have ever seen in a video game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-5-battle-of-the-atlantic/user-reviews?user_review_id=3911094">Expand</a></span>

Just to state an example: The &quot;Dept Under Keel&quot; is one of my most used commands, so I don&apos;t end up ramming into the sea floor. I like using that opposed to the external camera and looking...which in my opinion is cheating. Yet, this is what I had to do within SH5. From buggy gameplay, to the almost useless new control config, SH5 doesn&apos;t even top SH3&apos;s ease of gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-5-battle-of-the-atlantic/user-reviews?user_review_id=1469954">Expand</a></span>

Basically they removed all the good features from SH3 and SH4, added a &quot;meh&quot; UI, sort of improved crew management, improved graphics (yay, but duh), and floundered around with everything else.  Tutorial is non existent.  Auto TDC sucks (you aim where my periscope/uzo is looking? WTF? that&apos;s completely and utterly stupid. Who the heck is going to look 30 degrees in front of the boat they&apos;re aiming at?  Meaning you pretty much have to learn how to manual TDC.  Saving/loading is still bugged to F***, which is awesome because there&apos;s nothing more fun than simulating driving across the atlantic for an hour.  Take simple stuff like &quot;wanting to skip the tutorial&quot; (because it&apos;s useles), no option for that until you&apos;ve already beat the tutorial but if you accidentally restart the tutorial, the option to skip the tutorial is removed (Think about that one).  You still haven&apos;t added an in-game clock to the UI.  Bugs galore.  A few small steps forward in some areas, and giant leaps backwards in others.

<br>
<br>Just don&apos;t by Ubisoft games anymore, I know I won&apos;t. They do not treat you right and they deserve to fail as a company because they are a greedy trash company that produces trash games.
<br>
<br>You are better then Ubisoft, stay well away from anything they produce. All they care about is money, they are worse then EA and I don&apos;t buy EA games anymore ether.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-5-battle-of-the-atlantic/user-reviews?user_review_id=3630294">Expand</a></span>

Adding to this, the DRM, that requires you to be online and which stops you from playing when your internet connection drops is a disaster.</span>

Being a 20-year Silent Hunter fan, I expected a decent, if not good, game. I was wrong. Silent Hunter 5 is an abomination, and an insult to the legacy of the series. The core of the problem is the removal of quick keys that allow the player to move from one station to another. The player no longer has the ability to move directly to the Conn, plotting map, deck gun, periscope, or other location by simply pressing an F-key. You must literally and actually WALK from one location on the sub to another. This is frustrating and severely detracts from enjoying the game. Another deal-breaker is the nerfing of the deck and flak guns. Manning the deck gun and manually engaging a difficult surface target at 4000 meters has been part of Silent Hunter since 1996. Now, it is no longer an option. Just man the deck gun, point in the general direction of a target, and hope your crew can get the job done. The only redeeming feature of the game is the fairly decent graphics, but even a pretty face can be overwhelmed by the stench of incompetence and ignorance. Unless a mod is released that perfectly matches the user interface of Silent Hunter 3, this game is quite literally unplayable. Do not buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-5-battle-of-the-atlantic/user-reviews?user_review_id=6869099">Expand</a></span>
