<br>
<br>They&apos;re lying. There isn&apos;t anything here.
<br>
<br>The game is garbage. You plant seeds. They grow. There are some mechanics related to them - the pink seeds can be harvested for more seeds. The bush sprouts heart flowers which can be collected when you go into the void. The orange block&apos;s growth is dependent on whether it has space to grow horizontally. The red one explodes outwards in blocks and will throw you into the void if you stand too close.
<br>
<br>Your goal is to get to the void star blocks - not the one on the bottom, but ones which are off isolated on far edges of the screen. These turn into keys when you step into them, but unless you have brought your blocks up adjacent to it, you&apos;ll have no way out.
<br>
<br>Once you grab your key, you can go back to the start and go back into the main world, where you can plant seeds and grow to reach other areas with bits of esoteric poetry hanging in the sky.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a hidden block with three little stars in it which spawns a three keyhole exit. Bringing three keys to it will let you unlock some secret levels which can then be navigated to completion.
<br>
<br>There are a number of levels in the game, and they all LOOK the same, but are functionally slightly different. The void doesn&apos;t absorb you in some. You can&apos;t destroy blocks in others. The list goes on.
<br>
<br>The way they describe it, it seems like an unlocking, unfolding type game, but it isn&apos;t. It is just the very basic growing mechanics which the game is obtuse about. That&apos;s the limit of the discoveries in the game.
<br>
<br>It is boring. And it is a waste of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starseed-pilgrim/user-reviews?user_review_id=6502267">Expand</a></span>

This garbage looks like the Atari 2600 crap I played when I was 8  give these fools Atari Combat and they would say it was revolutionary, hell lets get the pong out of the basement.  Indie games suck!!!!  Retro games waste the technology we have.  Its like eating a steak and then pulling out potted meat and swearing it is the greatest thing you have ever tasted.  I just don&apos;t get these crappy, juvenile, blast from the past games and all the praise for them.  Mindless games like BIoshock will be the end of PC Games even though it is a 100 on a scale of 1 to 10 compared to this rot which is not saying much.  People bragging on Bioshock make me sick... is this what we have come too.  We are capable of sooo much more now days.  I don&apos;t understand this move to old looking garbage games with graphics that a 5 year old could have produced.  Send this back to Intellivision where it belongs.  These people giving this game good review must have an IQ of 10 and be dropping acid.  I say again when we are capable of producing a game like Skyrim or GTA, who would possible be entertained by this that is not completely brain dead???</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starseed-pilgrim/user-reviews?user_review_id=3493241">Expand</a></span>

<br>There is a magnificent synchrony between the music, the gameplay and the art. They all fit together quite well.

<br>While you have doubt, keep going! It&apos;s rewarding.</span>

The gameplay isn&apos;t really fun, and the puzzles I&apos;ve seen are obscure rather than clever.  The only positive thing I can think of about the game is that it was cheap, although I would&apos;ve passed on it had the reviews better prepared me for what to expect.</span>
