<br>6-8 missions in the game you start seeing the pattern, they all look alike, and they are all on the same spots. So at the camp you just rescued a guy, you now have to find a new weapon schematic, or kill some officer. It gets really repetetive really fast.
<br>(ESCORT MISSIONS!!! NO ONE LIKES THEM!)
<br>The traveltime in this game is horrible, you spend 40% of the game running from a to b, and the time spend flying in your chopper just seems to badly made. You have to watch yourself fly at least 1 minute either from takeoff or landing, this gets old really fast.
<br>It takes about 3-4 minutes to ride from one small camp to another, and the desert/mountain scenario gets old REALLY fast.
<br>
<br>You cant get more than 1 thing in your supply drop, so you have to wait allmost 1 minute from you order something, till it hits the ground, then buy 1 more thing and wait another minute.
<br>
<br>The weapon customization options are pitiful when you finally do unlock them, and most changes to the guns don&apos;t ACTUALLY do ANYTHING. I&apos;ve literally found around three parts that make changes to the base gun model. It&apos;s good for nothing more than painting your guns or adding flashlights though god only knows why the **** you&apos;d bother with those.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s literally Far Cry 2 with even LESS areas to explore. You will find yourself mind numbingly stumbling through the game later on taking down hostiles and picking up resources just because you&apos;ve gotten to a point where you&apos;re going through the motions, the areas are totally uninspired, even if they are gorgeous to look at.
<br>
<br>You do openly have the freedom to approach missions in almost anyway you want,
<br>that is, whenever snake isn&apos;t randomly sliding down inclines that I could easily crawl up myself.
<br>
<br>you cant even rebind the majority of the keys or save the game (even MGS1 let you save more or less freely!).
<br>bad console port.
<br>requested a refund.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5464132">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Seems people will rate anything a 10 with Kojima written on it, because this game is by no means perfect.  The worst offender here is the glitching controls that fight you at every turn whether it&apos;s something as simple as opening a door that takes 3 attempts or trying to take cover behind a wall the game developers forgot to mark as cover.  In those times you aren&apos;t crawling backwards instead of turning around, or climbing on a ledge you are actually allowed to climb the game shines and makes you wish they&apos;d spent more time polishing the terrain traversal instead of the cut scenes because it could have been much better than it is.  Also Assassin&apos;s Creed (yes the first one in 2007) did a better job of implementing horse movement.
<br>
<br>Other than that the story is barely coherent, extremely disjointed and nonsensical,  If you haven&apos;t played the previous games in the series be prepared for a rough time because very little is explained and the game expects you from the outset to care about characters who you&apos;ve only just been introduced to.  There&apos;s very little to explain wtf is going on really apart from a bunch of audio logs.
<br>
<br>Finally this game is a jarring blend of seriousness (like witnessing graphic cold blooded murder of innocents) and the completely ridiculous (such as stealing enemy troops by sending them into orbit via a balloon).  It does not blend well at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5458000">Expand</a></span>

The story line is ridiculous at best. Why is there such a disconnect with reality and a focal plot in this game? The invincible supernatural enemies, for instance: A red head girl in a gas mask wearing a sweater that&apos;s 5 sizes too large for her torso, green eyed zombies in gas masks (again the damn gas masks...), or a hulking man made of lava. This entire subplot makes zero sense, and even after reading up on previous MGS lore, it seems their writing has always been absolutely bonkers and juvenile to begin with. The gameplay is poorly executed, the world is bland and stale, missions are repetitive and boring. Each point of interest on the map is loaded with identical assets and enemies. Stun this guy, kill this guy, click this objective, rinse and repeat. I seriously do not understand the reasoning behind this game&apos;s score. I&apos;m all about open world games (The Witcher 3, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, etc.), but this is a joke.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5488991">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>+Great gameplay
<br>+Good amount of content. Chapter 1, 2 will take around 38-40 hours depending on fast you rush content.
<br>+Graphics are stunning on the PC at 4K
<br>+Good optimization for PC
<br>+I love MGS so much that I&apos;m playing it again on the PS4
<br>+Cinematic render in real time. The blood you have on you will show in the cinematic.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Story was a letdown compared to previous games
<br>-Dangerously very few cinematic scenes. Which is bad because MGS games are known for their story
<br>-Game was unfinished (missing important final boss fight)
<br>-Game can feel repetitive
<br>
<br>So just to clarify, I beat chapter 1 and 2. So I did beat the game so this is an honest review from a die hard MGS fan. I play MGS1, MGS2, MGS3, and MGS4 on their original platforms. I unfortunately did not beat Peace Walker. I didn&apos;t like how that game (Peace Walker) was based on missions instead of the linear flow of the previous games.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the downfall of this game for most die hard MGS fans is that this game was tailored to be mainstream. Instead of a linear fantastic story, you get an open world were the story is sacrificed, yet the gameplay is better than ever. Also, this game feels close to Assassins Creed, being that most missions have the same core (extract, destroy equipment, eliminate target) feel. Also a lot of the main story missions feel too much like a filler mission. Like the filler episodes you&apos;ll get on TV series that are there just to extend a season to 20-30 episodes.
<br>
<br>The biggest insult is that later in the game, &quot;new&quot; missions appear that are basically the exact same missions that you completed before except there will be a new twist. You&apos;ll have to do these new missions or do new side ops to advance the story. So my advice is to keep a good amount of side ops for towards the end of the game.
<br>
<br>Also as of this writing, do not use the female buddy during mission 29 and 42. As of this review there is a critical bug that will corrupt your save file. I used her on mission 29 and didn&apos;t encounter the bug, but I didn&apos;t bother with 42 because mission 42 if I remember correctly was the same mission with a twist.
<br>
<br>Also note that Konami did us dirty. There was suppose to be an epic ending but it wasn&apos;t finished and therefore is not in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5469754">Expand</a></span>

Graphically it&apos;s better than most and the gameplay is pretty good. I have a few quibbles about the play, such as Big Boss&apos; movement - he feels sluggish, almost drunk - and some pretty unrefined gunplay, but these quibbles aren&apos;t really that big of a deal. The narration is ho-hum and sometimes absolutely annoying, especially when getting harassed a bunch at Mother Base. But I could list a dozen games that are infinitely worse in this aspect.
<br>
<br>The problem I&apos;m having with the game is that I&apos;m finding it all so dreadfully BORING. I&apos;ve enjoyed every Metal Gear game since its inception back on the NES, including the movie-fest that was MGS4, but for some reason MGS5 just doesn&apos;t really make me want to keep playing. So far it&apos;s missing the &quot;WOW! DID YOU SEE THAT!&quot; factor. The game features large terrains but they&apos;re are mostly bereft of life outside of your side ops and main mission areas. 15 hours in and I&apos;m already tired of the samey repetition of the game&apos;s mission designs.
<br>
<br>The open world design doesn&apos;t seem all that impressive because most of the time is spent just traversing to predetermined destinations. But it&apos;s sure beautiful to look at. Also, the microtransactions really grate my nerves. I don&apos;t understand how anyone can defend this behavior. I don&apos;t think this is a Kojima design - I&apos;m almost certain this was forced into the game by Konami.

<br>+ extremely well optimized for PC and has good controls: Not a clunky port unlike most games this year
<br>+ intelligent AI that analyzes your play style and adapts to it, making the game challenging (but fun)

<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>- there is in-app purchases with the FOB system, however I never felt obliged to use it at all
<br>- you do go back to the same locations a few times, albeit with different objectives
<br>- if you don&apos;t like cut scenes (I don&apos;t mind them) you will not enjoy the first 1 hour 30 minutes
<br>- very little in the way of character development
<br>- story lacks compared to other MGS games, including Revengeance</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5462692">Expand</a></span>

<br>+Overall great visuals, animations, voice acting, music and sound design...very high production values
<br>+Excellent game play with amazing flexibility that allows you to tackle missions in a number of different ways...action stealth at it&apos;s FINEST
<br>+Intense intro and fantastic cinematics
<br>+&quot;Thematically strong&quot;, but only at certain( and very sparse) points within the game
<br>+Plenty of content, good replayability, interesting motherbase building concept
<br>-Convoluted, unfinished main story that fails to provide a sense of direction through majority of the game, plot holes, badly written dialogue at times, mute protagonist and little character development
<br>-Bland and unimpressive environmental design and world setting...game would hugely benefit from a change of scenery, especially later on in the game
<br>-Same applies to overall mission design, which can also get very tedious and repetitive
<br>-Typical MGS silliness that completely feels out of place with a more serious tone and setting of the game
<br>-Misc: Undeveloped motherbase, lot of unnecessary waiting periods, At times (Noticeable, but not frequent) buggy AI, &quot;Kojima intrusion on the game&quot;( you will know it when you see it, and you will...a LOT), credits rolling after each mission, at times glitchy controls, some minor graphical issues
<br>- In game Micro transactions, PC copies sold with nothing but a Steam installer on it, DRM...little respect for customers
<br>With finishing it, I can safely say that MGS V is a VERY polarizing title...if you are the sort of player who loves games that offer you amazing depth in game play mechanics and creating your own scenarios, then stop reading this and go buy this game...you&apos;re in for one hell of a ride.
<br>But if you&apos;re more interested about the story, characters, atmosphere, world or exploration...you won&apos;t regret passing on this one.
<br>Overall, don&apos;t listen to either &quot;fanboys&quot;,&quot;haters&quot; and ESPECIALLY to the majority of professional &quot;journalists&quot;...neither shows the full picture here. I recommend reading &quot;yellow&quot; reviews here and watching more detailed videos soon coming from independent and mature youtubers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5455124">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>We got an incredibly deep game. And the game dares to do what today is almost dead in gaming - it does not introduce you to every mechanic right away. It lets you explore. It lets you figure out the possibilities by yourself. It rewards you for good ideas, and punishes you for the lack of any.
<br>
<br>This is literally a game when you can restart the same damn mission ten times and do it all in a totally different way. And absolutely everything you do has some meaning. The game REACTS. Enemies are really aware of the threat both in short term and long term - from sending pairs of guards on patrols when a lot of lone ones are mysteriously disappearing to supplying bases with tools that can counter your overused tactics.
<br>
<br>This all makes the gameplay near perfect. It lets you fulfill objectives your own way. I don&apos;t remember any other game that let me chase tanks on the back on my horse while shooting RPG rockets at them, and making sure that their canon wont crosshair me at the same time. And that was absolutely unscripted. I could just lay out some C4 and wait in hiding while blowing up the tanks. I could clear the outpost out of guards and use the mortar to strike the tanks. I could make the tanks stop, for example with leaving any other vehicle or my horse in the middle of the road and steal them for myself while fultoning them into the air. I could do a lot of things. But the most fun thing about it all is the fact that game barely gives you any default way for dealing with objectives. Stop the tank, that&apos;s all. How? Well you&apos;re the boss. You figure it out. And you finish a mission in some creative way, and you actually feel like one.
<br>
<br>This PC port is amazing. I never dared to imagine that anyone can write an engine that looks so amazing and runs so smooth. And it was released the same day for PC and 4 consoles. I mean nowadays it&apos;s almost like a miracle.
<br>
<br>Story is good, but this time it&apos;s told in a very weird way - it&apos;s just very artistic and specific, meaning that it&apos;s a hit or miss. I understand people who don&apos;t like the story. Still, I just can&apos;t shake the feeling that the gameplay trumps it all.
<br>
<br>I think MGS V: Phantom Pain is in many ways a masterpiece that took gaming to the next level in many aspects. I really encourage everyone to try it, even if you&apos;re not MGS fan. This is just too good to miss. GTA V&apos;s world might feel more alive, Witcher&apos;s plot, characters and dialogs might be way better, but it&apos;s Phantom Pain that is the most fun to play and explore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5473014">Expand</a></span>

The environment is essentially lifeless and bland between outposts and the details within the buildings are sparse and lacking. Despite being open world the map (Afghanistan in particular) is very linear and allows only a very restricted travel route along roads (often winding) from one place to the next which often takes forever even by horse.
<br>
<br>The main missions are for the most part repetitive and stale and revisit the same areas over and over (the side missions are absolutely tedious because of this).
<br>
<br>The story is unfinished (given kojima konami split earlier), uneven, jarring, filled with plot holes and can appear mind boggling and laughable at times. The characters are unappealing and poorly developed. You&apos;ll scratch your head many times trying to understand a plot twist or wacky unprovoked character behaviour...
<br>
<br>You&apos;d hope dlc would fix this but it wont given ongoing developer publisher relations and its too widespread and major a problem anyway. A great shame; certainly one of the wackiest and most non sensical games I&apos;ve ever played (even compared to past mgs).
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve stopped midway through chapter 2 now and have done with the game, its that rubbish; try witcher 3 (100 x better than this) or mad max (unrecognised hit) instead or hold your breath till fallout 4 because this game will leave you frustrated....
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t recommend this and I struggle to understand how this has been getting perfect scores (no game is perfect even at the best of times)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5484665">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After great beginning - which is probably the most story driven part of the game - you landed in Afghanistan and there story is just... gone. Your getting one short cutscene and some cinematic action sequence per 3 to 4 hours of gameplay! How is that even possible in Kojima game?! To hell with that... How is that even possible in 2015, after we get such narration-based games like Witcher 3, where almost every single quest has cinematic story to it?!
<br>
<br>I mean **** the story... **** the narration... It is just incredibly bad for the pacing. The moment you get into &quot;open world&quot; game becomes &quot;choose the mission =&gt; go from point A to point B =&gt; do the stealth =&gt; repeat&quot;. It&apos;s almost like Destiny all over again. True, game has some great story-driven moments but they happen between hours upon hours of doing stealth missions all over again. And missions themselves aren&apos;t so much varied!
<br>
<br>The gameplay is great, no doubt about that, and game looks and runs gorgeous but the amount of story per hour and overall pacing make it repetitive after first 4 hours. It&apos;s like Kojima made amazing 10 hour game and then someone stretched it out to 50 hours by putting in completely story-lacked missions with only Ocelot speaking something of little importance to your ear. I can not understand those 10/10 from everyone. It is just impossible how everyone love this game with its repetitive &quot;do the steath mission over and over again&quot; while there are such games like Witcher or the Last of Us out there. It is just crazy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5455686">Expand</a></span>

This has all the long time fans cheering the virtues of Kojima.  These are the same people that say all the other ones are good, when they really aren&apos;t.  This is just horrible, but no less horrible than any in the series.  You may find it odd that I went with a 5.  Had I been reviewing it on it&apos;s own merit, it would be a 2.  Given the comparisons between the others, it&apos;s average for the series.  It&apos;s pretty, no doubt, but it hardly compensates for the poor story and weak characterizations.  It&apos;s like watching a bad B-Movie.  Horribly delivered lines.  Cheesy, predictable story.  I had to check to see if George Lucas was given a screenwriting credit.
<br>
<br>TL:DR, if you liked the series, this one is for you.  If you have never played any of the Metal Gear series, or didn&apos;t like it to begin with, this will make you hate it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5457813">Expand</a></span>

Why is that? First, it&apos;s an open world game. Now mind you, I have nothing against open world games. Open world games can be a blast if done right. Since this is the first time Metal Gear has gone open world, I had high expectations that they&apos;d not only meet but exceed their competitors when it came to creating a world that you actually want to explore. I mean, what is the point of making an open world game if it&apos;s not interesting to traverse? If you&apos;re not going to do that, just make it a linear game like prior games in the series and perfect each space by littering them full of interesting things to see and do. And here is my first complaint with Metal Gear Solid 5: the open world is uninteresting. You have Africa and Afghanistan - both overly brown, void of much life, and little to hold your interest while moving throughout the world. While there are side missions sprinkled throughout the world, the side missions are, sadly enough, entirely filler content that does little to add to the game. Actually, they sort of detract from the game overall. Instead of creating a linear, narrative-driven Metal Gear Solid, they&apos;ve created an open world, one that doesn&apos;t have anything interesting going on in it, and then try to throw in some copy &amp; paste side missions that are incredibly uninteresting and by-the-numbers in their design. But, then, the story must be good, especially if you&apos;re a Metal Gear fan, right? Wrong. For whatever reason, Konami replaced their old voice actors with new, more recognizable actors. For example, instead of David Hayter, we get Kiefer Sutherland. Not only does his performance fail in comparison to Hayter&apos;s, he rarely even talks throughout the game. And here&apos;s another issue: there&apos;s barely any cutscenes compared to the prior Metal Gear&apos;s. While I&apos;ll concede that prior Metal Gear&apos;s may have been overkill when it came to cutscenes, but they&apos;ve swung the pendulum so far from that that there&apos;s not enough now. I do agree that the gameplay here is solid and enjoyable, but when the world it takes place in, the narrative that surrounds, and the extra content is so poor, I can&apos;t give it praise that it simply doesn&apos;t deserve. If you&apos;re a fan of open world games, this will disappoint you. If you&apos;re a fan of Metal Gear Solid&apos;s past, this will disappoint. As a fan of both, I&apos;m floored that people are giving this game high marks. I can only surmise that it&apos;s because people were really hyped about it and now they&apos;re forgiving issues that they&apos;ll soon come to dislike. As is the case very often with people who play games and people who write about them, they sometimes overlook glaring issues when they release and then only come to grips with the fact that the game wasn&apos;t all that years down the road. Metal Gear Solid V is one such game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5471201">Expand</a></span>

I have now lost my save games twice after putting in god knows how many hours and this is not related to the quiet bug at all as i have not even reached the point in either play through where i can use her yet, and Konami seems to not even be acknowledging that there is a far bigger issue regarding save games. I am giving this game a zero as a wake up call to all game developers out there to not release unfinished, untested and broken games because quite frankly i have had a gut fool. Im sure that this one review is not going to make any difference amongst the near universal praise that this game has been recieving which i find unbelievable. if i was being honest the game is 7 out of 10 for me as the main structure of the game is extremely repetitive and honestly it feels empty and divoid of any richness if that makes any sense. I also have to point out the controls which are just bad, why on earth do i have two different sprint buttons for on foot and on hoarse? it dosent make any sense and I&apos;m not even going to go into the cover system which again, is just broken and seems to have a mind of it&apos;s own. And lastly for a metal gear game the story is very lacking and poorly told.

<br>
<br>Game starts with the impression your going to be handheld much like you would see in a call of duty game where you have to follow generic guy A cause he can only open doors.  However that is not the case and soon you will find yourself in a very fun and brilliant sandbox gameplay.  You&apos;re missions are a sandbox style, but don&apos;t think it&apos;s  a skyrim style free roam, where you deploy to do a mission is a huge section of area that you can freely do whatever kind of like FarCry.
<br>
<br>Lets see negative is hard to find, but I would say the constant reminder that its a hideo kojima game gets a bit rediculous as only extreme fans of the franchise would even know who he was a month ago.  I suppose some of the odd characters you encounter leave you wondering wtf is the point of that.  Overall amazing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5453189">Expand</a></span>

Graphics? Breathtaking. Cinematics? Breathtaking. Excelent missions, super well optimized ( 4K anyone?! ) and deep characters. I will give it a 9 though because the walking annimation is kinda funny.</span>

The further you get the more game mechanics get opened up to you as well.  The base you start building becomes a multiplayer arena which others try to infiltrate your customized defenses and vice versa.  This alone is a very original and fun experience.</span>

<br>The cutscenes are epic as **** the characters are deep and interesting.Troy baker done a damn voice job again,Mother base let you keep your own crew to develop weapon or go on missions.The enemy AI is pretty smart.They know how to find you and eliminate you.There is so much fun messing around in the battlefield and mother base.The whole game is just addictive that will makes you don&apos;t want to leave you computer for weeks.
<br>Still exploring the game,but in my scale this game is already the best game I played this year,even better than Witcher3(I cannot believe).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5445477">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay mechanics are some of the best I&apos;ve seen in a third person action game. It&apos;s so amazingly fluid and the graphics look amazing. I am running it on high 1080p on my GTX 760, and it runs flawlessly. Constant 60fps without problems.

I never played it before, until I got my hand on The Phantom Pain. Boy let me tell you it&apos;s kinda a fruitless endeavor: i.e. repetitive missions, a messy story-line development, lack of even some basic logic and lack of consistency.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll tell a bit on the lack of consistency. Basically you can develop new weapons and gear as you progress. However, this game rewards stealth/non-killing style. But the things you can develop are almost all meant for killing, often with a loud bang. So throughout the game you&apos;re stuck with the few basic things if you want to go the non-lethal way. But then... you have missions where you practically have no choice but to kill massively, often with loud bangs involved. So what&apos;s the point right? You can&apos;t be consistent as in, say, the Deus Ex franchise.
<br>
<br>Then there&apos;s the repetition. You can&apos;t develop meaningful things for a long time, so you&apos;re doing repetitive missions with the same old tranquilizer pistol (if you go non-lethal) for a quite a while, whether it&apos;s a level 1 or an upgraded level 2 pistol. Nothing changes really.
<br>
<br>Look, the graphics and motions are done nice. But it&apos;s the one and only good thing. But frankly it&apos;s a big grindfest in a neat environment which demands too much time to travel from one spot to another. Finally there&apos;s the controls, it&apos;s a bad port (unfinished) from a PlayStation system. For example the mouse doesn&apos;t even work in the Menu UI (only keys can be used to change settings) and in-game you need to press awkward key-combinations to get things done, like making cool moves. There are a lot of annoyances like that,including unfinished walk-paths and hiding spots. Even hiding is weird implemented: for some reason hiding crouched behind a wall is more hidden than just being crouched behind a wall (lol wtf?). But some spots aren&apos;t finished marking by the programmers as hiding-places, so you&apos;re wondering why you can&apos;t &quot;hide&quot; behind this massive boulder for example - but you can hide behind this tiny wall.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a storyline, but for the un-initiated it&apos;s almost entirely un-penetrable.From what I understand, even for die-hard MSG fans the story is nonsensical. One has to listen to endless audio-tapes (no video), and then try to make something coherent out of it.
<br>
<br>What can I say, this game really needs to move up 2 good notches before I could give it an minimal acceptable 6/10 rating. Hence the rating of 4/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=6921608">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Environments looks great. The weather system and day / night cycles changes the way you approach a base. The terrain has good use of vertical design. The FOX Engine works great on all next-gen platforms. I played the PS4 and this PC versions. Between both versions more than 200 hs. Still playing both for whiiiiiiiiiiiiilee!
<br>- The main advantage of this PC version is the lighting. Some shaders respond better to specular maps. The texture work between PS4 and PC at least looks kind of the same range. There&apos;re some critical closeups to textures like some Diamond Dogs logos and Quiet sniper riffle that looks awful on both. But aside that the game looks outstanding and runs great even on &quot;Borderless Fullscreen&quot; mode ;) It had some stuttering issues and problems with alpha maps of particles during day one but they are solved.
<br>- The game adapts to your gameplay style. It changes the experience every time you replay a mission.
<br>- Master Miller rules!
<br>- If you liked MGS Peace Walker this is a great evolution.
<br>- The buddies of course! D.D. Is Love!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=7089400">Expand</a></span>

<br>What i mean is that the game itself is great. It has a very nice world, the fighting aspect is perfectly done, different types of weapons, a lot of enemies everywhere to deal with and some nice quests. But, and this is what i think gives a Metal Gear it&apos;s credit is the lack of a well directed story: Metal Gear V is in some ways making the player disconnect of the main story, dealing with non-interesting side-quests, alternating with some epic moments on the story.
<br>
<br>Graphically the game is gorgeous. The world is beautifully created, and the fauna makes it even more interesting to explore. One bad aspect of the game is that the world is, in some moments, empty. There are only soldiers, not a simple civil basement, everything is about enemies bases, and nothing else. No interaction with any npc, no interaction apart of some videos with the &quot;allies&quot; you have.
<br>
<br>This is why, given the chance to score the game, i decided to give it a 7. Good graphics, soundtrack, fighting/shooting style. Correct story for a Metal Gear (very far away from what we saw on the 4 previous main games), but very bad connected. This is not what a Metal Gear game should be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=7154614">Expand</a></span>

<br>- mind blowing  amount of weapons, tools and other stuff to play around.
<br>- fairly decent enemy AI
<br>- good and challenging stealth mechanics
<br>- some nice humor here and there, some seriously shocking moments as well
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- open world here is a joke, empty and absolutely not utilized -  base, few outposts here ant there and nothing in between.
<br>- environment reuse - you do main mission in certain base/outpost, then you do like 5 side ops in the same base. This is dreadful design in open world game
<br>- starting points are ridiculous, you land like 1000+ meters away from your destination, just to run that distance in completely empty world. It&apos;s so pointless.
<br>- some serious cliches in the plot where you think &quot;wtf snake..? (or I should say wtf Kojima?!?)
<br>- game goes downhill in its second half (first half is way more solid).
<br>- ridiculous mission rankings, where most important thing is mission time, which conflicts with your interest of expanding the base (grinding materials)
<br>- online FOB&apos;s suck because too much cheaters with unlimited resources (like 500k of each material) and wtf microtransactions..
<br>
<br>Conlusion: it&apos;s still a decent game and best stealth game in a long time, but at the same time it&apos;s far far away from a masterpiece (critics must have been drunk, or did the reviews based on like 5 missions). If this wins GOTY, that just proves how absurd gaming market has became. Also, F*** Konami</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5490670">Expand</a></span>

<br>Aside from that, the game is regularly boring, completely hollow, and a fa&#xE7;ade for what should have been a linear game. mother base is but a tech tree you can walk around and get people to salute you, nothing more nothing less.
<br>the world just isn&apos;t real enough. they promised all sorts of different tactics, but nothing. there is no benefit to daytime attacks, AI can instantly report your location to every surrounding soldier, even if you shoot them before the radio reaches their mouth.
<br>the start was fantastic, then suddenly you are dumped into two boring maps with little going on. think farcry 2, and you will have pretty much nailed every element of MGSV: TPP, except MGS has more dart guns.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5495231">Expand</a></span>

<br>Controversial elements:
<br>
<br>+/- Motherbase (for some it might be a distraction for other it might be a cool new feature)
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>
<br>- No closure for MGS fans
<br>
<br>- Pacing sucks. The game revolves around gameplay only and the story has been sidelined to such an extent that it doesnt really matter how good the story line is. Cutscenes have been replaced by audio tapes that you listen to when you want. Do the first 20 missions and ask yourself how much has the actual story progressed and how it unfolded.
<br>
<br>- Forgettable villain
<br>
<br>- Repetitive main/side quests (Extract targets or Kill them thats pretty much the whole game). And sometimes you will find yourself doing similar missions at the exact same site. Whats up with this sh*t.
<br>
<br>- Lack of indoor stealth
<br>
<br>- Forgettable boss battles (Final boss is like a bad joke. Infact all the boss battles is this game are nothing compared to the battles from previous MGS games)
<br>
<br>- It is obviously a work in progress
<br>
<br>- Bland open world
<br>
<br>- First ever game i have played that asks you to replay the story missions on hard mode as a part of the main campaign
<br>
<br>- O and the &quot;Boss&quot; feels like he is Kaz&apos;s errand boy. All the high hopes of MGS fans to meet the legendary boss will be crushed to mush. His attitude shows that he really doesn&apos;t care about the story or the events of GZ because.....(the answer lies in mission 46).
<br>
<br>- The secret ending is a big Fu*k You to all the MGS fans. I am sorry but i cant see it any other way.
<br>
<br>This game doesn&apos;t deserve to be a part of the MGS series. One cannot just possibly praise this title as an MGS game simply because the gameplay is awesome while everything else great about the series is sacrificed.
<br>
<br>In short:
<br>Would i recommend this game: Yes (purely because its ultimately Kojima&apos;s MGS and the gameplay ofcourse)
<br>Is this game a disappointment: Yes (because of pretty much everything else)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5501043">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Stealth is reliable, but you can also viably play &apos;rambo mode&apos; if you have good aim.
<br>
<br>Probably has the best intro section to a game I&apos;ve ever seen.
<br>
<br>Runs at solid 60 fps (never dips) on max settings at 1920x1080 with a GTX 970. No mouse acceleration or smoothing, so aiming with the mouse feels good.
<br>
<br>Bad:
<br>
<br>Finished the game, and the story feels weak compared to previous games. Some characters, like the main antagonist (who you&apos;d think would be really important), have very little character development. The most interesting character in the game, Quiet, hardly gets any focus.
<br>
<br>A lot of the missions feel repetitive. Many of them are &quot;kill this target at this outpost&quot; or &quot;rescue these prisoners at this outpost&quot; with a few lines of story dialogue added in. Since it&apos;s an open world game, there&apos;s lots of filler content in between actual plot.
<br>
<br>Many things feel needlessly inconvenient. For example, your helicopter will take off right as you land on Motherbase, so you end up needing to call it back 20 seconds later when you want to leave Motherbase. Why doesn&apos;t the helicopter just stay landed until I want to leave?
<br>
<br>An option to manually save would have been nice, sometimes you forget when the last autosave happens so you are scared to exit the game and lose progress.
<br>
<br>Usage requirements are annoying and kind of ridiculous. For example, lvl 3 helicopter costs ~16 times more money to call down than the lvl1 helicopter, even though they do the same thing.
<br>
<br>No anti-cheat on FOB multiplayer and everything is client side, so there are godmode hacks and 1shot kill hacks. From what people have said, you are forced to build FOB if you are connected online after mission 22, so even if you want to play single player only, it will constantly get invaded. There is a &apos;disconnect&apos; option in the game menu which puts you offline, but every time you start the game you are automatically logged in and synced with the server, so the FOB damages ends up affecting your single player game anyway. The solution to skip this part of the game is to block the game with your firewall.
<br>
<br>60 fps is great, but since it is capped at 60 fps, if you have a high refresh rate monitor you won&apos;t be able to utilize it fully. No mouse control in menus or iDroid. There&apos;s no audio options, so you can&apos;t mute the game music or make the dialog louder. And even with no controller plugged in, I still get controller prompts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5472543">Expand</a></span>

<br>
Now, to begin with, what are you in for?

<br>I&apos;d recommend the game to anyone but there&apos;s simply things that are so criminally bad and awkward in this game that one should know before purchasing it.
<br>
<br>Now, to begin with, what are you in for?
<br>Before you can do anything you are in for a ~90 minutes intro mission with various cutscenes and not much fun in terms of gameplay. Afterwards the real game starts.
<br>Basically you have an open world with various main and side missions that tell you to infiltrate some base, however you&apos;d like to do that then, finish an objective, and get out again.
<br>In order to get in and out you can call in a heli that can pick you up and drop you off at various locations around the target - which is pretty atmospheric, even after doing it a hundred times.
<br>
<br>On top of that you have the opportunity to upgrade your mother base and compete with others online. You hire soldiers that defend your base, and you can attack other bases. Never tried that though.
<br>
<br>Now, if that sounds fun to you, and it is, here&apos;s the problems:
<br>Controls:
<br>The controls are basically good, the problem is more the reaction your controls have in the gameworld.
<br>For instance, if you push forward against a wall, like only 30% of the time he actually attaches to the wall. It doesn&apos;t work with all walls either. Some do, some don&apos;t... some sometimes do.
<br>
<br>The other issue is with climbing terrain. I&apos;m not talking Skyrim laziness level: I&apos;m trying to climb High Hrothgar from the Northeast in a straight line. I&apos;m talking: there&apos;s a 20% angle upwards, you can&apos;t go... sometimes you can though. Also sometimes you can hit E to climb up a wall, sometimes you can&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Missions:
<br>If you thought Skyrim was lazy in terms of recycling locations you better fasten your seatbelt because this game brings a whole new quality to this.
<br>To begin with, yes - locations are recycled and used for various missions and side missions. No problem.
<br>
<br>But, even missions themselves are recycled. To be perfect, pretty much everything in the second chapter is doing chapter 1 missions (same cutscenes btw.) on ridiculously hard. Like: you can&apos;t get detected or, we just make that really hard bossfight a tick harder to make the game longer. Where we are at it...
<br>
<br>Bossfights:
<br>This is the number one atrocity in MGS5 Phantom Pain. I&apos;ve never seen anything like it. The last MGS I played was the first MGS on the PSX. And those bossfights were hard, but original and had some tactic to them.
<br>
<br>Here though the tactic looks like this:
<br>Skulls: 4 guys jumping  around that take ~30 Bazooka shots each that will grant you hours and hours of frustration. (On Extreme (Mission 42) - one mistake, you&apos;re dead... which sets you back around 30 minutes if you almost just made it)
<br>Quiet: That one was fun actually, basically it was a sniper duel in a valley. Even on Extreme I enjoyed it.
<br>Sniper Skulls: That one was okayish, basically you fight against 4 weaker versions of Quiet. Still not fun. Just aim at them, let them shoot, dock, then aim - take your shot. They&apos;ll run, and after a few seconds they go back to their old position. Rinse and repeat.
<br>Sahelanthropus: Yea, basically shoot your bazooka in his chest for 20 minutes... towards the end a single shot from him instakills you though.
<br>Eli: Since you&apos;re also in Africa there ought to be child soldiers... with a white kid commander that is a boss.... basically he jumps around, attacks you, quicktime... then he runs away again. Chase after him, rinse and repeat. Oh and hit him with your tranqus in between. (For whatever reason kids are almost immune to tranqus and take 3 headshots (regular kid soldiers, not this one))
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>The story is badly implemented into the game. The fact that there is a chapter 2 and that it sends you back to story missions from chapter 1 on hard should be proof enough for that.
<br>Still, whenever the story progresses, it&apos;s interesting.
<br>
<br>Quiet - yes she deserves her own section:
<br>Basically she&apos;s a a really likeable, but underdeveloped and hypersexualized character that deserved more. It feels more like after the sniper battle you tamed her.
<br>Having done her whole storyline it feels like this character was written this way solely for the purpose of trolling Anita Sarkeesian.
<br>
<br>Quiet is still a great buddy and I wished they did more with her.
<br>
<br>Small positive stuff:
<br>Soundtrack is great 80&apos;s music and you can collect tapes you can then listen to on your walkman.
<br>Extracting persons and animals is a fun, comical feature.
<br>AI will adapt to your tactics - in my case they now all wear helmets and there&apos;s heavy units all over the place.
<br>Game is 100% worth replaying and you can always just replay single missions.
<br>You find a stray pup at some point that then gets bigger and trained and he can accompany you at missions.
<br>
<br>Bottom line - buy it, play it - it&apos;s great. But oh so flawed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5484983">Expand</a></span>

But I think I can still reasonably evaluate the game experience
<br>
<br>+ Graphics, scenery and everything is top notch.
<br>+ Combat system and movement is a little bit clunky, but it is not terrible
<br>+ The story I actually do not mind that much. There are some weird things going on, but I get the gist of it. You were once glorious private army leader who fell hard due to some powerful enemies, you are now trying to rebuild and have your vengeance along the way. All in all I think the starting story sequence in the hospital was well done and a really well done
<br>+ Base management is a plus. It fits with the whole rebuilding theme and I like it. I think it is done as well as it could given it is a console port
<br>
<br>Now unfortunately we get to the first and big minus: sandbox mode. At least for me it is very repetitive and boring. Sneak into the guard post/base/village, put everyone to sleep by tranquilizer/takedowns, chute everybody and everything out and rinse/repeat. I am not that far into the game and I cleared all the villages/guard posts several times over. I know where the guards are, I know the layout of everything by heart. Now you get something new every now and then (blow up some tanks and such), but it is not enough.
<br>
<br>Now I have to say that I am a little bit spoiled by having over 100 hours of Witcher 3 played. But the comparisons are not misplaced. While witcher lacks basebuilding concept, it gets everything else right. The world is large but also alive. You get separate story-lines that do not feel repetitive. You get a change in scenery (caves, open world, city streets even water) - in MGS it is same old.
<br>
<br>I am in a state where I still thing MGS is a good game but I now play it in bursts - log in, do one or two missions for hour or so, get fed up with doing same stuff, log out and go play other games. The game is not compelling for me, it lacks the element where you are curious what is over there or where this quest leads.
<br>
<br>If there is any comparison, I would say MGS V feels like FPS version of &quot;Mount and Blade&quot;, only without Mods that freshen the game up and with less compelling combat (at least for me).
<br>
<br>PS:
<br>
<br>- Also a minor point, what the hell is this business with the crate? I can totally eat floating girl-ghost appearing from nowhere and hurling large boulders around with her mind. I can enjoy indestructible guy set on fire going around and killing everyone or packs of some cyber  soldiers pursuing me in Afghanistan. I can even eat sending T-72s on a parachute to stratosphere  while listening to Phil Collings from my walkman. But I refuse to go around in hidden in a crate lunging attacks on unsuspecting russian  soldiers. It totally breaks my suspension of disbelief (fortunatelly I don&apos;t have to use it).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5493130">Expand</a></span>

<br>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is not only a benchmark for modern stealth games, but also for it&apos;s beautiful look and masterful gameplay, yet the story is a little bit linear.
<br>
<br>First, I&apos;d like to start off with the graphics and optimization. It is terrific, I&apos;m running this on an i7 6700k with 2 GTX 780&apos;s on SLI, with 100 fps on max settings. And the game truly is beautiful, ranging from the vast landmarks of South Africa to Afghanistan, especially the specular maps under rain. Venom Snake himself is an incredibly intricate model with detail across all his face to under his shoes. The weapons are also look nice, but lack a little bit when moving around in first person mode.
<br>
<br>2. The gameplay, which is the definite highlight of this game. While this game is technically defined as a stealth game, it also features alot of real time action, but that&apos;s not what I want to talk about. I want to talk about the tactical genius of the designers. In some missions, there will be varying weather conditions from rain that allows you to mask your footsteps, allowing you to move faster closer to enemies, and in Afghanistan, I noticed that there were slight sand storms that actually masked me, which really did allow me to move in plain sight undetected. I also noticed the silenced gunplay is another strong point of Metal Gear Solid 5, Cause if you shoot with a silenced pistol at enemies that are too close together, the other enemy will hear the silencer and the base will go into alert status. I haven&apos;t even gone into depth of the massive open world/linear sandbox to approach the mission in any specific way you want. You can use an RPG to blast your way through, approach silently, using only CQC or Silenced Pistols to slowly make your way through, or take enemies down from a distance using long range rifles making it easier to sweep through the area.
<br>
<br>3. A weird problem I have with this game is actually the missions. After a while, you will start to notice recycled areas, as in one mission you may have to infiltrate the area and rescue a hostage, and in another mission it may just be the exact same area that has been recycled for another purpose. But the best mission and most emotional mission was Shining Lights, Even in death, mission 43. I don&apos;t want to spoil anything if anyone has not played the game so try to avoid that.
<br>
<br>4. I would just like to note on the story, as I have never really been into the Metal Gear series, but this game had me reading the stories of Venom Snake and the real Big Boss on the wiki to understand what was going on, and while the ending was rather poor in my opinion, that is not the worst problem I have with this game. I understand this is probably how Kojima tried to mean it, but the story just feels so linear, because you get 1 or 2 cutscenes every mission, but they don&apos;t really mean anything, and the story only progresses as you complete missions and get to the ending.
<br>
<br>Verdict: I&apos;m rating this 9/10 not because of the story or the repetitive missions. If I really took them into account it would be an 8 or 7. I&apos;m rating this 9 because of the brilliant and refined gameplay. The game is well polished and good looking, which only adds to the overall stealth experiences. But the question remains: is the game worth it&apos;s price of $60 USD? Well,  if you&apos;ve played the other MGS games and want a story driven action stealth game, then maybe wait for a sale, such as now, but if you&apos;re just looking for a fun game with masterful gameplay then buy it.
<br>
<br>I believe this game is the future of modern stealth games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5943113">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So, in a nutshell: This game hit me by surprise, and is in my top 3 of the most enjoyable games I got and played in 2015.
<br>Before I go on: I was never deeply into the whole series. I did play one MGS on the PS1 like 15 years ago or so, and liked that, but I never played any of the others, and at first wasn&apos;t interested in this game. I bought it on impulse, and haven&apos;t regretted it at all.
<br>
<br>I wrote that so you&apos;d know where I am coming from regarding the series. That&apos;s why I might not share the disappointment many of the fans of the series seem to feel, which is reflected in many of the negative reviews.
<br>
<br>Now, let&apos;s go through the categories:
<br>
<br>Graphics: They look great, and the game performed flawlessly on my system, first on a cheapo GT 730, then on a GTX 960 with 4 gigs of Ram (on an i7-4790, 16 gigs of Ram, W7). I am impressed by the optimization, really, especially compard to some of the other triple A-releases I tried this year, which had some big issues at first.
<br>
<br>Story: Yep, I was confused. I didn&apos;t know the backstory from the other games, and even though I did watch some explanation-vids on Youtube, I am sure I still don&apos;t know or understand half of the story. The story in this one is a bit convoluted, but that, for once, didn&apos;t bother me much. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I usually care quite a bit about the story in the games I play, yet in this one, I didn&apos;t mind the sometimes confusing twists or the fact I didn&apos;t know the background of a lot fo the characters.
<br>The &quot;listen to tapes to get more background&quot; was an unusual device, some call it lazy. I actually liked it, as it was different from watching a ton of cutscenes (and there are quite a few in this game as well!) or reading tons of text. I actually LIKED listening to those interrogations on tapes while being on missions
<br>
<br>Gameplay: FUN!! You can kinda decide on what style you prefer to play. Of course, highest ranks are given when you go mainly for stealth, and of course, to obtain more and better soldiers, you need to tranq them. But you can also try to go serial killer a lot of times.
<br>I went for mostly tranq weapons. I spent a lot for research, yet didn&apos;t unlock all of the improvements.
<br>
<br>Some of the missions were VERY challenging, VERY, as I was trying to get the best possible rank. If you don&apos;t have the patience, you can wing a mission and return later to retry and get a better rating.
<br>
<br>LEt me point this out: YES, in act 2, you get a lot of hard mode-versions of older missions. BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THESE!! I didn&apos;t do ANY of them and still unlocked the whole story up to the very end. These, I think, are mainly for the extra challenge (going in without any gear, obtaining it in the field, total stealth etc) and possibly for more resources.
<br>
<br>Once you get Quiet, things get easier, as she can be very helpful, sometimes even IMBA, esp. if you hand her a tranq sniping gun.
<br>Yes, a lot of the missions were rather repetitive, but I didn&apos;t mind much. I did a story mission or two, then did a couple of quick side missions, rinse and repeat.
<br>Didn&apos;t bother with the FOB missions, and I don&apos;t think I will.
<br>
<br>I played the game with an Xbox controller for Windows, and the controls felt great, especially compared to some other new games (Witcher 3, FO4).
<br>
<br>Before I end this: Yes, apparently the game had issues. There was some drama with the studio and Kojima, and some parts seem unfinished or too rough.
<br>
<br>However, here is my point: I didn&apos;t expect to like this, or even buy it. I bought it on impulse, and am glad I did. It gave me more than 100 hrs of enjoyment, and that, to me, is what matters most. Are there things that could be improved? Sure, btu aren&apos;t there always?
<br>I enjoyed those 100+ hrs, and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if I start over at some point.
<br>This, together with W3, is my favorite game released in 2015, and I am glad I made that spontaneous purchase =)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=6090347">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. &quot;Good luck, boss&quot;.
<br>2. Put everyone to sleep (some variety included)
<br>3. Fulton everyone
<br>4. Mission complete.
<br>
<br>Of course, there is a good amount of variety, bot core parts don&apos;t change a bit. And you&apos;ll have to replay the story missions again. They will be more difficult: remember that there are no difficulty &quot;sliders&quot; and no quicksaves.
<br>
<br>Sandbox, base building, online (fob part): it&apos;s bad because it consists of 10% chopper, 25% fulton, 15% boring objectives, 40% boring terrain, 10% gameplay. Grinding soldiers for motherbase feels like mmo.
<br>
<br>In the end I want to say that if we&apos;d excluded repetative parts it would&apos;ve been very short game. 7/10 is the maximum for this Hideo Kojima game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5496782">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Best and most polished gameplay I&apos;ve seen in a long time.
<br>-100+ hours worth of (mostly) worthwhile content.
<br>-Great Chapter I, story is mostly nice.
<br>-Excellent, meticulously crafted cut-scenes, even if the cinematographer at times tried too hard to make greatness and ended up botching some scenes.
<br>-Amazing graphics, great environments, and surprisingly good level design for an open-world game.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Missing a lot of story. Lots of plot holes, unfinished stuff. Half of chapter 2 and the entire chapter 3 missing from the game.
<br>-The story, even without the cuts, is often times contradictory and nonsensical. For a game that&apos;s supposed to explain the Big Boss&apos;s fall from grace, it does nothing of the sorts. Instead of acting as a bridge between Metal Gear and Peace Walker, it acts as the bomb that blew up the hypothetical bridge: it creates more plot holes than it solves... actually it doesn&apos;t solve any, it just creates new ones.
<br>-Some important story points are told trough audio logs. It&apos;s jarring. A cutscene would&apos;ve been better.
<br>-Motherbase is gigantic and completely empty. Outside of some cutscenes, there&apos;s nothing going on there. There are only 2 indoors locations, and only one of them has anything interesting going on.
<br>-You build an awesome tank, and do nothing with it. Yeah, there was supposed to be something there, but it got cut from the game, like so many other things.
<br>-Controls are wonky at best. Shootings&apos; fine, great even, but free-running, climbing, stances, cover are all horrible. Often times Snake gets up, instead of crawling, he goes out of cover, instead of moving a bit to the side. etc. There&apos;s also no mouse support in menus, which is a pain, and for some reason or the other, the button prompts are some time for the controller and some time for KBM. Oh and every single action in the game is bound to the &quot;e&quot; button. So a lot of times you&apos;ll struggle to get the guy to do what you want him to do.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game has a lot of problems. I could sit here all day listing them. But the short version of it all? I&apos;ve had a tone of fun with it. It&apos;s dumb, and you&apos;ll get angry when you finish it, but the journey there might just be worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5481841">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For a game that was supposed to bridge the gap between the original Metal Gear games and the MGS series&apos;s later titles, there is very little storytelling or character development here. The only character with real growth is Huey, who is a piece of trash that you (and everyone in the game) grows to hate. Sure, Huey might be the best written character in the series, but it doesn&apos;t excuse how everyone else is fueled by revenge and has their arc concluded with revenge. There are also few cutscenes, with most of the meat of the story being told through Codec calls- *ahem* -I mean, cassette tapes. The game also takes a sharp turn from GZ&apos;s tone, with Skull Face going from being a creepy, mysterious horror one step ahead of you to being a caricature of a bond villain (who exposes his whole scheme to you during an awkwardly long caravan ride to his &quot;real&quot; base). The worst part is a lot of the story is repeated; you seem to be expected to listen to all of the cassette tapes to get the full story (imagine how bad previous games would&apos;ve been if you were expected to pay attention to every non-critical Codec call!) and yet the conversations on them are often repeated or paraphrased during the main game! The game also fails to conclude all of its threads appropriately; most notoriously, a cut Mission 51 has shown up on Youtube which concludes a cliffhanger that happens in the middle of Chapter 2. The fact that such an important mission was left undone makes me think that this game was unfinished and rushed out the door, despite being in development for a supposed 5 years.
<br>
<br>There is a lot that could be nitpicked about this game but the biggest issue I have with it is the story. The MGS games have always been known for their story, with lengthy cutscenes and frequent Codec calls crafting a believable parallel world to ours. Snake (despite being voiced by Jack Bauer) is almost a silent protagonist in 5, who doesn&apos;t respond to radio communications (the replacement for Codec calls) or even talk to non Diamond Dog characters outside of Mother Base. Even during the ridiculous caravan ride with Skull Face he doesn&apos;t say a word during Skull Face&apos;s exposition. Snake had some ridiculous writing in the past (often repeating lines and adding a question mark on the end to comical effect) but it makes no sense for him to play the mute during key story points. I understand that Kojima wanted players to insert themselves as Snake this time around... But isn&apos;t that what players have always done in this series? People wanted to play as Big Boss and watch his descent into madness as advertised, not play as a silent body double. This might&apos;ve been an attempt to reproduce the twist that Kojima created with Raiden in MGS2; however, that twist was acceptable because it happened near the beginning of the game. This game&apos;s twist just seems like a big &quot;screw you&quot; to the fans.  All of this is on top of Kojima&apos;s obnoxious handwavium of choice, VOCAL CHORD PARASITES, which have effectively replaced MGS4&apos;s nanomachines as being the cause and effect for everything supernatural that happens.
<br>
<br>MGS5 could&apos;ve been a good game had it ended with Chapter 1, could&apos;ve been a great game with better writing, and could&apos;ve been an amazing game with more series staples (more &amp; better bosses, more (!) cutscenes, more character development). Things might change in the future; Konami might just be holding out on later chapters to milk the player base for DLC money (MB coins are already disgustingly distorting the singleplayer experience). As it currently stands, I&apos;m going to get everything I can out of this game because its money already spent and its decently playable. However, because of all the glaring issues previously mentioned, plus broken online components such as MGO3 being delayed to January 2016 while consoles get it Oct. 6th and FOBs being invadable while offline, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Both MGR and even the &quot;paid demo&quot; Ground Zeroes were honestly better Metal Gear Solid games than this embarrassing train wreck of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5480267">Expand</a></span>

<br>They tried so hard to make a visually splendid game and they got the visuals right.
<br>But, they forgot the basics and that&apos;s movement.
<br>Movement in this game is buggy, your player gets stuck on things, the &apos;e&apos; button climbing option sometimes takes time to light up.
<br>This poor movement and interaction with the environment completely ruins game play as you are trying to be stealthy and then you are seen by the enemy simply because your player is &apos;stuck&apos; on a small rock, trying to get through an opening in a wall or trying to climb something.
<br>
<br>And, the equipment menus are a pain, the instructions and manual were thought out by a lazy 5 year old, so often I had to google just how to play the game.
<br>
<br>So this game wants you to play stealthy, but its so poorly ported that its glitches and bugs get you seen by the enemy far too often turning the game into a first person shooter, and this game is Not a good shooter.
<br>
<br>Trying to shoot over a ledge in the prone position is next to impossible, I have fallen over/off ledges trying to move forward enough so your first person gun sights are enabled when prone. Iit&apos;s just stupid frustrating.
<br>
<br>The developers should have got the basics right before making it look so pretty.
<br>After 5 missions and 6 side ops I obtained a refund !
<br>Far Cry and Dying Light play far more fluidly than this piece of clunky junk.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5810947">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is absolutely trash when it comes to PC, the controls are **** beyond retardness, the gameplay itself is really boring and dull and it feels like you are playing a gamecube &quot;open world&quot; game.
<br>
<br>The game starts out complete **** aswell. 30 sec sequence, 10 sec gameplay,30 sec sequence, 10 sec gameplay,30 sec sequence, 10 sec gameplay, etcetc.
<br>
<br>I have no idea what the hype is all about but I would not advice ANYONE to pay for **** like this.

But there is one thing that you should keep in mind - publisher of this game is Konami. And **** Konami! It&apos;s last Kojima game in this series and looks like he part ways with Konami not on best terms. And that after that story with Keiichiro Toyama. It&apos;s the same Konami that ported last gen version of PES 2016 on PC... So it makes me wonder what is really a Kojima&apos;s fault and what was just cut, scrapped and rushed by Konami. And **** Konami again. For example, according to latest news data miners discovered parts of act 3 that not in game and it should be it&apos;s real ending.
<br>Also be prepared that this game is nothing like any MGS before. No more long cinematic cutscenes, no more just plot missions...it&apos;s more like Assasin&apos;s Creed now than MGS of old.
<br>
<br>So graphics and optimization. It&apos;s looking good. Really good. Not like there are something incredible. Game take part in Afghanistan and Central Africa so most thing you will see are desert, rocks, savannah and that things are kind of barren. As they are IRL. But looks certainly nice. Plus view distance is incredible. Models are ok. Could be better, especially vehicles, but will do. And all that runs very smooth.
<br>
<br>As for gameplay. I see some people complain about controls. I agree that controls in menus done really poor for PC. Like pressing 1 or 3 to switch tabs. And absolutely no mouse support. WTF is that? But in-game i don&apos;t have much problems with controls. And i still prefer keyboard and mouse even with Xbox360 controller plugged into my PC. My biggest problem with this game is difficulty level. In previous MGS games i was dying a lot. In Phantom Pain it&apos;s such a rare thing. It&apos;s really easy. Get your trusty DD, card boxes and any enemy stronghold will fall before you. DD will spot every enemy, mine, hostage or other things from range of 100+ meters. Even behind walls, in buildings and so on. So if you pay attention enemy can&apos;t sneak upon you. And if you not fancy with all this sneaking around it&apos;s a valid option now. You can dress in battle dress (some kind of heavy protection gear), get you D-Walker with Gatling gun, some machine gun or rocket launcher and go in Rambo style with all guns blazing. In plot missions that could result in some score loss (for every hit you take and base alert) if you even care about it but in side ops there is absolutely no downside for that.
<br>Now to the Mother Base and everything about it. It&apos;s fun for some time. You run around looking for good soldiers, materials, specialists. Building it. But that quickly wears off. There is little point in it. Mostly it&apos;s about how fast you invent some weapon or gadget. And sooner or later you get there anyway. And that &quot;sooner&quot; require too much effort for a little reward. So this whole affair looks like a lot of wasted efforts in my opinion. As for FOBs - just avoid it.
<br>Open world. It&apos;s nonsense and have no value. Simple as that. As i said before it&apos;s fun in the beginning for some time. You run around, capture poor Russian soldiers and force em to work on your, rescue sheeps, gather some plants and resources... but after some time there little to no point in that activities. Well, if you are perfectionist and want to collect all animals for example you still can run around with cages. But for most people there are nothing to do in free roam mode at all. I can just get from one side ops point to another that&apos;s all.
<br>
<br>Story. I put 55 hour into this game (according to my Steam account) and right now somewhere in the middle (on mission 24). And so far everything makes sense for me. Yes, you have to listen to types to get all information, a lot of things said there. I hear that thing go worth further but so far so good. And again remember what i said in the beginning. There should be the whole act that must be a real ending. Will we see it? Was MGS5 rushed and final looks awful because of that? Who knows. I&apos;ll have to see it for myself yet. And as a customer you sure have a right to blame game if story is weak. Sad but true. And a lot of games suffered because of that.
<br>
<br>Quiet. So much was said about her. Objectifying, sexism, feminism, patriarchy and a lot of other stupid words. Welcome to MGS! What took you so long? I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s Kojima&apos;s thing or Japanese, but something like that is in every MGS game. And i really don&apos;t see why so much noise around it. There are mawing innocent people down with machineguns, child soldiers, Devil House and more. But of all thing Quiet gets attention! What&apos;s wrong with you, people?
<br>As a gamer I put it simple - most useless buddy in this game. She lucks in every single aspect. For raw firepower there is D-Walker, for scouting - D-Dog. D-Horse...well, D-Horse can poop on command! While Quiet is just for being there and looking pretty (and in that she fails too because i&apos;ll choose Laughing Octopus over her any time you ask anyway!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5502232">Expand</a></span>

<br>The best part of this game is that, it&apos;s an stealth game. It means that it challenges your skills to infiltrate places including FOBs. You have to make tactical decisions based on enemy guards equipment and they will adapt themselves to your strategies. For instance, if you shoot them all in the head, they will wear helmets.
<br>In case of story, I don&apos;t want to spoil it; however, I have to say it is outstanding in comparison to other games I have played. FOBs are the online part which I liked it so much; but bear in mind that Konami is not as eager as EA to support the online servers specially when we talk about long-term support.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5664466">Expand</a></span>

And the game lived up to it&apos;s hype, somewhat. &apos;Somewhat&apos;, because the game is incomplete. Yes, technically it&apos;s incomplete. The Chapter 2 was evidently rushed and Chapter 3 was entirely scrapped. The side missions are extremely boring as they get repetitive, barring the &apos;Important Side Ops&apos; as they are linked to the story. The Afghanistan and Africa worlds are well designed but they still are not that great as there&apos;s no unique landmark or anything to explore as compared to open worlds of other games released this year like Witcher 3 or Fallout 4. The fast travelling mechanic takes me average 3 minutes to go from one place to another. The Mother Base, no matter how much you expand, has nothing to offer you whatsoever. There&apos;s nothing and I mean nothing is happening on the Mother Base. Hardly there are couple of attractions (Including an animal sanctuary).The end might leave a sour taste in your mouth if you are a die hard Metal Gear fan and by now you must be wondering why I gave it a solid 8/10.
<br>
<br>The Gameplay. Period. It overshadows all the above mentioned issues and still makes it a 60 bucks game. I never felt so much in-control of a character in any previous game. And what was the icing on the cake was the Fox engine which never let the game fall below the 60fps no matter how many things are happening on the screen. Frankly I don&apos;t care if my game is capped to 30fps or 60fps, but I enjoyed the smooth frame rate while I was blasting through tons of vehicles and tanks. And yes, the game has re-play value.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a must buy. Kojima gave his best in making this one successful and it shows.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5768547">Expand</a></span>

He can&apos;t write his way out of a paper bag, that much is impossibly clear, but it is amazing how well he conveyed the sense of just badass power in everything the player does in the game. From sneaking behind snipers in the rain, to punching your way through an army of child soldiers, this is the one game that actually tried to make the player feel cool and did it.
<br>
<br>Slamming the door of the helicopter or pulling the trigger on an enemy just feels real, every action has weight to it where games like the witcher 3 and especially fallout/skyrim literally show their game engine when you try to interact with an object or move the character in the air.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is just plain innovative and after three hundred hours of raiding other people&apos;s bases I still can&apos;t put the controller down, and yes you should play with a controller as it is an Xbox port - but it will handle decently with m+k.
<br>
<br>The only complaints are konami&apos;s handling of, well, literally everything and Kojima&apos;s god-awful plot. The game itself is a miracle considering it was designed to run on 512mb of ram, and the only honest game I&apos;ve been impressed with in two years</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5846844">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Multiple actions are bound to the same button, since a controller only has a certain amount of buttons. Well, turns out a keyboard has a lot more buttons so it feels silly when half your keys go unused just because the controls were ported straight from the consoles. Furthermore, menu navigation is painful with console controls, and don&apos;t even get me started on the binoculars controls... you have to hold the binoculars button down, then press on a button to zoom in/zoom out, and press a different button to mark a target. Yeah, good job on that one.
<br>
<br>My only gripe with the gameplay itself is that the whole &quot;enemies adapt to your playstyle&quot; thing is that it was wonderfully marketed but ended up being a stinking pile of excrement. You essentially get punished for playing in a way you enjoy, or for example if you&apos;re good at aiming, you get punished for playing well. After taking over a camp using stealth once or twice, the enemies will become heavy armor wearing juggernauts were the only viable choice is a melee takedown or shooting them to death. The game would just be better off without that feature.
<br>
<br>All in all a great game, some weak points (like a very, very confusing story) but definitely worth playing. Would be a 10/10 if it hadn&apos;t been for the poor controls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5855705">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game to me is a wonderful masterpiece, the graphics, delivery, story is excellent. It&apos;s a rarity to see games with such compassion in gameplay and many little mind-blowing details.
<br>This game is definitely worth the 60$, and I hope to see another game appear in the franchise.</span>

I only judge the game itself as a whole and not how well it fits within the Metal Gear franchise.
<br>
<br>MGSV is, for the most part, an excellent game and very unique in many ways. Gameplay mechanics are top notch, probably the best in any stealth action game ever besides the sometimes clumsy cover system. I already fell in love with the gameplay in GZ, and TPP offers a more refined version of that. The game is stealth focused, but handles more than adequately in full-on combat as well. The story, while having a lot of silliness in it, tries to keep things mostly serious, while the gameplay often abandons the realism in favour of pure fun and over-the-top action. Hiding in cardboard boxes, launching sheep into air with a balloon, calling in a support helicopter to shoot down enemies while playing &quot;Take On Me&quot; on the loudspeakers...what&apos;s not to like?
<br>
<br>The controls are fine on kb+m, but it&apos;s clear they were designed with a controller in mind. Performance-wise, the game is well optimised for PC. My gtx 970 and i7-4790k can run it on max settings without even breaking a sweat. The graphics are quite good for the most part, but the lack of proper anti-aliasing and some low-res textures can get quite annoying. The options menu also lacks any proper audio sliders.
<br>
<br>The stealth and combat gameplay is mostly done in one of the two open worlds areas in the game, Afghanistan and Africa. Both are fairly big, but as they are warzones with no civilian life whatsoever, they don&apos;t really have much going on other than plants, wildlife and enemy outposts. There are 50 main missions and 157 side ops to do, and the objectives are usually quite simple and tend to repeat themselves after a while. However, even after 100 hours of gameplay I still haven&apos;t grown tired of doing them due to the unlimited freedom and the sheer amount of variables in play every time I do a mission or a side op. Other side activities include gathering resources, capturing outposts, finding secrets, collecting money and sending your mercenaries on assignments. I&apos;ve found the online FOB mechanic quite unnecessary and often irritating as you can be dragged to defend your FOB just as you&apos;re trying to get an S rank in some mission. The FOB infiltration is also hilariously difficult when the player whose FOB you&apos;re invading decides to come and defend it.
<br>
<br>A big part of the game is managing your own private military force. It&apos;s very addicting and almost like a game in itself. Pretty much everything you can think of is customisable and there&apos;s a lot to construct and develop. You can recruit enemy soldiers to your mercenary group by extracting them from the field. Your field gear is highly customisable, letting you choose everything from your equipment to your buddy and/or vehicle going to the field with you.
<br>
<br>The story is interesting, but quite sparse. There were some interesting stuff explored in the game with themes like revenge, language and identity, and there were a few particular scenes in the game that will stay with me for years to come, but ultimately I was left wanting a bit more. Too much of the story is hidden away in cassette tapes, and to be honest, listening to them started to feel too much of a chore after some time. Chapter 2 is missing a real narrative drive to keep it going forward and it also ends really abruptly, leaving loose ends and a feeling that there was supposed to be more.
<br>
<br>Other than the story, the game does have its fair share of other problems. The open world doesn&apos;t really help the game as much as I think the developers wanted it to. Even with real-time weather and great freedom in gameplay, it does get annoying when you start to go through the same areas time and time again while never coming across totally unexpected things on the way. The online FOBs feel a bit unnecessary and tacked on, especially with their microtransactions. The enemy AI, while for the most part quite good, doesn&apos;t always act all that intelligently. When you&apos;re spotted and try to break the line of sight, enemies hardly ever actively chase you. Enemy soldiers&apos; vision is also a bit weird, sometimes they have a hard time seeing you from 10 meters away when you&apos;re crouching and at other times they might see you and instantly alert the whole base even when you&apos;re hiding in tall grass over 50 meters away in pitch black darkness. It seems like the enemy&apos;s combat rating affects how well and far away they can see. It does allow for the game to have a really cool feeling of progressive difficulty where enemies get constantly better and harder to beat while you constantly get better equipment and also get better playing the game.
<br>
<br>Overall, the experience I&apos;ve had with MGSV has been very memorable and unique and I have no problems recommending it to anyone who can imagine liking an action game with a stealth focus.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5462883">Expand</a></span>

<br>- The story is pretty bad, both the content and how it is delivered. Chapter two has some of the exact same missions as chapter one, without any story context whatsoever. The side story about Quiet was pretty cool, but that&apos;s about it.
<br>- Some badly placed savepoints, or lack thereof, which leads to frustrating missions (I&apos;m looking at you, mission 45).
<br>- &quot;Forward Operating Bases&quot; are forcing multiplayer elements into the single player campaign. I don&apos;t want to lose the stuff I worked hard for to this crap and it can&apos;t be disabled. PF battles on the other hand are pretty cool, because your army battles against other players in a league system and you don&apos;t lose anything in the process. Should still be optional though.
<br>- Character often gets stuck on tiny bumps in the landscape.
<br>- The sound effects could be better, especially running and shooting.
<br>- When starting the game, you need to click through 10 (seriously) intro videos/news.
<br>- I never liked the comic relief in MGS games.
<br>
<br>Technically, the game is a 10, but unfortunately the story is pretty bad, some missions have bad savepoints and I don&apos;t like multiplayer elements being forced into the single player part of a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5501479">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+ Great gameplay: gameplay is probably the best in the series but i feel like a few things are lacking, such as a cover button and silently disabling devices such as cameras and antennas.
<br>+ Weapon variety: There&apos;s a **** of weapons and custimizations for those weapons, now while i mostly stick to a select few the fact that the choice is there is really good.
<br>+ Graphics optimization: I was always at a stable 60 fps and it looked amazing, the fox engine sure is one of the best optimized engines out there
<br>+ Fluent and fun combat: The shooting feels good and (most) of the sights are good in first person.
<br>+ Cutscenes (part 1): The cutscenes are really beutiful and impressive, however (see part 2)
<br>And here are some neutral things that i&apos;ll let you decide if they&apos;re good or bad.
<br>+ Non-lethal: the choice of non-lethal is far more than &quot;more score&quot; and &quot;better karma&quot;, because of the fulton extraction system that lets you basicly steal enemy soldiers and use them to improve is a great feature.
<br>
<br>&#xA4; Motherbase: some might find micromanaging annoying in a stealth game.
<br>&#xA4; Bland empty world: The world has basicly zero secrets and fun stuff/fun areas, some might apreciate teh sandbox feel though.
<br>
<br>And now for the negatives... (There are alot)
<br>
<br>- Boring story:In the MAIN story of Metal gear solid this has teh **** plot. And while thats understandable to some degree with chapter 2 because it was rushed, chapter 1 was finished completely and still sucked storywise.
<br>- Boring characters: Kinda goes in par with boring story but i feel this &quot;deserves&quot; it&apos;s own minus.
<br>- Cutscenes (part 2): There was a suprising lack of cutscenes which is one of the things MGS is famous for, i can understand decreasing cutscene amount/length by a bit but the lack of cutscenes is just horrid.
<br>- Repetetive missions: The first mission and maybe like 5 scattered missions are fun but the rest are horrible, boring and repetetive.
<br>- Trailers: The trailers are amazing and gave away practically portions of every cutscene in the game and just flat out lied about &quot;Not shying away from controversy&quot; and &quot;Dealing with controversial issues&quot;.
<br>- Venom Snake (protagonist): He&apos;s boring and unlikable and doesn&apos;t talk much at all, compare him to Naked snake or any other snake really in MGS.
<br>- Lack of orchestral soundtrack: They usually have some form of the iconic MGS theme or boss music, hey atleast we got some sweet 70&apos;s/80&apos;s hits.
<br>- Controls optimization: menus are the worst part but generally control wise, this is a bad port.
<br>- Taboo subjects: This game lacked them even though promising them, even ground zeroes was more taboo with listening to Paz being raped to look for background clues.
<br>- Quiet: While MGS has had sexy and skimpy-clad characters like EVA Quiet feels different in a bad way somehow (not her costume, her general character) and was pure fan service or trying to spark controversy to increase sales.
<br>- Bland mission enviroments: generally sucky and lack of inside enviroments.
<br>- Side ops: These are so bad they should be removed good god.
<br>
<br>The pacing is horrible and so are alot of other stuff but the gameplay and tiny details are so greatly done, and thats why i give it a 6/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5567300">Expand</a></span>

Nevertheless, if you have not played any of the previous games, you will not understand a damn thing about the storyline and might get confused. I strongly recommend playing at least Metal Gear Solid 3 and Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.</span>

<br>
<br>This game really has some humor too it. It should be called phantom kidnapper. Can&#x2019;t wait to literally steal every piece of equipment in an enemy base. That&#x2019;s a nice AAA turret you have, don&#x2019;t mind it I airlift it back to my base. Oh, that&#x2019;s some skilled personnel that you have, don&#x2019;t mind it I take them too. Nice truck, you don&#x2019;t need it right?
<br>
<br>I like putting people to sleep, but when you have to go loud it is equally as fun. There are a lot of ways to defeat group of enemy. Go in all sneaky, go in guns a blazing, kill them all predator style. Snipe them and have them rain mortars at you, unless you re position yourself. Misdirect them with C4.
<br>
<br>Mother base is awesome, the best part is leaving for a mission and seeing that great piece of steel construction out in the middle of the sea.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m still on mission 7 and I&apos;m already 18 hours in..
<br>
<br>Cons.
<br>I had to struggle past the prologue, to really get into the game.

I tend to only review games that I am deeply passionate about, and being that I have put in 20 hours and am only 15 percent completed into the game, I feel confident in reviewing it. I will preface this the fact that I have not played every metal gear game, but I have played MGS3, MGS:Peace Walker, Ground Zeros and I read the story of Portable Ops, so in the MGS Timeline I know everything Leading up to The Phantom Pain, but nothing afterwards.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-
<br>The gameplay in TPP is nothing short of a masterpeice, Kojima gives you so many tools to use throughout the missions, tools that allow the player to approach a mission virtually anyway you like. In previous games there was a huge focus on stealth, which is still part of the game, but it now allows for more varied gameplay and does not punish you if you want to go in guns blazing. Another deviation from the original MGS games is the introduction of an Open-World game, where as the other games were linear in nature. The Base building aspect of the game is also welcomed, as it gives you a reason to use stealth in order to abduct soldiers to your base. I am really looking forward to the true Online portion of the game when it launches early 2016.
<br>
<br>Graphics/optimization-
<br>There isn&apos;t much to say in this section because the results are the same across the board, this game is absolutely beautiful. Just look at the screenshots and the videos! With great texture work for a third person open-world game and amazing draw distance with little pop in, it is definetly a welcome change from some of the other PC games that have launched this year. I have been running this game on a GTX 970 4gig, AMD FX 6300, and on a SSD and with this hardware I have been running the game on Maximum settings with no noticeable drops below 60 FPS. (Note:The Game has a frame cap of 60 fps). It is clear that a lot of work has gone into optimization of the FOX game engine for all computer set-ups.
<br>
<br>Settings-
<br>Generally the settings options are good, Graphical options are pretty good giving you the option to customize pretty much anything you want. Sound options are where the game starts to fault. The only controls you have is for Master Volume and Audio Guidance. It would be ideal to have separate sliders for dialogue, music, and sound effects.
<br>
<br>Story (No Spoilers)-
<br>This section is a mixed bag, most die hard fans may find the deviation from standard MGS formula unwelcomed. But I actually dont mind how they presented the story in TPP. In other MGS games you would be subject to extraordinarily long cutscenes with gameplay sprinkled in between where as TPP takes the opposite approach. This is not saying that there is no story, as you can get a lot from the Cassette tapes that you acquire. This approach makes the game more accessible to non-metal gear players and opens the game up to more players. As to the ending even though I have not reached it yet, I do know how it ends, and I really don&apos;t mind how the story ends, I kinda like the idea. (I am being vague to avoid spoilers).
<br>
<br>Controls-
<br>When it comes to controls there are both pros and cons. Generally the controls feel excellent. I have tested both Keyboard and Mouse And Controller. Both work very well, but of course keyboard and mouse allows for much faster and more accurate aiming. Although I would suggest rebinding controls to suite what you are used to as some of the default controls are counter-intuitive. I rebound most controls to my mouse for a more enjoyable experience. One major con in terms of controls is that during the tutorial and throughout the game, tool tips will show the controls for a controller even if you are playing with a keyboard and mouse. This seems like it could be fixed via a patch fairly easily but as of this review this has not happened. The last major con in terms of controls is that mouse support in menus is not supported, forcing you to use the keyboard to navigate, which is just awful especially considering the layout of the menus. This is also something that seems like it could be fixed easily but has not been addressed as of yet.
<br>
<br>TLDR- Get the game! It is a masterpeice in my own opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5512622">Expand</a></span>

If it aids the review, my favorite entry was MGS3, where I went full stealth/tranq. After playing Peace Walker I was exceedingly excited for this entry in the series, and it did not disappoint. The FOX engine produces some of the best graphics i&apos;ve ever seen. The gameplay took many notes from more open world-centric games such as the Arkham series and Far Cry, while at the same time not abandoning the roots MGS has as a true stealth game. In the 60 hours I spent playing, I was constantly engaged by the challenges this game provides.
<br>
<br>My only gripe is with some of the plot elements of the game. As the last entry by Kojima in this series it attempted to connect all story lines, and get rid of any plotholes produced by previous entries in the series. It accomplished this, but the solution does leave a bit to be desired. Also, Quiet&apos;s entire storyline is ****
<br>
<br>Definite contender for Game of the Generation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5471536">Expand</a></span>

The open world environment was a new addition to Metal Gear and I feel like it makes the game less fun and strategic.  The open world is too barren with not much happening except near guard outposts and bases.
<br>
<br>Clearly this Metal Gear&apos;s story was not as well done as previous titles like Snake Eater.  There are not enough cutscenes to shed more light on the story and you really have to listen to the audio logs to get a better feel for it, which most players probably won&apos;t do.
<br>
<br>The gameplay itself is fun and the graphics are very good.  Once again though, if this game was not open world and set in specific environments, the missions could be more intricate and less repetitive.  I would have loved indoor missions with more security cameras and obstacles to negotiate, which I think is where the Metal Gear series shines.  There is a huge variety of weapon choices that don&apos;t really add much to the strategy of the game.
<br>
<br>As a Metal Gear game I think Phantom Pain is a bit of a let down, but I still think it&apos;s worth a shot and I have spent 50+ hours enjoying the game.  I believe if they emphasized more on the story quality and made this game non open world then this game would have been truly exceptional.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5541934">Expand</a></span>

This is game gets &quot;the worst most expensive game ever&quot; award. This whole open world. I&apos;ve seen better open world 20 years ago. It&apos;s empty, it&apos;s boring, it has no artistic value. This game looks like someone worked over it for 2 weeks and then did nothing but copy and paste his own work. This is the last MGS I ever played even if they do another instalments. Kojima has show as who he is. His like Venom Snake. Imposter pretending to be artist. He&apos;s Uwe Boll of video gaming but with worse skill to write story. Great hero Big Boss put to end. If you think MGS4 had stupid story, you will not believe how **** this one is. Game is most boring experience I ever had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5533597">Expand</a></span>

<br>and it really depends if you like more Gameplay over Story that is  more of an opinion.</span>

<br>
<br>The trailers basically promised too much and so did Kojima&apos;s constant PR.
<br>
<br>It doesn&apos;t deserve to be called an &quot;open world&quot; as there&apos;s nothing in it apart from enemy soldiers and the odd animal.
<br>
<br>Gameplay itself is very nice, however it&apos;s rinse and repeat. To get the best score and soldiers you essentially need to go non-lethal most of the time so your play method will be largely similar most missions. Quiet is a completely broken addition to the game though, she makes you lazy once you&apos;ve skilled her up. She essentially does your job for you about 75% of the time.
<br>
<br>Storyline is essentially an in-coherent mess. After Skull Face is killed, the rest appears to be some sort of cutting room floor extras scraped onto a number of missions, some new missions, some subsistence (no equipment) some ultra stealth with no order.
<br>
<br>Parts of the storyline are genuinely touching, Quiet&apos;s arch made me sad somewhat. And the presentation for the parts of the game that are finished are triple A worthy.
<br>
<br>Kojima seems to have wasted $80 million on this game, Witcher 3 Wild Hunt cost half that but is far more polished and doesn&apos;t feel like the plug was pulled on it. I don&apos;t want to compare it to Witcher 3 however these are two of the biggest hitting sandbox games this year and comparison is inevitable.
<br>
<br>Konami trying to force FOB upon everyone was idiotic too, I played in offline mode only to prevent this.
<br>
<br>They should have made it mission based with no open world and no multi-player. Had so much potential but fell down.
<br>
<br>And there I was thinking that Phantom Pain simply couldn&apos;t fail because Ground Zeroes was so good :-(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5770624">Expand</a></span>

<br>*Most weapons are geared towards non-stealth gameplay leaving you with the same old stealth arsenal and tactics throughout the game
<br>*Dull uninteresting desert environment coupled with boring enemy outposts that consist of a few tents, crates, and cardboard houses
<br>*PC controls need work; horse jerks left/right instead of just turning, snake has to stop fully when exiting sprint, you have to hold buttons a lot when doing stuff instead of them being toggle buttons. On-screen key tutorials still use console controller icons.
<br>*Motherbase meta sounds fun, but is ultimately a GUI screen/simple econ management with no integrations into the core gameplay experience.
<br>
<br>The core gameplay is simple and solid and mainly involves you sneaking around corners and tranquilizing clueless guards in the face. The game doesn&apos;t really build on that much as you play it, repetition is a very prominent theme in MGS5 which is not what you would expect from a MG title. Snake go rescue this hostage, now sneak in and kill this guy, now sneak into the same base you just were in 2 missions ago and steal these documents. Rinse repeat, at least for the 20 hours or so that I played. I kept holding out, expecting there to be more, but it just kept being the same old boring routine. You unlock various weapons/items of which 80% you don&apos;t use because they&apos;re not stealth related. The game actively punishes you for &quot;going loud&quot; and yet you have grenades, rockets, attack helicopters, mortar strikes, snipers, assault rifles, etc. Meanwhile stealth gear mainly consists of your hands, your tranq gun, and your limitless empty magazine stock. Your approach is always the same; sneak around some corners CQC the guards you lured towards you with magazines/sounds, and tranq gun the rest. No long range engagements, no traps, no clever uses of the environment, no change of pace.
<br>
<br>The environment is literally the dullest environment you could possibly base a game off of. Why would you pick a dessert for your open world? It sounds boring because it is, between bases there is nothing but sand and rocks that you can&apos;t traverse over. Calling this open world is a stretch because you pretty much are forced to take roads in order to get anywhere because there are rock formations blocking your every path. Capturing animals gets boring after the 3rd time you do it, it&apos;s just a meaningless number that you increase. Enemy bases are pretty much a tent, a few cardboard houses, and some crates. Gets really old really fast.
<br>
<br>The motherbase feature sounds like it&apos;d be really cool; collect soldiers you find in the battlefield and build your own personal army with them. You would only select the greatest soldiers you could find and maybe you could all go out to the bar and hang out or, even better, infiltrate bases together, like &quot;you take those cardboard houses and I&apos;ll take these&quot; or something. Nope. Motherbase is pretty much a GUI interface that says &quot;hey you have these soldiers, click this button to research stuff, now click this button to send them on a timer-based dice-roll mission that gets you money&quot;. You can walk around the physical motherbase, however, there is no actual interaction with anything there so it adds very little to the experience.
<br>
<br>The character controls are pretty questionable for on foot and on horse, not sure if this is a PC port issue or if it&apos;s like this on consoles as well. Snake awkwardly transitions from run to walk; he must come to a full stop from sprint before he transitions into walking again. A lot of the times you have to hold a key or multiple keys down to do stuff when they should just be toggle keys. I&apos;ve let a few enemies out of a choke hold because of this which cost me a lot of time due to the nature of being spotted and having to restart from checkpoint.
<br>
<br>Graphically it&apos;s just &quot;meh&quot;. It&apos;s not bad, it&apos;s not good, it&apos;s just a plain jane kinda game. It ran fine on my highend Nvidia gaming rig. The artistic choices are weird too, but it is MGS. Snake is part sci-fi robot that can shoot lightning out of his robot arm and has a holographic scannermatron but everyone else is listening to cassette tapes and doing 80s stuff.
<br>
<br>Would I recommend you buy this game? Nah, save your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5513750">Expand</a></span>

What&apos;s most important sneaking mechanics are very good and satisfying.
<br>
<br>To be honest I&apos;ve never been a huge fun of Kojima overly dramatic and convoluted storytelling. I have played all games in the series besides psp titles and really liked mgs from 1998 (loved the game and the story) and mgs 3. At the same time I really disliked mgs 2 and mgs 4 (a huge letdown) for nonsensical plots. The Phantom Pain story however feels great for me. Kojima has found the right balance between gameplay and storytelling and made a fantastic sneaking game. Best Metal Gear Solid for the newcomers.
<br>
<br>+ great sneaking mechanics
<br>+ freedom
<br>+ great audio
<br>+ good and well optimized graphics
<br>+ story - of course it&apos;s Kojima game so not everyone will like it
<br>+ a lot of content
<br>+ some great gameplay ideas

The animation, graphics, combat, and just general gameplay is great and some of the best third person gameplay I&apos;ve played in a long time. However from a story perspective it is not the best. It is good and does manage to pull you in and the twist at the end will feel good after connecting all the dots in the series all the way to MG1. Filler makes up most of the second half but is so dynamic its still fun and enjoyable so I would suggest this game. If you wish to see a full review my in-depth video review will be on my youtube channel DarekBaird. thank you for  reading and enjoy the game. oh and the third chapter if you hadn&apos;t heard was cut and did add a possible fourth area to the game  the three in it being Afganistan, Africa, and MotherBase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=5538901">Expand</a></span>

Baseline: very depressing and not fun the more you play and the more you understand the story.

The whole metal gear solid series is a joke, with the only worthwhile game being the first on the ps1. This game had a chance to be different, to actually compete as a game with the big western AAA boys, and failed miserably, probably due to lack of funds/time.
<br>
<br>The only good things about the game, are the production values, the great PC port, the graphics, the sound, the voice acting. Production wise and if you forget about the repetitiveness, this game is a great work. But here end all the good things.
<br>
<br>The story is trash. Typical Kojima trash. The kind of trash only apes find worthwhile.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is good, but repetitive. After a while you lose the motivation to keep playing. For what is worth, this is the only metal gear solid game in the entire series that has decent gameplay. And has actualy stealth. If that is any consolation.
<br>
<br>Still, the game overstays its welcome, and since the story is trash, unfinished, and not worth the effort, you are better off ignoring this game. And the series. Just play something else. Let Konami and the franchise die.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=6689391">Expand</a></span>

Estos de Konami son unos cachondos, totalmente abaros queriendo sacar el juego rapido para hacerse unos dolarcitos, aunque eso signifique que el juego no tenga final. El juego no tiene un final!! No fue terminado su desarrollo.
<br>Que la motherbase esta vacia, que al final resulta que no estas jugando con Snake, que no hay jefes de ningun tipo, salvo por uno, creo. Que los soldados todos iguales, varian en armamento y equiamiento, pero antes eran originales y habian montones de enemigos diferentes. Juego totalmente monotono, ni escenas le pusieron!! Tenes que fumarte unos casettitos horrendos.
<br>Cuando empezas cada nivel, te spoilea contra quien te vas a enfrentar en ese capitulo. Estaba tan falto de desarrollo, que hicieron un copy paste gigante, la segunda mitad del juego, tenes que volver a jugar todas las primeras misiones pero ojo, en un nivel de dificultad mas.
<br>Ay ay ay... Podria estar asi todo el dia, que juego feo, que no me gusto para nada, aburridisimo, cortando el legado de los anteriores. Tengo fe que hasta la pachinko debe ser mas divertida que esto.
<br>Como si el juego no fuese suficiente prueba de lo abaros que fueron, que el pachinko y que el juego nuevo de zombies aliens a travez de portales dimensionales... madre mia pero que plantacion de marihuana que tienen en las oficinas, se fumaron todos los fasos estos chinos</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=6705897">Expand</a></span>

I wouldn&apos;t said that the story is bad like a lot of people are saying but it definitely felt a little incomplete, and it let a lot of thing to the player to deduce. The only low point for this game in my opinion is the lack of the classic boss fights that Metal Gear is so famous for, there is like two (which are fairly good) but there could have done a lot more. The multiplayer base system is really solid and it adds a lot of depth to the gameplay and the actual multiplayer is quite unique and original. Overall i think this is a great game and a definite buy for stealth fans or Metal Gear fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=6404194">Expand</a></span>

The characters seem very generic and uninteresting. Though none of this really makes or breaks the game for me. What I can&apos;t get into is the gameplay. I just don&apos;t find it satisfying whatsoever. The game seems torn between being realistic and arcade. On one hand you need to use iron sights/scopes to shoot with any kind of accuracy, but on the other hand your guns don&apos;t have rate of fire controls, meaning that your full auto rifles just spray all over the place barely hitting targets that are point blank. The stealth mechanics aren&apos;t bad, but the enemies are bullet sponges, (which I really don&apos;t like in shooters), and instead of a silenced pistol you get a tranquilizer pistol that requires head shots to knock targets out immediately. Otherwise, you have to fire multiple shots. Which brings me to the AI, who are dumb as **** If they don&apos;t see you, you can just keep shooting them with sedatives and they just kinda stand there like &apos;cool drugs bro, thanks!&apos; But, why don&apos;t you get an actual silenced pistol? So you can attach a parachute to your knocked out targets that flies them to your base where through some bizarre form of brain washing they become part of your own little private army.
<br>
<br>Your character is also a bullet sponge, so if you want to just run n gun you certainly can. But there&apos;s no clutch play going on here, it&apos;s just bullet sponge against bullet sponge with horribly inaccurate weapons and tranq guns. I think the game is primarily focused on being a stealth game where you sneak up and choke people to sleep or shoot them in the head with a tranq gun so you can send their bodies to your oil rig out in the middle of the ocean for assimilation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/user-reviews?user_review_id=6827386">Expand</a></span>
