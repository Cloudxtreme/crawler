Thus, the total lack of ending helps create and bring that one fact home: every time you play, every time you pick up your pistol, every night you will spend playing this game over and over and over is a new and horrifying experience.

The happy part is, it&apos;s not a problem that has been caused by the game itself. However, this problem is so huge and towering as to block out the sun. The game itself and everything about it easily earn the 9 I am giving it. However, the brutal fact that a healthy portion of its online players are quite possibly the scum of the earth, the evolutionary low, the creations that God shudders at when he realizes he created them, can really wear on the more serious players. I am trying not to be a whiny hater noob about this. I get 1st place on every chapter, literally 9/10 times I play, no matter what difficulty, in all of the important aspects. Despite this fact, in almost every match I&apos;ve ever played, there has always been, at bare minimum, one incredibly anti-social sadist who wants to ruin the experience. Every. Single. Time. If this were a PvP/TvT FPS, I wouldn&apos;t care. People will be posturing lunatics in such games as CoD4 or FEAR2 or CS:S or whatever...but seriously? Can you even pretend to care about a team? If you are not one of those people and you don&apos;t want to deal with the infinite stream of madmen, idiots and TKers, skip this one. If you ARE one of the above, please...PLEASE, for the love of God, don&apos;t buy this game. Leave us serious people in peace so we can actually have fun playing this game with people who actually give a second crap about playing with a half-sane team.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=744445">Expand</a></span>

The graphics on the source engine have been drastically improved from previous games, the faces and characters look almost identical to that of new engines like Cryengine 2! This game relies completely on teamwork, a concept many FPS games often lack. There is more strategy in the game than you think, particularly in Versus mode.</span>

It is very amusing too. Not all people in multiplayer are jerks, you might even make friends. And if you people complain it&apos;s too easy, try other difficulties, it gets less boring that way aswell.</span>

It gives the hardcore a mode, the director is one of the smartest ever created and it&apos;s cheap right now. Left 4 Dead is probably the best zombie shooter ever. Yet.

With so many games focusing on surviving against zombies, it can be hard to pick any good games from the crowd. But with Left 4 Dead, I believe all other games have just been blown out of the water. In L4D, you play as one of four survivors- Bill, Francis, Zoey, or Louis. Each has their own little back story and their own personality, something that helps you connect. Like Francis, who hates stairs, helicopters, zombies, walking, and generally anything and everything. There are multiple campaigns in the game, each with a different set of locales and atmospheres. Like the first campaign, No Mercy, which has you moving through a city to rendezvous on a hospital skyscraper rooftop. Each campaign is broken into chapters, which have you getting from the start area to a safehouse. At the last chapter, you face a thing called a finale, where you get a bunch of supplies, an area to hole out in, and a trigger to start it. When you activate the trigger, a massive horde of zombies rush at you. And the game features a &quot;Director,&quot; who controls how the chapter is going. For example, you might hole out in a parking lot in one area and defend against a wave of zombies using gas canisters in one playthrough, and maybe the next the canisters won&apos;t be there and the zombies will come from behind. And killing zombies in this game is FUN. You start out with a single pistol, and can pick up an smg or a shotgun. Later in a chapter you find upgraded weapons, which are a hunting rifle, an auto shotgun, and an assault rifle. The game gets pretty gory when using a shotgun or hunting rifle, as headshots will take zombie heads clean off and shotgun blasts will tear off limbs. If you like FPS games, or zombie games, this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=1386950">Expand</a></span>

The story is about four survivors who are stranded in a town struck by the T-viru-, I mean a horrible infection which turned the citizens into zombies. Louis, Francis, Bill and Zoey are amazing characters that you will certainly grow to love and everytime we start playing the game we end up in a fight over who get&apos;s to play which awesome character. The story is mostly told through graffiti on the walls left there by other survivors and very subtle elements such as covered up bodies or piles of infected. The only downside is that the story of the survivors doesn&apos;t really make sense. At the end of every chapter you get saved from the city and at the beginning of every chapter you are standed again. That is the only reason this game does not get a full 10!<br><br><br>The gameplay is the best part because this game is endlessly replayable. The goal is to fight through the infected and make it to the next safehouse, in the final part of each mission you will have to wait for rescue while thousands of zombies try to kill you. Thanks to the AI Director who decides where zombies, items and special infected spawn the game is never same twice and the difficulty is adjusted to your playstyle. The special infected also force you to adapt to a new situation very quickly, so you can&apos;t just mow through the infected alone because you will be picked off. This game perfectly enforces teamwork and you can replay it at any time, that is a true multiplayer game and a true classic.<br><br>Finally, I also want to mention the presentation. A lot of effort has gone into making the city and everything that happens look as realistic as possible. There is never a moment that you will spend in a place you can&apos;t relate to and that is just amazing. The music is also awesome and like the AI Director it is different for each playthrough and each player hears a different song.<br><br>Summary: Great game which you can replay at any time without getting bored. Story fails to connect events to each other, but the presentation easily makes you forget about that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=1596866">Expand</a></span>

Because this game is one of the scariest zombie games I&apos;ve ever had to play. But it is shear fun just to shoot the crap out of the zombies. And the best part is? They keep coming and you just keep on shooting. Nice, right? Check this game out right away. I regret not playing this earlier.</span>

I&apos;m going to have boss-battles that prevent you from splitting up because they stun-lock you into poistions stopping you from moving and getting your **** chopped off and you need your team to help!&quot; What&apos;s weird is that if this was tried in any other FPS/Co-Op game, it would fail, Recklessley, but here it runs smoothly and perfectly.<br><br>You have hord attracting zombies, leaving you to the mercy of your team.<br>You have the hit and runners, causing your team to quickly get it off you and kill it before it strikes again, ECT ECT.<br><br>Half of the time you&apos;ll be walking back and forth, and occasionally sitting down on a box in a locked cupboard because you died. Whenever you die you&apos;re sent to a small cupboard where you must wait....and wait... and wait...Weaponless and itemless waiting for your team to help.<br><br>True survival horror Crowd Based madness.<br>However it gets a bit repetetive though, but maps are often updates/added, so they&apos;re basically spoon-feeding you the same thing but with a different flavour.<br><br>Worth the $12 dollars on steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=1552502">Expand</a></span>

You go round in circles trying to find an exit meanwhile they darken it more so you spend 90% indoors searching for an exit. Repetitive. Just a very poorly designed bunch of MODS they fooled people into thinking was a GAME. I have sent an official complaint to Valve that this is not a game but MODS strung together. Guns and player movements are copied and pasted from Counter Strike. NO originality. No story. No campaign just endless, boring, repetitive shooting and killing of the same sprites. Not a game. No skill required or used. Just hold your mouse button down and shoot. No strategy, no talent at all required. RIP OFF. Be very careful of Valve releases in future. They have a MOD look about them and are rushed out to rake in the $$$$ but are really other games MODDED. L4D2 is Counter Strike MODDED that&apos;s all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=743341">Expand</a></span>

<br>I was originally going to give it an 8.
<br>But right now there&apos;s about 7 exploits for this game which can easily be used and is constantly used. But still no patch even though it&apos;s been 2-3 weeks since these exploits started.
<br>
<br>Also i didn&apos;t like that Valve falsely advertised in their demo with &quot;10 New weapons&quot;
<br>There&apos;s only 5 weapons in the game.
<br>I don&apos;t see how grenades, props and the mounted gun are counted as actual weapons rather than being fire support. That&apos;s why i gave it a 6.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a good game but it just feels like Valve could have done better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=78005">Expand</a></span>

For something that was so hyped up, the gameplay sure feels rather lacking, and the latest update is, to put it bluntly, a great disappointment.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s rather difficult to express my sentiment on this game, as so much of my disdain for Left4Dead revolves around my admiration and praise for other titles in the &quot;Co-op&quot; genre.  To begin, things I thoroughly enjoyed about this title was the innovation of the infected, the overall graphical quality of the game, and the ability to play as the infected in multiplayer combat.
<br>
<br>In this particular title, the zombies are anything but the slow, doddering fools we&apos;ve all become accustomed to.  They sprint, scale walls, tear open windows, anything necessary to tear you apart.  They&apos;re fast, and reaction time is absolutely required to take down each and every one of them.  This is a refreshing break from the &quot;walking targets&quot; zombies usually are in other titles.
<br>
<br>The graphical quality of this game is absolutely phenomenal.  The lighting, the atmosphere, the detail put into a brick wall on the side of a building.  The attention spent on visuals in this game makes for a truly visceral experience.  My only gripe is with the weapon models, in which it appears that the weapons are incorrectly scaled to the player&apos;s hands.  The guns seem more like toys, and this only becomes increasingly apparent with the larger, more powerful items.
<br>
<br>Finally, the ability to play as the infected.  Nothing is more exciting than leaping from rooftop to rooftop as the Hunter, or plowing through a level as the Tank.  It&apos;s especially satisfying to play as the infected, especially once you&apos;ve exhausted the Story Mode gameplay.
<br>
<br>This leads me into the numerous qualities of this title that left me feeling rather disappointed.  Namely, the short-lived novelty of Story Mode, the terrible representation of Survival Mode, the &quot;Matchmaking&quot; system required for online play, the absolute requirement for you to stick with your team, and the overall lack of &quot;fear&quot; that should be paramount in any survival-horror game.
<br>
<br>First, the Story Mode gametype is extremely exciting for the first-time player.  Everything is new and fresh, and the fear aspect really kicks in when you hear a sound just around the corner and you&apos;re forced to investigate it in order to push on.  However, once you&apos;ve completed your first level, you&apos;ve essentially played them all.  Monotony is the cornerstone of this title.  Each level is essentially the same (save a few scenarios) and once you know what to listen for, the special infected become less of an intense conflict and more of a minor annoyance.
<br>
<br>Second, the &quot;Survival Mode&quot;, if you can call it that.  Personally, when I hear the word &quot;Survival&quot;, I think of just that notion, the ability to survive a scenario and walk away victorious.  However, Left4Dead&apos;s &quot;Survival Mode&quot; would better be described as &quot;Let&apos;s See How Long We Can Last Against Unending Waves of Enemies&quot; mode.  The Survival Mode is nothing more than a last-stand scenario, in which you and three teammates hold out against the onslaught of infected for as long as possible.  There is absolutely no closure to this mode, only a ticking clock at the top of your screen, measuring how long you survive before you and your team are finished off.  This irks me, because I like to feel like I&apos;ve completed something when I play a game.  Survival Mode leaves me wanting more...
<br>
<br>Next, the Matchmaking system, as required for all types of online play.  This system requires you to log into Steam Friends and, rather than using a standard server browser, syncs you up with a populated server at random.  This system would be fine, were it not a complete failure 50% of the time.  More often than not, I find myself connected to servers where my latency would be well above 200ms (were there a latency measurement system in this game).  This leaves me with terrible lag, a general inability to effectively communicate with my team, and frequent disconnects that leave me frustrated and unwilling to try to reconnect.  The only alternative to a random selection of servers is to play with your friends on your Steam Friends list.  This system, however, is also broken.  Once you and your friends have joined a lobby, the game proceeds to randomly select a dedicated server for you to play on, which again results in a terrible connection 50% of the time.  All of these scenarios require you to be signed into Steam Friends, which simultaneously comprimises your privacy as a player.  Suppose you wanted to just have a carefree game of Left4Dead with nobody to bother you.  Thanks to the matchmaking system, this is relatively impossible.
<br>
<br>The absolute requirement for you to stick with your team is perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this title.  When I think of &quot;Co-op&quot; gameplay, I think of a multitude of people working together in order to achieve a common goal.  With the added requirement for you to stick together at all times, this effectively compromises individual exploration (teammates scouting ahead to see what&apos;s coming next and reporting back to the team) as well as the ability for your team to work on multiple tasks simultaneously.  If you split up, the AI Director immediately recognizes this, and before you know it, an unending horde is unleashed on your team, and everyone is slaughtered.  This inhibits players from working on separate tasks, and forces the team to play through the entire scenario as one big bunch, shooting in all directions in order to survive.  Simultaneously, the ability for special infected to cripple your player, requiring that someone free you from their grasp, is the final nail in the coffin for individual exploration.  God forbid that you branch off from your team to explore a secondary location for items, a Hunter will pin you and that will be the end of your character.  The single saving grace of individual play was the ability to melee constantly, forcing the infected off of you, and giving you ample time to react and save yourself.  This feature, however, was removed with the latest patch, rendering your individual contributions useless.
<br>
<br>Finally, the overall lack of &quot;fear&quot; is what made me put down this game for good.  Because of the linear gameplay, you and your team are required to push ahead, since you are inevitably traveling from Point A to Point B.  Due to this singular requirement, it seems less like you are being hunted, and more like you are hunting zombies.  If you hear something just around the bend (like a Smoker cackling and wheezing), you can&apos;t hunker down and wait for him to find you.  Instead, you must push on ahead, wait for him to pop out, and then dispose of him.  For me, the fear aspect of Co-op survival games comes from the ability to have creatures pursue you, rather than you pursuing creatures.  Running away, and knowing that something is chasing after you, is absolutely terrifying to me.  Left4Dead misses out on this entire notion, as each scenario requires you to push ahead, hold your ground until the area is secure, and then continue pushing ahead.  Overall, the lack of fear results in a lack of immersion, and Left4Dead just assumes the role of &quot;casual game&quot; rather than &quot;pulse-pounding thrill ride&quot;.
<br>
<br>Overall, I was initially pleased with Left4Dead&apos;s gameplay, at least for the first few hours of gaming.  However, once I became more experienced in the game mechanics, the excitement drop-off was intense, and now I find the game rather dull and uninteresting.  For the initial $50 I had spent on this title, I can assure you that it&apos;s not worth it.  If you purchase during one of Steam&apos;s 50% off weekends, however, I&apos;d say it&apos;s a pretty decent game at $25 or less.  All I can say is, don&apos;t believe the hype like I did.  It will leave you disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=81018">Expand</a></span>

I woudn&apos;t say its bad (its gameplay was really origional back then) but I woudn&apos;t say its worth even $20 when i got it during 2008 thanksgiving. Why? well, its mainly because players easily get sick of the same gameplay after a while (its like play HL mod SvenCoOp with the same map over and over again), valve had made it such that the game has &quot;ALOT&quot; of restrictions, and very very little freedom to explore new tactics. for example, there&apos;s hardly any weapon to choose from except the assault, sniper rifle and shotgun. One of the most annoying thing is that there&apos;s NO melee weapons! NONE! (except pushing zombies away with ur hands). After 5 months of casual time to time playing, I&apos;ve convinced myself that Valve isin&apos;t going to make any map or content update that would make the game worth my time. The survival mode is just...rediciluously hard and &quot;Bad&quot;. OH, and did i mention...NO CUSTOM MAPS, NO MODS, NO MAP DEVELOPING TOOLS, HORRIBLE SERVER BROWSER. In terms of gameplay....The zombie verses has been balanced (you konw, for fairness) such that the Hunter can basically pounce on a player without landing on him/her, the smoker and tank takes a considerable damage before they die, the smoker can pull somebody miles away...the list goes on...basically, what valve tried to balance for verses mode didn&apos;t really translate well into the survival mode. eventually the gameplay became &quot;ANNOYING&quot; and boring for me. trust me, if you are looking for a fun zombie game, try some CSS zombie mod or perhaps &quot;ZombiePanic Source&quot; (i havnt tried that yet). Save your money, save you time, its not worth $20 unless valve opens up its custom developing tools for modding. (even if they did, i wouldn&apos;t strongly reccomend it).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=424006">Expand</a></span>

I cannot give this game anything above 8 even though I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s a bad game. The content is just extremely limited and if you were to run through all the levels without zombies you&apos;d get a sense of how small the levels actually are. Quite the opposite of what valve had written in their game description, boasting about the huge levels. Finding a decent server to play on takes a while due to the general lack of players, unstable dedicated servers, and getting connected to lag-infested servers across the world. They tried to get rid of repetitive play by supposedly introducing an AI director, which spawns zombies and guns at different locations every time you play, but it really doesn&apos;t help out. Repetition tends to be alright for most multi-player gaming (like counterstrike), but it&apos;s unacceptable for a game like l4d since it&apos;s a freaking co-op game. The biggest problem I have with this game is the price that it was sold for. Valve really took advantage of the community by charging $50, releasing a game that can be completed in the same hour range as portal. The biggest disappointment would probably be the versus gameplay. I have never played anything more stupid in my life. Survivors generally have a huge advantage over special infected, and you&apos;ll find yourself dying often until you get a tank. If you can&apos;t kill them with the tank, chances are they&apos;ll win the level. They really should have focused on making the maps larger and introducing vehicles for this game, instead of making the special infected playable. It&apos;s fun puking on the survivors as a boomer for the first 5 minutes, then it&apos;s just monotony and boredom. By writing this review I am not saying this is a bad game, but it is without a doubt, a VERY INCOMPLETE game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=421453">Expand</a></span>

Additionally, because it&apos;s limited to 4 player or 8 player games, the frustration of losing far outweighs gratification of winning. Online players take this to heart, and consequently there are far more gamers in L4D ready to kick someone out of the server because they are new to the game and not a veteran player. This isn&apos;t Valve&apos;s fault, but a shortcoming of small team online FPS, which could be remedied by (read: MORE CONTENT) larger servers and more than 8-player gametypes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=85402">Expand</a></span>

While shooting zombies the first few hours is quite fun and a decent change of pace to the typical FPS, the repetition eventually makes the player a zombie. I was not expecting a co-op only game so I docked points for no single player content or poor decision making single player characters (take your pick). While I find the expert mode the only challenge for my FPS experience level, the lower difficulties help newbies get their feet wet and can make the game both humorous and frustrating. The server interface is non existent. Way too much reliance on dedicated servers that shut down without warning, crash and glitch often and usually match you with the highest ping server possible. Finding a suitable game often becomes a chore, sometimes sitting in a lobby for 5 minutes waiting for a search to finish. I&apos;ve found hosting local games more reliable, but the players that get placed are usually on the other coast or out of country which gives them poor pings. Historically valve has done a decent job in patching the multiplayer experience and I hope this is not the exception. Like Return to Castle Wolfenstein multiplayer, the game is heavily reliant on a teamwork environment so having just one weak player usually means restarting levels often fueling the frustration to find better gaming partners. Server hopping seems to be normal. This game certainly does not apply to the Gung-Ho, Rambo style players. The $50.00 price tag seems a bit steep for the overall entertainment value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=421064">Expand</a></span>

Basically you are buying $50 worth of maps to play in, thats where most of the 7 gig folder size of this game comes from. There are only 7 weapons opposed to the 10 stated in the review: Dual Pistols, Shotgun, Uzi, Ar, Hunting Rifle, Molotov and Pipe bombs. There are only 5 &quot;boss&quot; (that is used very loosely because there is only one true boss in my mind and thats the Tank) mutations in this game. Really only the Tank can be considered a boss, the rest are just mutations: Boomer, Smoker, Hunter, Witch, and Tank The rest of the game&apos;s enemy list is comprised of zombies. There are only 4 scenarios, each with at most 4 map sections. Each play through it will only take an average player that actually plays the game rather then running through the map around 35 to 45 minutes to beat. This means that there is little actual game play time, only around 5 hours. The multiplayer is supposed to be where its at. But verses mode is severely unbalanced and the Co-Op campaigns can easily be ruin by bad players or idiots the run through the map and leave the rest of the team behind in the dust to fend for themselves. Overall, unless the content update in April brings around 2 nre maps to each scenario and 2 new scenarios or ties the current scenarios together and adds new boss infected and new weapons, this is the first game I think i could say shame on Valve for, its a money grabber that leaves us gamers wanting a hell of a lot more then we got or will ever get from valve. In the commentary, forgot where exactly, there is a node where one of the devs says in summery that they skipped out on making lots of content because they wanted the community to make it for them, and that to me is B.S lol.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=423472">Expand</a></span>

Despite the different game modes, and the ingenious devices that promote a cohesive team, the excitement all wears off pretty quickly. The lack of variety stifles the game. The 16 maps, all grouped into quads of 4 called campaigns, seem small after a few hours of play, and very repetitive. Valve was late releasing a map kit for L4D, and only showed a modding community the love after announcing L4D 2, killing anyone desire to mod the game, and smashing any hope of getting additional content for it. The game is fun however, and is worth getting when it hits the 10 dollar bargain bins.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=425207">Expand</a></span>

In long ... OK at first when I started playing I actually got that feeling I had so long ago when Half Life 1 came out and I emptied 2 clips on a head crab out of genuine fear.  And I felt the same thing in this game for about the first 15min of play.  Then it became retarded.  If you stand around pop zombies heads off with a rifle 1 by 1 or throw a pipe bomb and have them all run to it like a shiny red ball you will never get rid of them all.  Somehow there is always more coming like a respawn wave.  Witch at first seems scary because you don&apos;t know when the next wave will come but then becomes stupid because you can&apos;t hold any ground.  In any movie I have ever seen on zombies they can always hold their ground and there are always just a finite number of zombies.  There is a LOT of them but not infinite.  If they would have made it like the movie I am Legend where you tag 1 or 2 here and there then there is a huge random group it would have been great.  Or say you start out in a city 4 of you and 178,567 of them and there is a city population counter going at all times I could have lived with that.  But the way its setup now is just cheap.  No rime or reason just zombie waves coming at you every 5min like clock work.  Some triggers them like a car alarm or throwing a pipe bomb but mostly it&apos;s just retarded.  Say it wasn&apos;t so linear and I could collect items and throw them like we used to in the first counterstrike games then when you have a good number of ammo and bombs you go up on a roof top in a building that you have CLEARED maybe 1 or 2 still hang around that you missed but its god damn cleared and set off that car alarm from the roof by firing at the car and see 5,000 zombies collect around it all confused on why there are no brains to eat then you start chucking bombs and empting shells on them and watch that population counter drop like a rock.  And be able to get in that car like Carmagedon and roll over zombies till your car is trashed from all the zombies punching it or you get in a group that&apos;s way too big and they tare the car apart with you in it like say towards the end of Resident Evil Extinction or on the docks in I am Legend.

Luckily, the PC version is maintained through Valve&apos;s very own STEAM (http://www.Steampowered.com) - this will undoubtedly provide users with major-updates &amp; content-additions (at no charge) for years to come (Just as Valve has done for many of its other titles).  With the additions of these updates (and with the history Valve has with their past titles) it is likely that this game will live up to the 8/9 or even 9/10 score as stated above and by numerous users &amp; reviewers.
<br>
<br>The Flaws:
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>A) 
<br>The most noticeable issue for first-time users of the versus mode is simply the lack of content.  While there are 4 &apos;Movies&apos; in the Cooperative/Single-Player campaigns - in versus, there are only 2; one of them being the least spectacular of the four (Blood Harvest), the other being that which was previewed in the Demo (No Mercy). While both are entertaining initially - they sometimes become tiring and leave you begging for the other two.  Hopefully the addition of the original remaining two (&apos;Death Toll&apos; &amp; &apos;Dead Air&apos;) will be released early 2009</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=77031">Expand</a></span>

The Director does an excellent job of applying some randomness to each campaign so you have to be constantly thinking tactically.  Easy and Normal provide an environment where, unless you are set upon by Special Infected or a Horde, you can roam the map with impunity, the pinned mechanic works wonderfully and a lot of energy and attention has gone in to the visual and auditory style of the game (on my computer, the game is visually beautiful, in a dark and macbre way.)  I don&apos;t even mind the fact that we&apos;re limited to only 4 skins for the Survivors and 6 skins for the special infected (altho, there are effectively thousands of skins for the horde).  The voice acting is excellent also, and there is enough variety that you could probably play for a year and not have heard every line of speech.  Where the game really falls down though is in the online multiplayer, which is a crime of epic proportions when you consider that this is a multiplayer game only.  Matchmaking is barely functional, matching you to difficulty levels (putting you in an Expert game when you asked for a Normal one) and styles (A Versus game instead of a Campaign) and connection issues (joining you to a full game 4 times in a row) and connection issues (repeatedly timing out even when you&apos;ve got &quot;4 bars&quot; good latency and matching you to servers on another continent where everyone&apos;s latency is &quot;1 bar&quot; bad bad bad.)  I play, and will continue to play, and will even look forward to both fan released content and content released by Valve.  I won&apos;t even hold this title much against Valve, since they purchased the title well in to it&apos;s development and had to live with the flaws of it&apos;s original developers.  But, I am disappointed. 6 our of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=77124">Expand</a></span>

The reason behind this is probably the fact that I purchased the game almost a year after his release, after a year, most of the players lost their interest and i found actually hard to find a server with 3 players to start a campaign.</span>

ALSO Theres 4 Wepons!?!?!?!?! i mean 4 wepons? i was expecting;- more shotguns,RPGs maybe? More machine guns maybe baseball bats and crowbars.ao thats the reason i scored a 2/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=77944">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Id LOVE to be able to rate this game higher, the redeeming factor of L4D 2 coming out on Nov 17th does add some excitement, however, the fact its the same thing over and over and the fact that , besides myself, about 20,000 other people who feel the game was incomplete to begin with WILL NOT be buying. dont be cheap Valve, give moneys worth.... sadly disappointed.

I had lots of fun learning the game but now am tired of the struggle: I see no comments about the shortcomings so maybe no one is using the mouse and keyboard like I have to. The frustration is in the crossover reality shortcomings: the weapons are mismatched and the people are as well. Why can&apos;t I run faster than the Tank? I should at least be on par so I can dodge the stupid thing. And the best gun is the repeating shotgun and the worst is the pump action shotgun. The best weapon Should be the AR-15(M16) but it is not really here except as a visual. I think the programmers should portray it as a pellet pistol because that&apos;s all the damage I can do with the game version! The programmers should go out and try some of the guns at the shooting range or at least talk to people familiar with the weapons. I have a problem with the reality of changing the magazine and clearing a dud round etc, but give me a 300 round can and not the 50 round, or give a realistic hit level for the zombies. 4000 hits to take down a Tank!?Way too much. For Example,with the AR-15, I can kill you with less than the 20 rounds in a small clip in about 5 seconds, break every bone in your body and you&apos;d be dead before the 10th round; so 4000 hits without any visible damage and having to change clips at least 20 times in teamwork or depend on fire or something else to stop the attack, is crazy. I also would like to carry more than one pipebomb, trudging around to get another one takes too much time, I would even give up some ammo for the weight. it&apos;s too frustrating mixing reality with fantasy, I guess I hate being at a disadvantage with superior firepower, it doesn&apos;t make much sense. Last note on weapons; there is a NATO option to have a mix of AP and tracer bullets for the M16, let&apos;s get some!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=421093">Expand</a></span>

However, the game is let down wi th a lack of content, ridiculously stupid AI, buggy levels and more exploits than your average beta release. The single player modes are quite simply, a pointless feature. It is neigh on impossible to complete any of the &quot;movies&quot; on the expert campaigns. Whats worse, with the new &quot;survivor mode&quot;, world rankings simply haven&apos;t been included because of the large number of exploits and bugs in each of the 16 maps, with all but 1 taken from the 4 poorly produced &quot;movies&quot; the game has to offer. Great to play with friends as a team, but its not much different than counterstrike with the same flat appearance. The game also has a lack of strategic weaponry, lack of matchmaking options, and if you want to pay the hefty price of &#xA3;28 for the game... you&apos;d be better waiting till its at least below &#xA3;20. Newer players to the FPS genre are also recommended to avoid this game, as the community seems to have adopted a no new player attitude.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=423769">Expand</a></span>

You get two multiplayer modes either campaign co-op or versus. The problem in multiplayer is that one person is the director and while this could enhance the game by spawning infected to make the level harder or challenging, some just play around with players by pushing them off buildings or spawning 30 witches in front of the safehouse. The game isn&apos;t really that scary you hear the special infected while they are 100 yards away so you know they are coming long before you see them. As for opening doors or looking in dark rooms yes there may be an infected behind the door but 9 out of 10 times they are facing away and just stand there after you shine the light on them. A friend talked me into buying this game and I feel like I just wasted $40 on something worth $10. Also don&apos;t get this unless you have friends who also have the game as the average player is aged 13-15 and will boot you from the game lobby if you don&apos;t have some experience with multiplayer first which one of my friends learned after being booted from the first 5 games he tried to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=424146">Expand</a></span>

Levels are short and boring, if they bring out some new stuff for it than i may upgrade to a 7/10 but its pretty boring.</span>

Now the real price this game is actually worth content-wise is $5. Only a handful of weapons, 4 playable zombie classes, and even less than a handful of playable campaigns with less than mediocre level design. Then again, I guess anything would be considered gold if it had zombies in it.</span>

The lack of solid variety and content ans the minimal replay value make the game rather luke warm after the second play through. I was hoping for more given the 49.99 price tag</span>

It will be an inferior game in less than 3 months. You will have next to no further content for these next 6 months due to L4D2&apos;s attention. Still reading? You sure? Fine. Buy this game and you can kiss the next 10 weeks of free time you thought you had. This game is exponentially addictive, with its Survival, Versus, Campaign, and Single player mode. If you are handy with the DPS&apos;s steel, dive right into a Online Campaign game, grab an uzi or a shotgun and start blating away. Be careful, friendly fire hits are actually realistic here, especially in Expert. Accidentally shoot your teammate in the back with an uzi? He is going down.... fast. Cover each other and remember to always move forward. Maybe wanna see how brains taste? Jump into a versus game and cooperate with you teammates to set up ambushes and deadly traps, maybe hit that damage pounce off the building, maybe peek around from a corner and vomit over them..... or just sneakily pull the last one over the side of whatever vertical object makes the biggest SPLAT! Want to play that endless zombie panic, where ammo is tight and you wish you had a baseball bat? Check out survival... grab some propane tanks and gasoline cans, set them out at key choke points, flip the switch and start mowing them down, blowing them up, or making them do the zombie disco inferno. My origonal score for this game would have absolutely been a 10, but the lack of content is a killer. more than a year after release all they could come up with is hijacking the MOD community&apos;s ideas. 1 new minimap, not a full campaign. Good news is the mods are making up for Valve&apos;s stupidity, creating their own maps, betaing them, fixing them, and releasing them to the public. Even though the game is a year old and change, still expect some bugs, some more annoying than others. Steam&apos;s platform is questionable as well, often not allowing you to connect to something as simple as a friends list, not allowing you to one-click-join a friend&apos;s game from desktop. It adds up, and quickly at that. Lastly, you have the first promised main update to l4d1, which was to include new guns (&quot;no re-skins whatsoever&quot;, valve&apos;s own words) and a bazooka, RPG, whatever your name preference..... Still waiting. 9 months. GG True score for this game should be 50/100, because being pathetically late on your promises and cashing out just a year in, is just ridiculous. Hindsight says the only time this game was worth buting was a 1/2 price weekend deal for $20. Even then, its questionable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=83066">Expand</a></span>

At this current time (9/25/09), this game has the longevity of around 3-4 weeks. When this game was released the graphics were behind almost two PC generations. The music is OK, it sort-of fits the games theme. It is plagued by horrible AI, which seems to do nothing but shoot and run, rarely saves the players from the special infected, lack of updates, graphics that are not up to date, broken levels on versus mode (this is accurate some of the levels are completely unfinished yet valve released them.) My advise, only buy this if you are willing to take a risk on this game even though it is halfway broken you might get some fun out of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=85142">Expand</a></span>

As a huge fan of the Half-Life saga and an obessive online player of TF2, Valve have always impressed me with a great range of well developed games. Then along came L4D and what a dissapointment this turned out to be, this is far from Valve&apos;s epic work and have produced something that has been done before by other devs(in terms of zombie survival horror). This zombie shooter is not original in any way, boring beyond belief killing zombie, after zombie after zombie, very repetative, no story to keep you gripped it is just an average &quot;arcade&quot; shooter. There are a lot more better zombie shooters out there, with more original ideas, a plot and better action. I respect Valve for what they have attempted here but dispite being a fan of their work I am going to have to turn away from this horrible game. I will just sit tightly now and wait for HL2:Episode 3 at least that will be something good to look forward to :) P.S. This game is overated I&apos;ve decided and Valve could have done a better job.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=419953">Expand</a></span>

L4D is the ultimate tribute to the zombie horror genre that George A Romero is so famously recognized for. The game has everything you need, the characters, the zombie types, even the cheesy script and music are present. 
<br>
Gameplay is fast and fun and set in a variety of locations. There are fantastic finales to each campaign and each one can take you hours to get through. Anyone who says that the game is too short is obviously playing on easy mode... Try expert guys. 
<br>
The weapons in the game are good although diversity throughout the different campaigns would have been nice. There just aren&apos;t enough weapons here and technically two of the stronger guns are just upgrades of the shotgun and uzi. 
<br>
Graphically the game is strong, especially when you have hordes of 30+ zombies charging at you. The steam engine has really been taken to the next level with L4D.
<br>
<br>Although L4D has alot of replay value there definetally isn&apos;t enough content. As i&apos;ve said before there aren&apos;t enough weapons (You&apos;ll have encountered every one by your second level of play) but there also aren&apos;t enough characters. Having just 4 people to a game creates a nice balance and keeps the scenarios tense, but this atmosphere is broken slightly when your character dies and the exact same one is rescued from a side room minutes later. More boss zombies would also have been nice that could have been interchanged at each boss fight, hence allowing the director greater control of what was spawned. At the moment you always know which levels a tank is going to appear in. More boss zombies would keep the players on their toes. The number of user interactions are fairly small aswell. You can&apos;t share ammo or all of your equiptment with other players or give them guns. More interaction would have been very nice...
<br>
<br>Overall L4D earns a 7 from me. It&apos;s an excellent game but perhaps not good enough to empty the servers of css. Hopefully the modding community will show some great new media for the game in the near future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=76744">Expand</a></span>

<br>Anyway.  The game has pros and cons, but like ALL multiplayer games you need a good team that works well together or you end up with n00bs that run away from you and do their own thing.  If you have a group of friends that play well together you will have an awesome experience.  Don&apos;t expect to just play with anybody and expect them to back you up the whoule time.

<br>
<br>The Good
<br>I won&apos;t say much about the good, since everyone else has for me. I absolutely love zombie games and this game has a lot of potential. I love how team play is emphasized. If your team has stragglers, a boss zombie will no doubt take advantage. There are several instances where conservation of health pickups and grenades can save a team in the most unsurvivable situations. Graphics were good, and I was impressed with the level of detail in the maps.
<br>
<br>The Bad
<br>This game was highly touted for its AI, but I was not impressed. Even with all the random spawning, maps are still incredibly predictable. This makes the replayability low for some people. Especially since there is only 4 maps. What&apos;s worse is that each map plays almost identically as follows:
<br>
<br>Start with crappy weapon, horde, boss, rest, horde, boss, rest, flip a switch, horde, boss, rest, second pistol, horde, boss, next level, horde, boss, rest, horde, boss, rest, better guns, horde, boss, rest, flip a switch, etc...
<br>
<br>While the end of each map is a fun 10 minute king of the hill game, it&apos;s exactly the same with each map. I really wish they had thought out the objectives. It&apos;s sad that you can get better objectives from some Joe Nobody making a map on zpanic than with this $50 glorified, &quot;end all&quot; zombie game. 
<br>
While the versus mode is cool, the wait time for the zombie players in game is very annoying. And the lack of choice of what boss you are is additionally frustrating. It&apos;d be nice if you could play as a regular zombie as you wait for boss spawn. Also, a custom spawn limit for boss zombies might be nice to give survivers a better or worse chance.
<br>
<br>I am really hoping that as updates and mods come out, we will see different objectives, more than basic weapons, and more playable zombies (and zombie choice).
<br>
<br>All in all, 
<br>Buyer beware, this game is NOT worth $50, but with good updates may be in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=77125">Expand</a></span>

When I first opened it and started playing I was impressed with how smooth it is but as the next 2 hours roll on I had already played through the 4 levels offered in the game and yeah like everyone has stated there is really nothing random in the game because all the zombies and items are in the same place every single time . Now of course you can always play Versus Mode which is ok for a while too until the server crashes which it almost always ends up doing which is really annoying and I can appreciate them trying to make it more realistic with friendly fire but when you get some one who is trigger happy and can&apos;t aim worth a damn you end up getting shot which I understand that&apos;s the whole point but that gets a little old too when you get some 12yr old who doesn&apos;t know what the hell they&apos;re doing. There are definitive pros and cons in the game . Maybe if they created some sort of memory erasing device that you could use before the start of every game because the 1st time playing it i had a lot of fun then after that was downhill.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=77246">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Playing online with other people depends on the luck of the draw.  You may be in a good group, or maybe not.  I wish that I could play with people who have had actual training.  Playing with the bots means that you are in a cooperative, but mediocre, group.  The bots seem to have an attraction for being in front of my gun&apos;s muzzle.
<br>
<br>I wish that Valve would get guns right.  Firing pistols two-handed is actually the worst thing you can do.  In the game, it&apos;s second to an M-16.  When you want to throw a molotov or pipe bomb, you have to stare at it a bit, like it&apos;s some kind of art object.  There are no speed loaders for the shotguns, so shells are stuffed in one by one.  Firing the pump shotgun is slow, when in practice it&apos;s quite fast.  The pistols are actually the main weapons in the game, as they can fire nearly as fast as a machine gun and never run out of ammunition.
<br>
<br>The game play is very simple: kill the zombies, again and again and again.  The action is very intense, and the &quot;director&quot; AI will keep you on your toes, maybe a bit too much.  The bots will jump around, once in a while appearing to ricochet around a room, so not hitting them with &quot;friendly&quot; fire is difficult.  A player or bot can be incapacitated by a &quot;special&quot; infected.  Multiple times the player bots have left me to &quot;die,&quot; so I have to listen to my character&apos;s pitiful cries for help until the game resets.  I wish that I could direct the player bots to a location, instead of just hoping that they would follow me.  The characters occasionally chat amongst themselves, so you learn that Francis hates everything, except dentists.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=77275">Expand</a></span>

It made l4d a lot more boring. It was a game you should rent or try it out but I would wait until it gets to around $20. (Not to be mean but its a wallop when it first came out around $49.99). It&apos;s not recomended on xbox 360 since its even more harder to control and boringer. Yet on the PC is a breeze in the wind. So try it out yet i suggest a price drop since left 4 dead 2 is coming out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=738543">Expand</a></span>

There is no suspense in the game, no way to develop any kind of strategy aside from killing everything that moves. This is like being in a Rob Zombie mosh pit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=78949">Expand</a></span>

Infact it&apos;s even less. There&apos;s a real lack of content here and it certainly isn&apos;t worth the &#xA3;26.99 it&apos;s being sold for atm, I bought it during a promotion for &#xA3;14.99 and still feel slighty ripped off. There&apos;s a lack of weapons, a lack of enemies, a lack of levels (4 campains broken into 5 smaller levels, takes about 40 minutes to do a campain, 50 minutes max, so that&apos;s 4 hour of gameplay, which is very very poor for a full commercial release. You get more length from Pac Man) and a lack of choice within those levels (you run, gun, pick up med kit, heal buddy, recieve snidey remarks from children, hit a scripted trigger, enter zombies, repeat). The way it was advertised and the length it was in development made me expect more from it, especially the price tag and the fact it&apos;s a full commercial release. I&apos;ve seen mods with more content than this, and those guys don&apos;t get paid! The user interface needs some serious work, you dont even get to choose what server you join, the computer picks for you and 9 times out of 10 it picks a laggy server in verses mode even though you clearly clicked co-op (and vice versa). If you&apos;re like me and remember people names, you&apos;ll remember the people from games that were total idiots, or kids and won&apos;t want to play with them, unfortunatly you cant see who you&apos;re joining till your loading the server up and the joy of that is when it picks the server you&apos;ve just left 4 times in a row. Not good. Also using quick match takes forever as it starts connecting to full servers and bounces you back to the menu, it did this to me a wopping 17 times before i finally gave up and headed onto some better, ie/ TF2. TheUI can be fixed quite easily, but the length it&apos;s been out suggests to me they aren&apos;t going to do it. And now the gameplay, fun when you join chaps that actually want YOU to live as well as themselves, but the chances of that happening is very small. I&apos;ve only joined a few games where team work has actually been used. Most of the time it&apos;s just every man for himself and first guy to the med kits heals as many times as possible so the others suffer (there&apos;s only 4 at each point, one each). I remember my frst Tank sighting, I was pummeled as everyone ran away from it (me being arrogant thought my shotty would blast his face off, I was greated with a big meaty fist), whilst he beat me to a pulp the others killed him, then refused to help me up and ran away hitting the &apos;Laugh&apos; key, leaving me to slowly die whilst casting a vote to kick me. I really felt the love in my first ever game. My advice, if your looking for a team game with loads of content and replay value, by TeamFortress 2, it&apos;s got more to offer, isn&apos;t anywhere near as expensive and doesn&apos;t contain as many idiots (usually, it has its moments when teh new class packs are released). However, if you like playing the same strech of scenery with the same monsters popping in the same places enjoy navigating through a crappy, broken menu, love waiting to find servers only to be greated with lag and absolutley must play with ignorent, childish morons that you&apos;re supposed to work with and help out even though they&apos;ve shot you in the face, vomitted abuse at you, used all the med packs, left you for dead (I apologise for that) voted to kick you and set you on fire, you must buy this. The players of this game have killed my willingness to give medpacks to others... They&apos;re mine... All mine!... *twitches* I don&apos;t hate the game, it can be a laugh with mates (when we all have time), but I hate 90% of the people I&apos;ve played with. People will say it&apos;s not teh games fualt that I get thrust into servers with idiots, but it is. There&apos;s no way of avoiding mongtard players, there for it is the games fault. You can mute them, why can&apos;t you opt to avoid them? And this seriously isn&apos;t worth the money Valve are charging for it. If it was &#xA3;10 and the interface was sorted, it&apos;d get maybe a 6, and if immature planks were banned from life it&apos;d get a 7. If both applied, it&apos;d get an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=422079">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunate as that may be, it can last for a while with the co-op playability. Still, as cool as this game should have been, I just don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth paying $49.99.

Anyone else should use that cash to buy Call of Duty 4 or World at War.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/left-4-dead/user-reviews?user_review_id=76715">Expand</a></span>
