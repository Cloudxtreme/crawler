This certainly makes up for a great deal of the challenge (being to close to hit an enemy) and causes a lot of yelling things like &quot;come on!&quot; and &quot;wtf? srsly?&quot; The bow n arrow is aimed by your right analog stick but the aiming is so finnicky and will reset if you dont hold the stick at the same angle which also leads to yelling. But you know what? I really didn&apos;t die because of any of these things and I plyed to the end and enjoyed myself. The story is compelling, the art design is unique to say the least and beautiful to say the most, and the ending is damn satisfying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/apotheon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4960709">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is really fun, you get to use a lot of different melee and ranged weapons that require different tactics.  The combat mechanics are well made and the boss battles are epic.  The game gives you a good challenge without being frustrating - even if you choose champion difficulty.  There are quite a few secrets to find in the different maps giving the game some replay value.
<br>The voice acting could have been a little better but still fits well in the context of the game.
<br>This is a great setting for a video game with a great story and a must for any fan of Greek mythology.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/apotheon/user-reviews?user_review_id=5274982">Expand</a></span>

Apotheon offers good balance of engaging story, platforming, fighting and puzzles all wrapped up in breathtaking art style inspired by Ancient Greek pottery. Despite the fact that it was developed by small studio,  Apotheon has great production values including polished gameplay, amazing soundtrack and AAA quality of voice acting. Single player offers about 10 hours of gameplay and based on difficulty I dare to say that both hardcore and more casual player will be satisfied! Plus - You can still try to compete in multiplayer with your friends!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/apotheon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4948121">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>A Metroidvania-like game with a pretty nice art-style, good combat and a (so far) nice story. There&apos;s a bit of crafting, a lot of fighting and quite some diversity when it comes to weapons and how they change the play style. So far I would say 8/10, the score could improve if I&apos;m more into the game.</span>

Apotheon surprisingly respects the myths and the personas of deities and other mythological characters and creatures.And the result is pretty fantastic.
<br>Platforming is solid and easy, with context sensitive features that help out climbing ledges. Combat is very fun once you get used to the controls. Every weapon is a throwable, and you can also throw rocks and explosive jars to enemies. Boss fights feel unique and well thought out and the various areas for each God offer wide diversity and keep the game interesting.
<br>The main campaign also feels huge, and there is also a cool local vs mode, but you will need two controllers to enjoy the latter one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/apotheon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4952339">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game itself is good fun, I wish the difficultly was a little more forgiving early on (leading to me turning the difficulty back down but now I&apos;m walking all over it...) and the game&apos;s beautiful look very quickly plays second fiddle to the gameplay, exploring and combat on offer.

Now being a huge fan of Greek history/civilization, I was very interested to see something that wasn&#x2019;t exactly like the usual take on that time period/civilization, but had to force myself to not think about it too much as the wait began. Fast forward to today and having played through around 5 hours of Apotheon, I have to say the game has impressed me very much so far.
<br>
<br>I absolutely love the visuals and little details within the game, which is heavily based on the art seen on ancient Greek pottery, conveying a dream-like feel as you wander the various areas within the game. The color scheme used for each area is very interesting, often going for a monochromatic look for many (if not all, as I have not completed the game as of yet) areas of the world, which gives the game a very nice and consistent look, yet each area within the game still feels distinct.
<br>
<br>The character and creature renderings are very well done and highly stylized, and while I myself love it, it may not appeal to those who like a less stylized feel. That being said, I feel that the rendering of the animals, humans, creatures, and gods are spot on and doesn&#x2019;t go overboard with excessive details (understandable given the style of ancient Greek art) giving everything a nice and streamlined look, while maintaining the little flourishes here and there where it counts (like the lines that adorn the body of elk/deer/hind/whatever they&#x2019;re called).
<br>
<br>The combat system is actually pretty simplified, yet interesting, with different types of swings/thrusts being at your disposal (depending on the position of the mouse), with much of combat being about timing, movement, and matching up weapons that are better suited to the current fight to give you the most advantage.
<br>
<br>The world of Apotheon is a destructible one, so don&#x2019;t get too attached to your weapons or shields as they will eventually wear down and break.. This rule also extends to the objects that inhabit the game world, with many being able to be destroyed with possible spoils to be looted.
<br>
<br>The game is surprisingly visceral as well, which I didn&#x2019;t really expect, showing spurts of blood when you strike a creature/person, while a mortally wounded enemy will cough and choke and gurgle as they lay dying.
<br>
<br>Musically, the score is beautiful, although it does hit the wailing woman trope a lot and it knows when to add an exclamation point to a scene and when to linger in the background, adding more wonder/tension to exploration and combat, respectively.
<br>
<br>All this is well and good, but probably the thing I love the most about Apotheon is the lack of constraint in the way you approach the game, which is more of a sandbox than anything else. Of course its not completely open world like Oblivion or Skyrim, but its open enough to allow me to explore the world at my leisure and really communicates the feel (or illusion) of freedom very well as you wander about, as well as a sense of wonder as you uncover new areas or secrets.
<br>
<br>Within this open world, animals wander and flee from you, citizens go about their (although limited) business, while friends and enemies populate the wilds and are always spawning, giving the game a sometimes frantic pace. In this, resource management is key, as is keeping a nice healthy stock of weapons and supplies.
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s not a perfect game, make no mistake in that, as it does have some issues with the controls (at least getting used to using the mouse to aim) that take some time to get acclimated to. Difficulty seems to be above average (or I could be wandering around where I shouldn&#x2019;t be&#x2026;) and it does feel like I&#x2019;m fighting for my life sometimes, which keeps the pressure on and provides a healthy amount of tension.
<br>
<br>I have to say I am biased about Apotheon, in the sense that it is a game that happens to have the features I most appreciate in a game, any game, but I also feel that it is a strong title overall, but is probably not for everyone. If you love Greek mythology and history, or if you&#x2019;re a fan of open world action/platformers/rpgs that don&#x2019;t really hold your hand, you&#x2019;ll love this game. I had some very cautious expectations of this title before release and have not been disappointed yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/apotheon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4957734">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not just an artsy indie game, and the more you play the better it gets.
<br>
<br>The game takes place almost entirely on Mt Olympus, and has you visit different areas. There are 2 main hub locations (Agora and Acropolis), and each one contains doorways to a number of other areas. Some of these areas belong to a specific deity, whilst others are just bonus locations. Most of the game&apos;s story involves you simply undertaking tasks for each Olympian deity and eventually confronting them one way or another.
<br>
<br>This is not just a simple 2D platformer. The game has quite an open world and really knows how to reward exploration. There are tonnes of optional areas and hidden secrets, and a huge variety of weapons to collect, many of which are uniques. There&apos;s always some delicious surprise around a corner or behind a breakable wall. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the Metroid style games, so if you&apos;ve ever enjoyed those, you should have a fun time with Apotheon as well.
<br>
<br>Despite the enormous amount of fun I&apos;ve had, I&apos;ve also come across a lot of frustration, which was somewhat disappointing. As some people already pointed out, the combat, although fun and enjoyable, can be a bit tricky and awkward at times, because you have to time your swings really well. Not much of a problem most of the time, but it can be a nightmare when fighting fast moving enemies that either jump at you or fly around.
<br>
<br>There were some parts of the game where frustration came mostly from controls, such as trying to quickly outclimb the fast-rising flames of river Phlegethon, but most times it was in the boss fights. Although some bosses were a fun challenge, a fair few were frustrating beyond belief and involved mechanics which did not make much sense, like Diomedes being completely invulnerable unless you&apos;ve thrown a jar of blood at him to stun him, or Zeus somehow being weak to his own lightning bolts, but managing to shrug off blades, clubs, and fire like they were nothing.
<br>
<br>Still, despite the frustrating sections, I&apos;ve had a very fun playthrough. The music is also really fantastic and fits the areas perfectly. The most noteworthy one being the eerie track that plays in Hades. So for the most part, this is a really memorable and unique game. I would highly recommend you check it out if you&apos;ve ever at least remotely enjoyed 2D platformers and sidescrollers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/apotheon/user-reviews?user_review_id=5213593">Expand</a></span>
