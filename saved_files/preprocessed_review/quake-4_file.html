Well, balance seems to be an issue with Quake 4 - sometimes the gameplay gets way to hard! - Vehicle situations are VERY difficult relative to the rest of the game play. Seems like you are being hit from all directions with limited weapons to defend yourself with, poor maneuverability, and quick death. - Occasional poor ammo placement. Sometimes I find myself in a situation with a lot of enemies and not a lot of ammo. Unless I missed something (I didn&apos;t, I checked a number of times), I&apos;m going into areas outnumbered and out gunned. - Some of the enemies are nearly unstoppable. That&apos;s fine for bosses, but geez, how about some more tactical challenges instead of having to brut-force these guys? Other than these issues though, the game has it going on with great environments, characters, combat, and story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=56730">Expand</a></span>

However, it&apos;s oozing cinematic flair, thanks largely to superb voice acting, and has a lovely plethora of weapons to create hell with, so it&apos;s not all bad. Just be expected to be clicking that quickload button quite a bit towards the end of the game.</span>

Its not.. play the game and you&apos;ll find it has a awesome storyline and great gameplay. Well done to raven software for another disturbing atmospheric single player experience. Now keep up that great work and make us Soldier of Fortune 3!</span>

First of I thought I was playing doom for the first 20 minutes of the game and that ticked me off. But after I played a bit more the game became quite unique, Its still the same ass all other FPS run and shoot, but at least in Quake 4 you are able to see some of the strangest things ever. Some of the things you see within this game I have never expected to see in almost any video game, the level of graphic violance is so great to see in a dark game like this, If you have a computer that can take the ravagings of the Doom engine and you love violance and gore in games then this game is for you stop reading this and go buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=56635">Expand</a></span>

You charicter doesn&apos;t say anything but all those guys around you will completely distract you from that fact. You really feel like your apart of somthing in this game. The story has been found to be shalow by some people but that part is pretty much up to you. However there is a major twist in the story. I won&apos;t ruin it for you but it is deffinetly the most shocking story twists I have ever seen. The A.I was good you guys really help you which imerses you even more into the expereance. The multi-player was very fun and traditional. Its mainly quake 3 with better graphics and a couple of new maps one new weapon. The dark matter gun. IT OWNS. In my opinion this game is classic I could go on for a long time about it. If you like shooters BUY IT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=70871">Expand</a></span>

I have both and F.E.A.R. doesn&apos;t not have a story worth remembering. Quake4 is more involving and at least there is a variety of enemies to kill unlike the overrated F.E.A.R.</span>

Even 7 years after its original release this game looks great, has snappy weapons, solid AI, and beautiful graphics, and is raw fun. Overall score 9. Played in 2012.03 on Win7 installed using XP SP2 compatibility. DRM CD Key only, no activation. [Story] You play as a marine with the main mission to dismantle the Strogg command facilities on their home planet. An adult title with hyperviolence, including a sick sequence where you are captured and get surgically converted to Strogg. [Challenges] The scenarios are mostly a mix of corridor shoot outs, medium and large area showdowns. You will get good at mixing up your snipper shots with medium to short range weapons. Tight movement controls allow for good use of cover in the fire fights and a much more satisfying gun fight. Strafe strafe strafe. On normal difficulty level this was mostly an easy romp - but some of the large arenas swamped me... I solved it by using a better match between the gun (a choice of ten weapons) and the foe - and that is always satisfying. Pick ups along the way are so generous that saving is almost not necessary, the autosaves and the level saves are good enough. This is not a sandbox game and there is no real exploring.<br><br><br>[My PC] i7-2600K 3.4GHz / ASUS Z68 ProGen3 / 8Gig RAM / Radeon 6870 / 1920x1200 / W7 PRO SP1 [Graphics score 10] The game world looks great and mood disturbing as war should be. The frame rate is flawless.<br>[Controls score 10] I always play with a Logitech keyboard and a Kensington trackball. Remapping the keys in game was easy. [Sound score 10] I always play with headphones. Voice acting and SFX are great.<br><br>[MyFavorites] [PC Win7] Rage [PC XP] DeuxExHumanRevolution&amp;TheMissingLink DeadSpace1&amp;2 Fallout3 FalloutNewVegas HalfLife1&amp;2 Bordelands BatmanArkumAsylum AssassinsCreed1 Magicka RedFaction Portal1&amp;2 FromDust MrRobot Sam&amp;MaxSeasons1&amp;2 CulpaInnata TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland DreamfallTheLongestJourney Syberia1&amp;2 CrayonPhysicsDeluxe DefenseGridTheAwakening PlantsVsZombies Prototype Bioshock1&amp;2 UnrealTournament3 Quake4 [360] AfroSamurai BrutalLegends [XBOX] HALO KOTOR1&amp;2 Crackdown ArmedAndDangerous AggressiveInline BeyondGoodAndEvil DeadOrAlive1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;ExtremeBeachVolleyball Psychonauts [AppleG4] DeusExMachina ReturnToZork Suspended UnrealTournament TombRaiderSeries Suspended [MyUnhappyGames] WoW {boring} [Born] 1964</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=2207992">Expand</a></span>

This is a focused corridor shooter with great weapons and cool environments, the kind of game that&apos;s beginning to fade into history. It&apos;s still a very pretty game even by todays standards with atmospheric lighting and good looking enemy models. However the vehicle sections and outdoor areas do look dated now. To be honest I didn&apos;t think they looked great in 2005 either. The game and game engine (id tech 4) are at their best in the dark techno-horror corridors of the many Strogg installations. I can highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fun blaster with plenty of challenge. Its typical ID / Raven and people who have grown up with their games will love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=2509768">Expand</a></span>

If I were a parent, I would refuse to buy my child an Xbox 360 just so that they don&apos;t ever get their hands on this game. The gameplay itself is aged too. It&apos;s Quake, but there&apos;s nothing new except the graphics. No new weapons, no new ideas, just more run and shoot with the same old gear. Unreal 2004 released a ton of new ideas with the use of vehicles and new maps, but Quake 4 feels very much like Quake 3. The graphics are beautiful and the lighting is excellent, but the game is very lacking of new ideas. I don&apos;t need to pay $60 for some new maps. I do not recommend buying Quake 4 until the price drops significantly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=56722">Expand</a></span>

There is no myth under it, no mystery, no charisma, no &apos;thought&apos; underlying this concept. Its just the idea that worked well in the past decade and the lesser of the creative minds just keep bashing the same old boring concepts in the current generation of games as well. Quake had been an awesome game, but its speciality has been due to whatever &apos;mystical&apos; side it got to show in quake-1 and quake-3-arena games of the series. Quake 2 took it to a more science fiction side rather than the witchcraft appeal that suits the quake world better. knowing that quake 4 was coming got me excited to see the q3-arena look done to the better in the current gen of consoles. But it didn&apos;t...they have taken up the quake-2 stuff, that boring half demon-half robot monsters stuff whose cyborg nature is totally theoryless, the story which offers sheerly senseless plot, and the thing that got doom 3 undertaken...the repetition, all are mastered in quake 4. Although the Doom 3 did look better than quake 4, quake 4 does have gameplay advantages over doom 3. The vehicle stuff is good, but the particle effects are as &apos;old&apos; and &apos;bitmappy&apos;(rather than 3D) as doom 3 portrayed. I think its just enough with these type of gaming thoughts and directions, although the same boring direction is still coming up in games like &apos;prey&apos; and &apos;gears of war&apos;, please people, let demons be demons and machines be machines ! and think more in terms of exoticness and immersiveness !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=56598">Expand</a></span>

If it would not have been for occasional help by other soldiers in the game, it would have been spitting image of the Doom 3. I agree, since when is the graphic more important then gameplay!</span>

                                        <span> I have to say I like it more than doom 3. They sorta messed up the engine while trying to improve it in some ways but didn&apos;t hurt is all the way. Gameplay was pretty fun and was intense right from the start. If you say it&apos;s boring you probably didn&apos;t play it on medium difficulty or highter. Makes it more fun.</span>

                                        <span> not the best of th quake series, but the graphics do make it better than the others (graphic wise). The game IS doom3 because it uses the same engine, it is by the same people. It is just a doom 3 with a different tory and different weapons. the game is dark, but it is supposed to be, to show how the aliens live. It may not have new ideas but it is a fun play.</span>

Multiplayer leaves little to be desired; quite a step down from Quake III. Fantastic graphics with a lot of options so that the game can be ran well on most systems. I have an Athlon 3500 with 2 GB RAM and a 6800 GT video card and at 1600 x 1200 res I average between 30 and 60 FPS. The anti-aliasing is too much for my system though, but at high res, the pixels are small enough that it looks godd enough without AA or AF. The game graphics are extremely dark and I had to move the gamm slider up to see where I was going. Game has god sound, but almost no options aside from a master volume control. Sound options are important to me, because I hate loud in-game music and the effects are often too loud, the combined effect of the two often make the voices hard to hear. Very creative assortment of weapons. Why do only the pistol and machine gun have flashlights? This game is apparently set in the distant future, and currently night vision technology is thirty years old. The AI is fair but the variety of enemies is well thought out. Why are NPC chracters not packing good weapons? The best weapon they will have is the hyperblaster. The gore is also a good feature, other FPS games are too benign in that respect. Most of the story mode maps are Strogg bases. It would have been nice to have some decent outdoor maps, maybe some wild alien landscapes a la Halo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=57520">Expand</a></span>

This game tries to have a bunch of characters in it, but all of the characters suck. Dealing with these assholes and being on the ship wastes a ton of time and it slows the game down. The driving parts sucked. A lot of the weapons sucked. The shotgun only has 40 ammo max, machine gun is useless, nailgun has exploding ammo so it can&apos;t be used close range, hyperblaster bounces off walls so it can&apos;t be used close range, explosives are not close range, railgun is mostly a sniper weapon. Can you guess what range most of the fighting is? You guessed it - close range. It&apos;s like the developers took Quake 2 and thought &quot;let&apos;s cripple the hell out of this game then improve the graphics or something and call it Quake 4&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=74772">Expand</a></span>

The guns are amazingly fun to shoot, and the teammates aren&apos;t too dumb, which is a change for friendly A.I., but they still have trouble between understanding how they need to move to avoid fire and follow the player at the same time, which is always present in video games. The enemy AI doesn&apos;t really get advanced until you meet these orange-suited guys in the second half, but it&apos;s worth it. As with all Raven games, the art direction is fantastic. The environments are beautifully designed, and the sound is amazing. Again, the second half of the game is mentioned, as piles of bodies and guts, flayed human skin, and gigantic Strogg blood vessels are strewn about the environment making it lovingly dark and eerie. By the end the number of bosses you face (including the silly &quot;challenge room&quot;) is ridiculous, but the boss fights are amazing, also a property of Raven games. The story is pretty puh and meh, and many things are stereotypical of science fiction, but it&apos;s is a typical video game that doesn&apos;t carry its own torch, but excels in many ways.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=85836">Expand</a></span>

The game play is very old school but done to perfection for what it is. The gore didn&apos;t bother me at all, found it quite entertaining actually. An excellent selection of bad guys and weapons to smoke them with specially liked the dark matter gun. On the downside it&apos;s pretty demanding on your PC, I&apos;ve got 3.4Ghz P4 / Geforce 6800 / 2 Gigs RAM and I could really only run it everything set at medium. It looked okay but I would love to see this game with it cranked up on full. I found this far superior to Doom 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=57026">Expand</a></span>

Similar to Doom 3 in mechanics as would be expected. Tons of those little computer screens like Doom. A lot of the weapons are pretty much rehashes of Doom 3 weapons, ie, Grenade Launcher, Machine Gun (which isn&apos;t even a machine gun, more of an assault rifle or SMG type thing, why does id always call them that?) &quot;Blaster&quot; which is basically the pistol with infinite ammo, Shotgun, etc. Characters you meet throughout the game will sometimes randomly offer to upgrade some of your weapons. Most of them get a kind of modification, some a lot more useful than others. The enemies are reasonably varied but some of the common foot soldiers are especially predictable and almost all enemies display fairly dimwitted AI. Mastering the art of strafing while scoring consistent hits is a must for those sudden close encounters.
<br>
<br>A significant part of the game is spent both going solo and fighting in small groups with your AI teammates, which are usually helpful enough if you do your part to stave off enemies so they are not butchered. The Medics and &quot;Techs&quot; are especially helpful to refill your life and armor respectively. But if you are more comfortable as a lone wolf then not to worry, you get plenty of time for that, particularly during the more creepy/horror section of the game. Personally I enjoy the parts where it is actually depicting the &apos;war&apos; between humanity and the Strogg, and thus you have some small squad-based combat. The horror parts rely mostly on absurd amounts of gore and shock value, which to me after a while is more depressing than scary. These areas also (and the game in general) leave much to be desired for music and audio outside of sound effects of combat and groans/weird crap. Halo knows how to pump you up a bit with some music themes, id should maybe take a lesson for their less horror-driven areas.
<br>
<br>As far as plot, the story is interesting enough, but the ending seems kind of abrupt and the final fight was kind of easy once you figured out what to do. I played on the second hardest difficulty out of 4 choices for reference. Sometimes the &apos;leaders&apos; of your squad make asinine decisions compared to real life, ie, hey, YOU, go on this dangerous solo mission while I apparently do nothing. Or if you secure something they love to leave a single guy behind to guard it, cause you know, he can handle dozens of enemies by himself. Future humanity sucks at organizing for war. But I digress, it&apos;s obviously more for game play reasons than it is to make sense.
<br>
<br>Overall a decent campaign. Multiplayer is kind of weak and has no bots without installing mods. Worth a bargain price, which by the age of the game you should be able to get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=1987302">Expand</a></span>

Jumping makes you go slower when you land, and you can&apos;t run at 5k MPH and shoot things in the face and live. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I don&apos;t look for this in a game. Only Quake and Doom games. This is too story oriented. And on top of that, the story isn&apos;t even very good. I mean, it&apos;s OK, but more than that, it&apos;s just not worth the time. Now, as for the multiplayer, it&apos;s just a copy of Quake III Arena with beefed up player and weapon models. And as for the graphics, even for 2005, it&apos;s not that great. The weapon models are cool, the textures are cool, but the character models are just atrocious. Now, I don&apos;t say &quot;STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!11!!1!&quot; It can be fun. But it doesn&apos;t hold up to the former glory of Quake from 1996. I mean, not even id Software was happy with the way Raven and Bethesda took it. So, maybe if you see it at a used game store for like $10 or on sale on Steam for $10, it might be a good buy. But don&apos;t expect lots of runny-jumpy-shooty fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3068365">Expand</a></span>

All this cyberpunk theme, biomechanoids, combining human body with computer parts really tickle your nerves. There are very few games I wanted to complete more that one time, and this it is. Even in 2013 you shall try it, if you like horrors. By the way this game is FAR FAR better that Doom 3  just miles ahead.</span>

In order to beat the Strogg force you actually become one of them later in the game, making for some interesting plot twists. The game&#x2019;s audio and visuals are excellent and create a dark and scary atmosphere that you actually feel a part of. In spite of the excellence of the campaign there are some shortcomings however. The vehicle sections are quite underwhelming and I feel they are only there to advertise the game&#x2019;s capabilities and variety rather than being a fun experience in their own right. The multiplayer is also rather dull and is essentially just Quake 3 or Open Arena with more high-tech graphics and a lower player base.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3795634">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s fast paced, it&apos;s brutal, it&apos;s gory, it&apos;s immersive, it&apos;s exhilarating, and it&apos;s fun.  The story is fantastic and the visuals are impressive even by today&apos;s standards.  The game starts by putting you in the action right away.  The only time when you won&apos;t be fighting is when you&apos;re on board the ship called The Hannibal.  If you have ever played Doom 3 or Prey then you will get used to the game quickly because it uses the same engine.  The weapons are great.  If you&apos;ve every played any of the other Quake games then you will notice a few familiar weapons.  The iconic nail gun, rail gun, and lightning gun make a return.  The second half of the game is easily the best part.  You become a Strogg.  As a Strogg you can now move faster, have increased health and armor, and look even more badass.  The Stroggification part is very gruesome and gross.  Instead of showing it as a cutscene, it is shown in game.  Quake 4 is fantastic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5117819">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I think i was too much fondled with the fast gameplay of Q3A and UT that this game simply felt slow and boring. And it does not make me want to go back for some reason either. Its not a bad game but i wouldnt call it a good game either. You forget it very fast.</span>

<br>I bought this game on CDs and I plan to buy a second copy on Steam when it goes on sale. I would suggest you buy a copy as well. $10 seems like the right price to wait for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=7585619">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s not a bad game per se, it&apos;s just... meh. And hours of meh don&apos;t make for a great experience.
<br>You just run around, kill monsters, find switches, go back (a lot), kill monsters again, same old, same old.
<br>Graphics are good, but Doom 3 was way better and immersive; here there&apos;s no mystery, no atmosphere, it looks like just a lame excuse to shoot stuff.
<br>If you don&apos;t need imagination and inspiration at all, and you just want to shoot and kill stuff, then you might like it - good for you ;-)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/quake-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5923137">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Can&apos;t believe this game gets so much hate compared to other quake games. It&apos;s everything you could expect from a Quake game, dark, &quot;scary&quot;, exciting, hard... The multiplayer is great too, the only problem is the movement for the campaign is quite slow, hence the 8, quake is about speed and jumping.</span>
