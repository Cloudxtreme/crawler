If someone died in a previous game, someone who is basically that person only a stunt double shows up and says basically the same thing and does the same thing.<br><br>Does having geth as allies matter over krogen?  No it doesnt.  You dont ever fight beside your allies, the they only show up in a single cutscene.  How many endings are there?  Just 1 regardless of what people tell you,  all 3 endings are 99% the same, as regardless of the choices you make,  the exact same things happen. The game plays just like all other bioware games,  where they are a series of short stories tied to a larger story, but the short stories have no effect on any other the other stories in the book, or the larger story of the book.<br><br>Do i recommend the game.  For a budget purchase, yeah, you will get some fun out of it. If you can put aside the weak story and terrible ending.  The game lacks that something that shows up when a developer really cares about their product.  Take the witcher 2 for example.  The witcher 2 is a better game in every area when compared to ME3.  Bioware should be ashamed, their game comes off soulless when compared to TW2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2315116">Expand</a></span>

I could list the reasons but I won&apos;t since I only have 5000 characters to write this review. So I will make it short and sweet. Bioware stopped loving their games. That&apos;s all. They have become less interested in making games that are actually good and more interested in selling games to the mindless masses so that they can make more money. Simple really. Look at their latest games and tell me i&apos;m wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2175570">Expand</a></span>

The End is what bothers most of the gamers.  It&apos;s out of character for Shephard, is confusing and is always &quot;bad&quot; regardless of how well you play the game.  Basically skip side quests and such you get the Worst Ending, do the most you get a Bad Ending.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise it plays similar to ME2.  Combat is essentially the same, with the addition of slightly better melee capabilities.  They aren&apos;t really that good even if you spec for doing melee, simply too many enemies are far to dangerous to get close to.  In addition, muliplayer, despite Bioware&apos;s assurances, is REQUIRED to  improve your ability to get a Not-As-Bad Ending.  This may put off some who will feel that a single player rpg shouldn&apos;t be reliant on multiplayer.  This time around there are no character driven side quests unfortunately.  In ME2 the point was to gain loyalty, yet here there could have been SOME reason to help someone do something.  Overall, the game feels rushed and is a very unsatisfying end to what was otherwise an outstanding trilogy. 5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2220447">Expand</a></span>

That **** should be illegal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2177697">Expand</a></span>

Music - I guess it depends on your style, but for me it was below average. The gameplay was retarded at best. Press space to do this, press space to do that. God I have more then one button on my keyboard for christs sake. You can only do things in specific moments and then you have to press space, so no reason to press space otherwise. It is more of an interactive movie then a game. Story - Jeebez how retarded incapable and completely fantasy-retarded do you have to be to write this drivel. Every self respecting author would jump off the bridge before he would write something like this. Generally, the only thing you see is that if you pay the official reviewers, they will give you a high score. That is it. I am so so extremely sorry this game I awaited with such high expectations underperformed in every possible way. Please save yourselves the trouble and do not buy it. There are better games, Deus Ex for one or even the previous MEs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2192827">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s an utter failure of a game and a disgrace for the franchise that had already went down with the second game.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s what this game deserves. Why? Because it&apos;s a scam provided by EA and Bioware, they promised something, closure, an ending that would wrap up everything and they delivered nothing. This is simply put another Dragon Age 2 scam. Do not waste your money in this piece of crap, save it for companies that actually deliver what they promise and that have good policies towards their customers.
<br>
<br>The animations are exceptionally terrible. The story is obviously developed by a game company, which is why it&apos;s so very badly written. They repeated the same mistake from Dragon age 2, they firmly believe that killing important characters creates a good story, which is what awful writers do in a pathetic attempt to cause an emotion. What they won&apos;t understand is that the emotion is negative and people don&apos;t pay money to feel bad.
<br>
<br>The endings discourages the player from even finishing the game, they&apos;re so bad and makes so little sense that my friends simply stopped playing the game.
<br>
<br>Two critical issues on their writing and design is that they seem to think that Godmodding and metagaming are valid tools for crafting a story, just like the huge amount of clich&#xC3;&#xA9;s that are present.
<br>
<br>They also blatantly copied the ending from Deus ex, it&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2199406">Expand</a></span>

The animations are bad (males walk really weird in this game ++). Some of the explosions and gun effects are really low quality. Then there is the FOV in this game, it reminds me of Resident Evil 5. Why can&apos;t you adjust ANYTHING in this game? Oh yeah, I forgot... it&apos;s a really bad console port. Also you have to use the space bar for absolutely EVERYTHING. On the plus side it has some great voice acting, interesting characters and locations. Not enough to make it worth my money though. Sadly. The last Bioware game I bought was Dragon Age 2, and yeah, I was very disappointed then as well. I hoped they would redeem themselves with this game, but I was unfortunately wrong. This is the last game I will buy from Bioware, and I can&apos;t recommend buying this game to others. If you want to play it, rent it, or buy it used on console.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2207745">Expand</a></span>

Day 1 DLC of very important character considering prequels and lore, otherwise not present in the game but found by players on disk and activated by them without any download so what kind of DLC is that good question. Graphics are medium, Mass Effect 2 has better graphics, porting from consoles almost 1 to 1 without use of PC technical superiority, not even keyboard. A lot of things binding to &quot;space&quot; and you cant change it. Controls taken away from player in terms of less movement/view possibilities such as holstering for example. Much less dialogue choices but much more cutscenes without any choices. Bug of importing characters from prequels and even if imported not look same, only remotely similar. Game have good combat mechanics and very good sound/voices. Positioned as RPG/Action in advertisement. Third person Shooter with few RPG style dialogues and a lot of cutscenes in reality. Replay value hangs on very low to none.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2213466">Expand</a></span>

The ending unfortunately looked like it suffered from the developer running out of time/money/ideas. I&apos;m noticing that every time you add a gimmick (aka multiplayer), you have to sacrifice something.</span>

The first game was practically a new genre, a new step in video games that gave a sense of awe, the second game followed this and near matched the sense of awe and continued the genre breaking gameplay but the third game almost takes a step back from the action-roleplay and becomes more &apos;Gears of War&apos; by focusing on combat, with pretty much all new mechanics revolving around improving the combat system. A step backwards with an action-roleplaying game, the previous games were fantastic and this game broke the trend. The awe inspiring is still here in this game however, when the Victory fleet flew through the mass relay and the final space battle began I was in awe there is no doubt about it, when I talk to all the characters  I have bonded with over the previous games, it brought tears to my eyes, it was almost poetic but then my emotions turn to confusion and anger at the finally of the game. We were promised vastly different endings, there would be no A, B, C options and that your choices mattered but in the end, you get 3 options to end the game with no matter of the choices you have made in the previous games, no matter how high your War Assets were (which was a silly mechanic). It really comes down to what is your favourite colour? Blue, Green or Red which is what the 3 endings are, the same ending in different colours, so in reality there is only 1 ending that has filters put over it and tweaked. Even at the end of this sillyness, there is no closure to all those relationships you have developed, you never know if Garrus retired some place tropical or if Tali built her house on Rannoch or if Liara had little blue children. I don&apos;t mind Shepard dying, a bittersweet ending can be good if executed properly, this was not executed properly and it fails for it. As we had learned before, the destruction of a mass relay causes a supernova like explosion and destroys a whole system so you have just destroyed practically all life in the galaxy which is worse than the reapers. Even putting that aside, the destruction of the mass relays means everyone is stranded where they where, including the Victory fleet which will now starve to death. Joker fleeing the battle for no reason, it just doesn&apos;t make sense.<br><br>Now apart from the endings, there is a lot of other discouraging things to be mentioned. A day 1 DLC that &quot;was developed by a different team after the main game was finished&quot; yet if you change 1 line of code on the game files, you can get the Prothean on your game without the DLC. A DLC  that costs $10.00 for the most interesting character and one of the best guns in the game. The reveal of Tali&apos;s face, being a slightly edited stockphoto from google images. Reputation having no physical effect on the game apart from the terminator look, going so far of having to do renegade actions to save your own life? Wat. Even if Bioware was to release a new DLC  for a different ending which I highly doubt, why do they need to release a new ending, it should have been on the disk, it should not have sucked so badly that it has distressed the whole of the mass effect community and destroyed the metacritic score for it. I&apos;ll be even more amazed if they make you pay for it. I however don&apos;t see why people are complaining there is multiplayer, it is a great thing to play with your friends every now and then and it adds more value to your money however integrating multiplayer into singleplayer and forcing you to play it so you can get the &apos;best&apos; ending in the singleplayer is just pathetic and whoever organized that should lose their job.<br><br>So yeah, the journey was still interesting and thrilling at times but the destination and cheap cashing in&apos;s just ruined everything that we had been working up to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2259881">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is solid, but for ruining the game with plot holes and idiotic ending, I give it a zero. Not to mention the Day 1 DLC. This is the last thing I bought coming from Bioware.</span>

Bioware pretends that the criticism is purely hate, when by looking at the negative reviews, this is clearly not true. Dialogue options are simplified and boring, combat is about the same, hardly any improvements, and explore-able environments have completely disappeared. This game is a giant joke. Personally, I&apos;m pretending that Mass Effect 1 and 2 are true to the series, and 3 never happened. This is what the Crystal Skull movie did to the Indiana Jones series, it raped it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2201544">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately the story feels like your on rails with only 1 or 2 side missions popping up between main story plot points. If your bringing in a past love interest from ME1 or 2 I hope it&apos;s Kaiden, Ashley or Liara, Tali&apos;Zora STAYS masked for all intents and purposes (search it and you&apos;ll find the photo is a stock model pic w/ lines drawn on it), Miranda&apos;s is ok, the rest are basically in there for bioware to say we did it without putting thought there.  Most all of this I could forgive IF they had put ANY thought behind the ending. Controls are pretty smooth but due to almost every action being mapped to the spacebar you will find yourself rolling and taking cover alot instead of picking up that gun mod or looking at a datapad. they completely removed all minigames replacing it with cover your squad mate mechanics.<br><br>Voice acting is still good with few exceptions (femshep is the better actor again) Character models have changed for some, and not for others. Ashley looks like Miranda, Jacob got 10 yrs younger, Zaeed got a personal trainer and a ton of ink, and then there are 2 new people from the Jersey Shore aboard your ship, Tali also looks like Miranda in the picture she gives you.<br><br>Story premise was good until Shep crawled away from Anderson, when that happens turn off the game and just use your imagination to end it how you like. OR So you got the whole universe to work together, collected all the resources, followed paragon/renegade choices like a religion?  you can look forward to the Exact same story ending as someone who rushed through the story and got squat (1 ending with 3 color differences) BTW Shep dies and your crew is stranded on a tropic island.<br><br>Character  development - I shouldn&apos;t have to even go here due to the other games were building the characters we know and love, but alas they screwed this up too in ways I won&apos;t get into. in short Bioware and EA rushed this didn&apos;t get a full game out (Day 1 Paid DLC) made an action game that a 4 yo can play and a rpg story that makes no sense with an ending sure to piss off anyone who plays it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2219474">Expand</a></span>

First, its a sequel to the Mass effect series, in witch if youre a fan played  Mass effect 1 and 2. The second, that this game is trying to be marketed to a wider player market. while that is not the main concern here, it did lead to some design views,<br>There is a lot of things to say about this game, some are good, most are bad. Fistly the thing that will put off fans of the series is the side quest structure, its seems that most of them you get from lisening to conversations, with no animated conversations scenes with the player. This makes the side quest just a fetch chores, without giving any emotional meaning to the player. Then theres the &quot;support&quot; task, witch is basicly suport one of the two views of the arguing characters. This is again done without a scene with coversation, you just come over, press space and then give a one liner, witch covinces them. It is impersonal, it doenst give any emotional tension or even feeling like a real choise. What I liked is the reapearance of the older side quest characters of the series. While they feel a bit overused. Almost in every side quest dialogue sene you can meet them, sometimes it works, sometimes its more like: oh its me, you helped me with that thing remember?. This is sometimes more like an anoyance, and i woudnt have mind if there where other new characters.<br>The more well crafted characters are worth the time. Some again strike a more personal note, others are just there, and you dont much care for them. A little thing that bugged me was the dialogues of the main characters and squad mates, theyre timing seemed to be off. I really cant explained it but it felt like the actors wherent the with one another or didint get the sense of the scene or the suspence wich woud have created emotional, scared, angry reactions. The pauses between dialoged semed to long, as if it wanted to give dramatic tension, but only felt like the voiceover actors forgot the line. The fell of the citadel and the spaceship (Noramdy) are off. I did like the progresion of Citadel spaces. as the war progresed, they got damaged and more full of refuges and so on. The think that felt off is the design of the areas. They are quite small, combine that with the broken sidequest and you have an area that you go  not to explore or get the feel of the game world, but get it get out, nothing more there. The Normandy itself was made in a line of checks. Finish a mission, get a dialogue witch a holovid character, leave to teh war room, go true a conference table witch was used only once, get true a chech of security withc was pointles, and let the personal assisance tell there more mesages. I this you feel boxed in  as if these things had to be done that the player woudn miss anything (the expliration hating player forced walk ? ). While the ship is stocked with a new crew theres nothing much to do with these generic npcs. The dialogue isnt rememberable and i didnt care much for them, they are just there. Combat: the shooting mechanics are similar to the Mass effect 2 game. While in the last game the combat was overal a pleasant experience, here we have a cover porblem, enemys feeling very generic after a while, no heavy weapons. The fought enemies also left much to be desired, we get cerberus units (heavys, engineers, a few snipers, ninjas with swords) , and reaper indoctrinated species (human-melee, turian- ranged, canibal-heavy? then assary biotic power user   and another heavy  charger). We do get to fight some geth in the quarian missions. The main storyline: Mixed feelings about it too. the sotryline seems a lot more linear. You cant really choose what to do first. You go to mars, the turians, then the krogans. This felt a break from the past game freedom experiences, witch to me meant a lot.  Parts of it was great, the quarian missions, getting the artifact from the assari home world.  Coincidently these too missions are put on the table at the same time, and you coud choose witch to do first witch was a nice free feel to the exploration and getting support. So mostly youll spend youre time helping races, for theyre support in the war and this works for the story. It all goes to hell in the ending. It woud take a seperate article if we where to discus whats wrong with it. A few quick points: The plan doesnt make sense, you dont get any feeling that youre in a larger battle, the radio conversations that the other units have are emotionless, doenst contribute at all. the whole battle culmination is you with 2 other squad memebers just surviving an atack then launching misisles, after that a desperate run to the citadel by the tranportation beam (dont ask). the whole last part is emty of any feeling or emotion, and the bets parts are shown in cinamit moevies, witch you dont feel a part off.  Characters ending. Last question: is it worth youre money? 50 euros? NO. You will play it if youre a fan, but it is not worth it...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2193153">Expand</a></span>

EA just want your money they don&apos;t give a **** about good games and fans, look at the Sims 3 eating money from kids, release half game for 50$ and eating money from rest half game in DLCS who worth 500$ **** ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2193763">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t open if you want to buy the game. I&apos;m sorry, but I&apos;ll be adding to really bad score part of players. To start, I have to say that I&apos;m a 22 year old man and played ME 1,2 and 3 with Female Shepard. This review is written after 5 hours of gametime. Even when the demo was released, I looked at it and said, hey, this is just way too easy. Another thing that pissed me off was when even though I was playing as an infiltrator, I didn&apos;t get my sniper rifle!! Why?! It&apos;s demoverzion! Yesterday, after I finished ME2 after 14 straight hours of playing - for the knitpickers, the game was nearly over, I was just finishing side missions, the first thing that pissed me off was that ME3 couldn&apos;t import my beautiful FemShep face! That was just the beginning. Why, why in the seven hells is she whining about Kaidan? Yep, I dated him in ME1, but than I spent 2 years dead, he behaved like an idiot and the character shouldn&apos;t give a damn about him. But no, even though I romanced Garrus - hell yeah, I&apos;, the pioneer of the interracial sex - he doesn&apos;t give a flying **** that he sees me. And this only goes on an on. They took a lot of time to finish this game, and indeed, they screwed the game and the players both kingly and thoroughly. The Mass effect trilogy for me is ME 1+DLC/ ME2/ME2 DLC. Then Shepard with her crew went to the Reaper&apos; part of the universe and kicked the **** out of Reapers. Too bad than someone didn&apos;t do a decent game about it - It would have been amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2194491">Expand</a></span>

What happened to the customization that was available in the first Mass Effect? Because I sure don&apos;t see it here.  It&apos;s obvious that they didn&apos;t put any effort into any part of this game.  They only wanted to milk their cash cow even more.

The game was wonderful right up till the end, if it hadn&apos;t been for those horrible endings I would have given this game a much higher score. The combat was great, the story up till then was great, the relationship between Shepard and squadmates was great, it was a terrific game. Then the endings ruined it and made you feel like all the choices you made really didn&apos;t matter after all. They were bleak and depressing, didn&apos;t really even make sense, and left many more questions than answers. And everyone gets to choose from the same three terrible endings no matter what choices you made throughout the three games. It was just depressing. Shepards story deserved a much better ending than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2213401">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Problems I had with the game:
<br>The time skip is confusing, even to people who played ME1 &amp; 2. Seems like a lot of plot development off-screen that is never explained, like why does everyone hate Shepard at the beginning of the game? Has no real impact in the ME3 story arc but alienates and confuses players who, like me, played ME1 and 2, or just picked up ME3 to start with. For example, I wasn&apos;t aware there *was* a time skip until I was told by a character and that Shepard had &quot;done stuff&quot; to warrant his status on Earth at the beginning of the game. Even when you are told that its been 3 years you&apos;re like, &quot;Okay...3 years from what?&quot; I basically had to do research to even know that this was a time skip and not something entirely different. When your audience has to do external research to understand a major plot point, its a problem.
<br>
<br>Some of the decisions you make in the game have real consequences, such as letting a villain go or deciding to donate resources. One kind of these decisions are actions in conversations which are indicated by mouse clicks. This adds depth to the interactive story, but some of the choices are poorly worded, such as being nice to a specific character or a stern tone to another, and suddenly your character enters a romantic relationship... Or you just killed a side character and the verbal clue was a vague and minor disagreement... Other times these decisions require split second reactions. This is fine, but since the last time you made a decision without deciphering its intent for 5 minutes killed a person, these &quot;gut reactions&quot; actually take away from the story more often than not. Basically you&apos;re afraid to react quickly because of consequences in other conversations and can&apos;t use the system as intended. However I place blame on vague writing and lack of context for your character&apos;s decisions.
<br>
<br>The combat is decent, it has enough depth to satisfy most people and allows for wacky builds like a &quot;powers only&quot; character. Multi-player is okay but the only available mode is co-op survival, I was surprised that player versus player modes don&apos;t exist considering that the Gears of War franchise has shown 3rd person shooters can do so successfully for years. A little disappointing.
<br>
<br>Most of the talk has been about the endings for the game. I tend to agree with what appears to be the consensus that the endings are disappointing and frustrating. Considering that an RPG, even an action RPG, is defined by its story, Mass Effect 3&apos;s ending does not deliver.
<br>
<br>The game boils down to three main endings and two extra endings. The extra endings are one where everyone loses and one where Shepard chose to kill the Reapers but possibly survived. The main endings are one where Shepard kills the Reapers and dies, one where Shepard controls the Reapers but dies, and one where Shepard sacrifices himself to make everybody half-organic half-machine.

<br>He is told these choices by a hologram, who, very poorly, explains why the Reapers have been committing genocides. In fact, the hologram seems ignorant of multiple events WITHIN THE GAME that contradict his logic and states assertions on the future without any justification. The worst part is that Shepard ACCEPTS THIS. In a game about INTERACTING with the story and causing MEANINGFUL changes to the plot because of it, the player cannot argue with the childish logic spouting from the hologram and has to make one of the holograms choices. All of the choices are deus ex machina, not to mention the plot hook itself to begin with, and the fact that the hologram is the Reaper&apos;s God... The ending almost appears to be the same quality as most fan-fiction, unintelligible, self-serving, and amateurish at best. I find it hard to believe that the same studio that released Planescape: Torment or the Baldur&apos;s Gate series could fudge an ending so badly, but then again I have heard unflattering remarks about the Dragon Age sequel from last year.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: If you enjoy third person shooters with rpg elements but no story, its great. Otherwise, Mass Effect 3 suffers from a story that is an insult to intellectual thought. The main offenders are the plot holes, vague choices, caricatured personalities, and the awful ending.
<br>
<br>In any other genre I would still rate this a 6/10, but since storytelling and character development is what defines every role playing game, then I cannot give that score. Since the gameplay deserves a score of 6 and the story deserves a 0, Mass Effect 3 earns a dismal 3/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2220330">Expand</a></span>

Source: http://www.oxm.co.uk/37677/mass-effect-3-citadel-is-bigger-than-ever-endings-will-be-more-sophisticated/<br><br>2. Nothing you did in the past two games matters. If you picked Anderson to be Councillor it doesn&apos;t matter they changed it, if you killed the Rachni queen it doesn&apos;t matter there&apos;s another one just for the hell of it, if you helped Cerberus at the end of Mass Effect 2 it doesn&apos;t matter you still have to fight them. Nothing you have done matters more than a few lines to admit that they know you wanted things to be different and they couldn&apos;t care less because this is their story not yours.<br><br>3. The gameplay is nothing special. Point your gun at people and shoot then take cover while your health comes back. This has been done before and better. The role playing aspect of the game is laughably simple. There is no merging of the story and the gameplay. The story is told in cutscenes where you can choose what shepard says but as I said before it seems no matter what you say the same things are going to happen.<br><br>4. Day one on disc DLC. They changed a single line of code to lock out paying customers from the prothean companion which was meant to be included in the game. There is no excuse for this blatantly greedy money grab that insults all of their fans.<br><br>5. Multiplayer effects singleplayer. Games today all want to tack on some multiplayer component in order to boost sales or something stupid like that. But the multiplayer effects how well your forces do in the end and if you want the &apos;best&apos; end which is still the same ending with a different color laser beam you have to play the multiplayer which has huge amounts of DLC if you want to win. Oh and if you join the wrong server you&apos;ll get banned from both multiplayer and single player though no fault of your own.<br><br>Aside from the story, gameplay, animation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDpQn5EOre8, bioware and EA have responded to fan criticism with nothing but snide remarks and apathy banning anybody who insults their precious masterpiece. This company thinks they&apos;re above their fans. Do not buy Mass Effect 3, do not get Origin, this is the final nail in the coffin of Bioware.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2227112">Expand</a></span>

The fact that it is mostly an excellent game isn&apos;t the point, and indeed makes what Bioware has done with the title even worse.  Bioware has said that gamers new to the series can enter in with this game and be satisfied, and perhaps that is true.  Having never played ME1 and ME2 and made decisions which felt extremely important at the time and been assured that those decisions would have lasting consequences, they would probably not feel the extreme sense of betrayal which many gamers (myself included) felt at the end of the trilogy.  While technically it is a solid Action/RPG, perhaps even more so than the other games in the series, my dismal review reflects the fact that ME3 has lost its soul: it throws away the story-telling legacy of ME1 and to a lesser extent ME2, with a ridiculous Space Magic ending which should be a source of shame for whomever concocted it.  Nothing the gamer has chosen appears to manner significantly when it comes to the actual outcome of the game, and the ominous and Chthonic Reapers appear to be a somewhat paradoxical cosmic joke.  I am sure it will make a lot of money and as such validate the choices Bioware/EA have made, which is unfortunate for gamers everywhere.  The Mass Effect trilogy began well and promised to be a truly unique experience, a science fiction universe for our generation, however it just ended up being about the money in the end.  Unfortunate, but unsurprising, and perhaps that is the greatest let down of all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2228484">Expand</a></span>

The characters were not obnoxious and pacing of the story was good, writing of characters passable. I enjoyed some of them. Developing relationships between crew, not only romances and friendships but also growing animosity. All well and good. Some missions repetitive and boring (rushed much?) but still kinda strong 7, 6 if you count out DLC.<br><br>Up until the ending...I have hard time believing that people who wrote Mass Effect universe suddenly had a writing stroke and spawned this horrifying abomination of an ending. Screw the limited choices but the sheer story telling behind is stripped of all logic. It resembles incoherent symbolism of Lynch meeting Van Trier with pseudo metaphysical babbling. I didn&apos;t want artistic cinema with dubious, implying ending full of symbols and mystical wisdom. It&apos;s a fricken space opera. A pulp genre. I wanted a straight up epic finish to the series, happy &#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2241250">Expand</a></span>

It truly baffles me why the writers gave us this ending which is full of plot holes and has no closure whatsoever. It also offers no choice other than choosing the colour of the big explosion in the end, even though the developers promised before the game&apos;s release that the game would offer many different and distinct endings. It&apos;s truly a shame to see a great company like bioware become nothing but liars and incompetent of creating a decent video game in years. Dragon Age 2, Star Wars The Old Republic and now Mass Effect 3. It&apos;s sad to say but the old good bioware is dead, gone forever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2274615">Expand</a></span>

I would label Mass Effect 1 as one of my favorite games but I just feel so alienated by this game that I just don&apos;t what to think anymore.  Day 1 DLC, stock images copied, animations, textures, clunky story... I... just no.  I refuse to believe this game exists.</span>

They removed the planet and resources exploration, almost no dynamic dialogs (most of the game if cut scene dialogue), removed completely the RPG from the game..<br>A bad way to end a trilogy. Mass Effect 2 was the best in the series because it mixed RPG and action TPS but now with Mass Effect 3, it remains only Action TPS and that&apos;s sucks!!</span>

In fact, the core audience of this game has probably played the two games leading into this, and have a good feel for the game represents. So let us start there and talk about what has changed. There was significantly less development time this iteration, and it shows. Mass Effect 2 had an incredible prologue, that was polished to a mirror. Doing the space walk and having the sound mute, etc...it was a cinematic work of art. Mass Effect 3 shows it&apos;s rushed development immediately. You are cast straight into the game, given a short cutscene for the long awaited arrival of the Reapers. That&apos;s right, it isn&apos;t a big moment at all. Mass Effect 1 had more suspense going into the first mission, and that was just supposed to be a routine scout mission. The Reapers just show up in the back ground and start shooting stuff. Mundane and unimaginative. The dialogue and writing are atrocious, with the whole game feeling like it was written as a poorly made fan-fic. Inexplicably, actoresses like Jessica Chobot are cast in major roles in the game-despite being wholly inexperienced, and frankly, bad. The graphics are several notches down from what you&apos;d expect in a 2012 game. Games like The Witcher 2, which don&apos;t even have a fraction of this games budget, and able to produce better visuals. The combat sections are keep distinct from the story, to a degree that you are either watching or playing, never both. The combat is repetitive and formulaic, often consisting of shooting down a corridor until a time limit expires. The cover mechanic is generic, and the game falls back on this gimmick too much, to cover for its linear, uninspired level design.   Ontop of all this, the game has had its content sharded, to be sold back to you at a higher price. To get the full experience, with all additional content available on day 1, you will be paying in the hundreds of dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2199273">Expand</a></span>

The problems with this game are numerous and I could go on and on. I really don&apos;t have a clue how websites can give this 9s and 10s and expect to be taken seriously.<br><br>The graphics are worse than ME2. It&apos;s the same engine, how did that happen? The Illusive Man&apos;s skin is smudged and compressed now and in some places NPCs are replaced with cheesy looking sprites when a bit further away. Lens flares are WAY overused, even for a Mass Effect game, often being way bigger than they even need to be. Animation is noticeably stiffer and models teleport around in cutscenes. Anderson&apos;s running animation in the intro is just laughably bad. I&apos;ve seen far better work from modders.<br><br>The story will be fine once in a while but ridiculous bits keep pulling me out. For instance, in the Protheans&apos;s flashback, ONLY he has a Jamacan accent (which sounds silly in its own right) but none of his other race has it. They also use human military ranks apparently. Tali&apos;s big unmasking has been reduced to a badly photoshopped stock image they pulled off of the internet. Joker dates EDI. I mean seriously? He dates a robot? What&apos;s next? A romance with option with Legion? Actually don&apos;t answer that. The endings are completely ripped off of Deus Ex. And there are so many holes in the plot, I don&apos;t know where to begin.<br><br>From Ashes, the Day 1 DLC is $10 for...get ready...30 mins of content. If that. Great huh? Avoid buying it if your money is important to you.<br><br>Just all around disappointed in this game and I&apos;ve had enough from EA/Bioware.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2204384">Expand</a></span>

BioWare managed to do two things successfully: 1) Trivialize the effort a player put into the entire game by not addressing the achievements of the game in a climactic ending and 2) Ruining a trilogy of relationships between characters, races and heroes through a sheer lack of care towards player sentiments regarding the aftermath of the game.  There are also incredible inconsistencies in pacing and ending just give off a terribly unfinished, unpolished feel that is a truly disappointing experience.

Or whether or not to save the collector base, saving or killing the quarians and geth again, curing the genophage, Samara or Morinth???  Yeah none of that mattered at all.  Hope you didn&apos;t actually get emotionally invested in any of those choices like I did or you might just break the disc after the impossibly poorly put together ending.  I will never play ME1, 2, or 3 again because I know the ending boils down to red, blue, or green so all the decisions you made are pointles...  Oh yeah and hope you didn&apos;t like any of your romances as they really really don&apos;t matter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2243693">Expand</a></span>

The reviews are 95% fluff and buzzwords, 2% actual reviewing, and then the rest is just them trying to make up for the small criticisms they&apos;ve given it. No really. I saw a review that complained about graphic glitches and problems with having to restart missions entirely for no reason, and then they go, &quot;THE CHARACTERIZATION IS CHILLING THOUGH&quot; as if it had anything to do with what they were saying. This game is a virtual choose your own adventure, where your choices don&apos;t actually end the story or change it in any way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2177455">Expand</a></span>

Not to mention being exclusive to Origin, which is a massive sin in itself.<br><br>I would have given this game just a five, as it&apos;s just that, an average game. However, since it&apos;s clear that Bioware bribed journalists and reviewers to give their game a good review, I decided to counter the inflated reviewer scores and give this game a zero.<br><br>Criticism and feedback is one of the most important things for a game developer. Unfortunately, it seems fanboys nowadays views criticism as a direct attack at them or the developers. Fanboys. Understand that criticism is the only way for a game developer to get better. Bioware probably suffered a overblown ego from the fanboys, which results in declining quality for their games. From a fan who enjoyed Baldur&apos;s Gate, KOTOR, Mass Effect and even Dragon Age: Origins, it&apos;s just depressing to see all of this unfold. I can only hope that Bioware will return to their senses and start making quality games without Day 1 DLC. Also, DLC is a horrendous blight on the gaming industry and should never be supported ever unless it&apos;s purely cosmetic.

I can find redeeming features in almost any game to at least call it mediocre. But Mass Effect 3 is the biggest letdown in PC gaming history. ME1 was plagued with wonky, unintuitive controls and menu navigation, but painted a rich, colorful universe that just demanded exploring. And explore we did. The Mass Effect universe was second only to Dune. The storytelling and acting were deep and meaningful, and the game just FELT enormous, even if it wasn&apos;t. You had so much freedom to do things your way, that it was mind boggling.<br><br>The sequel narrowed the scope to your ship and your companions, telling a deeper, more personal story that blended wonderfully with the broad moral strokes in the first. Sure, you had to be a completion junkie to get the perfect ending, but the characters were fascinating, their stories meaningful, and the voice acting was superb. I really cared about the people I went to battle with, so much that I happily replayed it entirely just to make sure that one crew member survived.<br><br>And then comes three. It starts out very serious, if a bit disjointed. You have saved the galaxy twice, and you still got court-marshaled? Your estranged companion is thrust upon you and then taken away. Relevant members jump in and out at complete random, you have no control over whether or not people live or die, and the woefully limited, boring citadel (seriously? How do you make the CITADEL boring this time?) is just a place where you go to get side quests that are essentially a dull minigame that doesn&apos;t even encourage exploration. Your companions are very mismatched, with Garrus and EDI being the only really meaty characters. Joker is thrust into some disjointed, ultra-serious role, and the animations make his eyes look downright crazed. All the animations are pathetically stiff and wooden. Why not simply use the wonderfully animated SWTOR engine and simply transplant the gorgeous textures? The stories are short, the side quests are almost meaningless and always presented exactly the same way. You either fly around collecting items whose relevance is never explained, and running from reapers in the minigame, or you are on a tiny, repetitive map fighting for equally irrelevant resources. The combat is okay, but feels so sluggish and imprecise that you can feel the &quot;controller-itis&quot; in its DNA. So low marks there. Also, I don&apos;t know about the other classes, but the Vanguard feels downright worthless, with absolutely no synergy in its skills, whereas in the first two, it was a fast paced engine of destruction.<br><br>The new relationships are shallow, jerky, and forced upon you so quickly and back-to-back that it&apos;s laughable.<br><br>And then the whole story draws to a conclusion. All that work you did to unite the galaxy, seems to have no impact or weight whatsoever. The final mission is disjointed, and all it appears to change is the length of your cutscenes, because it all boils down to the ending. The choices you&apos;re presented with mirror nothing that makes sense, let alone what your goal was. No matter what type of person you chose to play in the Mass Effect series, the ending presents nothing that you have any interest in pursuing. Not to mention glaring plot holes and absurdities. The ending was so bad, it single handedly ruined the entire series for me. After learning how things turned out, I will probably never pick up a Mass Effect title again. Nothing you can do will alter the eventual outcome, either. Finally, we get to the day one DLC. I didn&apos;t knock off a point from Portal 2 for having it. That DLC was cosmetic and completely unnecessary. But the DLC that adds 1% to the game and costs 20% of its retail cost and should have OBVIOUSLY been included, is the final nail in the coffin for bioware. I don&apos;t like making broad generalizations, but after the awfulness that was  I can&apos;t help but get the feeling that EA has finally destroyed what was once my favorite RPG makers. The Mass Effect universe was the most astonishingly well-conceived, lore-ridden universe in gaming history, and EA just destroyed it. The user score (and it&apos;s not like the /v/ bombing of portal 2, which I stood against) clearly shows that EA just pays for ratings, because while barely tolerable as a game itself, the second you finish it, there is no way you can seriously sit back and think &quot;That made sense. That ending was totally logical.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2226367">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a shame that the incomprehensible ending overshadows all of it.

There is no exploring planets, the citidel is very small and not open. ME2 made the game more basic, but ME3 took it down to a stupid level. This is NOT what we expected/wanted from bioware. And the ending is not at all based on anything you did in any game what so ever. I repeat not at all based on your choices. Several things in the game happen in cutscense. Meaning that you dont have full control over the choices shepard makes. Not that it matters. Avoid. A miserable ending to a great series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2243564">Expand</a></span>

Biggest let down in my gaming career. There was no happy ending, only **** If you watched BSG you know what I mean: an epic scifi tale with huge moral crises and battles and epic confrontations, ruined because some writers thought that they should get all existential at the end. I&apos;ll sum it up: there are 3 endings, all of which involve Shepard and Anderson dieing and the Mass Relay network being destroyed, resulting in organic life being sent back to the stone age. 1 is the reapers leave the galaxy forever, but an EMP destroys all electronics and the mass relays are gone, so there is basically no point in intelligent life. 2 is the reapers leave, but humans and geth are fused to make a new race of reapers for when the cycle begins again. And 3 is nuke everything, geth, reapers, humans, relays.<br><br>There is no victory over the reapers, and a new age of galactic peace and cooperation, prosperity, etc. Only dead Shepard and dead dreams.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2209918">Expand</a></span>

To tell the truth, I never thought about Mass Effect as an &quot;shooter&quot;, but merely as an &quot;Visual Novel&quot; in its classical meaning - a book with CGI pictures, music and voice acting.<br><br>I never cared about the graphics or shooter/pseudo-rpg aspect of the game. The only strong point of Mass Effect 1/2 were the characters we, the players, interacted with.<br><br>Not only BioWare has crippled every single character&apos;s personality, but altered them in a truly terrible ways. Ashley being transgender?! Male Shepard being gay for random crew member?!! Tali&apos;s face being a photoshopped human photo?!?! Humanized EDI with clearly visible female part?!?!?!  The player no longer being able to save everybody and live happy ever after?!?!?!?!<br><br>Even literally stolen illustrations and the game being crippled to multiple DLCs are nothing compared to what BioWare/EA did to the plot and the characters, which were the only strong points of the series.<br><br>I&apos;ve got a refund in the shop where I bought my collector&apos;s edition and going to buy a bucket of strawberry shaved ice instead - at least that will be more enjoyable.<br><br>P.S.

There are a few idiots letting us down, but the vast majority of disappointed fans are unhappy with this game simply because it does not nearly deliver on the promises made by Bioware since the franchise&apos;s inception.The endings are particularly poor, not only because the twists are illogical and the tone is so depressing, but because your choices barely make any difference to the final outcome. Favourite characters are reduced to cameos. Long-awaited moments are handled with complacency (for example, the reveal of a particularly beloved character&apos;s face, for which a Getty stock photo was used with only the most minor of Photoshop edits). It&apos;s a very good game in many ways, but it could have been so much more. We didn&apos;t want this to happen. We wanted it to be everything Bioware promised that it would be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2197516">Expand</a></span>

It is a fantastic article and the only negative comment from an established media site I have yet seen.<br><br>The many hours prior to the final one are really very enjoyable. I was close to completing everything in the game on the first play through that was available, barring a few non-combat side quests.<br><br>The combat remains the same as ME2 but sped up a great deal. The cover system remains quite clunky where you sometimes get in cover, sometimes just do a diving roll against a wall and stand up again but it is not that bigger deal. You will probably only die by going too far ahead too quickly and getting flanked, where due to the very rigid but effective combat system you are reliant on enemies being in only one direction.<br><br>The acting, story and missions are everything you would expect from the series, which to me means a high standard.

If Bioware had any sense left they would fire the whole writing staff and replace it with a room full of monkeys. Of course they don&apos;t need to worry about it since they have every major game review site in their pocket.</span>

I definitely do NOT recommend Mass Effect 3. Its such a pity when great franchises just ruin themselves all for the sake of profit, like Call of Duty and Resident Evil. And now, unfortunately Mass Effect.</span>

ME1 was my favorite game, it was a great game no doubt about that, ME2 though was an ok game, not great just ok compared to ME1, but ME3 was terrible even compared to ME2. The past decision or even the decision in ME3 have absolutely no impact on the game, the great story in ME1 is gone, now its just cheesy teen angst soap opera, and you don&apos;t even have a choice. The illusion of choice yes, the choice to make your own commander shepherd story no (see the &quot;multiple Deus Ex&quot; three ending on IGN if you want), i know sci-fic or game is not suppose to be logical but this is a whole new level of Bull. Gameplay wise is okay, okay as in acceptable nothing mind blowing, but since ME was mostly about story and less about gameplay it doesn&apos;t really matter, if i want a good shooter i will play GOW3 or BD which is a lot better. Everything else is mediocre, i advise gamer not to buy this game, don&apos;t buy it based on it&apos;s past series, because ME3 is completely different, rent it first if you must, for hard core fan of the series, i advised you to pretend this game does not exist or it will break your heart. Maybe just maybe a giant size DLC will be develop by Bioware to redeemed themselves and save the ME universe, but this ain&apos;t a fairy tale so i won&apos;t keep my hope up. Ranting time!!!!!! Many of the best PC RPG game is created by Bioware in the past, but now they are determined to destroy all of it for the sake of short-term income, ridiculous dlc, releasing unpolished game just barely working so that they can get away with it. I won&apos;t even explain why i am disappointed  or justify my opinion, Bioware know damn well what standard of game ME3 is as creator of great games in the past. Do you honestly think consumers will continue to support your crappy game, you are going to be EA worst mistake, because they wont even be able to squeeze one single best selling game from you! and when they realize that EA will dump you like yesterday news that you are. RIP Bioware i wish we could remember you fondly, but instead you will become the greatest tragedy and proof of the terrible practice of EA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2175131">Expand</a></span>

Plain and simple.<br><br>EAs&apos; CEOs want to throw their weight around and basically force people to use their second-rate platform and indifferent customer service. It&apos;s strange that they would rather destroy game after game in a effort to grow their digital distribution platform than spend that cash on just making a compelling product and selling it through established and trusted platforms like Steam or Impulse. EA must really be convinced that the millions of dollars their losing and customers their aggravating will eventually start buying game from them again once their &quot;platform&quot; is established. It&apos;d be one thing if EA sold these games through it&apos;s own platform as well as others, but since it&apos;s made it &quot;exclusive&quot; to Origin, it appears EA would rather flex it&apos;s monopoly muscle then play fair with the other kids. Here&apos;s a simple analogy: if the consumers were the cops, EA is the robbers, and the games are the hostages, ever movie hostage negotiation movie I&apos;ve ever seen has taught me to never give in to the robbers demands, regardless of how many hostages they&apos;re willing to kill in the process. I will not give in to terrorist threats.<br><br>Don&apos;t give in.

The use of deus ex machina betrays BioWare&apos;s incredibly lazy narrative and ridiculous ending. Choices and consequences are non-existent, the combat is simplified to the point it&apos;s painfully easy even on hardest difficulty, animations are clunky and facial animations are always deeply entrenched within the uncanny valley. Characters are stupid, boring, predictable and funny for all the wrong reasons. Avoid this game at all costs, your time is better spent elsewhere</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2206291">Expand</a></span>

Actually, I believe disappointed is not a strong enough term- I was utterly devastated. To have the story built up beautifully over five years and to come to care about the characters and the outcome of your decisions was a huge emotional investment for many players; it was an investment on which we received no returns. The ending(s) of the game left something to be desired. They were incredibly clich&#xC3;&#xA9;d and felt tacked-on, almost as an afterthought, and with no consideration to any of the events of the previous two games. The worst part, personally, was that Mass Effect 3 lived up to even my expectations- until the last twenty minutes or so of the game. Those last twenty minutes (or what is known in-game as Citadel: The Return) soured the entire narrative experience, including the years of story that came before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2208697">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s awful that metacritic gives this game a 93 rating on some top screens, based on the reviews of 13 &quot;critics.&quot; The spread here between a 9.3 critic score and a 3.6 user score is the largest I&apos;ve ever seen.  This game is the most annoying game I&apos;ve ever seen.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m going to this trouble because I absolutely loved Mass Effect 1 and 2, and I was really pumped for 3.  But 3 is a DISASTER!
<br>
<br>1. Paid $50 for store version plus $25 for game guide.  I can&apos;t return it because I wrote my Origin password on the insert with the validation code.  The game guide got a cracked spine the first time I opened it!  Low quality all the way.
<br>
<br>2. I&apos;m a sophisticated computer game player and computer programmer, with more than 25 years of experience.  This darned game took me 2.5 hours to install!  All kinds of problems.
<br>
<br>3. I was so beat down after that, I punted after about 15 minutes.  I just didn&apos;t like the feel of the initial sequence.
<br>
<br>4. The game expects you to buy DLC content concerning a critical element of the game (the precursor aliens) right off the bat!  The DLC was promoted the day the game was released!  That is incredibly greedy and stupid.  I never buy DLC unless I really like a game AND have finished what I bought at high price.
<br>
<br>5. The Origin intermediary program is insane!  Having selected an option at some point during the install to have this automatically start when I reboot my computer, there is no way to turn it off.
<br>
<br>6. The game is almost impossible to run.  After getting a successful install, off the $50 of DVDs I purchased, it takes 15 minutes or more to start the game!  You can&apos;t just play the game you bought.  You have to have Origin running (Electronic Arts&apos;s version of Steam) and it takes forever for it to log on and validate your password.  Then, after the game loads, it doesn&apos;t start until it logs onto separate Electronic Arts servers.  That can take more than 30 minutes!!!!!  In my case this morning, it took about 8 minutes, but I&apos;ve seen people complaining that at high-volume periods like Saturday night it can take more than 30 minutes.  What in the heck is up with that???  Why do I need to be logged onto EA at all to play the game I just bought!!!???
<br>
<br>7. After a full install, it is impossible to run the game offline.  Most civilized systems permit this.  For example, I bought Skyrim in November and was able to run it for four months offline of Steam, after getting the initial patch.  Origin is a very stupid program.
<br>
<br>8. I&apos;m on a crappy satellite Internet location in a rural location, and the Internet connection goes down rather regularly during rough weather.  But I can&apos;t play Mass Effect 3 during bad weather.  That sucks.  I paid $75 to buy the game and the game guide.  I should be able to play it offline!  (And I should be able to play it on a laptop during travel, etc.)
<br>
<br>9. When I tried to start the game this morning, Origin insisted I had to install a 16 GB update!!!  WTF?  I just bought the game with physical DVDs a few days ago.  No way is such a patch required.  The stupid Origin program obviously thinks I need to download the entire darned game, even though I&apos;ve already got it installed!  By the by, on my Hughes satellite Internet connection, if I did a download like that, it would knock me off the Internet for a couple of days.
<br>
<br>10. Finally, in the ever-growing list of fantastic aggravations, I learn from the manual and the initial game screens that I start out with all of my &quot;war assets&quot; in the &quot;galactic war&quot; set at 50%.  That means ALL of the essential allies I am gathered are gimped to one-half.  The ONLY ways that can be upgraded is to start with an end-game save from Mass Effect 2, or to play many, many hours of mulitiplayer combats.
<br>
<br>Well, I can&apos;t import a Mass Effect 2 save, because the computer I was using for that was destroyed by a particularly virulent virus.  And I don&apos;t want to play multiplayer combat exercises, and I couldn&apos;t do it even if I wanted to, due to my current crappy and laggy satellite Internet connection.
<br>
<br>So, in other words, this crappy game, after collecting so much money, forces me to have such inferior troops that it may be impossible to win the game.
<br>
<br>*************  I&apos;m VERY sore about this!  I feel VERY ripped off and abused by a greedy and stupid company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2239620">Expand</a></span>

Most are decisions are hacked away to funnel one down the story path. 2/ Romance is forced upon the player. In ME1 and 2, I always picked up &quot;lets focus on the mission, no time for that kindof stuff with whole galaxy at stakes&quot; option. Garrus who was the companion I had with me the most in ME2, except for when I gave him the lead of the fire squad and the like in the suicide mission. All of a sudden he jumps out of the closet and wants a homosexual relationship !? That is insulting even to homosexuals... makes no sense, breaks the immersion.<br>3/ The ending is bad. Seemed to be stolen from Deus Ex, except in Deus Ex they made sense.<br>4/ The Game of Thronesque knack for killing off characters/companions the reader/player has grown attached to advance the story and for some canned emotional factor. Except for a novel when it happens the story advances and it is nice. In a RPG the player just feels helpless, conned and like it is a means to shove another cut scene down the throat.<br>----- The good: The multiplayer part. It is a nice addition to the game, although unnecessary if the single player game had any appeal or replayability ---- The ugly: Day 1 DLC. I am less bothered about it than most, for me it just translates into a quite expensive full game. Still it is a blatantly ugly move by BW/EA, and their cover up PR BS is just as ugly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2202802">Expand</a></span>

After the catastrophe that was DA2, which left me with a great feeling of dissapointment, I was vary, but since I thought the ME series had other developers than DA2, I still thought I didn&apos;t need to worry. But it seems everyone at Bioware has read the same game developer book, &quot;How to ruin promising IPs&quot;. I truly loved DA:O and ME1, I liked ME2 although I was worried of the direction. But this game and DA2 is pure crap.<br><br>Worst of all is Biowares inability to deliver satisfying endings although that is far from all there is. I thought DA2&apos;s ending was the worst, but ME3&apos;s &quot;Different Colors&quot; endings are a slap in the face of ALL humanity. Take those two games and add in SW:TOR and you can see how badly Bioware manages these days, and the only reason they are still succesfull is because of past glories. To Bioware: Anyone can see that you don&apos;t  want anything to do with the RPG community anymore so stop trying, leave RPG out of your game making  PR and just go make braindead shooters and try to compete with MW and BF series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2205902">Expand</a></span>
