<br>Doom 3 is a great game. Hell, the other two are as well. I remember playing them when they first came out, and I love the action and the exploration of Hell.
<br>
<br>Obviously this is not a &quot;remake&quot; but rather a &quot;remastered&quot; version. The visuals do look better, with crisp texturing and a great UI, along with motion blur and other various effects. It runs very nicely at 120 fps. The lighting engine is still the best in gaming, and the combat is just as good as ever. This was released almost 10 years ago, and it still looks and plays better than many games newly released.
<br>
<br>The base game always had problems, such as monotonous environments and repetitive game play. Modern game play staples such as weapon zooming and a radial weapon selection system should have been added. The game could have been better, but these 0&apos;s and 3&apos;s are a bit ridiculous. Some people don&apos;t understand rating systems (or are trolls).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3907770">Expand</a></span>

The game is not merely Doom 3, but also includes the original and Doom 2, which are great games on their own. Doom 3 is not necessarily fantastic, but it&apos;s a fun corridor shooter that I recalled playing several years ago on the original Xbox. Wanting to relive the relative nostalgia, I bought this to see if it was as good as I remembered it being. I hate to say that it wasn&apos;t as great as I remember, but still rather fun and intriguing. The story is a little cliche and predictable, but the setup itself is interesting and, at some times, slightly disturbing (which is a good thing, considering this is effectively meant to be a horror game). Some enemy designs are a little uninspired; generic, humanoid demons and possessed people will be the earliest encounters you face. However, later on in the game, there are more interesting monsters; floating demon faces, that are horrifying on their own, and cyborg hellhounds will appear later on.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, it&apos;s not fantastic, but for the amount of content (multiple expansion packs and three doom games), you can&apos;t really go wrong anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4246270">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>They have brightened it up to the point that it ruins the atmosphere at points. The textures and models actually look terrible because they&apos;ve been dulled down for consoles. The game looks terrible but runs perfect.
<br>
<br>Just buy the original, Doom 1 and 2 buy separately next time there&apos;s an id sale. I couldn&apos;t make my way through this again, even being a big fan of Doom 3 and I really can&apos;t see the justification of spending 30 euro on it.
<br>
<br>It gets 3 points for the Lost Missions and that&apos;s it. Everything else is a subpar product that has been ruined by Id&apos;s boner for consoles.
<br>
<br>I got as far as the Alpha Labs and just couldn&apos;t go on butchering the good memories I had of scaring myself **** with Doom 3.
<br>
<br>Even the Doom 1 and 2 emulators are terrible, with a minimal of options in them.
<br>
<br>On that note, let me be clear ; THERE ARE NO GRAPHIC ADJUSTMENT OPTIONS WHATSOEVER
<br>
<br>I repeat, if you have played Doom 3 before on PC.. do not buy this unless you are comfortable spending 30 euro on 10 mod level quality extra missions. Really I wouldn&apos;t bother, it&apos;s the most justified pirate ever
<br>
<br>All I wanted out of this was high res textures with a bit of nifty motion blur, instead I got a botched Doom 3 with almost blocky graphics and textures. It really is actually WORSE than the original.
<br>
<br>I will be playing the Lost Missions, but honestly I&apos;m not that arsed seeing how badly they have butchered the experience
<br>
<br>Not worth your 30 bones

I really love the whole Doom series, but this seems to me like just like an attempt to milk players for some more money. Had this been free for people who bought the original Doom 3 + RoE, it would have been really awesome. But this way, its just the old good Doom 3 with some minor graphic additions and missions, that could have been easily added via a patch and completely free of charge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2698091">Expand</a></span>

I read somewhere they have optimized this version only for consoles, the game runs at a blazing 120 FPS maxed out on my 9800GT but it looks like the original doom 3 on medium settings.
<br>
<br>The pack comes with doom 1 and 2 which are enjoyable today and run beautifully on current systems,
<br>game-play is solid, its nostalgic where you worm through darkness and there is always something that lurches toward you...sound design is perfect, i can imagine playing this with the occulus rift but maybe that will take a while to commercialize, for standard display this game looks average.
<br>
<br>Buy it only if you are a hardcore fan as it provides extra content called lost mission and serves as an entry to your collection, or if you have never played doom 3, this is your chance to experience it as graphics is the only flaw with the release otherwise this game is WAY BETTER than most of the FPS that we play today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2783431">Expand</a></span>

In my opinion, it is inferior I&apos;ll start with some good- Doom 3 did influence, through its use of audio tapes and storytelling, some of what Irrational implemented in Bioshock a few years later. (Maybe, can&apos;t prove this obviously) So yes, it leads you along a sci-fi corridor roller coaster, albeit a hackneyed and trite one. Let&apos;s be honest here -  the story, characters and writing is below the standards of a star trek fanfic. How they went with some of the schlock I&apos;ll never know. Every cutscene I&apos;m looking for the skip key, and that&apos;s telling. Replaying it now has changed nothing since 2004. From a fundamental perspective, I detest the choice of the &apos;monster closets&apos; in this game. It presents a die and retry pattern to the campaign that only the most stalwart sympathizers could enjoy. (Sidebar- I think Rage is a great id game...) This game is below average- not truly awful, but lacking in almost every conceivable category, especially in 2012.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2699019">Expand</a></span>

With that said, I would be reluctant to recommend this version to someone who already owns all the Doom games. However, for someone who doesn&apos;t own Doom 3 and/or the early Doom games, Doom 3 BFG is an excellent choice. I guess whether or not one can give this game a good review depends entirely on whether or not they liked Doom 3 - which the Doom community is split down the middle on. I loved Doom 3 - and I love this game. The extra content and improved lighting make Doom 3 BFG a great deal. About the only thing that keeps me from giving this game a perfect 10 is the fact that it currently lacks mod support - so all of the great Doom 3 mods cannot be enjoyed with this version - yet. That is apt to change soon, however, it&apos;s still somewhat of a bummer that these mods can&apos;t be used immediately. I am still awarding it a perfect 10, however, just to counter the butthurt communists.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2703123">Expand</a></span>

As for Doom3, they made it substantially brighter, updated the UI, and tuned the engine for todays standards (widescreen, 3d)... on the bad side: no graphics options, horrid console fov, no mod support... in this case it is also better to run old Doom3 with all the awesome graphics addon and you&apos;ll get what BFG should have been. The new &quot;Lost Mission&quot; contains 2 hours of gameplay made up of refurbished Doom3 content, and even tough the new Hell level is nice, it is not worth the price of admission, it should be your usual 4$ DLC. VEREDICT: Worthwhile only if you are a hardcore doom fan and don&apos;t care the price tag, haven&apos;t played doom ever OR if you own a PS3 and want to get a taste of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2702114">Expand</a></span>

Sure if you want to market to console players sure do that but don&apos;t leave the PC players in the dark and give them something they don&apos;t want.
<br>
<br>Moving on from the models which are the most obvious thing that ID didn&apos;t change at all. Textures are hard to get right, most of the time users end up installing mods with over the top HD textures because the &apos;High Quality&apos; textures added by the games original developer are sub-par at best and DooM3 BFG is no different. What you end up with is with a completely undefined set of textures where you can barely read the &apos;UAC&apos; logos printed on everything. This to me is the biggest downfall of the &apos;remastered&apos; DooM3 game as textures define a games graphics in my eyes. Moving ahead now I&apos;ll visit the included DooM and DooM2. These games are always going to be good, but what annoyed me was the complete lack of effort that ID put into making these games born again... They are the same and have not even been ported to a decent engine. To be completely frank I don&apos;t think ID realizes that with old games like these nobody thinks they should be making money off them and just about everyone is going to just download the .wad files directly.
<br>
<br>Overall this re-release fails as a re-release and feels like more of an add-on pack with the new content (which I can&apos;t properly review because I just couldn&apos;t sit through it).
<br>
<br>Giving this 1/10 due to the total lack of effort on IDs part.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2803901">Expand</a></span>

In addition to this, they made the originals available, a classic touch.  My top pick for first-person shooters.  Halo can&apos;t touch Doom.</span>

What was jaw-dropping then in terms of visuals now look quite dated, and ID have done little to improve the look of the game. The expansions are pretty pointless, more embarrassing than anything else. Resurrection of Evil, with its new weapons just screams, &quot;Hey guys! We can be like Half-Life 2 and FEAR also!&quot;, which at the time was hopping on the bandwagon of shooter trends whereas now it&apos;s just old and outdated. While it was a more or less fun experience, I wish they had done more to improve the look of the game and the frustrating and tedious elements of the game have only gotten worse over time. People new to the series won&apos;t be won over but long-time fans will probably have a bit of fun enjoying an old favorite.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2704614">Expand</a></span>

There, I said it. Its essentially a mod for Doom 3. Graphically, the game is considerably brighter. This doesn&apos;t really destroy the atmosphere of the original version at all but when you consider that they&apos;ve changed the signature flashlight mechanic to a Half-Life-esque battery drain/attached-to-suit flashlight that makes a lot of scares just plain dumb, it degrades the entire game. Apart from this, graphic-wise, the BFG edition does not go the extra mile at all to enhance the overall graphical fidelity. Dont expect any HD-makeover here at all. The texture res still suck balls, shadows r basically the same and overall detail remains largely unchanged. In terms of gameplay, its basically the same thing - shotgun, MG, chaingun, Pulse Rifle and BFG monsters from hell though dozens of generic cold steel facilities. It gets repetitive but on a personal level, I did get a nostalgic rush to the days of old in high school where my friends and I would lose our **** at playing Doom 3 back in 2005 on a fishbowl PC. But in the end, why would I want to spend $39 on a game which I could&apos;ve got from Steam for $9? This is for the young only, those who did not experience the terror that Doom 3 evoked upon us gamers back in the day. Though the most they might do is get bored after a few hours and go play prettier, more dynamic shooters with decent plotlines.
<br>Oh and it also comes with Doom 1 and 2 (No, I dont want to fck up my eyes thnx). But overall, its as expected - Doom 3 with some tweaks. id Software, just give us Doom 4. After Rage, we just cant take anymore of your bull****.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2703226">Expand</a></span>

They managed to dumb down doom for consoles, brake its fine graphics and rest of things and turn it into yeat another RAGE! This game dont even have support for mod and graphic settings! Textures and lighting became worse, no flashligtht shadows, many light sources and decals with blood and signs was removed, self shadowing turned off, console locked, most of CFG cvars ignored or overridden by game. Once finest PC game was ported to consoles and then ported to PC from consoles to became POOR PC port!
<br>I really loved original DOOM and gave it 9 of 10, but my score here and now is not for DOOM 3 itself, but for &quot;remaster&quot; &quot;re-release&quot; and this release is 0 of 10 (ok if ill add real doom 3 score it would be 8 of 10 because its still old good doom but a screwed up one, but as i said im giving as score to quallity of re-release not to game itself) because its add nothing good except for gamepad and proper widescreen support, but its removes a lot.
<br>
<br>Dont buy this release untill Bethesda and ID will release PC patch that will return everything they cut intto rigth place, will turn on everything they turned off, will restore every feature of original, inluding support for modding and sergeant kely proper face and all the graphic and gameplay settings of original.
<br>Once and if they will release major update that will unscrew everything they screwed and once it will add even better high res textures as excuse and as part of promised &quot;remastering&quot; and &quot;improvement&quot; you can buy it with discount, because its still doesnt cost 30$ for a re-release. 15$ is biggest price for such a cheap port of game everyone already own and to be honnest this should be offered as free patch to original game (only if they will unscrew it 1st, without fixes it would be a downgrade patch), just like enhanced editions of The Witcher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2700983">Expand</a></span>

<br>If your on console, definetely don&apos;t miss this release... go buy it.

<br>Also, the 3D effects are great... some of the best I&apos;ve seen in a game that supports 3D.

Well, you get the older Dooms, but you can easily get those for either dirt cheap, or simply for free. There&apos;s some Wolfenstein levels, which are HILARIOUSLY CENSORED TO REMOVE THE NAZI STUFF. I&apos;m aware that the censorship happened when it was released, but that was in certain countries, not including the US. It&apos;s hilarious that they decide to censor them here. But anyway. Doom 3 relied on nothing but cheap jump scares, standard gameplay, and the promise of nostalgia. Again, it sucked to begin with. And this remake? What&apos;s remade? Things were added, and stereoscopy. That does NOT warrant another release. Zenimax can blow me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2698163">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m proud to say that I managed to finish this version, so it&apos;s not that bad after all. I&apos;ll be frank, Doom 3 never was a shining example of good game design, shooting was meh(weak weapons, bullet sponge enemies), scares were cheap, story was weak. But very solid graphics engine and level design. I played for bits of good old Doom 1-2 left in it and never liked that flashlight mechanics where you can&apos;t see enemies when you can actually shoot at them. In this version this problem was solved, making it faster, more dynamic. For me, this is a plus. I would prefer a more subtle solution, though. But they just removed most of the dynamic lighting from the game. Basically, it has detail of the PC version with slightly improved textures, but lighting from old xbox 1 port. Thanks to this change, performance is very stable, but a lot of lighting magic is lost. BTW, Radeon owners can use rs_enable 0 console command to remove an unnecessary feature that makes the game slow on their systems. But there is a killer feature in this game. Stereoscopic 3D is really, really good. This is, in fact, the first game with stereo3D that I played inthis mode from start to finish, where you can get an awesome depth perception and a solid performance on 3 years old PC hardware. Console tweaks help, of course. Too bad, they didn&apos;t try to convert old Doom games to improved engine with stereo3d support, making them even more awesome than they already are. But who would play Doom 3 then?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2720462">Expand</a></span>

People tend to forget how innovative this game was when it came out in 2004, a full console generation before the currently aging one. An advice from the past: play it on the hardest possible mode - don&apos;t even bother with medium difficulty settings. This is caviar, not chopped pork.</span>

The gameplay is still just as good as it was back then, and being able to use a flashlight while shooting is a breath of fresh air, if any at all. The sense of location is eerily believable, and sounds are somewhat acceptable to the game&apos;s overall tone of horror-themed action. DOOM 1 &amp; 2 are also included in this collection, which is an awesome addition for anyone who wants to relive the experience of one of the most legendary FPS franchises in history. And if that wasn&apos;t enough, the game has 60+ Steam achievements to collect and many &quot;secrets&quot; to discover, making this product even more playable. If you were a hardcore DOOM fan who felt cheated from buying this, I feel sorry that you can&apos;t enjoy this amazing collection for what it truly is. But if you are just now learning about DOOM, and want to experience something unforgettable, I recommend you buy this as soon as possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2713440">Expand</a></span>

Try playing your old doom 3 on a new computer and see how dated it is.  This brings it up to date and playable again.  So look at this game not against the new generation of games,which it cannot compare,but as a chance for new players to enjoy what we all enjoyed. This is still a must have in your library of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2782783">Expand</a></span>

Even if they made graphics very much better, why raising the price so much? And remember that in the original Doom 3, there are many mods that make it even look better than Doom 3 BFG Edition! It&apos;s just the same game, with an expansion! Same thing with Quake Live. It&apos;s free, but it&apos;s full of publicity of Bethesda games, and it&apos;s not open anymore. Damn. As innovation, I&apos;d rate this game a 0/10. As a flop, I&apos;d rate it a 10/10.

One of the scariest games ever made has returned in preperation for Doom 4!  Anyone who hasn&apos;t played doom 3 should pick this up, because even though it&apos;s 8 years old (and some) and the graphics are dated, they still look good for something so old.  Not sure why everyone complains about that.</span>

                                        <span>I loved the Doom series, but this is little more than a cash in.  Lost Mission is the only real new content here, and I would probably pay $10 for it, but the $30 admission price ($20 with a Steam discount) is far too much for what you get.  The only reason I didn&apos;t rate this in the negatives is that if you have never played the series before, this is a good way to get them all in one place.</span>

If you are a horror FPS gamer then this is a must play. However, as of the time of this writing, this game is $30 on Steam. I believe this is way too over priced. I would have given this game an &quot;8&quot; but because of the price it has earned a 6. A fair price for this game would be $15 IMO. If you haven&apos;t checked this one out yet, it is not too dated to still be enjoyable. Even if you have played this game before, it is worth another visit. This collection does contain Doom 1 + 2. While these are classics, I do feel that they are too dated to be really great by today&apos;s standards. Just my opinion. Check this out when the price comes down a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2728692">Expand</a></span>

I already owned and loved Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil, so I already knew it was a game I knew and loved.
<br>
<br>I know a lot of people complained about Doom 3&apos;s graphics, but I honestly never had an issue with it. By today&apos;s standards, the game is dated, but many games are. When compared to other games and movies that were given the &quot;HD&quot; treatment, it&apos;s almost always the same. You can&apos;t take a game that is 7 years old and expect superior graphics without major re-work. With that being said, I don&apos;t find Doom 3 BFG to be any more offensive in that department then any other game I&apos;ve played this year. I find it unbelievable that people are throwing a &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; fit about the graphics when STEAM is still pushing &quot;8bit&quot; garbage in the Indie Department.
<br>
<br>People complained about the human models. Who gives a damn? Honestly? Wasn&apos;t doom about shooting demons and wading through pools of blood? Not how some of the character models didn&apos;t look perfect? Some of you have lost your way.
<br>
<br>Another complaint has been the sound. I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t notice any difference, or upgrade for that matter. I live in a duplex and use a pair of wireless Afterglow headset for all of my gaming, it sounds great and I have no complaints.
<br>
<br>Added Xbox 360 controller support is great.
<br>
<br>So then, where&apos;s the beef? The 3D. I use a 3D TV that supports multiple modes, which I have connected to my computer. I have no problems viewing 3D images and watching 3D BluRay rips on my computer, never have. You can tell when people don&apos;t work very hard on 3D, you can tell RIGHT AWAY, because with 3D you either do it right the first time, or it&apos;s shoddy the whole way through.
<br>
<br>They didn&apos;t work as hard on the 3D as they could have or should have. 3D was one of the major selling points for me and I am really dispointed with this. No matter what adjustments I make, there is always a very slight ghosting on the 3D imaging, which is a huge let down for me.
<br>
<br>For people who haven&apos;t played Doom 3, this is an all in one package that is fine, there isn&apos;t anything WRONG with it. For people looking for a great 3D game experience to freshen up an old great, don&apos;t bother, it&apos;s not very good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2793933">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t quite like to think of it as just a re-release of Doom 3, but rather a collection of some of the finest games from id. Think about it, a large portion of this current generation of gamers never got to experience the awe of Doom, but now, they can! BFG Edition includes the original Doom, Doom II, and a remastered version of Doom 3.
<br>
<br>First things first, the classic Doom games that the PC version comes with are running under a proprietary source port from id; multiplayer and mods are not accessible, visuals are a little blurry, and the framerate is capped at 35 FPS. If you really don&apos;t care for any of the awesome mods and fan-made levels, or classic Doom multiplayer, this version of Doom will be fine. It is very playable. However, I would highly recommend getting a source port such as ZDoom to run the games better. The WAD files for the Doom and Doom II can be found in the &apos;wads&apos; folder in the Doom 3: BFG Edition steam folder. One thing I think is pretty cool is that id included the new Doom II episode, No Rest For the Living (which was originally only available in the XBLA version of Doom II), in BFG Edition. It can be played on other source ports if you load it as a PWAD for Doom II (the name of it is called NERVE.wad).
<br>
<br>Now for Doom 3. The visuals have definitely been updated, and the game looks better, but still not up to current games standards. Now, I really wasn&apos;t expecting current gen graphics, but I was still a little let down. Overall, it still looks dated, but I personally rate a game more based on gameplay than graphics. The main differences between the original Doom 3 and the BFG Edition is that you now have a chest-mounted flashlight that allows you to see in dark areas without you having to switch to your flashlight. This allows for more action-oriented, faster and smoother overall gameplay. Ammo, shielding, and health is also more plentiful. id wants to focus less on surviving, and more on shooting tons of demon spawn. I personally like this; it makes Doom 3 more like the original games. These updates are subtle, but very welcome. The multiplayer has not changed much, except now you can have 8 people playing in a game rather than just 4. I joined a game of Team Deathmatch, and swiftly got my butt kicked. People seem to be enjoying themselves. BFG also includes the Doom 3 expansion pack, Resurrection of Evil, and an all new expansion titled The Lost Missions. These new levels are very enjoyable, and add a lot to the Doom 3 experience.
<br>
<br>Some things I do not particularly like about the BFG Edtion of Doom 3 is that all previous mods for the original Doom 3 do not work for BFG. There were some pretty great mods available. Another thing I don&apos;t like is that there is no co-op mode. The original Doom 3 didn&apos;t have co-op either (except for the Xbox version), but there was a mod that allowed it. Now, with no mods, there is no co-op. Despite these shortcomings, Doom 3: BFG Edition is still a solid package. If you have never played Doom, or do not own the games, you really should get this collection. Doom is one of the most influential games of all time, and practically spawned the first-person-shooter genre. All three of the games are awesome. If you already have Doom 3, this might not be an absolute MUST BUY. Still, its only 30 dollars, and the new stuff is pretty enjoyable. Is it worth 30 bucks? You decide.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2700880">Expand</a></span>

This edition is exclusive to the Steam network and it seems these Doom games cannot be played on my Sharp HDTV in full screen without clipping the edges of the screen. I am forced to play in windowed mode, but at least the game window fills up most of my TV monitor.  This is not usually an issue with modern games... Moving on: the Doom 3 expansions are present and work just fine. As far as parts of the game being &apos;remastered&apos; I couldn&apos;t really tell since I was forced to play in windowed mode so the improved lighting effects didn&apos;t really jump out at me. Speaking of which- the inclusion of the shoulder mounted flashlight sort of negates any cool looking shadows and lighting effects to begin with and I suspect most people will use it constantly while playing. Personally I thought the shoulder flashlight was a bit cheap, since it severely reduced the difficulty of the game. Weapon mounted flashlights would have been an acceptable compromise but that is just my opinion. For delivering Doom 1, 2, and 3 with expansions with few issues, I think Bethesda delivered what was advertised.  It is what is it, essentially a thowback to linear shooters that contain mindless shooting. To be frank, modern games blow the Doom genre out of the water.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2870606">Expand</a></span>

And if you&apos;re running Windows 8, it&apos;s a crashfest. Not recommended. It gets 4 for having (average) ports of the original games.</span>

<br>- Killed enemies dissapear (!)
<br>- Less gore than in Doom 1 &amp; 2.
<br>- It&apos;s too dark. I know it wants to create a &quot;spooky&quot; and dark atmosphere. But imho it fails and can&apos;t deliver much more then cheap Jumpscares (and hides many well build and textured assets in the world)
<br>- less enemies than the predecessors
<br>- much slower gameplay than the first two games!
<br>- boring dark hallways with the same linear leveldesign from the beginning to the end!
<br>
<br>I personally wouldn&apos;t recommend the BFG-Edition and would rather say: Go buy doom 1 &amp; 2 instead, install the Brutal Doom-mod and have the fun of your lifetime (especially with some of the enhanced and remixed soundtracks like DoomMetal!) It has even a coop-mode!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5357370">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;d recommend this package for people who have never played all the Doom games. The rest are probably better off with the 1993, 1994 and 2004 releases of the games in the package. I mean, they censored Doom 2 for example. Who in the right mind would do that?
<br>
<br>Not to mention that they&apos;ve not fixed any of the major bugs in the Doom 3&apos;s BFG version compared to the original 2004 release. There&apos;s just zero reasons to own the BFG version instead of the original.
<br>
<br>Cost for the package seem ok. For 30&#x20AC; player gets about 50~60 hours of single-player fun. That&apos;s pretty good. Additionally there&apos;s some extra single-player content too. Doom 2&apos;s &quot;No Rest for the Living&quot; is a good fun experience. And &quot;The Lost Mission&quot; for Doom 3 is ok even if it recycles lots of content from the main game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5305711">Expand</a></span>

I hate horror games where your only option is running and hiding.  I want to dish out pain to evil.  Doom 3 gives you that power and scares the hell out of you while doing it.</span>

In short, buy it, it&apos;s really good and fun. However, only buy it if you want to have a good controlled Ultimate Doom and DOOM II, as well as Doom 3 enhanced.</span>

<br>One point for it actually works, One for being DOOM3ish-like. One point for Steam achievements.
<br>It was advertised as enhanced, but actually for every plus there are two minuses.
<br>Graphic:
<br>- The same, but now you can choose HD in menu. The same thing can be done with the original with some config edititng.
<br>- Seems not as dark as the original. Acceptable but looses some tension here.
<br>Sound: Noticed no difference.
<br>Gamplay (the real rage):
<br>- Flash lamp is always on. That was annoying in the original, but it added to the tension, now it&apos;s lost.
<br>- Difficulty has been degraded to a level of joke, so console players can play i guess. There are less enemies, and ALL the enemies are FAR FAR easier. The same machine gunned zsec that would kill me in 5sec in the original EASY, could only kill me in about 20sec on normal in BFG. That&apos;s embarrassing! All the bosses has been altered not just being weak but many lost a few of their attacks. The biggest scandal was to me the new Arch-vile, those were always boss-like enemies. Couldn&apos;t believe how they degraded them to a pityful average foe!
<br>- Ammo flood. Practically 3x more. All the boxes give double amount and you can even find more clips around. Again the game lost a big chunk of atmosphere here. So much ammo i cannot even think what they thought. Console players cannot be that dumb to use 24 shotgun shells on a basic Imp, as approximately this is the rate the game give ammo. In the original i would never be able to see the shotgun shells maximum amount i could wield (not even close).
<br>Levels: So now we have DOOM1 and DOOM2 plus a full new campaing sound cool.
<br>- 1 and 2 are OK, they only downgraded them with censorship.
<br>- New campaign is ok but a bit boring.
<br>- Now the big problem, CUT AREAS! Mostly minor spaces but the absolutely coolest part of ROE, the blueish platform with several hellknights and mancubii is vanished as it was too hard for console players(?). That is absolutely unacceptable!
<br>The only good thing the game gave me to taught me how console oriented FPSs look like, so i can avoid them later no matter how much hype they gather. Boring, no tension at all, easy as hell and ridiculous ammo flood.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/doom-3-bfg-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6345547">Expand</a></span>
