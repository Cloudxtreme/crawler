It&apos;s a great-looking game if you love graphic novels, and they absolutely nailed the painted comic style. As comic-esque games go, only Dishonored and The Wolf Among Us achieved this kind of look successfully (although TWAU emulates an inked style rather than a painted one). The arm movements can seem a little wooden at times, but that&apos;s only in sharp contrast because the animation of microexpressions is so good. While a lot of the NPCs&apos; character springs from the voice acting, the animation is no small part of the overall effect. Environments and clothing are lovingly constructed. While the backstreets and warehouses can feel pretty lacklustre, other locations such as Jackie&apos;s mansion are a pleasure to behold.
<br>
<br>The game can feel a little cramped with such a tight field of view. It&apos;s hard to ever feel like combat is going really smoothly, and I found it to be a mostly clumsy affair. There&apos;s a reward for headshots, in that time slows down for a couple of seconds after a direct hit so you can chain headshot after headshot and remain in slo-mo the whole time.
<br>
<br>I strongly recommend a Xbox-style controller for this game. The whole control system is built around dual-wielded guns via the triggers and Jackie&apos;s demonic appendages via the shoulder buttons, and it couldn&apos;t feel as good with kb/m.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4368038">Expand</a></span>

This game carves out its own interesting mythology that is very fascinating with the darkness and the angelus. The atmosphere is engrossing and dark and anyone who experienced the 90&apos;s for real will love the what 90&apos;s nyc has to offer from dialogue to Jane&apos;s addiction playing on the radio in the backround. More so than that this game tells a great story that will have you questioning your (Jackie Estacado)&apos;s sanity more than once. It has great plot twists and leaves room for a sequel (fingers crossed) though i doubt it as it under sold due to people playing truly unique story driven shooters instead like Call of Doody  (because the difference from modern warfare2 to modernwarfare 3 is so immense that admittedly they use the same exact game engine year to year hence the graphics neeever improving, where as look at how beautifully  battlefield&apos;s graphics improve,frostbite1-gorgeous frostbite2 )so anyway back to FPS&apos;s that are actually fun, the Darkness 2 has the most fun and unique combat i have ever played in a FPS more so than bioshock. To what turns out to be a kind of quad wielding with regular satisfying dual wielding guns and two beautifully hideous snake like demon arms with demon heads on them growing out of your back in the dark (which is most of the game). The demon arms can flatout destroy and they steal the show with a multitude of capabilities from slashing a man in two to lacerating to eating a man&apos;s head to pick up objects like barrels and men and throwing them to grabbing car doors and using them as a shield they are simply amazing. They have a variety of finishing moves and they can even be used to throw your monkey like(even though he calls you monkey) demon pet at enemies and watch him rip them apart. Granted it is linear and it is rather short, it should be played on hard otherwise it is too easy. Jackie has multiple skill trees as well with unique upgradable powers and new abilities. The short single player campaign is more than tolerable considering there is a plethora of story advancing play to be had after the regular campaign. They have a vendetta campaign with 4 other playable characters which you can play alone or in coop. Either way it is very enjoyable playing and advancing other unique darkness empowered characters and further advancing the story. These are fully fleshed out characters with large skill trees, unique weapons, and distinct personalities. This mode extends the main story and is about half the length of the main story but with 4 different characters to try out. If that wasn&apos;t enough the game has a hitlist mode where you are placed in large semi levels tasked with ultimately taking out a boss like target after dispatching his henchmen. They have many of these hitlist missions and they can be played with friends as well and as any of the 4 new characters. All together there is MORE than enough content and Vendetta campaign and hitlists are not tacked on they are fully fleshed out and fun. Overall this is a very enjoyable FPS and it deserved more in sales and more from the reviewers i.e. game informer giving it a 7. something this game deserves better and it is Not a seven. I played the 360 version and experience ZERO bugs, stylish cell shaded graphics (after all it is a comic book) (see top cow) and an overall great time. 9.25/10 the Darkness 2</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3202321">Expand</a></span>

The love story is convincing and i actually did feel part of the pain he must have been going thru. But the irritating weapons system, where it was way to easy to accidentally pic up and replace new weapons combined with the last few chapters of the game where the story telling took a huge downturn makes this game subpar.

Does not matter if you like to shoot stuff up or like to rip them open and they their guts out of their bodies. It is alot of fun, the only thing is that it sometimes is quiet hard to use your tentacles, other than that part it is a great game.</span>

<br>Beatiful story, graphics are kinda okay, I liked the previous one more, but it fits to the game.
<br>It&apos;s really bloody which I like and violent, yumee, yumee.</span>

You will really feel connected with Jackie Estacado and all what he does. The plot is well written and executed. It&apos;s not so common in shooters anymore.  I&apos;ll honestly say - The Darkness 2 is one of the most enjoyable FPS i played the last year. It makes You feel powerful, it&apos;s bloody as hell, dual-wielding kicks major ass and darkling is pretty funny. Enough of this chaotic mumble, i&apos;ve got only one serious issue about this game. It&apos;s really, really TOO SHORT.  I&apos;ve finished the game on Thug difficulty (guess it&apos;s &quot;normal&quot;), then I played it again on the highest difficulty (New Game+ feauture). After that, Vendettas Co-op campaign, Vendettas Hit-list missions... There&apos;s 15 h of gameplay on my clock and 50/50 achievements done. So... Nothing else to do.  Keep in mind, not everyone will play the whole game two times or finish co-op mode... So, for the of the people, gameplay time will be shorter.  Still, great game, 8 points well earned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2147877">Expand</a></span>

From some interesting storytelling, to frantic and diverse action - the game is a delight to play. It&apos;s painfully short however. Running about 5 hours or slightly less. Visually it&apos;s better and worse than the original, the comic book look suits it better - however you lose some of the grit and bleakness as a result. If this was about twice the length with the same pacing - it would be a 9/10. As it stands. 7/10. HIGHLY Reccomended on a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2139574">Expand</a></span>

Granted, it only lasts six hours, but all of that is quality time, and you&apos;ll be having so much fun you&apos;ll start replaying right away (I know I did!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2150410">Expand</a></span>

Sounds like a good story, but like a lot of games (Deus EX, Assassin&apos;s Creed), it&apos;s just a repetition of the basics you learn in the beginning. When you learn the fastest way to earn most points, you will always do it.</span>

I knew I was going to get mixed up with the story so I was just playing it for what it was, a FPS. The game comes with a &quot;Previously on&quot; bit at the start so it fills you in with all the mumbo jumbo of the other game which was VERY useful (I wish most other games thought of this). I lept straight in and loved it from the very start. The gameplay was amazing, story was fantastic and I feel I really made an emotional connection with the character and his situation. There were lots of twists and turns in this game which kept you enticed playing it will make you not want to put it down (I bought it and didnt come off it untill I finished it, about 6 hours of play time :S). But was totally worth it. It wasnt too short and I didnt feel like any parts dragged or any parts were too hurried. The little choices in the game were interesting especially towards the end of the game (but I wont spoil it). I thought the animations were spot on and the whole tentacle thing while using guns worked very well with the control scheme (you just have to get used to multitasking a wee bit). But I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story or even just to kick the sh*t out of some bad guys. Honestly dont know how this only has critic rating of 7.7 because Im rating it a 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2528360">Expand</a></span>

I got this game off steam on the summer sale for 75% off so it only costed $12.49 and man was it worth it. The only reason this game loses a point is because its to short, to short for 13 bucks? no. To short to pay $50 yes, and so i feel the other users reviews on this issue. If you can find this game on a sale or similar sale as Steam did then youd be stupid not to buy this. Great game :) i love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2524118">Expand</a></span>

It has a great story with psycho elements, you can get confused easily. Gameplay is excellent, no complains here. You can tear enemy with your demonic arms, kill them with a gun, throw a bucket or metal strips to them, also later you can get more abilities, like use swarm of insects, use energy instead of bullets or drop vortex that will suck all around it. But that&apos;s not it, you can grab enemy to perform one of four finishing moves, which will grant you different bonus, like health, ammo, shield or faster restore your abilities. It&apos;s a nice bloodbath with good variety of gameplay. But I didn&apos;t liked the autoaim function, which works even on hardest difficulty and can&apos;t be turned off. It helps you when you use a controller, but otherwise it is a nuisance. Slow motion headshot are pretty damn cool, you get the time to looks around for the next enemy. Sounds are done nicely, not like in other games, where if you stand far from talking person you barely hear him. Also killing squishy sounds are cool and of course you will like the &quot;darkness&quot; voice, I can hear it even now! Through the game a darkling demon will help you in some situations, you can even get control of it in some parts of the game. It&apos;s about 5-6 hours of gameplay that won&apos;t leave you disappointed, the ending will make you excited. One con I found in this game is that there are too many names starting letter J - Jenny, Johny, Jimmy, Jackie, it&apos;s annoying. But anyway a game is worth of your time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2136299">Expand</a></span>

The cut scenes, however, were too frequent and occasionally annoying.  Overall, Darkness II wasn&apos;t quite as good as the other games recently released at this price level.  I suggest waiting until the price drops a bit before buying this game.</span>

The campaign is depressingly short, even though the action is tight and the story is a complete trip. That&apos;s the trend nowadays--charge more...provide less.
<br>
<br>The graphics are slightly cartoonish which I&apos;m pretty sure was the effect they were going for since the game is based on a comic book. Voice acting is well done. There is a separate 4-player coop campaign element which is pretty fun, but I haven&apos;t fully experienced it yet due to a lack of players. All-in-all it&apos;s a pretty amazing game, but the short campaign didn&apos;t allow me to unlock all the special abilities in a single play through. Not that I won&apos;t enjoy playing it again!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2336415">Expand</a></span>

<br>I know nothing about the Darkness universe.  But, something about the story of the game.  I will just say this much about it without spoiling anything.  If you have ever truly ever loved a woman before, you will definitely be to relate to it.  So let&apos;s get to the review shall we-
<br>Story-I thought the story was awesome.  Graphics-Amazing.  while I must admit there was some slight issues with screen tearing and vertical sync.  Other wise then that it was amazing and It was only on medium.  It was kinda Borderlands esque textures if you catch my drift.  Awesome
<br>Voice acting-Awesome.
<br>Game play-Awesome.  The controls do take some getting used to.  I used a 360 controller mind you and i just had to get the hang of using both the guns and the powers.
<br>I can&apos;t really think of compaints other then the vsync issue and I can&apos;t be sure if that was the game or if that was my system.  I will be fair and give this game a 9.0  Definitely get it.  Is it worth 50 bucks?  I got it when it was on sale so, try and get it on sale and if you can&apos;t then if you can afford the 50 bucks go for that baby.   Good luck and good gaming</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2717963">Expand</a></span>

If you like FPS with interesting story, great atmosphere, comics graphic and with a lot of blood, Darkness II is way to go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2512842">Expand</a></span>

From picking up objects and tossing them at your foes to performing executions, every battle is up for grabs. Sure you can just gun your way through the game but what would be the fun in that? Upgrading your powers with experience will want you to get the most from your kills, as the more unique the kill the more you get.<br><br>The story is not as good as the first, leaving you with a rather cliffhanger ending that pretty much needs either DLC or a Darkness 3 (hopefully in less that 5 years).<br><br>Some stumbling blocks that the Darkness 2 encounters are the lack of variety in enemies and length, you could easily finish the game in less that 5 hours. The odd use of cell-shaded graphics leaves a mixed bag, it is not overly &quot;cartooned&quot; but some scenes seem less brutal using this.<br><br>The co-op is a fresh step, get a group of friends and the experience in the side campaign is a blast though on the short side.<br><br>If you are looking for a fresh unique fps then this should get you your fill but don&apos;t expect fireworks. Can&apos;t say I would recommend this game at full price though because of the length.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2151766">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Darkness II, first it got me interested enough, and should priznatsya I do not even dare to buy it for the reason that I am not a fan of horror movies, and games like it. But later I saw some gameplay videos, and decided to play on their &quot;own&quot; risk. The game I was pleasantly surprised, it turns out, I do not have pryatatsya from monsters, but rather to frighten people out of the darkness, I even felt a little funny. Despite some moments, such as graphics, that I was cutting the eyes, I liked the game in general. The plot is quite interesting, and despite all tuzhu schedule, and in the picture was a pleasant surprise as a whole ... umm narisovannasti, cartoon chtoli. Yes there are some clich&#xC3;&#xA9;s of the plot, but in general it&apos;s not bad, especially this latest note paid in the entire history of this crazy hospital. Frustration has brought me, is that some points on the levels when I was getting a bit boring, So the ending (right) made it clear that we wait for the third part, and I think this project should not begin to make out of a series. Collecting all the pros and cons, I put this game 8 points, though with more stretch 7.5. But my decision is completely thought out, in general, it is a good game, and I recommend it to friends, and all the players in Russia and vrintsipe world.

I enjoyed the power tree and how you can kinda chose the style you want to play through. The multiplayer characters have their own smaller skill tree&apos;s and add a lil bit more to the game if your looking for a new more missions. I enjoyed the little extra time in the extra missions since you got new powers and weapons. The darkling sidekick is awesome but somewhat repetitive constantly peeing on people, and farting I feel he could have something else thrown in there but he does help you kill people by distracting them or (if you unlock the power you can hurl him on your enemies for a kill </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3468234">Expand</a></span>

<br>I definitely think it deserves a 10, but there was just one thing that prevented me from granting it that score  The length.
<br>It was so darn short.
<br>I enjoyed it so much, but why was it so short???

The Darkness 2 is an absolutely phenomenal game in every way. The only nitpick I have is that its a bit short(I beat it in 6.8 hours), but my god it was so good I don&apos;t even care. BUY THIS GAME! 10/10!</span>

It lacks the least degree variation (in level design and battles) provided by what&apos;s called (for a good reason) a blockbuster.<br><br>The story&apos;s very diluted for a game whose gameplay isn&apos;t that engaging, sadly i rarely give up on a game without finishing it but after 4 hours i was plagued with boredom (the story up until that point could have been summed up in a few lines) and i&apos;d rather spend the rest of the time i had left to finish it playing a point and click adventure. The Darkness and Witchblade have great potential and if they&apos;d reimagine the gameplay the next Darkness could be great but i haven&apos;t seen much progress since the first one.<br><br>I felt as if Dead Space&apos;s story had more consistence and let&apos;s be honest, you could sum up Dark Space 1 and 2 in a 20 minutes animation, and still capture the whole &quot;depth&quot; of the characters and lore (at least the gameplay&apos;s engaging in Dead Space and you don&apos;t feel the lack of story).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2264456">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I am not a big fan of games adapted from comics, but I really loved playing this game. The action makes fun, even if the game is really brutal. I enjoyed the large variety of levels, the graphics, the sound and the style which suite the game. This is nice and fresh compared to many other games. I think the only thing is disliked is the really small FOV.</span>

If you&apos;re like me and can sometimes have a short attention span for games, The Darkness II is absolutely perfect in pitch and pace. The story, though not airtight, is extremely compelling and gameplay is smooth and fast paced. I think I beat it on the hardest difficulty available in about seven hours. Real good time and worth the ten bucks I paid for it.</span>

This game takes roughly 6 hours to beat, and I played on a hard difficulty and meandered around exploring often. The price is 1.5 of the 2 points I dint give this game, the content is just so lacking that I cant rate it very high. What content there is, is good however. Also as one negative reviewer mentioned, FOV is a slight problem, but its not noticeable for the majority of the gameplay, just in dialogue scenes. If you have the money and want it, buy it, if your pinching pennies, wait for a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2135546">Expand</a></span>

The field of view is set for console/TV use and not for a PC monitor. Consequently it strains the eyes horribly after a few minutes of play. However, I fixed this by using a little program called Widescreen Fixer. Secondly it is short, but perhaps not as short as some are suggesting. Took me about 9 hours to complete with difficulty elevated one notch. And you will want to elevate the difficulty a little or it&apos;s far too easy. The last thing is the gore. No, I&apos;m not being a wuss here, I actually think the gore has been toned-down post production - it seems as if key frames involving throats/hearts being ripped out have been removed to avoid the censor. If this is indeed the case, it should be a toggle option for gore-lovers like myself.<br><br>Now the good. I&apos;ve given this game 9, because aside from the above issues it&apos;s one of the best games I&apos;ve played in the last few years. And that&apos;s coming from someone who *hates* run-of-the-mill FPS games. It has exceptional characterisation, atmosphere and storyline; I actually got a lump in my throat a little at the end *cough*. The graphical style mentioned by a few here is &quot;Scanner Darkly&quot; cartoon style, and it works very well. The weapons and fights are satisfying, and while many of the environments are &quot;yeah yeah seen this before&quot;, the unique style of the game makes them feel new.<br><br>In a nutshell, think Max Payne, Bioshock and the original F.E.A.R combined. If you&apos;re thinking of getting it, wait until there&apos;s confirmation of the supposedly-soon-to-arrive field of view patch, unless you want to puke from eyestrain while playing it. If the patch does arrive - get this game - it&apos;s so awesome you won&apos;t care about the other flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2150537">Expand</a></span>

The only thing it really had going for it was the story and the gameplay length. The Darkness 2 i can happily was rather good. Graphics are something out of a comic book which really complements the comic book series of the franchise. The controls are much more likeable. The special kills are really gorey and look amazing. The voice acting is very well done, the story is nicely thought out and the storys behind each of the Darkness relics is also very interesting. The game also has two different endings, one end right away and the other keep you playing for anouther 5 minutes or so to see the true and amazing ending. The only thing that this game does not share with TD1 is that the game feel a couple hours too short. The game also has multiplayer which is a nice co-op experience. The players have to do jobs for Jackie when he is unavalible. Each of the players has a weapon has a weapon that is infused with Darkness energy. The co-op is fun and will keep you busy for a extra couple of hours. It does however feel unnecessary to be intergrated to the storyline as it really isnt needed and you never see the characters in the singleplayer game.I know im only nit-picking but i would have liked it to be alittle more linked to the singleplayer experience than it currantly is. hopefully some free DLC will come out to put more interesting content in. Other than that, this game is a very fun experience and is worth buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2151456">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>All of the mind shifts that your character is going through makes you wander what&apos;s real and whats not (in the world of the game ofc.)
<br>
<br>The game itself is for me mix of Max Payne and Darksiders! I highly recommend!</span>

<br>
<br>Apart from sometimes having too much voice acting during the shooting (five guys shouting their over-the-top lines at the same time, even when they&apos;re already dead), there&apos;s not much to dislike. It&apos;s very pretty, the story is told in a manner that doesn&apos;t get too much in the way (and really isn&apos;t half as bad as it sounds like), and, what is most important, the action is fast-paced and challenging.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not teh high arts, but it&apos;s very convincingly built. I&apos;ve played a lot of boring, generic shooters. This is definitely one of the fresher first-person games available.

However, in those six hours you get more action, more intense combat, and more mindf*cks than any other modern shooter out there. Also if the small FoV seriously ruins a gaming experience for you, I just feel sorry for you. Stop whining. The rest of the game is ported fine.</span>

Final Verdict:<br>The Darkness 2 is a great First Person Shooter Game and a worthy Sequel, I am still thinking about weather I will keep it or return it for a full refund for use on a future game. However the only downside to The Darkness 2 is that the Campaign is too short for a game this good, I hope the sequel is longer. My Score:<br><br>Gameplay = 9/10<br>Graphics = 7.5/10<br>Story = 9.5/10<br>Total = 9/10<br><br>Also so far The Darkness 2 is my favorite First Person Shooter of 2012</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2139223">Expand</a></span>

The great dialogues and the story well told keeps you stuck to the narrative, while the combat moments allow you to use your creativity to defeat the enemies in several different ways.  The reduction in the number of interactions in the dialogues and the absence of open world took much of the freedom and made the experience much more linear. Still, the increase of puzzles and greater interactivity have counterbalancing this satisfactorily. The Darkness 2 cannot escape totally from the FPS genre and you end up using their pistols and submachine guns most of the time, but this overshadows the good gameplay and the memorable plot told by host of darkness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2141888">Expand</a></span>

On them I will not write, because I consider them minor. I am pleased that the game is short, it has added the desire to play in the next, the third part. I put a solid game nine. Have more to such a dynamic and bloody shooters.</span>

The gameplay is awesome. While this game is a first person shooter, it adds some very cool twists to the gameplay. Controlling darkness powers is very fun, addicting, and very gory. The story is also one of the strong points of the game. The connection you get with the characters is great, and voice acting is exceptional. However, the ending (no spoilers) leaves a bit to be desired. Perhaps they want to leave room for a sequel? Audio is very well done, the darkness is well voiced and music is dark and moody as it should be. Now for the cons. This game is short. VERY short. It took me  hours on regular, and I really take my time playing through games. However, coop is fun, and adds for some extra play time, either alone or with friends. There are some glitches. Bodies stuck in walls, things like that, but nothing game breaking at all. Overall this is an awesome game that shouldn&apos;t be missed, and I greatly look forward to a sequel!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2144253">Expand</a></span>

Having played the first, being compelled to play the sequel was an inevitably easy choice... one that did not disappoint. The cell shading and artistic direction in the graphic department was a stroke of genius, you didn&apos;t just feel like you were reading the comic but a part of it. The story was extremely enjoyable but I must admit it was much too short and left you only wanting more. The game-play came very easy after a couple minutes and seamed to flow (even though you managed to pick of weapons you didn&apos;t want). The only real drawbacks to this game is the length (6 hours, and that&apos;s with exploring), the game was also much more linear then the first time around. This game is sure to appease the story and/or FPS fans out there (us fans of the comics as well).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2604887">Expand</a></span>

I mean the gun-play is great and the addition of the darkness powers makes it even more satisfying to mow through hordes of enemies.  The story is smart and the characters are interesting.  It is somewhat short but a great game none the less.</span>

Three main points spoiled this game for me. I won&apos;t go on about graphics, they&apos;re fine. Decent engine, decent artists etc. Game mechanics were fine. The menu system was a little annoying but you get used to that. Music was typically horrible but thankfully you can turn it off unlike some games(yes Halo 4, I&apos;m talking about you) So what didn&apos;t I like? Read on.
<br>
<br>Firstly, cinematics...lots and lots of cinematics. The annoying kind where you can&apos;t move and the characters talk seemingly forever when all they have to do is say, &apos;go out the door and shoot everyone you see.&apos;. You can hardly travel 100 meters without being dragged into some scripted action sequence or some long boring dialogue. Judging by the amount of positive reviews this game receives I assume most people don&apos;t mind this. I don&apos;t understand. I find it very tedious. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I like storylines. I&apos;m happy to sit and watch little cinematics every now and then. I just hate the game being interrupted every 5 minutes just so someone can tell you to walk down some stairs or whatever. OK, finished gripe no.1
<br>
<br>Second gripe; the demon, serpent, tentacle, penis things. I assumed they were something you could bring up to use when you needed them. Nope, they&apos;re there the whole time. Fine if you like that sort of thing, IE great big dangly appendages cluttering up the screen, and I understand that some people do like that sort of thing, just not me. Oh, and apart from their basic intrusiveness, they&apos;re just silly. A gangster with tentacles, spare me please.
<br>
<br>Thirdly, the sidekick. Again, some people obviously like annoying little halfwit sidekicks running around saying annoying half witted things. I just happen to not. The last half hour of my abortive attempt at playing this game was spent shooting it. The only joy I had in this game was discovering that you can shoot the sidekick, though regrettably he does regenerate.
<br>
<br>So there you have it. I wanted to like this game. I loved Sandman and Hellblazer and other stuff back in the day.  I knew it would be silly. It&apos;s graphic novel/comic book type horror, of course it&apos;s going to be silly. Unfortunately excessive cinematics, non-retractable tentacles and a sidekick modelled on a brain damaged teenage metal head made this game unplayable for me. Sorry Digital Extremes. I tried.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3857494">Expand</a></span>

The graphics look pretty good, with some bad textures from time to time, but its all cell shaded, which makes it look a lot like Borderlands. But that would only be if Borderlands was bloody. No joke, there was less gore in saving private Ryan. Limbs get torn off, people get impaled, and its all in this bloody mess. Which is good, by the way. Anyway, the gameplay is very arcade like shoot em up, with your demon arm to help impale people. Even on the lowest difficulty setting, its still a hard game, coming from a seasoned DkS2 vet,and well, ya. The only gripe I have with the gameplay is that ammo is semi-scare in early game, which well, just feels weird in an FPS.
<br>Overall, if you find the game on a sale, pick up up without hesitation.
<br>If you dont, well, here comes one of my only gripes. Single Player length. It will last only about 6 hours on Med. I get that its not that big of a deal, but well, for a game with not to much replay value...I mean, it does have a coop mode, but when I picked it up, the coop was dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4423914">Expand</a></span>

As someone with no experience in the comic book that inspired the series, I feel like I got a pretty good introduction in the first game. I think the developers knew that, because Darkness II builds wonderfully on that foundation and covers several comic elements that the first game did not, such as the Darkness itself&apos;s opposite number, the Angelus. The campaign belongs to a breed of story-driven, cinematic shooter that I have always loved, and indeed does a good job of making you feel terrifyingly powerful while still challenging you to fight creatively. And when that&apos;s over, you have an excellent co-op mode with a group of four entertaining characters, each with their own distinct Dark weapon. Especially endearing to me is the psychopathic, perpetually drunk Scotsman Jimmy Wilson, armed with his foe-cleaving Dark Axe that he can throw and summon back to him at will.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507999">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The &quot;shooting&quot; part of the gameplay is decent-to-good (weapons are pretty classic) and the real meat of the game / twist of the genre comes from the supernatural powers granted by the Darkness, in shape of two &quot;snakes&quot; on both side of the screen. During the shooting, you can do things with the snakes like grabbing, throwing, destroying, slashing, etc. The controls are a little bit complex to manage at first, but you&apos;ll eventually get used to it and it&apos;s really fun.
<br>
<br>An interesting game mechanic is tied to light : the Darkness hates the light, so when you&apos;re exposed to it, you temporarily lose your powers - this leads to interesting level layout (otherwise pretty linear), light deactivation puzzles and even enemy types carrying light to weaken you. Now we&apos;re talking challenge.
<br>
<br>The game follows a single storyline, that has many twists and turns that will deepen it, and eventually question you up to the ending where you take the final decision, depending on your perception of the events. Even if the cinematics / dialogs are a little bit long, I found this final part rewarding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5653288">Expand</a></span>

I would summ it up as smoething different, you know, such as Borderlands is for the FPS genre and that is becaouse I give it 8 out of 10.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY
<br>It is one of the better sides of this title. There are enough guns to keep the shooting interesting and the gunplay itself is fun. Every gun is a little different so the player can customize his inventory to certain situations. In addition, you can dual wield just about any two guns, be it the same type or different.
<br>You can shoot freehand or you can aim down the sights, both modes are ok. Ofcourse there`s no  selecting between burst/singleshot modes but this is nothing that would take away from the gunplay.
<br>Gun animations such as reloading and arming are also there and well made. No real flaws here.
<br>
<br>AI, as this is mostly a singleplayer game, should be at least ok. IMO it is ok. There are many different types of cannonfodder here, so you have to change weapons and killing ways to make it interesting long enough. The enemies change their positions, take cover and move a lot. If I had any complaints here, it would be that they are too tough, especially in the later parts of the game.
<br>
<br>Here I come to the biggest flaw of this game. The levels are different and interesting, but no longer than after 2,5 hours the game ditches the changes of environment and just throws more and more enemies at you in different combinations. There are lot of scripts where the drones appear from different directions and spots and you can`t tell when this happens. As a result, you often end up encircled by enemies you thought you killed just moments ago. At about half through the singleplayer mode, this tends to get silly with waves and waves of enemies thrown at you, and you are repeatedly outnumbered with little ammo to spare.  Even worse, those drones almost everytime come with guys who flash their lights at you, making you blind and ripped off your special powers. That doesn`t make the experience any better and just iritated me, because I very often felt underpowered, had to retreat and hide just not to die. Hardly the experience of an evil guy with mad superpowers.
<br>
<br>Lastly, the &quot;tentacles&quot; of Darkness are very cool, giving great interesting skills, many kill animations. Howegver as said above, the game itself often prevents the player from using them, which is a bad choice.
<br>
<br>The player is given some special abilities like creating a black hole. Most of them are &quot;meh&quot; but I wouldn`t sum it up as needless. They don`t make the game any worse, at times they make it better, so why not.
<br>
<br>STORY
<br>It is something I`ve never seen before and I liked it a lot. Jackie as the protagonist is very cool. You are the evil one who is making carnage everywhere. Everyone`s afraid of you. At the same time Jenny makes you show your human side whenever she appears. There are some different missions with classic &quot;kill xxx drones and reach the level boss&quot; style and there are some not fighting levels like the asylum where the player mostly talks with othere characters. Switching between the two makes the player really confused as to what is factually going on and that is a very good thing. The story swallowed me whole thanks to this and some of the memorable characters (Jackie`s henchmen).
<br>I finished the story in 8 hours, I rate it as good overall.
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS
<br>Playing through the game in 2014, I did not see anything particulary wrong here. The game is pretty, textures are ok. Guns and levels look good, character models are well detailed. Nothing like Far Cry 3 or Crysis but at the same time nothing that would take away from the enjoyment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3996824">Expand</a></span>

<br>THE DARKNESS II is a terrific little game. I say little because the main campaign is somewhat short, (6&#x2013;8 hrs, depending on how you play) although it is supplemented by a number of small campaigns that can be played alone or as online coop. But this lack of content is more than compensated for by the quality of what you do get. The best thing about TD2 is the combat, which incorporates some of the most enjoyable features and mechanics I&#x2019;ve encountered in a game. The demon arms that Jackie sprouts when he engages The Darkness are great fun to use. You can grab, dismember, and disembowel enemies with ease. You can whip, slash, and decapitate. You can also throw all manner of objects, and it&#x2019;s especially satisfying to impale enemies with scaffolding poles or to cut them in half with a car door. The weapons are pretty good too, and channelling The Darkness through dual-wielded pistols is as cool as gunplay gets. You&#x2019;re also accompanied by a side-kick, in the shape of a hilarious Darkling, who farts and wisecracks while jumping on enemies and beating them around the head. What more could you want? Well, there&#x2019;s a decent story behind the action and the voice acting is good throughout. The art style is similar to that of the Borderlands series and is perfectly suited to a comic book adaptation. On the downside, it is, as already mentioned, rather short. Also, when playing the additional maps you play as different characters, none of whom have the demon arms (although they do have the darkness and can channel it through various weapons), and consequently they do not offer quite as much fun as Jackie does. Nevertheless,  TD2 is enjoyable throughout and I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7269133">Expand</a></span>

The voice acting is some of the best in recent memory and the script is really well written. All the characters feel so real and alive which really adds to the experience.

Overall it&apos;s just a very fun shooter with a good story and incredible voice work, and even though it&apos;s 4 years old it holds up well today thanks to its stylised visuals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6564607">Expand</a></span>

Last week, mostly out of boredom, I decided to give it a try, A very pleasant surprise, indeed. Overall the game is a linear action/horror first person shooter similar to games like Bulletstorm in it&apos;s (fun as hell) selection of ways to kill the enemy. The story is no Oscar winner, but keeps one entertained, and the skills wheel makes you want to give the rather short 6 hour campaign another run. Graphics can&apos;t compete with with other major titles out there, BUT the cartoony graphics style fits perfectly to this game.

Not the biggest fan of the cell shaded graphics, but they work fine in this game and most importantly game runs smooth from start to finish. Gameplay was also suprisingly solid with enough satisfying gunplay. The idea of being a mob boss with evil dark powers who has lost his true love and is being tormented by it was something original in game for me. Story also goes goes into a area where you must question what is reality and whats fiction. Jackie himself and his side kick Darkling are very likeable characters. Voice acting was also very nicely done for most of the characters. Using your evil powers efectively in combat took a bit of time to get used to, but once you do its a blast to play.
<br>
<br>In the end very good game with a bit of a sequel bait in the ending which i hope we&apos;ll see someday.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-darkness-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6779453">Expand</a></span>
