Replayable to the point of abusiveness and deep beyond imagination, ?GalCiv? is an achievement that goes beyond almost all the adulatory accolades that can be rightfully attached to it. Brad Wardell and his team are fully worthy of avatarhood industry-wide for the level of user input they welcome and to which they unfailingly respond. After a months-long beta period, and only a few short weeks after release, no fewer than 4 significant gameplay-enhancing subsequent releases have been provided, with a major expansion pack coming mid-summer. Wardell?s dev team has pledged a full year of ongoing support to expanding GalCiv, and one can only imagine how far this truly phenomenal game will have progressed when Stardock is done polishing it. Yes, there could be more middle ground between ?too easy? and ?too difficult?, and if you?re seeking cutting-edge 3D graphics and tons of shoot-?em-up action, then look elsewhere; but for the thinking, strategy-inclined gamer, this title can only be described as hopelessly addictive gaming nirvana and an ultra-rare treat beyond description. Recommended without a shred of reservation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations/user-reviews?user_review_id=366477">Expand</a></span>

One of my favorite aspects of the game is that it de-emphasizes the necessity of combat. yes, you can certainly pursue a military path to victory, but the extensive work put in to building the trade and economic systems mean that you can also win without firing a shot, simply by building your empire into an economic juggernaught.

I just really love this game and would recommend to any strategy game player who has a little patience to get started as the rewards are great. I rarely touch any of my other computer games. Another great thing is there is a community! You get to talk to other players and sugest mprovements (there are always patches coming out to make teh game better and more challenging and they listen to the players!)
