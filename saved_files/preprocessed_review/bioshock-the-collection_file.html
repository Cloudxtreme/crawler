The original version is actually my favorite game of all time despite the technical issues. I&apos;m giving this &quot;remaster&quot; a 2/10 because it fails at being a remaster in almost every conceivable way.
<br>
<br>All of the technical issues that plagued the original PC release are present in this iteration. All of them. Mouse input (which was easily the worst aspect of the original game)  has not seen any fixes in this remaster, the constant audio dropping/stuttering hasn&apos;t been fixed, and the game constantly crashes just like the original did when played on newer hardware. Also, game-breaking bugs from roughly a decade ago have remained untouched in this release. The addition of new bugs, like the main menu randomly switching between controller and KBM controls, doesn&apos;t help the situation.
<br>
<br>The texture work and lighting, while decent in some areas, is actually worse than the original in others. Definitely not up to par with what I&apos;ve come to expect from remastered games. Worse still is that the advanced graphics settings are COMPLETELY ABSENT from this release even though they were in the original. I don&apos;t know what else to call that than a downgrade.
<br>
<br>There is still no FOV slider, and there is still no mouse sensitivity slider. Sensitivity is still measured on a 1-10 scale, with 1 being the only &quot;normal&quot; sensitivity, but also being especially bugged for some reason, forcing players to use 2 sensitivity minimum.
<br>
<br>So... what exactly was &quot;remastered&quot; in Bioshock Remastered? Certainly none of the things that needed to be. I would have given this effort a 0/10, but then I remembered the addition of the Golden Reels, console-exclusive DLC, and Steam achievements.
<br>
<br>Honestly, this game is just sad. It could have been so much better, but the devs decided not to make an effort.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-the-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=6698446">Expand</a></span>

Make no mistake, all 3 Bioshock games are just mediocre console FPSes with bad graphics, bad controls, stupid plots full of holes and run of the mill gameplay. I am fairly certain that those games, back when they were released, were just hyped based on paid reviews/shills and 12 year old kids who had never played an FPS before in their lives. &quot;Spiritual successors to System Shock 2&quot;? LOOOOOL.
<br>
<br>All 3 of those games are 7/10 games at the year of their release. Nothing more nothing less, just functional mainstream console FPS. Getting all 3 for the price of 1, is not bad, but make no mistake, on PC there is almost no improvement for Bioshocks 1 and 2, and Bioshock Infinite is exactly the same. So if you like your meh FPSes and like cheap deals, i suppose you could buy this if you have never tried them before. The rest of you, play any other FPS on the market, it is probably better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-the-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=6700155">Expand</a></span>

On the other Hand Bioshock Infinite is kinda bad at least by himself but since this collection contains Burial at Sea 1 and 2 this make Infinite Slightly better and solidify its place in the trilogy.  So yeah its an  amazing collection and every shooter/RPG hybrid should own also Credits for the PC version which  is free if you own the 3 games already but suffer from a lack of option and optimization but still they give it for free so i won&apos;t complain much i written this review mainly for the console player while i own the PC version of these games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-the-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=7314533">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Bioschock: Remastered
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>- You will step in to the rapture (city at bottom of sea) for first time.
<br>- Graphics are logically worst of all tree games, but it is still okay even for todays standarts.
<br>- Gameplay is what matters here and in bioshock 1 its very good. Interesting locations, enemies, bosses, crafting, hacking, etc... You explore locations, finding hiddent areas, fighting your way trought hostile city. There are various weapons and plasmind (magical powers) that will help you in various situations and fights of course.
<br>- Story is and lore very good too. You will expereince a lot of funny, interesting moments.
<br>- First game is the longest of all three in my opinion. its a little bit slower but do not fear, t&#xB4;here is enough action for everybody.
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>- Crashing. Yes that is the only thing that i didnt liked. After years, it is still there and not fixed. So if you will paly this, please do have 2 SAVES and rotate them everytime you save. I had to repeat almost all location because of this.
<br>
<br>Bioschock 2: Remastered
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>- In second game, you will look to the undersea city rapture again, but this time you will play as Big Daddy (If you played first game you know what it is :-D)
<br>- Graphics are significantly better. Especially water effects are very good (Better than in third bioshock)
<br>- The game is really very similiar to the first bioshock. But everything is enhanced. Fights are better, crafting is better, hacking is better. Almost all things are improved a bit. The game plays better.
<br>- But there are still some thing that are worse. The game feels shorter. Locations are more straightforward and not so interesting in my opinion and so on.
<br>- Story is and lore are very good.
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>- Still crashing :-D but now only when you let the game in menu for some time. But rotate saves here too for sure like in first game.
<br>
<br>Bioshock: Infinite
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>- Third bioshock is different and not in bad way, but in good way. It is from different universe :-D. Welcome to the columbia, the flying city!
<br>- Good thing is the gameplay itself is very similiar to first 2 games, but with more intense action. There are no pasive plasminds but now you will find gear through the game (its better in my opinion). Active plasminds (magic skills) are still here and they are still usefull and funny to use. There many weapons to use and you can choose which fits better to your playstyle.
<br>- In bioshock: infinity you will have a companion, sweet young girls elisabeth, that will acompany you during the game and will be with you till the end. Together with her you will uncover story of third bioshock which is in my opinion fantastic and leaves 2 previous games behind. Elisabeth is not just a pet that will follow you. She talk, she move, she cover herself, she find money, ammo, salt (mana) and medkits for you, and thats not all because about you and her the whole story is. She is just unique and fantastic addition to the game. Without her game would be nothing.
<br>- Graphics are logically best from all three bioshocks but in bioshock 2, water had better effects.
<br>- Music and sounds are atmosferic and top notch. The world itself is beatufily crafted.
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>- Well its not crashing, at least for me. But its sad it stuters on my new high end PC when changing locations (loading new things) its annoying but i got used to it.
<br>
<br>FINAL RESULT
<br>
<br>All three bioshocks in single pack and in discount are fantastic offer. Gameplay, Story, Atmosphere, Good portion of action, Many ways how to play, that are things where all bioshocks excell. I like that all bioshocks differs from each other in some ways. in every one of the three i like something else that others do not have.
<br>
<br>If there werent crashing and stuttering issues it would be even better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-the-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=7578582">Expand</a></span>
