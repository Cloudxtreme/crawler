<br>Its still not a 10 but its an easy 8 and possibly a 9 if you&apos;re a big fan of some of the genres it combines. It includes your standard first-person hack and slack, dungeon crawling, as well as some skyrim style rpg and equipment, and a little bit of Theif as well. Lots of good exploration. Complicated combat if you take the time to figure it out. Tons of alternative ways to &quot;off&quot; enemies. Its not full on stealth or hack and slash, but it forces you to mix them a bit. Give this game a chance. Its cheap nowdays too, and still looks good compared to todays games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2791749">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m guessing that alienated some of the fans, but I far prefer ARPGs, so the change in style is a positive imo.
<br>
<br>The game is terribly buggy until you get the latest patch, but with the latest patch (1.02), all of the serious issues are fixed. I&apos;m not counting that against the score anymore because it&apos;s simply stupid to rate a game down for issues that have already been fixed.
<br>
<br>Imo, Dark Messiah is excellent. Voice acting is poor at times, but fortunately it&apos;s quite good for Leanna and Xana (the two companions and romance options who have 90% of the total dialogue). The combat is deeper than the typical ARPG, and there&apos;s a heavy emphasis on using the environment to kill opponents. In fact, if you don&apos;t take advantage of alternate tactics the fights will last a long time and sap your health. It&apos;s much quicker to throw an urn of oil at someone and kick them into a fire than it is to simply slash at them repeatedly. I suspect this is where some complaints came from. Some people end up slowly grinding through every fight, because they won&apos;t accept that they need to think fast and use varied tactics to beat enemies efficiently. I can&apos;t stress this enough; it simply is not effective to spam attacks on someone&apos;s shield. Instead, throw a shovel at them and beat them down while they&apos;re distracted. Etc. The combat reminds me of Zeno Clash+Skyrim.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t fault Dark Messiah for requiring some intelligence on the player&apos;s end.
<br>
<br>On to other aspects, there are a lot of hidden areas in zones that add replay value. Add variable endings and several relevant difficulty modes, and there&apos;s a lot of potential for at least a few playthroughs. Replayability and game length is huge for me. Since I&apos;m in college and I don&apos;t have infinite cash, it doesn&apos;t make sense to spend $20-50 on a game for just a few hours of entertainment.
<br>
<br>At times, Dark Messiah incorporates parkour and climbing aspects to offset its combat, and in general it works very well. My only complaint in that regard is that I wish the climbing was a bit more fluid. I play at 60 fps on a full gaming rig with a high-precision mouse, and even then it was sometimes difficult to maintain control of the character while vaulting between windows.
<br>
<br>The story is decidedly average. The first time I played it, I wasn&apos;t really sure what was going on. I just knew Necromancers were killing people and there were a lot of spider-worshippers. My second playthrough, I took more time to read books and notes (hidden in the game), and I paid a lot more attention to in-game banter and cutscenes. After paying more attention, the story becomes a lot more interesting, but it&apos;s still not great.
<br>
<br>The graphics, from what I understand, were stunningly beautiful back when the game released. In 2013, they still hold up well enough. The character models especially look good, which is welcome, because unless you&apos;re female or otherwise inclined, you&apos;ll probably spend a lot of the game staring at your companion&apos;s mostly exposed thighs. One thing I also like is that the girl attached to the aforementioned thighs is reasonably clothed. There&apos;s no lingerie armor here. There&apos;s only one character wearing skimpy (or no) clothing throughout, and she&apos;s a succubus, so that makes sense. Hair and skin is also well done, and water supports full scene reflections. The HDR lighting is still beautiful and the physics hold up well. I ran the game on ultra at 60 fps back when I had a GTX 460, and I still run it on ultra at 60 fps now that I have a new GTX 660 TI.
<br>
<br>If it sounds like I don&apos;t like the game, I apologize. Really I had a great time with Dark Messiah, but I try to list at least as many complaints as good features in my reviews. Too much of either is just unhelpful, unless it explains in detail why the game irrefutably deserves such a score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=3241333">Expand</a></span>

All these different systems individually mastered in both design and execution. Combined together to produce an immersive , dynamic and enjoyable set of systems unmatched by any game to date.<br><br>The choice in difficulty a player is likely to over look for picking their typical preference. But in the game all different difficulty levels present a unique pace of game play that whatever you feel your skill level is, all difficulties in this game are enjoyable.<br><br>The re-playability does not end with the difficulty choice, the skill tree system allows you to not only build a unique character, but replaying the game and making different skill choices also completely changes how you interact with both the enemies and the environment, many opportunities which you may have over looked in previous play through reveal themselves completely changing how you had previously perceived a level. This is similar to the different approaches in Deus Ex, but the different paths you can take are much more subtle, and there is no &quot;right&quot; way to complete a level.<br><br>But the replayabilty does not stop with skills and difficulty. Every single weapon type, every single spell, can be used in many unique ways. Directional attacks like M&amp;B, but with added advantage of the fantastic Source engine physics, means enemies will be pushed from side to side or onto the ground depending on your swing direction, if your charging the enemy and many other unique actions, all beautifully animated for first person view. And that just for swords... there are staves, daggers, bows and shields each with their own unique capabilities too.<br><br>In as varied as the weapons are, the spells are also another side to the game which has been implemented so well, and unmatched to this day.  Lightning that travels through water to hit every enemy, to huge fireball that explode sending burning, screaming, flying through the air enemies, who often if your skilled enough find themselves blown of a cliff edge. There are many more spells and unique ways to use them that I will leave any newcomers the joy of discovering for themselves.<br><br>The Negative; the voice acting would be 4/10 and the story 6/10. They are weakest parts of the game. But really they are irrelevant, the real story is YOUR journey through game, how unique and inventively you tackle the threats you face, each run through the game will be a one of a kind experience, that any other action game would fall short of.<br><br>I could not recommend this game enough, if your a PC gamer this is a must have. If you have already played it, play it again, there will be there for you to discover! a real TEN, unmatched and outclasses all other action games by far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2419154">Expand</a></span>

This game has the best melee combat system ever seen so far: 2012 games like Skyrim still don&apos;t have such an advanced and &quot;environmental&quot; combat system. It is true that Dark Messiah is neither an FPS or an RPG, but its story is really engrossing and the RPGish features add more fun to the game.<br>There is no game out there that let you interact so well with things surrounding you, and the story never gets boring.

Tons of creative ways to kill your opponents, lite RPG elements that don&apos;t intrude on the base hack-and-slash gameplay, and what is still probably the best first person melee combat ever. Multiplayer is pretty tacked on but this is still worth picking up today just to experience the single player.</span>

Do we have some sort of mystery here? Well, not really. The things is quite simple: DM tries to let you explore the world around you but in some borders, yourself - but without self-analysis and the story of your avatar but, again, without soul-reaping details. There are a kingdom, and magic and demons and some loot. There is no Shakespeare&apos;s drama or moral problems. Why there must be? I don&apos;t know but the critics asured that this particular game must be very, very serious. Also it must have a way better graphics, sound and so one. The truth - it must not. It&apos;s a good story, childish dream of power, naive and sunny in some parts and anciently shadowed in another. Just let yourself to listen the tale and enjoy the taste of your own childhood.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2872037">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Have a look at Youtube, it amazing how many Plyers share my opinion about this game.
<br>Okay, its linear and by far not that big and open as skyrim. But hell yeah! its by far older and was never such a big one. its a real Insiders, hot tipp. Everyone who loves a small, linear, fast paced, action oriented and scary RPG  will LOVE this brilliant game that gibes u 3 superb  completely  different character classes!

The combat is fun and very different from what you would normally expect from a first person melee game. The weapon classes all offer very different gameplay options allowing for a lot of variety in combat. Magic is fluid but some of the spells lack the balance needed (especially the inferno spell). The  first person camera is amazing and it is really refreshing to see your legs and body (as weird as that sounds) when you look down. The story is engaging enough to keep you playing through the different beautifully designed stages. The stages are designed to make you use physics instead of regular hack and slash. Fighting in close quarters: drop an oil jar, set it on fire, profit. Enemy near a ledge: knock him off. Enemy near spikes: kick him into them. Enemy not near spikes: kick him anyways. The game really gets you thinking on how to use the environment in your favor (ex. setting your arrows on fire). The RPG elements are a bit lacking, as this game takes more of the action approach to the story but regardless there are plenty of secrets to find during the levels. The mutliplayer is amazing in its own unique way and does not feel like an afterthought to accompany the game: but rather, a separate game that comes with the purchase. Some annoying glitches (visual, audio, and gameplay) exist but if you install all the patches there should not be any big, game-breaking problems. If you are a fan of the heroes franchise (who has kept up with the storyline of the newer games) there is lots of references and hints that will make the story much more relevant (its a direct sequel to homm5 with characters from both homm 5 and homm 6 either mentioned or making actual appearances). Overall a very fun and enjoyable game. Money well spent in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2491839">Expand</a></span>

I remember buying this game and couldn&apos;t play it because it crashed after competing the tutorial level (prologue). After some patches and fixes the game finally worked for me and DAMN, that have been fun. The physics are weird but really fun, there are plenty ways of killing a single enemy. Or you can be boring and kick them into spikes or some other insta-kill environment. The story itself is actually interesting IMO, I won&apos;t spoil anything but you can alternate the ending, it isn&apos;t a huge different but still great.
<br>The fighting mechanics is fun! really fun, probably the best part of the game. I know the game is easy sometimes but its still fun! It really depends on how you play the game, the boring way with insta-kills and getting through the game as fast as possible, or having fun and exploring the world. Btw there are a lot of secrets in this game, some that might benefit you later on.
<br>There are some bugs and glitches but they aren&apos;t a huge problem, you might get stuck now and then and the AI is kind of horrible. But that&apos;s what makes the game fun! except for your companions AI, that&apos;s horrible and bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=3554076">Expand</a></span>

With any bladed weapon you can slash (in two directions), stab, uppercut, or deliver a powerful overhead blow, all with a simple combination of a direction key plus a mouse button, a system that becomes intuitive almost immediately. There is also the &quot;death kick&quot; that, while perhaps a little too powerful to be realistic, sure is fun when you&apos;ve got enemies backed toward the edge of a cliff or a rack of metal spikes.  Other than innovative melee combat, most of Dark Messiah is standard dungeon-crawler stuff: monsters, various races, the usual spells, choices about how to develop your strengths, and of course the choice of good-versus-evil. I suspect hardcore FPS gamers will find Dark Messiah too easy; by the end your powers are pretty much god-like, and you can destroy most enemies with a single physical or magical blow.  But if you are just looking for good, clean, bloody, hack-and-slash fun with a decent story and lots of cool environments, Dark Messiah definitely satisfies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682313">Expand</a></span>

The best medieval/melee combat in first person, one of the few games that made me finish it with all the characters, so diverse and fun that was the gameplay. Onother was &quot;severance - blade of darkness&quot;. And im an hardcore allstats rolling RPG gamer.. but this game was nearlly perfect.</span>

<br>Seems the game is unknown to most.. And i simply can&apos;t live with that
<br>The world needs to know about the best game ever
<br>It&apos;s kinda old now, but it runs on Source Engine, so the graphics are still acceptable (I&apos;m a huge graphics snob, so this says something)
<br>1000 out of 10, i will be buried with this game dug into my heart</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=5559451">Expand</a></span>

<br>with the perfect gameplay, world and lore from the might and magic series (Heroes of Might and Magic V)
<br>physics engine using the Source Engine, this Hack and Slash FPS is the eqivelent of half life 2 as a childhood masterpiece of game
<br>criminally under-rated (FU gamespot) and the spritual predecessor of Dishonored
<br>
<br>this game hits all the spots from a gaming perspective
<br>too bad it&apos;s a tad bit short, but has IMMENSE replayvalue
<br>i&apos;ve finished this game 15 times on the elements version on console
<br>and now i&apos;ve finished it on the 16th on the steam version
<br>
<br>and my god, what a nostalgia trip!
<br>i wish i could erase my memory and replay this gem again and again...
<br>
<br>this game has 4 main styles of gameplay, with the PC version you can mix em up
<br>on console you&apos;re stuck with whatever you started with
<br>
<br>so you have:
<br>Strength and Endurance -Sword and Shield with heavy armor playstyle
<br>Stealth and burgerly - use of daggers, allows to 1-hit kill from behind while undetected, also to open doors and chests without keys (via automatic lockpicking)
<br>Magic and Mana:spells spells spells! get yer spells here, don&apos;t bother with staves, they&apos;re boring and unispring
<br>i personally perfer the &quot;utility&quot; magic over the elemental magic, because you have the &quot;Charm&quot; ability which makes enemies allies for a period of time, very helpful and you can get it pretty early on
<br>
<br>last but not least...
<br>marksmanship and critial hits: bow gameplay, essentially turning this game into a medivil FPS, i don&apos;t like this playstyle because it relies on you camping from a distance and aiming for the head, if you want this playstyle
<br>mix with a couple levels of stealth
<br>
<br>i personally went with the dishonored build
<br>a lot of stealth and crit, a bunch of magic, some endurance and a bit of strength (on hardmode enemies can definitely take a beating) and i would DEFINITELY recommend you to play this game on at least hard (normal is the EZ mode of the game)
<br>ask me what to level up first if you&apos;re in a bind
<br>
<br>and if you&apos;re really into the story,i&apos;ed recommend watching the story of Heroes of might and magic V and it&apos;s expansions on youtube (i can link you to a channel)
<br>Dark Messiah concludes the might and magic series before Ubisoft went to milk the &quot;past&quot; of the series with terrible sequels
<br>as of now this is the last year of the seventh dragon (989), meaning this game was the planned to end the series (either giving Ashan eternal peace, or unleashing all Shough upon it)
<br>
<br>TLDR: this is a great game and i would recommend you to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=7445233">Expand</a></span>

The story is, believable in a fantasy setting but isn&apos;t great but holds the game well enough to sending you into battle against evil foes! The graphics are quite good for a game that was made when it was but the real strong point for me was the magic! Every spell is completely unique in its own way, fireballs being like homing missiles while frost spells could freeze enemies or terrain. They all add a very fun twist to the game that no other game has ever succeeded at before now! Definitely recommended if you&apos;re looking for an RPG with combat a cut above the rest!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2685631">Expand</a></span>

This adaptation of the Source engine, developed by Arkane Studios, is a classic example of a good game that could have been so much more. You take on the role of Sareth, apprentice of the Wizard Phenrig, who is initially tasked with delivering a strange crystal to another wizard, who is in search of the &quot;Skull of Shadows&quot;. However, as the story progresses, you find yourself entangled in an ancient prophecy that could potentially end the world. This game plays remarkable similar to another Arkane Studios game, Arx Fatalis; so if you liked that game, you can stop reading this review right here because you&apos;ll like this game as well.  The enviromnents themselves are actually pretty good, even for a game released in 2006. Combat is fast paced and varies greatly depending on whatever weapon types you decide to use. There is a basic skill progression system that allows you to decide what Sareth can do both in and out of combat. With it, you CAN progress down the basic archetypes (Warrior, mage, rogue) or you can mix and match to fit your style. My personal preference is mage; I don&apos;t understand why people think it&apos;s so weak. Admitedly, it starts out somewhat underpowered, but mid-late game, it becomes unstoppable (Sanctuary FTW). The voice acting is passable and at times is funny and I found myself chuckling more than once. However, this game does come with some serious drawbacks that limit an otherwise flawless game. First off, the game is just too short and while it does a fair job of making you feel like part of the game, the fast pace of the game often leaves you behind. Second, the enemy AI ranges from overly brilliant, to just plain stupid (They can find me hiding in a corner 100 feet away, but they can&apos;t think of any other way to attack me besides charging into my kick.). Finally, the limited weapon variety pretty much tells you what weapons you&apos;ll be using. Ultimatly though, for its price, this is a fair buy for RPG fans, and they won&apos;t be dissapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=1774996">Expand</a></span>

Now, I, completely understand the need for copyright protection... after all, these people work too hard to produce these games, only to have them pirated. This so- called protection should no way infringe on your ability to play these games. What I find to be inexcusable, is UBISOFT releasing a game before ensuring that it is , reasonably, bug free. I had a problem that was a result of the copyright protection conflicting with my DVD rom ( driver software). Why was this major problem not resolved before shipping? Waiting for a patch,for me, is an afterthought, that is simply, not acceptable. I feel that these problems could have been avoided, had this product been thoroughly tested before it&apos;s release.Everyone makes mistakes but when they are done consistently, one has to wonder what is UBISOFT hoping to prove by releasing glitched and sub par products.Because of this, I have, reluctantly, sold my copy of Dark Messiah after many frustrating hours, unsuccessfully trying to get it to work and am sad to say that I wll never purchase another UBISOFT product, unless these big copyright protection problems are resolved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=392726">Expand</a></span>

Yes, I did manage to play through and beat the game on my friend&apos;s computer. I was amazed, It&apos;s absolutely beautiful. The gameplay is unique, however frustrating at first but that&apos;s most new HUD styles.The Kick ability was so much fun I couldn&apos;t contain myself. Especially right at the beginning when you can kick the Stonehelm guard out the window as he looks down through it. XD Then the story was a bit farfetched but I tend to not notice that until after the game is finished. Voice acting was awesome. Everything was nearly flawless. I swear, I had to get this game for myself... That&apos;s where the problem came in and I&apos;m still dealing with it as of now. 2.) I thankfully paid only $7.99 for the game off steam and I was surprised to see it so low. I kept thinking, &quot;What a great bargain for a good game.&quot; Only to have to find out that it&apos;s a 6.7 gigabite game file and I have a 256k DSL connection... In short, I waited for nearly eleven hours before it finished. I went ahead and restarted the computer just to make sure that it got the updates needed and such and to let my computer allow it access to the internet and all. Well upon starting up, the main UBISOFT logo opening locked up and started to lag majorly, like it was being run off a 1 ghz processor. Here&apos;s my setup: 3.0 ghz HT Processor (Intel) 3.25 gigs of ram (4 really but it doesn utilize all of it) 256 mb Nvidia Geforce 7300 GT with latest drivers It didn&apos;t run with that. Now I can run Supreme Commander on medium and it plays somewhat smoothly. There&apos;s something seriously wrong with the game, Dark Messiah M&amp;M, itself, whether it be the latest update or the coding of the game in general, UBISOFT has officially gone on my &quot;stay away from&quot; list.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=420947">Expand</a></span>

The extreme diversity of activities throughout the game keeps it from becoming repetitive. The skill system also adds yet another dimension. However, when i first played it (the MINUTE it was released i started playing) i noticed that Dark Messiah of Might and Magic probably was just about the buggiest game i have ever played, and furthermore probably one of the buggiest release titles ever in gaming history. In about 8 hours i had completed the campaign twice, and i must say that in the end the glass felt half-full rather than half-empty. There simply is so much to see in it. Now, a few months later, the game has gone from the buggiest game ever to the most updated game ever. The update log is the size of the bible! And the bugs HAVE been fixed, the flow is surpreme and the multiplayer is IMMENSE. Playing the game now is like playing an entirely new game, compared to playing it release day. So as much as the lower ratings here were very much justified RELEASE DAY, they are not justified here. The low ratings have expired, and the metaphorical Stamina and Mana of Might and Magic has just about finished regenerating.

As a Might and Magic game, it&apos;s a horrid failure. Might and Magic used to be about large expanses (for their time) of world to explore, of dungeon crawls and leveling up.

I have played every game in the might and magic series and this one doesnt currently work. Long load times, stuttering sound, etc. I decided it is not worth playing after dieing and contemplating another 5 min load time.</span>

I am tech savvy, there is nothing wrong with my computer, no viruses, no memory bugs, etc etc. The game just plain sucks.</span>

The recent 1.01 patch fixed the game for maybe 10%. Might as well called all of us suckers beta testers. Shame on the developers of this game. Don&apos;t waste a hard earned 50 bucks on this!</span>

The Ugly: It&apos;s just not a stable game; some people manage to run it fine, but for those people who experience problems the game just gets really frustrating after a while because you never know when the game will freeze, crash, or slow down to just a few FPS for some weird reason (you have to reload your save game when the FPS drop occurs). If you can get the game the run fine then you are going to have a great time; although make sure you set the game to modest settings because it&apos;s a real system hog. If it wasn&apos;t for all the technical difficulties and a more original storyline, I would have given this game a score of 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=402259">Expand</a></span>

The ability to behead an opponent (easily when stunned, try the lightning shield...) is nice, and the graphics are great. The story does move too quickly at times, and there are some very frustrating moments when trying to jump up to new platforms, or out of the water. I do like the use of the rope bow though. =) I&apos;m obviously one of the lucky ones that has a system it only crashes on 33% of the time, and even then, only after playing for a reasonably long time. I can&apos;t imagine how mad I&apos;d be if I felt like a &quot;beta tester&quot; like so many others have. That&apos;s just B.S. and UBI should be careful... if they do this enough they&apos;ll face a class action suit that will set them back far more than a small Q&amp;A dept. All that said, I am still very mad that the old Might &amp; Magic is gone. Granted the last several stunk (X was the worst, with so many bugs it was almost impossible to finish) but still, they held true to the series creating a world for you to explore. All in all, if the game had stayed true to the old Might &amp; Magic theme, I would have given it a 7, and from there, easily a 10 if they&apos;d not released a beta.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=393587">Expand</a></span>

Minimum Req. are understated you can not run the game with the min requirements met. Patches are too long in coming out. The game is over 6 weeks out and only one patch out and it needs at least 2 more but knowing UbiSoft you will never see them. Arkane Studios made a bad mistake teaming with Ubisoft !</span>

Dark Messiah is another example of what a game COULD have been. With some refinement, skill balancing, and a little more creativity this game might have been enjoyable. Instead it remains a journey into mediocrity. The levels are uninspired with the same tricks of cutting a rope to drop a box on an enemy, kicking them into spikes, or just plain slashing at them halfheartedly. Blocking attacks is clunky and there is way to dodge short of running away. Ranged combat is useless due to the unbelievably low damage that arrows inflict. Spell casting is also a farce. Spells are not powerful and use up at least half of your mana, leaving you very vulnerable for several minutes while you recharge. If you buy the game on sale and go into it with low expectations you&apos;ll probably get your money&apos;s worth. All in all, the game takes far too long to get to the interesting parts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=1707344">Expand</a></span>

No races, no classes, no attributes, no party, no open-world exploration, nothing that justify the use of the Might &amp; Magic brand.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know what the deal is with combat. I played the game with a focus on Magic and Archery, because I was never able to make heads or tails of the Melee fights in this game with daggers, swords and staffs, because there is a lot of distracting flamboyant swings and handling on the weapons in between strikes and a general lack of blood splatters and health bars on enemies, which makes it very hard to tell whether I am shadow boxing or actually dealing damage. Eventually, as I felt I wasn&apos;t making a difference, I started to use Charm a lot to let my enemies kill each other.
<br>
<br>At first it felt a bit like Gothic and it has a bit of the same mechanics where you have to combine strikes with movement keys, but with all the sneaking around in darkness, bows and daggers it started to feel much more like a Thief game. Fortunately enemies makes noise as they talk to each other or themselves, sounds of foot-steps or cripply-crawly noises give away their position so you don&apos;t have to sneak around all the time. The most important utility is the rope bow, that you will be using a lot to dodge traps and move on to the next level of whatever..
<br>
<br>The graphics and sounds are pretty decent. Looks a bit dated now, of course.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not a bad game per se, but it&apos;s not a Might &amp; Magic game and without that brand I would never have bothered playing it at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=4730570">Expand</a></span>

<br>I was hoping for some RPG. What I got is what many will call a FPS, but what I simply call a platformer. Not really my kind of game, and it started with a less than impressive tutorial, yet as soon as the story began I was enjoying it, from the narrative tricks to the scenery design, the pace and the liveliness. It&apos;s a game where killing is fun. Killing easily is fun, backstabbing is radical, low-level spells are powerful, a staff is a proper weapon (whereas in other games it&apos;s always designed as a wizard limitation,) and your foot is a true catapult.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll tell you some flaws, but they don&apos;t stop me from playing at all: it&apos;s as linear as a platformer can be. It has the occasional invisible obstacle that inexplicably blocks you between 2 planks. And progression might be too quick, as I am already more than satisfied with the full set of thieves skills and a couple of fun spells. That&apos;s pretty much the worst I can say.
<br>
<br>Casual sneaking and cutting throats at its best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=6036351">Expand</a></span>

The controls are very intuitive and you can change the story as much as you could in this, my only complaint is that it&apos;s very difficult at first, and becomes much much easier toward the end.</span>

I&apos;m running it at the lowest resolution and had to adjust some shading aspects, but it runs and looks fantastic now. Had some sound issues but fixed that by going on the Steam forums. If I would have been unable to install it or get it to run correctly I wouldnt be playing it, therefore I wouldnt have bothered giving a review based on my anger at not being able to play it. Hate to sound arrogant, but if your system is incapable of installing this game, you should think about upgrading, getting a new system or just stick to console gaming. PC gaming is inherently more involved and requires a bit of research and the understanding that the game you pick might not turn out the way you want. Stop blaming it on the game maker.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=392783">Expand</a></span>

The singleplayer campaign isn&apos;t like Oblivion however, but to think that if it did, everyone would say &quot;Oblivi-who?&quot;</span>

Luckily the game turned out to be really entertaining. It&apos;s not free, vast and doesn&apos;t have a deep storytelling element, but as a lightweigth action/adventureRPG it&apos;s a winner. I enjoyed Oblivion immensely and Gothic 3 keeps entertaining me, but at times they&apos;re exhaustingly open and there&apos;s way too much to do. Dark Messiah keeps it small and focused, which is an excellent option to the large games. The graphics are excellent and the game runs on full detail with no mentionable stuttering. Gameplay is great and so far I haven&apos;t encountered any bugs. Thoroughly enjoyable game. If you&apos;re into rpg/action adventures I&apos;d suggest you try the game. Only thing keeping the game away from a 10 is that from what I&apos;ve heared the game could be a tad longer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/user-reviews?user_review_id=392762">Expand</a></span>

The cons are that some fighting and play can be slightly repetative but not enought to ruin the game, however I do suggest hardcore gamers to begin playing at a hard setting otheriwse it can get boring until a challenging monsters comes along.</span>
