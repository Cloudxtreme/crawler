Some of the gameplay mechanics from previous games are gone like Pontius&apos;s hammer, watering plants or summoning different sized boxes. I finished the game in 3 days (with all triangles collected), but I could probably do that in 1 day if I really wanted to. The ending for a second made me hope I&apos;ll get transported to a new map and I finished just a chapter of the game, but nope... Trine 3 ends with unsolved problem that will probably be continued in a DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-3-the-artifacts-of-power/user-reviews?user_review_id=5469697">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not bad and the fact that it&apos;s no longer a 2D-only game makes it more enticing, but it lacks the polished story of the previous 2 games and it ends abruptly when it actually starts getting interesting. My main complaint is the shortness of the story though, rather than the inconsistent aspect of it. The narrator seems to try too much to deliver, whereas the game mechanics need some serious work (in certain parts of the game) in order to provide the PC gamer with a pleasant experience. I&apos;d have very much appreciated if side-quests were skipped in detriment of a longer story and less bugs. The same ones I&apos;ve seen in the first game are still present in this 3rd iteration, which makes things hard to swallow. And the lack of character progression (which really made Trine 2 fun, I&apos;m now playing it on PS4 in co-op) is a depressing aspect to say the least, more like inexcusable. There are indeed some novel capabilities added to each of the 3 (shield floating or air-stomping for Pontius, rope tying for Zoya, smashing cubes in enemies heads for Amadeus) but those should really have been added bonus *on top* of the existing character progression rather than fixed features from the get-go. In all, I gave it a 7 because I&apos;m a fan of the series and really enjoyed the 2D-to-3D evolution, but it&apos;s actually around 6. It mattered also that I bought it for a discount on Steam, so all in all, a good 10EUR spent. But that&apos;s all I can recommend as price for Trin3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-3-the-artifacts-of-power/user-reviews?user_review_id=5661660">Expand</a></span>

However, it brings problems. Often it is not clear which direction you should take to proceed further. This is not a big problem in single-player, but when two or three players start playing, it becomes very confusing at some points. Especially since camera does not move perfectly. The graphics, music and sound effects are great, and it seems like the the game engine used has improved because the game is faster and more responsive to controls than Trine 1 and Trine 2. It&apos;s a good sequel to the series.

Games ends just when it gets started and should not have been released as it&apos;s worse than some early  access without even being one. One fix is that they put it in early access and finish it, then il give 8 at least depending on rest of the game.</span>

<br>a Beautiful but shallow adventure
<br>Trine 3 as a game about collecting well, the artifacts of power
<br>Trine 3 consists of 19 levels in total, included in those 19 levels are 8 main chapters to the game.
<br>You play as 3 different characters.
<br>You have a knight who comes equipped with a sword and a shield he can use to float,
<br>an assassin with a bow and ropes used to pull object, and a wizard character than can create a platform at will and move objects around the screen.
<br>Each character has their own chapter to introduce them, and  they all have their own optional side chapters throughout the game
<br>You only spend 5 of the 8 chapters together as the characters, but this is plenty enough, I actually prefer the levels where im on my own.
<br>You can play this game with local co op, and im fairly certain co op was in mind during the development of this game so I cant complain too much, however I feel like there was way too much dependency on the wizard&#x2026;
<br>Clearly the wizard has the most puzzle potential, but it would&#x2019;ve been nice to just give my mind a break and let me be the knight or platform with the assassin for a good while,
<br>There is a decent balance of back and forth to get through the levels, but they kind of felt a little too much like a puzzle, not enough of an adventure.
<br>There is some combat sprinkled into this game, not too much, again very puzzle heavy, but nothing all too challenging.
<br>In these gorgeous and varied worlds there are also triangles all over the place,
<br>Triangle collecting kind of became the game for me
<br>You have to collect triangles to unlock chapters, so you might as well collect them, luckily they are easy to spot and very fun to collect.
<br>All in all, I enjoyed the casual puzzle experience Trine 3 offers and I loved exploring the beautiful levels, but ultimately the game felt hollow to me, the story went over my head and there is no satisfying ending.. at least for me,
<br>Trine 3 is an alright time, but not a must play.
<br>
<br>For what it is, puzzle adventure game
<br>7.5/10
<br>

But it isn&apos;t. Because rather than developing the things that made the second game really great, like the skill trees, items, world visuals, and 2D (not 3D) platforming puzzles, it goes off in another direction; 3D. We already have a ton of games that utilize 3D platforming; they are called Action games. And Trine 3 takes a hit because of clunky controls that were clearly not optimized for this sort of thing. Depth perception is bad which makes many 3D puzzles and boss fights (with flying enemies in 3D) more difficult than necessary. This added complexity is not offset by any measurable improvements in the game. The skill trees are also gone, as well as the usable treasures from the second game. This made the game more repetitive and uncreative as a result, with the characters feeling less capable and distinct, compared to Trine 2. I don&apos;t like it when my favorite games regress, and Trine 3 feels like it was attempting to appeal to a broader audience by drawing in the console action crowd, at the expense of its 2D platforming charm, which made the game so strong to begin with. The game also feels unfinished and rushed, which is forgivable, given the short budget, but still, overall, Trine 3 only gets a 7 from me, which is the lowest I have given the series, because even with the 3D movement, it feels like a step back on many aspects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine-3-the-artifacts-of-power/user-reviews?user_review_id=7493790">Expand</a></span>

There are some features that the game retains. The platforming being one of them, the characters being another and of course the beautifully enchanting visuals. Now there are a number of things that sets Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power apart from it&apos;s predecessors. The first being that there&apos;s no leveling system, all of the skills learnt in the previous games e.g Pontius&apos; shield gliding ability and Zoya&apos;s fire arrows, to note two, are now given to you from the very start. Another difference, and quite a major one, is the camera angle(s). No longer are you bound to a 2D plane, you can now wander freely in 3D world. This does make the game more interesting, and puts the puzzling elements through their paces, Although at times it can be hard to judge the distance between certain platforms and how far away enemies are. One quite important thing to note is that this iteration of the game does seems to lack the amount of puzzles that the previous games in the series had. Also, not to mention, the difficulty seems to have been ramped up a little, not helped by the fact that it can&apos;t be changed, also unlike the previous two games.
<br>There are a number of moments in the game where it becomes incredibly frustrating, with the scarce number of checkpoints and the fairly annoying, and pointless, side quests that pit you against multiple waves of foes.
<br>Although retaining some of the original traits of the previous games, Trine 3 is sadly a bit of a disappointment. With bugs and glitches scattered around each level and the constant demand to battle enemies in order to progress, this game just feels like it&apos;s missing the original charm. The story is fairly well put together, however, and the characters are still as charming as ever. But sadly, for the most part Trine 3 is too lacking in what the series is known for. As a fan of the other two games, it saddens me to have to down vote this game. If you want to play the whole series then you have to play The Artifacts of Power. But if you want a puzzle based platformer that&apos;s very much like the previous two in the series, then I suggest looking elsewhere.
