I thought I was smart.  I thought that they didn&apos;t make games hard anymore.  Antichamber has gently relieved me of these delusions.  I&apos;ve been playing for hours and I don&apos;t even think I&apos;m past the first level yet.  It seems so abstract, but after grinding away you eventually find the clues cleverly woven into walls, or skillfully hidden in the cryptic language of the signs located throughout.  There is no one solution, no single correct way to proceed.  You must try and  remember everything, and once you devise a possible solution it will no doubt take technical execution.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend this game, but come prepared.  I didn&apos;t think a game could mentally toy with me like this one has, or be capable of downright stumping me in a manner that ridicules my intelligence.  It&apos;s challenging and frustrating, but at the same time lots of fun.  Games have veered away from the model presented in Antichamber, which is why I believe I like it so much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2928679">Expand</a></span>

In most video games they give you a few options but most of them don&apos;t lead anywhere. When the hero is asked &quot;Do you want to save the princess?&quot; It might give you a Yes or No choice but really no matter what you pick, you have to go save the princess. Not in Antichamber. Every decision you make leads somewhere. Turned left instead of right at an intersection? The game will happily let you continue down this path for 20 minutes throwing puzzles at you as you go just to find yourself trapped in a room with no way out. Probably because you missed some really important clue or ignored all the really subtle warnings that you were going the wrong way.   This game might just be the most scary games ever made. Its not a fear of something popping out at you and eating your face like most horror games, its a fear of the unknown. Its the same fear you might get before giving a big speech in front of a large audience. What if I make a mistake? What if I forget what I was going to say? What if the audience does not like what I&apos;m about to say? Only now its what if I go down this hallway instead of the other one? What if I close this door behind me and I get trapped? What if this next room has a hidden trap door and I fall into a completely new level? What if I did not find all the items I needed to from the area I can no longer access?
<br>You can always teleport out by pressing the escape key and start again, but you don&apos;t want to. You never want to admit the game beat you or that you fell for such an obvious trap. The game does such an amazing job setting the mood and pulling you in that it almost feels like your trapped for real.
<br>Overall its one of the best games I have ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2929219">Expand</a></span>

The basics are you move from one room to the next solving puzzles in a minimalistic 1st person world. There&apos;s no goal other than connecting the different rooms and seeing all  the hint messages along the way. After &quot;beating&quot; an area you&apos;ll find yourself either in a new room or right back where you started. After failing a room, the same thing will happen, making it unclear when you should feel like you&apos;ve accomplished anything. Sometimes the reward is a dead end. Or maybe it&apos;s not. Who knows? The controls and physics within the game often lead you to wonder if you passed an area the way you were supposed to or if you stumbled on some exploit they didn&apos;t consider or correct. This also robs you of your sense of accomplishment. Most of the puzzles don&apos;t take thought or planning, rather experimentation. You just do things until something works and move forward. Sometimes you&apos;ll reapply what you stumbled on previously, but most of the puzzles are just mindless poking around. As soon as you understand, the game will move on and introduce something else that will be equally confusing on first inspection. These cheap tricks are what passes for difficulty. The mind-bending stuff is hardly ground breaking. I mean, the original zelda and super mario had repeating mazes. You&apos;re not going to mouth the word &quot;wow&quot;  unless you&apos;re easily impressed and have already prepped by others who swear this is a mind-blowing work of art. I can assure you it&apos;s not. The end game plays like an empty/texture-less Doom level. You just stroll along an ill-defined catwalk for 5 minutes and watch an end sequence that nowadays could have been animated by a 10 year old. It is an addicting game. I&apos;ll give that. I didn&apos;t put it down until I beat it but the same could be said for most browser games. Was it fun? Not really. I feel like most that recommend do so because they think it validates their intelligence and because calling games where nothing happens &quot;art&quot; is in fashion. It feels like someone entirely foreign to video games had a cool idea but lacked basic video game theory to make it rewarding or enjoyable. Everything in the game is smeared with vagueness to cover its shortcomings. It sounds like a bunch of reverse-engineered cop-outs when I hear the game designer explain what&apos;s going on. I would recommend if it were a free browser game (because all they need is the addiction part) but as it&apos;s not, I cannot.

Most people would think that one hour and a half will be enough to complete this game, but the Puzzle Solving in Antichamber gets more and more difficult, and some of the chambers are not as you remember. There is no story, you only have a sort of ray gun to store and shoot little cubes, and you walk and jump. End of the story. Yet, in every chamber, there are sort of Motivational sentences or morals that help you or hint you the puzzle. The game is really entertaining. Unfortunately, there isn&apos;t a sense of accomplishment neither replayability. The game&apos;s graphics are beautiful, but sometimes clunky. This is no Portal (It tries to be more a thought-provoking game than an actual puzzle game). Either way it is fun, only that its short duration and unexplained concept is potentially disappointing. I will give it a 7. It&apos;s not the best puzzle game ever, though it will give an hour or so of bran-burning fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3037715">Expand</a></span>

<br>Released on Jan 1st, 2013 and played about 5 months later by me  [DRM] Steam only and thank goodness there is no GamesForWindowsLive on this title.
<br>
<br>[Story]
<br>You discover solutions to puzzles. There is no cute girl with a nice chest with the protagonist in voice over saying  &#x201C;She has such pretty eyes&#x201D; while everybody stares at her nipples. There are no battles in the Breastriary in Nippopolis. There is no Cheesing. Just puzzles. However the next version of this game could easily involve scantily clad aliens and power ups.
<br>
<br>[Challenges and Mechanics]
<br>Learn each new skill. Don&#x2019;t look with your eyes because they lie. Feel the force Luke. Trial and error is likely to make up for brief intense stupidity, and thank dog !
<br>[Save] The game saves itself like every game should.
<br>[Keys] cannot be remapped because the game takes place in 24000 BC when dinosaurs ruled the earth. You can stick it up your WSAD !
<br>
<br>[Game time] 30 hrs and counting. Go back and finish the stuff you did not get even though you beat the game !
<br>
<br>[Audio] I always play with headphones. I thought the audio was great. They could make it even more important in the game play next time. Thank you!
<br>
<br>[ToYou]
<br>My compliments to all of you who pursue and share this obsession to experience this modern digital art. There are many games that will not be playable in 15-20 years because of OS and hardware changes. The time is now to experience these achievements. Think about going to museums and looking at those Van gogh paintings already 150 years old today. Think about watching reruns of old TV programs anytime you want. This will not be possible for most games and digital art dependent on game engines   so consume and enjoy now and appreciate the moment.
<br>
<br>[Children] Good for 12 years old and up.... be warned that the puzzles can be challenging.

Antichamber bears some resemblance to Portal, but at the same time is different enough and in many aspects unique. Interestingly, the non-Euclidean geometry, which might come off as its central idea, before you play it, is in fact secondary to its main puzzle mechanic, which involves the manipulation of small cubes, and at first looks quite mundane, but soon reaches incredible depth.
<br>The sense of disorientation, caused by the spatial anomalies, the striking visuals and the ambient soundscape put you in extraordinary mood of mystery and curiosity  I always wanted to progress a bit further and see what&#x2019;s next. In short  if you like puzzle games you owe it to yourself to try this out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3056073">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, the game has absolutely no story and there are some collectibles that do absolutely nothing as of right now.

This fantastic puzzle game is easily a 10/10 in my book, despite its many graphical glitches here and there. A game should be rated on its mechanics, aesthetics, and game play, all of which compliment each other perfectly. Well done!</span>

This game displays such diverse conditions its never possible to predict what your in for next, half way through a puzzle you might think you have the hang of it only for the game to introduce an entirely different way of manipulating and navigating your environment.  And with each new possibility comes more possible outcomes or are they? In a preview totalbiscut talked to the developer of this game, it was kinda funny how he viewed the players, the first part is to break every conceived notion of FPS games and then teach you a concept that would be easy to understand had you not previously broken and reformed your brain.

<br>The &quot;gun&quot; if you can say this to this tool which you get can be used in many ways so there are often similar tasks to do which you must solve in a different way. (Don&apos;t want to spoiler them)

Seeing the trailer before starting the game was probably the biggest disappointment as it have ruined first 3 min of the brilliant game play. It sucks you in after a first few puzzles and spits out once finished with a clear and shifted mind. It is like after you saw Matrix for the first time. Like flew in sleep for the first time. Innovative as Braid or Portal and very unique. Minimalist, but overwhelming. Simple, but complex. Calming, but scary. Relaxing, but very frustrating. Once you start the game (born) you go through your lifetime solving puzzles (school, marriage, work) and once you are finish (&quot;die&quot; in a way) you gain so many new experiences and rewords which are hard to be explained.

<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s brilliant, the difficulty level is just right to let you find your feet before stonewalling you with another puzzle. I found it to be have less &#x2018;eureka&#x2019; moments than expected, instead the game slowly expanded your toolset so that you always had something new to try, whether a new gun (of which there are 5) or piece of information on how the weird and wonderful world worked.
<br>
<br>In all the hype up to its release, I was expecting more illogical puzzles and weird happenstances. This is not the case, the world definitely has a set of well defined rules, they&#x2019;re just generally used in a more &#x2018;left field&#x2019; and &#x2018;outside of the box&#x2019; context.
<br>
<br>Apart from the gorgeous art, loveable life assuring messages and abstract Eno-esq soundtrack, my favorite parts of the game were the Easter egg rooms the developer must have left dotted and hidden about. They act like DVD extras giving a player who is willing to look a greater insight into the game, these included screenshots from old versions, a gallery of assets, wire frame models, a weird flowchart, and other more abstract areas&#x2026;  I&#x2019;m especially curious about those little purple cubes that were placed in hard to reach areas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3068016">Expand</a></span>

The entire premise of the game focuses on two aspects: exploring a series of rooms and halls featuring impossible geometry, such as a box that&apos;s longer on the inside than on the inside, along with a &apos;gun&apos; that manipulates small cubes in order to solve puzzles. Antichamber makes a point to have players think outside the box with both how one travels from point A to point B, as well as how one approaches a puzzle logically. This is accompanied by a slew of fun little philosophical tidbits that also connect, to some extent, to real life.
<br>
<br>There are many reasons to love Antichamber. Perhaps most blissful is the unusual aspect of enjoying getting lost in the game&apos;s strange layout (and lost you will get), supported by the game&apos;s also unusual graphics consisting of thickly outlined simple mesh polygons that are mostly white with splashes of highly saturated colors. Gone are textures, and shadows are lighting are very minimal. Even stranger is the fact that all of this is set to a variety of nature based ambiance rather than any sort of musical score, making the experience all that much more relaxing even in the face of a dead end, a perplexing puzzle, or realizing that you are going in circles.
<br>
<br>The puzzles put forth in Antichamber are also a delight, teasing those with preemptive puzzle game solving knowledge and providing a new outlook on the genre for the new and veteran alike. Puzzles are mostly in the form of performing various actions involving small colored cubes, the cube colors correlating to what gun power is required to solve the puzzle. Actions boil down to essentially just moving the cubes, but this can range from sucking up cubes and then placing them to block motion sensing laser paths, to moving a trail of cubes that pull along any trail of cubes adjacent, and more.
<br>
<br>Many people might compare Antichamber to Portal, and there are certainly some similarities. However, where Portal is a linear puzzle solver accompanied by dark humorous banter by the antagonist, Antichamber is more of an open ended journey into expanding one&apos;s perspective. To this end Antichamber has very little in terms of narrative (just a minute amount towards the end), but this helps free the game to its open-endedness and surrealistic experiences. Antichamber does what it sets out to do sublimely, but unfortunately it&apos;s mission is a tad niche and simply will not be for everyone. Even some avid puzzle enthusiasts might have some trouble sinking into Antichamber if they are not charmed by it&apos;s unconventional artistry, and those seeking simply to explore a virtual gallery of geometric (and philosophical) musings might find the puzzle aspects to be too frustrating.
<br>
<br>All in all Antichamber is a crowning achievement for avant-garde game design, and a wonderful journey for those with an open curious mind. Highly recommended for those seeking something challenging and soothing with an unusual design perspective, but probably not for classic action gamers or those who want clear cut objectives in their games.
<br>
<br>10/10  despite lacking a bit in terms of optimization and far from being universally appealing, this game&apos;s artistic achievement is one the best I&apos;ve experienced.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3520105">Expand</a></span>

You have nothing but your brain and legs to solve puzzles and there are some very clever world-warping puzzles for you to solve and navigate through. Some pretty good head-scratching stuff here which had me going in circles for a while before I figured things out. Sadly this doesn&apos;t last. You eventually start to pick up &quot;guns&quot; which let you manipulate blocks in different ways (depending on the &quot;gun&quot; you picked up) and this is when the game plummets from a high 9 score right down to a 6 or even lower. You go from the clever world-bending mazes to what are essentially point-and-click block puzzles. Some of these block puzzles make good use of the bendable world but the majority do not. The majority of these puzzles that I have seen are nothing more than a panel on the wall with sliding blocks in it or slots by doors for you to stick blocks into. While these are technically still puzzles they are neither fun nor clever. After the amazing first-section of the game I expected more from the later portions. TotalBiscuit&apos;s PAX interview with the developer had the dev saying that he wanted puzzles in which the puzzle was finding out what you needed to do rather than immediately seeing your goal and then the puzzle was actually completing it. Every single block puzzle I have seen so far has been the opposite of that. I can almost immediately see what I need to do but getting it done is very tedious, finicky, and just frustrating. Yeah I can complete the puzzle but there is no enjoyment or WOW-factor in doing so. I have free games on my Android phone which shares similar concepts to some of these block puzzles. I guess I expected something more from what is known as a very prestigious and award-winning title. The second point I would like to raise is that the game has a serious problem with not actually telling you key information. I understand the game wants to be the silent type and let you figure things out for yourself and I can kind of respect that   many games have issues with holding your hand. This game, on the other hand, completely withholds information about mechanics which are absolutely mandatory to continuing further into the game. The end result is that figuring out the mechanics is more of a puzzle than the actual puzzles are. I&apos;m supposed to use the tools I have at my disposal to solve the challenges ahead but half the time I don&apos;t even know what my tools even do. This doubles the frustration and halves the fun of what are already not very enjoyable puzzles. I honestly think that if they just stuck with the basic game as seen from the beginning it would truly be a much better game. Either that or maybe the basic non-upgraded block manipulator gun. The game goes from abstract mind-melting puzzles to slide-square-blocks-around and I feel it really harms the game. Shame, really.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3902973">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll find yourselves trapped in this really deceptive maze where nothing it&apos;s what it seems, without a tutorial or anything similar to it. There&apos;s not even a game menu, everything is handled from the first room, audio and graphic options included. I know it may sound weird but works perfectly fine.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll mostly walk long white corridors leading to locked doors, when you&apos;re lucky, or room with apparently no exit, when you&apos;re not. Many times I had the feeling of being in a museum of installation art rather than a video-ame.
<br>
<br>Soon you&apos;ll get the weird feeling of being tested, just like happened in the Portal saga. But the similarities end here. The most notable difference between the two titles is that Antichamber completely lacks a storyline. That&apos;s probably the reason why I never felt being sucked into the game. However, this is not necessarily a negative aspect. We&apos;re talking about a title that, in my opinion, should be taken in small doses, it needs to sediment before you can go on with it.
<br>
<br>If you won&apos;t stop for a while focusing on details you&apos;ll end up wandering around without a destination, which might be frustrating for some players. So now we get to my only real criticism. Your best friend in order to complete the game will be the map, that&apos;s where you&apos;ll get the only clues to get past the challenges you&apos;ll be faced with. The funny thing is that I realised only by the end of the game how it &quot;worked&quot;.
<br>
<br>To conclude, a tip for the players willing to give this really unusual game a chance: think out of the box!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3130622">Expand</a></span>

It is very ground-breaking in the sense that a lot of the game mechanics are completely new. So as far as originality is concerned, Antichamber scores big. Unfortunately, the actually game playing experience does not quite live up to the originality of the design. The puzzles all involve progress from one room to another. There is no storyline to speak of other than &quot;inspirational posters&quot; that you encounter at each puzzle. For me the satisfaction of solving the puzzles would have been greater if there was an overall story. Also, it would have been better if some of the puzzles had been of a type where you do more than just figure out how to move from point A to point B. There are a few cases where it is hard to tell if you have really solved the puzzle. If there had been a kind of running score, or a little &quot;happy music&quot; when you solved a puzzle, this would have enhanced the game experience. There is no tutorial at all as to the rules and mechanics of the game, you figure this all out during the game. In some cases this makes the game more fun, since figuring out the game mechanics is part of the puzzle. In other cases, it is just plain frustrating, since there is a lot of trial and error to figure out how the game works. One big problem is the color coding system. There are parts of the game that you will encounter early on that are impossible to solve before you progress in other areas. You can waste a lot of time and become very frustrated before you figure this out. I still think this is a very good game and well worth your money. I would recommend starting with a strategy guide that explains the basics of the game mechanics and the color coding system, and how to use the map in the starting area. Don&apos;t spend too much time in any one puzzle, use the esc key to go back to the starting area and choose a new puzzle (color appropriate) before spending too much time on any one puzzle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3628137">Expand</a></span>

In return, you get rewarded with clever puzzles with satisfying solutions, constant mind-benders and -twisters, and generally an adventure you will never quite forget. The puzzles are one of the most satisfying in the world, and finding all the secrets can sure be a thing to brag about. I enjoyed every second of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4267743">Expand</a></span>

Much of the fun of Antichamber comes from figuring out the strange logic that governs things, and using it to make sense out of situations that wouldn&apos;t make sense in any other game. It rewards exploration and experimenting more than it does logically deducing the answer on the spot, and fairly often the solution to something can come about by accident while you try everything you can imagine.
<br>
<br>Having a mostly non-linear map that opens up more as you collect new abilities makes it much more fun to progress through than a straight, linear sequence of puzzles and for the most part there is enough direction that the temptation to look at a guide is rarely there. It&apos;s an unusual sort of puzzle game that plays smoothly and maintains a certain level of immersion instead of just leaving you wandering in circles in frustration. It can trick you and mess with you, and it is very satisfying to overcome its illusions and quirks.
<br>
<br>On the negative side, your results may vary, but I did find it very hard on the eyes with all the glaring white backgrounds. You may want to turn down your brightness and play in a well-lit room.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=5666090">Expand</a></span>

Amazing puzzles (that&apos;s challenging, but not impossible) set against some amazing visuals at time... all that while playing the most calming background music. At one point you can solve a particular puzzle and end up in a room where the developers set up a picturesc roadmap of the product development throughout the years. You can see how the product changed throughout. I would recommend this game to any portal fan, and anyone who loves a good mindbender with satisfactory outcomes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2932077">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t look like much from the pictures, but in my book this is the first first-person-puzzler game to even come close, and possibly match, the brilliance and uniqueness of Portal, besting even Quantum Conundrum and Qube. There&apos;s no witty narrator, or even a storyline; you simply start in a black room, then walk around a mansion(?) where the laws of physics, logic, and sanity don&apos;t apply.  The puzzles are rather open:  unlike Qube, you do not simply linearly progress from one puzzle to the next.  Rather, it&apos;s more like you can do the puzzles in almost any order you want, and you often don&apos;t even know if you&apos;re solving a puzzle or simply exploring.  The game does many things to disorient you and punish you for conventional ways of thinking, but it&apos;s never done over-the-top or in a way that will simply frustrate you; an incredible amount of thought must have been put into this game. It&apos;s hard to explain how it does that without giving away any spoilers --in fact, it&apos;s hard to explain anything that happens in this game at all-- but it should suffice to say, if you enjoyed Portal, you will enjoy this. And of course you enjoyed Portal, so go out and buy this. PS. Valve needs to hire this guy to spearhead Portal 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2931986">Expand</a></span>

Each step forward is an adventure as reality seems to bend and fold around you, and you&apos;re left wondering, moment to moment, what the game is going to pull out of its hat next.  But unlike many games that might give you a few &apos;oohs&apos; and &apos;ahhs&apos; before wearing thin, Antichamber forces you to examine your surroundings and use what it gives you to solve expertly crafted puzzles.  There is no real reward except a new way forward and the distant promise of an ending, but that was plenty for me.  A shockingly unique game in today&apos;s colour by the numbers market, Antichamber is everything that makes art games good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2930321">Expand</a></span>

Sure it is lacking in the replayability, unless you and some friends just play again for a race to the actual finish, but it makes up for it in its original content, and graphics. Just another thing, why are all the games starting to gain this &quot;high-psychedelic&quot; look? Just wondering, because it does the game wonders, and yes a little on your eyes after a few fours of gameplay. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2934006">Expand</a></span>

A ten of ten? Yes, in fact Antichamber is perhaps now one of my favorite games of all time.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s premise is to put you into a world that follows rules that are nothing like the real universe: simply turning around can show you a new hallway that you didn&apos;t come through before. The puzzles slowly grow in complexity, but the gameplay is nevertheless very, very fun.
<br>
<br>As you play, you also find black squares with simple life lessons on them. There a total of 120 to &quot;learn&quot; and they contribute to the game&apos;s greatest strength, which I will explain in a second. The graphics are... interesting. The walls and floors are painted with bright, vibrant, and yet simple, elegant colors. The interface in the map room is nice as well, it lets you jump everywhere through the game with the touch of the button.
<br>
<br>Now, as you progress through the game, the morals you&apos;ve learned start to slowly add up and create a unique picture. But, as you near the end, you finally realize the game&apos;s incredibly deep meaning. the simple (spoilers here) version is that you have been placed into a world as if you were a newborn baby, and once you win, you realize that the game is a huge metaphor for life itself.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game is incredibly great. The puzzles may prove challenging, but they are lots of fun to play. I would recommend this game to almost anyone who enjoys video games. The bottom line is: go out and get this game. You won&apos;t regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3187839">Expand</a></span>

I get stuck on some sort of puzzle and i just feel unmotivated to crack it. If you are a sucker for puzzle games this is probably it for you. Perhaps even an masterpeice. Me?

It tries really hard to be different which might really please some people. It certainly feels different from other first person puzzle games which might be a reason to pick this game up if you are getting bored of other games in the same genre. I am not entirely in love with everything about this game though. First of all i should mention that i got really badly dizzy and nauseated when playing this game. I have never experienced this before despite gaming for quite a long time and this might be a total deal breaker for people more sensitive than i am. It did certainly affect my time with this game negatively. Puzzle-wise it is quite varied. The game do have some really interesting puzzles that feels smart and fresh, But it also have some quite odd puzzles that just is not all that fun to solve. I am also not a big fan of the non-linear progression system in the game. In theory its sound cool to be able to solve different puzzles at different places at your own pace. However since some puzzles are unsolvable without the proper tools gained trough solving a different puzzle you might find yourself trying to solve a unsolvable puzzle which is not all that fun. Antichamber is not a bad game but its not a game that will appeal to all kinds of players. It certainly didn&apos;t appeal to me and being kind of clever from time to time doesn&apos;t excuse the fact that the general gameplay wasn&apos;t all that enjoyable for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3013739">Expand</a></span>

The only thing I really liked about the game was the nice minimalistic art style, although; this game is certainly no work of art.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2954092">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m sure the puzzles are truely asume and mind blowing sadly, but between the the FOW and the colors they have chosen I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever play it through as for me a game should not send you running to the toilet to throw up.  Of the puzzles I&apos;ve seen they are not difficult, however given I could only play for 10 minutes, in comparison to the first 10 minutes of most games it certainly starts at a harder level, so I can definately believe what others have written.
<br>
<br>I really wish I could give this a higher score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2935898">Expand</a></span>

<br>Antichamber is supposed to be &quot;mind blowing&quot; and &quot;non euclidean&quot;. That may be true from a developer&apos;s standpoint. However the way it presents itself to a player is more in the vein of Zelda &quot;discovery&quot; of &quot;oh I have to go up, up, up, left, right, left, down&quot;.

Trial and error is not mindblowing. Neither is it a &quot;clever puzzle&quot;.

<br>Antichamber is supposed to be &quot;mind blowing&quot; and &quot;non euclidean&quot;. That may be true from a developer&apos;s standpoint. However the way it presents itself to a player is more in the vein of Zelda &quot;discovery&quot; of &quot;oh I have to go up, up, up, left, right, left, down&quot;.
<br>
<br>Trial and error is not mindblowing. Neither is it a &quot;clever puzzle&quot;.
<br>
<br>If you have 1000 monkeys and 1000 gaming areas, you will see this game beaten. Cleverness? No. Cleverness is not required. Randomness is required. When A doesn&apos;t work, do B, C, D, E, F until you have &quot;solved&quot; the conundrum.
<br>
<br>As in the Emperor&apos;s New Clothes, I feel that people are too ashamed to downrate this game. It MUST be smart (and if I don&apos;t get it, I must not be) so I should rate it highly, seems to be the case with many a reviewer.
<br>
<br>If you like closing your eyes and throwing darts and then patting yourself on the back when you get a bullseye, by all means, this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3865319">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it is sad that I feel I have to compare this game with the aforementioned titles but it seems unavoidable.
<br>This is not a story driven game, lets get that out of the way as soon as possible. Antichamber is for the competitive at heart; the only satisfaction one will get for playing this game is from being able to advance. Browsing the reviews this seems to be one of the most common negatives on the game. When I saw the trailer it was evident that this game was not going to be plot focused, so I wasn&apos;t let down in anyway because I knew what I was getting into. I found the lack of story actually quite refreshing.
<br>I kept expecting the puzzles to get repetitive, but I did not find this to be true. One of the more frustrating points of the game was the access to many puzzles that you did not have the tools to solve. The way I went about it, figuring out you are unable to do a puzzle is part of the puzzle itself.
<br>Watch some of the trailers for this game. If it looks good, buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3115124">Expand</a></span>

Portal 2 is superior and why is that, isn&apos;t just about Glados [and from my point of view,Portal 2 is just beaten up by Arkahm City: the most ingenious puzzle complement in a videogame around nowadays],is maybe because a major publisher behind and maybe, isn&apos;t fair to compare better graphics and having a interesting history, but because this game suffers from the lacking of  two main elements:History and environments, is badly flawed.This game just doesn&apos;t deliver or at least hasn&apos;t delivered to me just yet.
<br>This lack of ingredients really affects the game itself.After several hours of playing and quitting to return always feel like I have been playing nothing, there&apos;s an empty feeling and feels also like unrewarding, totally the opposite of Portal 2 or even the  actual champion Batman&apos;s Arkham city, both which outstand for rewarding the player in the game itself. And comparing Antichamber with those heavy weight champs could be unfair somehow but, what about Limbo? I liked Limbo a lot and maybe   does not have exactly a history but more of a piece of art,symbolic and reflective but always got that feeling that something that makes you return for more. So Antichamber doesn&apos;t have that, and even the dumbest monologue/dialogue, not clear ,simplistic piece of script to excuse a history would have helped a lot. Just to be more apreciated by the gamer indeed; have to tell that isn&apos;t much at all, trolls post never count. About scenarios,oh well for indy devs could be very difficult to create masterpieces in the graphs department but I was wondering if even cheap art or a kids drawings would make a huge difference,besides of not having history sometimes this game feels as empty as the blank rooms you visit quite often.
<br>Another point to analyse and bothers me a lot was the criptically rude map.You don&apos;t know if in some point you have already solved the area posibilities or if are you missing something. In fact, all puzzle levels are connected one with another. Different to another puzzles games that have individual levels
<br>and you have to go from point A  to point B ,in this game all levels are connected and that  makes all confusing,then add the criptic map and you have a puzzle game of pure confussion.
<br>I love puzzles games and was expecting the same from this one but the level of difficult  the confusing ingredient, the lacking of rewards feeling and the blank enviromnent makes me think that this game is only aimed to the nerdy audience,not even the average like Portal games or above average like Arkahm City.So I&apos;m actually questioning the green bars,mhmm...well I never check for solutions in puzzle games so I&apos;m still wondering about,smells fishy...
<br>Oh well whatever,returning to the review,Antichamber dev/s have potential and have to be exploited,so if they really mean for videogames they would really take the points already mentioned for consideration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3110298">Expand</a></span>

This game is really what a pure indie First-person puzzle game SHOULD be. The game can be so mind bending at times that it is easy to get lost in this huge game. It can easily be forgiven for it&apos;s minimalistic art form with just how well this game can be. Usually these days, most puzzle games like this tend to almost automatically get compared to the amazing PC first-person puzzle game, Portal, due to it being a First-person puzzle game. Games like Q.U.B.E are also on this list. However, unlike most of them, especially Q.U.B.E, Antichamber could stand up beside Portal and still be considered pretty damn good. Most certainly not better than Portal (cause almost nothing is), but great nonetheless. Not much of a plot to the game though but it certainly has personality in it like Portal does. That was the problem Q.U.B.E had that Antichamber doesn&apos;t. While not as funny or entertaining as GLaDOS, Antichamber often has words of wisdom that usually tends to either be aimed at encouraging you, or telling you how you kinda screwed up, though in a passive way. The game really feels like some sort of test or experience that you have been put into to test your knowledge. Though at times, that really is debatable as the game just loves to  around with your head, often making loops you didn&apos;t realize and putting you in places you weren&apos;t before without you realizing it. It also has a bad tendency of trapping you or making a puzzle no longer solvable through a simple mistake as well as having no real pause feature which is a shame because if I wanna pause something so I don&apos;t miss it, I either gotta go back to the starting room and go all the way back if there wasn&apos;t a checkpoint there, or miss it by leaving it unpaused. Though I still stand by the game happily as it is an amazing puzzle game that shall stick to my memories. Go get it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2965583">Expand</a></span>

Seriously, playing the game is like being stuck in a book of collected motivational cliches.  As far as I can tell, the whole game is made up of wandering aimlessly down one corridor after another while clicking on signs with stupid motivational messages.  What&apos;s the point?  The game is marketed and reviewed as a puzzler, but it&apos;s really more of an &quot;experience&quot; like Dear Ester and its ilk.
<br>
<br>On top of the mediocre to very poor gaming experience, the game options are as rudimentary as possible.  It&apos;s not possible to adjust the keyboard mapping to something suitable for left-handers, it isn&apos;t possible to setup a gamepad, it isn&apos;t possible to set the resolution to match my 16:9 Windows Desktop, it isn&apos;t possible to adjust the sound levels, and the game is riddled with horrible, horrible aliased and jagged lines with no option to enable anti-aliasing.  All these features should be trivial to include, since the game is built on the excellent Unreal engine, but the developer must&apos;ve felt like creating an options menu or setup program was too much work.
<br>
<br>This is definitely another indie game that benefited from rating inflation.  It doesn&apos;t deserve the 8.2 that it received, so pass on it until it shows up for four dollars or less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3513927">Expand</a></span>

What&apos;s even more appreciable, is that the puzzles progressively build on your previous solutions and explorations, twisting them in some unexpected ways. Now while that&apos;s all excellent, in my opinion, there are some serious flaws that should be addressed. I&apos;ve completed the game in around 5 hours, divided in 3 small gaming sessions and each time I wished to take up where I left, I spent many frustrating minutes trying to remember in which room I last was. Sure, I like open world games but this one has a progression path and unless you make it one long gaming session, it&apos;s really easy to lose it. The next big flaw is rather a matter of taste but I&apos;m pretty sure some people will agree with me: this game seriously lacks some personality  this is mainly why I wasn&apos;t compelled to play more than one or two hours at a time. Compare this to Braid, Portal or Limbo, aside from it&apos;s very peculiar puzzles, Antichamber feels sterile (sure the little advice panels were fun but sadly not enough to make the game really compelling). In anyways, if you liked Portal (I  II) or if you&apos;re just fond of puzzles, this is a game you should definitely give a few hours of your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2944020">Expand</a></span>

With games these days not being able to budge an inch to make an effort to be original, and the opposite problems for Indie Games trying to be &quot;retro&quot; stylized as a poor excuse for laziness and a quick way of seeming &quot;different&quot;, Antichamber is the sore thumb out of all of these games, but in a good way of course. A very good way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2943764">Expand</a></span>

It was interesting to play but with no real backdrop gives you little to attach to or invest in. From a puzzle perspective its top notch but whilst there are secrets to discover, don&apos;t expect much reward from the game.</span>

Maybe it&apos;s just way too abstract, compared, say, to Portal. It probably deserves all the good reviews too. It&apos;s just not for everyone.</span>

Had the price remained that, the score would have easily been a 8/10. However, as it stands, this game is not worth $20. I know it&apos;s just $5 bucks, but the game is a bit too shallow and incomplete for that extra dough.
<br>
<br>Anyway, onto the game. The graphics are unique and engrossing. It&apos;s an Unreal Engine 3 game that&apos;s been filtered to hell and back, and it comes out the other side looking like some kind of ink drawing. It&apos;s really kinda neat... but the game relies a lot on style. Sometimes the ambient noises and strange sound effects are pretty irritating. The puzzle mechanics can&apos;t help but feel  wasted. Immediately, the non-Euclidean, illusory nature of the level design becomes apparent... but then the game devolves into puzzles based on a puzzle-gun, reminiscent of the portal gun from Portal. Instead of portals, however, the gun shoots blocks. Hardly an interesting concept, but the puzzles that utilize the gun are fairly interesting and sometimes quite tricky. However... some puzzles are irritating because at first glance, it seems there is no hint telling you about your need for extra equipment. That leads to puzzles seeming solvable when they are, in fact, not. That&apos;s poor game design, flat out. That led me to second guessing whether puzzles were solvable or not, which in turn led me in circles, easily doubling the amount of time it took to complete the game... and adding to my frustration.
<br>
<br>On another note, the overall level design is impossible to really grasp. It&apos;s an incredible accomplishment on that front... the entire game is one level, and can be completely traversed seamlessly. That really means something special once you realize that there are dozens of puzzles crammed in there somewhere. Sometimes, turning around can put you in a completely different room... it really makes the player feel like they can&apos;t rely on a &quot;room&quot; or a &quot;hallway&quot; as an overall concept. The game does a good job of destroying your basic conceptions of geometry. I laughed a few times when the game tricked me into feeling secure about knowing where I was. I would walk into a room, see a sign on the wall, turn around, and... welp, I&apos;m in a completely different room... and sometimes? I could turn around a third time and end up in yet ANOTHER room. This game can really surprise you.
<br>
<br>Sometimes, I would feel like I was going to outsmart the game. The game rewarded me with Easter eggs, such as some behind the scenes stuff, concept art, and in one occasion, a map of a particularly confusing hallway-based puzzle. This kind of reminds me of Portal, but instead of fleshing out the world, it shows a little bit about the game itself... almost like a &quot;Bonus Features&quot; section of a DVD. This is a nice change from Portal. I am very happy that the creator of this game elected to ignore story and provide a game instead. I wasn&apos;t going to believe whatever nonsense he tried to feed me about this bizarre, yet wonderful location.
<br>
<br>One final note about how good the playable space is designed:
<br>
<br>It takes many hours to complete on your first play through, probably 5 or 6 on average. I completed a subsequent play through in eight minutes. This game is full of shortcuts, and big ones are often right in your face and you just don&apos;t seem them. It takes some talent to hide the obvious by putting it in plain sight.
<br>
<br>So, in conclusion:
<br>
<br>Cons-
<br>1. Too expensive for what it is.
<br>2. Game has minor incomplete elements.
<br>3. Puzzles are sometimes disappointing.
<br>4. Game design is sometimes poorly thought out.
<br>5. Relies too much on style... which is strange for a puzzle game.
<br>
<br>Pros-
<br>1. The level design is just *that* special level of good, where you actually notice how good it is.
<br>2. Usage of Non-Euclidean space is very entertaining to navigate, and often exciting!
<br>3. Game is full of secrets and Easter eggs.
<br>4. The game doesn&apos;t even attempt to explain itself, which was a good choice. We didn&apos;t need another Portal 2.
<br>5. Again, the level design is amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2964177">Expand</a></span>

Sometimes you&#x2019;d end up walking in circles, other times confronted with branching paths.
<br>
<br>The style of presentation in Antichamber is definitely commendable, but is it really fun? The mind-bending environments are interesting at first, but the novelty wears off very quickly and instead you start wishing that the game would just stop misleading you all the time. The game has a very non-linear approach to it. A lot of the time if you&#x2019;re stuck, you can simply return back to the &#x2018;lobby&#x2019; area and pick a different path and solve the puzzles along that route. Eventually all routes are meant to be important, or at least that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve gathered anyway.
<br>
<br>One of the problems about this approach is that as you go on through the labyrinth, you will acquire certain devices that will allow you to pick up and place cubes of different colours in your environment and are meant to be used to solve some of the game&#x2019;s puzzles. This means that at times you&#x2019;ll be coming across puzzles that you can&#x2019;t yet solve until you&#x2019;ve gotten the right device, which can at times be annoying because there&#x2019;s no way to tell whether a puzzle in front of you can or cannot be solved at the time. A lot of the game&#x2019;s &#x2018;rules&#x2019; don&#x2019;t seem to make much logical sense and require a lot of random experimentation. For example, walking over some of the drops will create a path in front of you, or trying to pick up green cubes from the middle of the structure they&#x2019;re in will cause its ends to disintegrate, leaving you with less cubes to work with.
<br>
<br>Throughout the game there is also a number of philosophical quotes scattered about. However, most of those quotes don&#x2019;t inspire much thought and instead are a collection of common sense mantras that you&#x2019;re more likely to teach your kids. It&#x2019;s stuff like &#x2018;sometimes you&#x2019;ve got to go backwards before you can go forwards&#x2019;. As you go collecting each quote, they all compile on a huge screen in the lobby area. To what end I am not sure, because I didn&#x2019;t collect them all, but it seems as though it tries to draw a diagram of a person&#x2019;s life and some of the time they seem relevant to the puzzle in a nearby room.
<br>
<br>Overall the game&#x2019;s setting is way too abstract for my liking. I couldn&#x2019;t get much satisfaction from solving the game&#x2019;s puzzles, because every time I solved a tricky puzzle, the game would either take me back to where I&#x2019;ve been already, or bring me to one of the puzzles that I cannot yet solve. The sense of progression is not felt and there is little to no incentive to keep going through the remainder of the labyrinth. After several hours in I got tired of coming back to the same puzzles over and over again, so I ended up giving up on the game. I think Antichamber is the kind of game that you either get it or you don&#x2019;t. It stands out with its unique art style and unorthodox way of puzzle solving, but it&#x2019;s hardly rewarding for the player and I couldn&#x2019;t get much fun out of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3928739">Expand</a></span>

And as such Antichamber is another gem those who look for new interesting experiences in gaming should not miss. The solutions to the puzzles are often incredibly primitive, it really is the matter of noticing them in the first place. Only problem I had with the game is the fact that while some mechanisms are hardly/clearly shown at work before you are expected to utilise them (which can be frustrating, but is in line with the rest of the game I guess) there is one that wasn&apos;t shown at all afaik and I made my progress through it by accident. Then again, Even accidents can help you progress.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3093551">Expand</a></span>

I enjoy a puzzle where the puzzle itself is hard, but once you see the solution it&apos;s easy to execute. But in Antichamber it&apos;s entirely the opposite-- easy to see solutions, but insanely hard to execute. I&apos;m really not a fan of that kind of puzzle.
<br>
<br>So while I will recommend Antichamber, I will also say that  it swings a hard turn from &quot;good frustrating&quot; to &quot;bad frustrating&quot;, and players need to be prepared.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3285437">Expand</a></span>

I took a few days off from playing it, and when I returned, I just felt like I&apos;d lost the thread a bit and I couldn&apos;t get back into it. I might pick it up again one day, but I&apos;ve been distracted by Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon for now.
<br>I was quite wary of playing another &apos;Portal-style&apos; first-person puzzle game, as I&apos;d been disappointed by some other FPP I&apos;d played (I forget which), but the look of Antichamber, it&apos;s glowing reviews, and a half-price offer on Steam persuaded me to give it a try. And I have to say it&apos;s completely unlike any other game I&apos;ve played, and any comparisons to Portal fade away in seconds. The simplicity of the controls lull you into a false sense of security, because things are certainly not what they seem.
<br>I&apos;m not sure how to describe the kinds of puzzles you encounter, because figuring them out feels like you&apos;re somehow allowing your conscience mind to take back seat and allowing cognitive instincts and your subconscious to take over. I know that sounds a bit wanky, but I honestly can&apos;t think of any other way of explaining the way the puzzles are presented to you and how you have to approach them. Yes, they take place in a physical environment, but nothing, absolutely nothing is explained to you. It&apos;s all one, rather-steep, ambiguous, learning curve. No hints, no companion to guide you, no story to indicate what your ultimate goal is. All you get is a set of black plaques containing proverbs which relate to the puzzle you&apos;ve just solved.
<br>Echoing the principles of quantum mechanics, the way you perceive the puzzles in Antichamber can alter how they behave. A large part of the initial approach to the game is simple trial and error, but once you pick up the basic principles you start to alter your approach accordingly. It&apos;s only when you get your hands on a device that allows you to manipulate small cubes (it doesn&apos;t sound very exciting, does it?) that you start to feel like you&apos;re playing a proper game, rather than a set of random puzzles.
<br>It&apos;s a good job the all-white environment and the background ambient music is very soothing, because some of the puzzles would probably have you throwing your mouse at the screen in frustration. But despite feeling like just giving up sometimes, I never once felt angry or frustrated at the puzzles. I&apos;m a firm believer that any puzzles in a game should contain just enough clues to allow you to solve them, and the biggest part of solving the puzzles is finding the clues, or recognising what IS a clue. I remember a couple of times in the old Tomb Raider games I&apos;d spend hours running around in circles because the clue to the next step of the game was either far too discreet, relied on you stumbling across something by accident, or utterly non-existent. I also feel that games, even puzzle games, have become far too spoon-fed in recent years, and it&apos;s refreshing to play a game that contains no cut-scenes, no tutorials, and even very few configuration settings. You switch the game on, and you play. It&apos;s a principle that I wish was applied to all games, not just puzzlers. Allowing the player to learn as they play has become a forgotten art, and constant reminders about what buttons you need to press to perform an action have become a seemingly ubiquitous annoyance. I digress.
<br>Although I described a trial and error approach to the puzzles, it never feels like you&apos;re running around in circles. If you&apos;ve missed a clue, you just have to take a moment and reevaluate your surroundings and adjust your approach. The multiple patch approach also offers the chance to try something different and return to a particularly troubling puzzle at a later point. Many puzzles actually require you to return to them later in the game, you just have to learn which are which!
<br>A excellent game, and a beacon to all developers who should have the balls to try something different. I&apos;ll go and finish it once I beat Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, I promise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3158398">Expand</a></span>

Memorizing the map is pretty much impossible, so whenever you&apos;re using the map to teleport, you spend very long time hovering over rooms, to see which room is where. I guess that&apos;s the part of the challenge, and definitely good thing for speedrunners. But for me it was too much. Sound design is really cool. But the minimalistic art style becomes very tedious after a while. I don&apos;t know why is that exactly, I think later on there is much more detail in rooms, and I was getting bit dizzy. Overall, the experience get&apos;s really tiresome with time. But it is a very unique game, and it&apos;s definitely worth experiencing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=4316561">Expand</a></span>

It does not have to try hard with epic graphics, epic story, epic whatsoever like other mainstream games do  it simply works.  The level design is confusing. You cannot simply figure out which path to take to get somewhere special; sometimes you end where you&apos;ve started, sometimes you run in circles, but you always get somewhere and figuring out the rules is part of the game. It can be frustrating, but after a while I started to understand the rules of this world so well, that the solutions simply came to me.  The story is artistic in the same way this whole game is. It tells you something and nothing. So much said: &quot;The journey is its own reward&quot;.  IF OTHERS think this game is stupid, going nowhere or could have been done by a 10 year old, that&apos;s a valid opinion. Not everyone entertained by a &quot;Kill anything in a sandbox&quot;-game or a quick-time-event-movie-game will like this kind of game. IF YOU say &quot;3D puzzle games are no innovation since Portal&quot;, think about the struggles many game developers had telling the publishers, they want to do a 1st-person-game without shooting people. After all, Antichamber is simply a GAME  like PONG.... with lots of </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3880846">Expand</a></span>

The puzzle difficulty ranges from easy to nearly impossible to solve without spoilers, but you almost always have a variety of puzzles to choose from.  Minimalistic, it doesn&apos;t try to forcibly inject a plot into the gameplay. I only have 3 issues:
<br>
<br>1) the graphics  I don&apos;t mind the minimalism. In fact it was probably the only sensible design. My brain was so busy trying to figure out the space-time defying puzzles that I think any texture interference would have just been a headache. My issue was with the quality of the execution. You can tell that the developers forced the Unreal Engine to do something it was not designed to do out of the box. It&apos;s pretty rough around the edges. It doesn&apos;t interfere with gameplay, but it reminds you that you&apos;re playing an indie title.
<br>
<br>2) Instruction  Once I figured out how to read the map, I was able to focus my attention on only the unsolved puzzles. In order to understand the map I had to consult the internet. I don&apos;t think it would have been unreasonable to put a bit more time into explaining this tool.
<br>
<br>3) precision  on several occasions I found it difficult to predict how my tools were going to behave. It&apos;s very hard to create chains of blocks in the direction you want without looking at a wall dead on.
<br>
<br>All-in-all, a joy to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3245872">Expand</a></span>

As soon as you think you&apos;ve got it figured out it (sometimes literally) pulls the rug from under your feet. I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles even when I felt hopelessly stuck. I don&apos;t think it has too much in common with Portal, but one similarity definitely is that it&apos;s great fun sitting with a friend or two at the comp and trying to figure out the next puzzle. It&apos;s more fun in a small group, just like Portal.
<br>
<br>The only (slight) let-down for me was the very end  it didn&apos;t feel the same way, as if it didn&apos;t quite belong to the game proper. It felt more like a platformer then. Nevertheless, after finishing it, I had 12 pictures missing from my wall and I spent another few hours digging these out  with some online help, but that was still fun. The overall design and the ambient soundtrack complement it extremely well.
<br>
<br>All in all I spent 27 hours of mind-wrecking fun on it. It&apos;s certainly not for everybody, and the notions about making you feel dizzy and nauseous are true  I felt totally fine but my GF could not look at it. But if you cope with that and love puzzles and non-linear weird environments, go for it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797936">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s interesting, it&apos;s innovative and it is most certainly thought-provoking. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s quite what the developer made it out to be  he said it should change your perspective about playing games  but it makes a good stab at it. You will find yourself entertained in thinking about how you&apos;re going to solve the puzzle, knowing that the only clue you have is that your preconceptions are wrong.
<br>After about an hour or so, it turns from an intriguing experience into a dry puzzle game. Of course, if you love puzzle games then you&apos;ll have oodles of fun here, but it seems to me to be a fairly mediocre puzzle game. It&apos;s not at all bad, but lots of the puzzles are very similar to each other, and when the game is short, you can&apos;t really afford to have that.
<br>So as an experience, Antichamber delivers, and I thoroughly recommend it for that. As a puzzler, though, it&apos;s middle-of-the-range. Whether you should buy it depends entirely on what you want it for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2998840">Expand</a></span>

If you don&apos;t use walkthroughs, nothing will make sense until you can twist your mind around the concept of Antichamber. However, this only gets an 8 because once you&apos;re done you&apos;re done. No fun ending, only one side quest which isn&apos;t fun, nothing. Just waiting for a sequel or some DLC or something so i can solve some more.</span>

But comparing them almost seems like a category error, because beyond the quality of their puzzles, they have few similarities. Portal is a story- and character-driven puzzler that captures its audience with humor and a creeping sense of claustrophobia; ultimately, the player&apos;s objective is to complete the puzzles set by the antagonists so that they can survive and escape the facility. Antichamber, on the other hand, offers the player no objective beyond the promise of more puzzles if they complete the current ones, and the chance to leave the stark and minimalist setting if they complete all of them. This may seem like a downside at first, but it ends up being more like a poignant meditation on the puzzle genre in general, a reminder to the player that he or she playing the game because figuring out puzzles is fun, and just winning some trophy at the end is not.
<br>________
<br>New gamers will like how Antichamber forces one to experiment and think outside the box in order to progress, while experienced gamers will appreciate its subtle subversions of puzzle game tropes and how well it takes advantage of its non-Euclidean environment. I found myself most grateful for its use of the &quot;hub&quot; system that allows instant travel between different areas of the game, so I would never have to remember all the mind-bending twist and turns I had to take from A to B, and so that I would never have to repeat a puzzle in order to return to an unexplored area. It&apos;s non-linear format will also please gamers who obsessively backtrack to make sure they haven&apos;t missed anything (i.e. me), as there are no hidden areas that aren&apos;t directly related to progressing forward (except for maybe the pink blocks behind the walls, but apparently these will have significance in a future patch). In general, what makes this game most compelling is how it genuinely makes players take different perspectives and often weird approaches in order to solve a puzzle. This is perhaps in contrast to Portal, whose puzzles are solvable merely with high spatial intelligence and a good eye for knowing where to put portals.
<br>________
<br>My only reason for not giving this game a perfect 10 would be for subtle faults or omissions related to the provided &quot;hints&quot;. While all the puzzles can be reasonably solved without having to use a guide (or even any of the cryptic hints placed on the walls nearby), there is a distinct tendency to get &quot;stuck&quot; at points. By &quot;stuck&quot; I do not mean with a specific puzzle, but instead with the sense that one has explored all they can explore (given their current materials) and are &quot;missing something&quot; in order to go forward. This could be solved by having the hub system highlight areas where the player has yet to do something that they &quot;could&quot; do. In retrospect, though, such an addition may be impossible, as there always appears to be multiple avenues a player can take to progress forward.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=2948894">Expand</a></span>

As a regular puzzle-game player, I didn&apos;t find Antichamber to be that mind-bending or difficult; it was simply a different set of challenges with a different rule set.  However, for the &quot;normal&quot; video game crowd, I see where the challenge would be.  To be honest, this game felt a lot like Portal 2.  The original Portal was a completely new experience for me, and I had a lot of fun going through the game and learning all about the portal mechanism (not to mention that the story was fantastic).  Portal 2 was in the awkward position of having to introduce the portal mechanism (along with the goo mechanisms) to new players while not boring old players.  In Antichamber, there was some new stuff for me, but some felt old hat and too easy.  The experience was also really unfulfilling because there wasn&apos;t any kind of story to go along with in.  There was absolutely no motivation for any of my actions other than &quot;solve puzzles.&quot;  On the plus side, the artistic value of this game is amazing.  The minimalistic graphics style is gorgeous (though the developer seriously needs to consider a treatment of antialiasing), the music is a great fit (reminds me of Minecraft, actually), and the ambiance noise is fantastic.  Touching on that a little more, the ambiance isn&apos;t actually about what you actually hear/see, but it&apos;s designed to create an emotion associated with what&apos;s happening in the game.  On that level, it works incredibly well, and was the cause of most of my enjoyment with this game.  In summary, I&apos;d recommend to most people to play this game, though I don&apos;t know that I can recommend spending $20 on it.  Things that I&apos;d like to see improved:  1) AA on the graphics, PLEASE; 2) Some kind of story/motivation; 3) A better ending.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3008426">Expand</a></span>

<br>I dont know about you, but i HATE. Puzzle games. HATE them. To me, when i think puzzle games, i think the type of puzzle games like my Grandma plays. &quot;words with friends&quot; or &quot;help ally the alligator get to her pond&quot; or &quot;Fling a cat to the goal&quot;. I think of the multicolored bubble-blaster crap you always find on &quot;OmgFreeGames.com&quot;. But then i bought antichamber. It twists your view of reality and spits on it. Lets say you are walking down a hallway, and you peer through glass to another hallway. You think you are going to go into that next hallway, yes? Nope. Instead, you look through the opening into the second HW, and see a giant spaceship. &quot;Oh holy  i didnt see that there. Im going to turn around and come back to this in a sec, let me explore the other paths first.&quot; You turn around, Where was the hallway you were just in? All you see is a white wall. &quot;Okay, i guess i have to go to the spaceship.&quot; You turn away from the wall only to see that you are in yet another room, falling down an endless pit.
<br>
<br>This game has changed in what i believe software was capable of. Its beautiful, GO BUY IT. I bought it for like 6$ at the Steam Summer Sale, but its worth 60$.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3360339">Expand</a></span>

This game takes all assumptions of reality such as straight lines, consistent shapes and logic and throws it completely out the window making for what I consider to be one of the first intuitively puzzle games I&apos;ve ever played. This game does not reward you for thinking outside of the box, it rewards you for re-inventing the box. Even when it decideds to punish you it does so in fun and creative ways which make you ask yourself &quot;What the Hell just happened? THAT WAS AWESOME!&quot; Even when you fail a puzzle, which will happen more often than not, the failures are often performed in such fantastic manners that even failing is fun. I can&apos;t tell you how many times I ran into a room and purposely failed it simply to fall down the chute I dubbed &quot;the rainbow tube&quot; because I enjoyed the color and the freefall.
<br>
<br>Make no mistakes, Antichamber is substantially different from your typical puzzle game in that it rewards broad thinking rather repetitive motions as most modern or preceding puzzle games do. Yes, there are techniques you will use more than once, but often they are applied in a manner which they are tacked on as a composite to a larger puzzle rather than being a derivation of a repeated solution. Simply put, no two puzzles in the game are the same or even close to being the same. Make no mistake; this is not an easy puzzle game and unless you enjoy a little bit of intellectual sadism, or at the very least pretty colors, chances are this isn&apos;t the game for you.
<br>
<br>All in all, this is a game for people who enjoy trial and error erm, trials who don&apos;t mind failing in fantastically mind blowing ways. The puzzles are all unique and well thought out and there is a huge amount of satisfaction to be had in completing a puzzle and then handing the game over to your friend.  Nothing seems to quite beat resisting the urge to tell them how incredibly simple the puzzle they just spent an our on really is after you spent roughly the same amount of time stumbling through it yourself.
<br>
<br>The only reason I don&apos;t give this game a 10/10 is because as an indie game, with the proper support I could see this game being markedly better than it already is and believe me, that&apos;s saying something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antichamber/user-reviews?user_review_id=3440372">Expand</a></span>
