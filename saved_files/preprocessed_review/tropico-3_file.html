The setting is beautiful, but as a chronically benevolent sim player, I found some aspects of being a dictator unsettling. The tutorial is very bare bones.

You&apos;re given choices on how you develop your Island nation. You can go North Korea/Communist Cuba style or go South Korea/Jamaica style. For those who love history and older things, there are piles of culture references (Monty Python) and history references (US fruit company) that will provide you with a couple laughs and smirks. Your El Presidente can be made to your expectations through traits and aesthetic changes, from a CIA installed dictator with Tourettes syndrome to a Democratically elected Socialist who is a Pirate.  As a newcomer to the Tropico Franchise I found the game very simple and easy to get into. The campaign Scenario&apos;s for the most part act as the tutorial and playing through them really doesn&apos;t feel like a tutorial, which is a tutorial done right in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2416160">Expand</a></span>

It has style, which other city builders tend to lack, and the game has some nice options ranging from an okay campaign to a sandbox scenario on a randomly generated island. Unfortunately, the game severely lacks polishing. After playing this over three years past its release, it still suffers from an unbelievable amount of bugs. I can only imagine how unplayable it would have been at release. A polished version of this game might have scored a 7 from me, but in its current state (that I imagine won&apos;t get any better at this point), I can&apos;t give it more than a 4. To clarify, the bugs range from both gameplay bugs and technical bugs (such as crashing while saving, corrupting save files of course).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3397639">Expand</a></span>

For those who haven&apos;t played the original, Tropico is among the most creative and entertaining &quot;city sims&quot; ever created, and Tropico 3 does a great job of updating the experience for 2009. However, those who have played the original will find virtually nothing new here beyond a few online features and a better looking (though far clunkier) interface. Tropico 3 adds basically nothing in terms of buildings, edicts, character traits, and the game&apos;s basic mechanics. In fact, compared to the expanded Tropico Mucho Macho Edition, Tropico 3 is a drastically scaled back version of the game that offers little challenge or novelty to hold the interest of experienced Tropicans. Honestly, if you still own a copy of the original, you&apos;re probably better off playing that. The changes made here are uniformly superficial with the exception of the event editor. While the game looks good, the free-floating camera doesn&apos;t work well for this kind of game, though you do have the option of viewing the game in a &quot;classic&quot; fixed perspective. The musical soundtrack is very nice (though short), and the voice acting is fairly poor compared to the original game. Character creation is very similar to the original, though you now have the option of creating a 3d avatar. However, the choices are fairly limited, particularly since many of the available outfits just don&apos;t really fit in with the flavor of the game. All in all, Tropico 3 is a very good game for the unitiated. For those of you who haven&apos;t played the original, this definitely deserves an 8 or 9. However, those who have played the original will likely feel like they&apos;ve basically just purchased the same game they bought eight years ago. For these experienced Tropicans, this lazy update warrants a 3 or 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=738250">Expand</a></span>

Whether you&apos;re building your island empire, or simply cruising the streets and following peoples&apos; daily activities, it&apos;s all fun. You could say it combines Sim City, The Sims, and... well, more. Everyone should try it.</span>

This game gets a clean 10 stars from me, because for me this is how a good game supose to be like. The game is good old fashion fun! Finaly a game where i don&apos;t feel i am being milked by the game developers. They really put an effort in creating this game to give you a long lasting fun game. The graphics are not wow (still good), but that does not bother me one bit. I prefer this game over almost any top game releast in the last years. I&apos;m sure if i really look for it i would find some flaws, so far i&apos;m having to much fun to even notice any. Thats a good sign :) ..I recommend this game to all the true gamers out there!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=738609">Expand</a></span>

All you need to do to start playing Tropico 3, is enter the key code included with the game (just like the good old days!) It&apos;s because of this, that I went to Best Buy and gladly paid full price for Tropico 3. Way to go Kalypso... thank you for having faith in your fans!!! As for the game itself... 10/10 - The developers stayed faithful to the original Tropico, basically combining the original &amp; its expansion into one game... and then updating it. They have added great new features such as a customizable avatar &amp; vehicles. These two features alone add an extra layer of depth, realism and playability missing from the original series. I have also found the game to be almost bug free... this is very refreshing, since most new games seem to be released unfinished &amp; still in Beta (Empire: Total War anyone?) My main criticism with Tropico 3, would have to be the Garages. These building types are a fundamental part of the vehicle/transportation system in the game. The garage buildings, however, look very modern &amp; out of place. They are an eyesore that stand out amongst the other theme-appropriate buildings on your island. I would love to see a garage makeover in a future expansion pack. Speaking of an expansion pack... The only other critique I would give this game is the need for more of everything - more customizable options for your avatar, more building types or design variations of current buildings, more edict options... more, more, more. Call it &quot;Tropico 3: Mas Todo&quot; - no major theme change is needed, just more of everything! Tropico 3 is a very fun game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=738099">Expand</a></span>

The premise is you are the leader of a communist island that has just taken over for a variety of reasons (choosing a custom avatar will allow you to create the background of your leader and gives rewards and penalties with the immense amount of factions).  You have to build it into a paradise in so many years (depending on the scenario), bringing in Tourism and exporting Industry, all while trying to keep the US and USSR happy enough to send you cash to help out.  It really is fun, Juanito is a hoot, Betty Boom is hilarious, micro managing the island is surprisingly VERY fun!  I was stunned at how fun the game was.  It really is a grand ole time to sit down for a few hours trying to make the island work without getting taken out by assassins or a coup.  It&apos;s well worth the price, and if you&apos;re any good at micro-manage games and world building games, you should be pleasantly surprised with this offering.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1662145">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s cheap price and abbundent content allow you to make a safe investment. The steep learning curve might turn some people away but otherwise, that&apos;s really it&apos;s only flaw. A few may say that Tropico isn&apos;t indepth enough, and I would agree only in some portions of the game such as diplomacy, and trade (if any). But I think that Haemimont Games wanted to keep the game as simple as possible. The game is very deep in individual polotics and electoral processes which is a deviation from most City Builders. If you enjoy city building but have been turned off by all the recent Rome era games, this is the game for you, different, modern, cheap, addicting. Building a 1950&apos;s era island is one of those things that turns out to be far more fun after you get the hang of it. Build industry, housing, entertainment, tourism, infestructure etc. all through a steamlined, realistic process. This is not a military game! If you like seeing little men kill each other like in AoE, then don&apos;t count on it in Tropico. The only visual military conflict that I know of is Rebel rebelions, when you see five guys attacking five guys, it&apos;s very anticlimatic. The graphics and lighting are perfect for this tropical setting and the amount of buildings and people seems a little low, but the variaty makes up for it. Are you Pro U.S.S.R or U.S.? you decide. Nationalist, realigous, a militant? There&apos;s so much to do in Tropico that it will have you playing for hours. It&apos;s not for EVERYONE, but it is for most. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=747060">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is nearly the same , although Tropico 3 adds your presidente as a avatar. This avatar is currently the most useful buffing for lack of a better word the function of most buildings, thereby adding 20 service quality in most cases. It is also able to fight alongside your soldiers, break up peaceful demonstrations by talking to the person that started it and holding a speech from the palace balcony. Election speeches might be new in which you can give 1 faction or superpower a 10% ratings boost. The avatar is also fully customizable , on top of having certain bonuses to ratings, productions or what have you, all chooseable at the beginning of a scenario. If you can&apos;t do it at once, you can always try it again with a avatar better suited to that map. Graphics are gorgeous at highlevel settings. Complexity is there, but it is forsaking some realism for more interesting gameplay I guess. For instance food is free, always, yet most factories and farms are only ever privatized in a very few scenarios where they give you monthly rents instead of sales. Overall I suggest doing the tutorial and playing around a bit first IF you have never played Tropico 1 or 3. If you have played Tropico 1 you might also like the third (can&apos;t say anything about the second yet, as I haven&apos;t installed it yet. Most things from the first one are in the second as well along with the latino soundtrack. Instead of your Adviser you will be able to hear the Radio DJ Juan and yourself during Election speeches. Just a word of warning, it is not a War simulator, your soldiers will behave better depending on how much skill they have at that Job, like in any else. You can influence that though wtih a few edicts, essentially laws you pass but can cancel anytime again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=86226">Expand</a></span>

But the DJ is starting to annoy me, and I think there should be more variety in buildings, character customization and islands. However, I do sense an add-on or a map pack is coming soon.</span>

So far it&apos;s proven to be a very stable game and a relatively well optimized one too. The scenarios are great but not always the most challenging. Sandbox mode is funt too for those who want to have full control over how they shape their island but it seems to be lacking something... namely a point (but that&apos;s why they made campaign mode right?). The variety of pain and suffering you can inflict as dictator of your island could keep one occupied for hours. Users will get the most out of this game if they select a president and then govern with some role playing, as they probably would govern. The game has its flaws (reliance on XL parking garages, dead slow construction workers, limited map editing, needs more building variety &amp; late game buildings) but it presents an incredible value at its current price and hours of entertainment. Additional content packages should make this game a 9 or 9.5 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=739002">Expand</a></span>

This game brings me right back. It is essentially the same game with new music (I think I like the tropico 1 music slightly better - it was more varied) and MUCH better graphics. The new camera control and 3D detail really add to feeling of living in a warm and wonderful world - even if it is a constant battle to keep the place from unraveling, what with all the challenging gameplay which must be attended to. The addition of the Presidente avatar is actually a useful tool and a GREAT idea that is well implemented. How many times did I just sit there *glaring* at the screen like a mad man trying desperately to *will* the little Tropicans into focusing on a particular construction project or production activity!?!? Now I can actually send them the message, and they get it! Brilliant. Something I don&apos;t see much talk about in the reviews, but has a big effect on gameplay is the addition of roads with actual VEHICLES! It is also well implemented in that typically low-maintenance way that the rest of the game has going for it. The thing is that the development of the island can be organized around resources almost right from the beginning of play! In the old tropico, it seems you had to develop an economic base around the town center for a few years before you could even consider developing a choice resource on the other side of the island. This adds to the overall flexibility in a big way and puts more design choices and power where it belongs - in the hands of El Presidente! ;) Things I don&apos;t like - the voice-overs have gotten more harshly ridiculous and intrusive. Some of the building and production processes have become less realistic - but at the same time more convenient. It&apos;s nice to have roads and park installations appear instantly, but it feels like I&apos;m kind of cheating when in Tropico 1 there were no such breaks. Minor stuff really. The game is still as challenging as you want it to be. I think I like the old interface better too when checking in on buildings, etc. It seems to me like it was a little more &apos;visual&apos; before, where now it&apos;s more about numbers. I&apos;m used to it now - again pretty minor. Overall, it still feels like an upgrade, so I give it an 8!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=739971">Expand</a></span>

I would have like to see more fighting between different factions. The use of all the special options available to oppress the people doesn&apos;t really find their use, when the grip on Tropico is so easily held.</span>

I haven&apos;t had hours fly by on me like this since Civilization IV. Great graphics for a game of this nature and runs very well on my system with everything maxed (Intel Core 2 Duo 3 GHz, 8 GB of RAM, ATI Radeon HD 4870 512 MB; 512 MB cards only allow up to Medium setting for anti-aliasing). There are a few things that aren&apos;t perfect; laying out roads could be a little easier. It&apos;s easy to get yourself into trouble at the beginning trying to grow too quickly by spending yourself into debt. Once your economy is strong, the game is too easy. Natural disasters (Hurricanes, Earthquakes, etc.) cause damage to your city, but the buildings just disappear instead of crumbling too the ground in a pile of rubble. These are all relatively minor issues that will likely be taken care of in a future patch or, as usual w/ PC games, fixed by a user/group of users who can&apos;t wait for the patch. If you like Civ IV, Sim City, or any other city/empire building game, you won&apos;t regret buying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=737889">Expand</a></span>

The negative that i give the game is that there is a &quot;random map&quot; option but you can&apos;t go and create a custom map tile-by-tile as you can in other city building games. Also, you can&apos;t manually control your soldiers. I like the idea of your Presidente dude being controllable and that he can give speeches to make the people happy. etc. Maybe one of the more entertaining parts of the game i find is the subtle sarcasms against totalitarian dictatorships. I never played the previous Tropico 1 or 2, but i find this one to be great. Graphics aren&apos;t Oblivion or Crysis comparable, but the graphics are way better than any other city building game i have ever played. Again, i think not having a custom map terrain editor is the only minus i have... it takes away re-playability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=738060">Expand</a></span>

Its atmosphere and graphics are what grab you at first and make you want to see what it&apos;s all about. I&apos;ve been playing it all weekend, which says something about its ability to suck you in. I haven&apos;t been that hooked on a game since I got Oblivion 2 years ago. Let&apos;s face it, the market was long overdue for a professional, polished city builder that people could get into and get to love. It&apos;s got one flawed and frustrating system and a few other annoyances, but that&apos;s understandable since there&apos;s a fine line between challenge and broken mechanics - mostly you&apos;re just concentrating on dictating effectively and staying in power. Which is an awesome and unique theme that completely captures the feel of a small time dictatorship. As long as you&apos;re not afraid of looking up the fine points on the internet, get this game already. It&apos;s dirt cheap now, and you&apos;ll know you like it if you&apos;ve played the likes of Caesar or Sim City before. 8.3 overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1834721">Expand</a></span>

Lots of customization and control over your style of play, as well as a deep political aspect unseen in most city build games. the voice acting is fantastic and hilarious, the story mode has engaging missions and is fun to play. The only qualms I have with this game is relating to the tourism game play, I feel like it is in all underwhelming. The soundtrack to the game is fantastic, and often you need to think carefully about how you want to go about planning your little island paradise before just jumping in. All in all it is a deep and rewarding city builder, with a generous splash of politics and humor, and easily one of the best city build games I&apos;ve ever owned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2197298">Expand</a></span>
