<br>
<br>This years version offers nothing new but some UPDATED things such as the interface and a update to the scouting system which i really do like, the sidebar is great and helps tidy up the interface and the scouting is much more interesting because players take more time to be fully scouting, like last years version you could hire a 20/20 scout and the player would be scouted almost instantly but now when a player is scouted the stats are ranged for example a players stats could be 12-16 but the more you scout the player the more accurate the scout report will be, some players won&apos;t like this system but i find it more realistic.
<br>
<br>The match engine is slightly improved by the way it looks and feels, they have added more animations to the players and the stadiums have had a bit of a face lift, they have also changed the lighting which is pretty poor because you can just about see the football depending on the time of day the match is taking place. The biggest issues right now with the ME is that every goal you concede will be from a cross or corner which leaves me very frustrated because its nothing to do with your team or tactic, it happens every game you play in you will always concede from a cross/corner and has to be an issue with the game itself which I&apos;m sure they will hotfix or fix in a patch but this is just taking the fun out the game because no matter what you do or try to stop it happening it will always happen. Another issue players are complaining about and this is happening to me too is the amount of players that will get injured either in a match or in training, I&apos;m currently halfway through my season and have always had at least 7 players out with injuries since the start of the season,
<br>
<br>Since FM 2013 the game gets released with issues and bugs that ruin the game, sure they get fixed in patches but last years one took 3 months to sort out before the game became enjoyable to play and i get the feeling that with the cross/corner goals and injury problem it will take them 3 months to sort this one out too.
<br>
<br>IN SHORT:
<br>This years version offers nothing new or any reason to updated from last years version apart from a updated interface and a updated player database, Wait for a fix on the problems this version has or stick to FM 2014</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4664473">Expand</a></span>

And you have to press so many links to find your profile and so many other stuff. The sidebar offers minimal help as it lacks the most important menu items and not customizable as the 2014 version.
<br>The Match Engine, which determines how good the overall game is, is very one-dimensional hence very poor, that is to say, it only favors one style of football that I totally dislike: the crossing game. I was amazed even the brilliant Lionel Messi can&apos;t score 1v1 clear cut chances no matter how many times he tries or how poor the keeper is. You have to cross to score, no passing game, no counters, only wings and crosses. Defensively, the game can be amazing. So amazing, I had to delete the game. We conceded few goals but the manner in which we conceded goals was unacceptable.
<br>Sports Interactive have to learn how to build on their improvements instead of reworking the match engine.
<br>I won&apos;t speak of the positives because no matter how many positives the game has, Its still Poor if the Match Engine is Poor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4912745">Expand</a></span>

<br>After a year since the last instalment, the team behind FM15 must go to work in striped black and white outfits with matching black masks, carrying the expected &apos;swag&apos; bag with them, especially with the &#xA3;30 price tag attached to this shambles.  They must work all of about half an hour a week if this is all they have created in the prevailing year.
<br>There is so little change to this game, change to areas that were in true need of overhaul, that it is criminal.  Yes, there is a tidier screen, (because it was SO DIFFICULT navigating before wasn&apos;t it??), improved scouting, and some more match day animations, but really, that is it.
<br>The usual bugs continue to aggravate those of us who paid for this before FM15 decided to properly stress test it.  No doubt we will be greeted with another update in the new year, because the team are just too damn lazy to iron out the kinks beforehand.  Here&apos;s an idea SI, release it early next year in beta mode before you release it for sale.  That way, I pretty much guarantee, all the bugs can be sorted BEFORE launch.
<br>These bugs include the match day animations that are truly horrific; players who are told to &apos;mark tightly&apos; but just stand by why opposition players get a shot off, players close down but refuse to tackle, opposition players with poor pace/acceleration repeatedly ghosting past my apparently quicker players, bugs such as continuously conceding goals from crosses and wide play which has been mentioned repeatedly on various forums, continuously conceding late goals, irrespective of team strategy.
<br>Outside of the match day screen, the press questioning, an area which was supposed to be improved, is just as annoying as ever.  It just happens more often now, adding to your annoyance.
<br>The transfer system, something I personally contacted SI about and was told would be sorted in this issue, is still as bad as ever too.  I have never seen one of the top players in world football move to another club, and this hasn&apos;t changed in FM15 either.  Those transfers like Suarez to Barca, or Bale to RM, or how about them coming back?  How about MU offering &#xA3;60 mill for Ronaldo or MC offering &#xA3;100 mill for Neymar?  These transfers NEVER happen.  Apparently in this game, they not only are NEVER bided on, but no one ever goes to watch them either.  The free transfer list is still cluttered with players that would grace most teams, but no one wants them.  There is no sense of capturing a player that a dozen clubs were after, and the whole thing feels sterile and cold.  Just like it did in 14 and 13 and 12.....
<br>
<br>This is just another poor iteration of the last, with a new price tag and some new screens.  My advice would be to wait for the expected update.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4691883">Expand</a></span>

The new media features are tedious and boring. The roster update does not warrant the price tag. I wish I bought the game on Origin instead of Steam so I can get a refund.</span>

An example, I am Arsenal, just beat Anderlect 5-0 away from home in Europe and then beat Man City 2-0 in the league; I then play Bournmout in the cup and get pumped 3-0 for no reason at all; all the players that got 9&apos;s etc for some reason get 5&apos;s; both prematch and half time team talks gain green responses from all players but still they could not beat Bournmouth, its ridiculous, and just one example of many senseless results I&apos;ve had with different teams.
<br>
<br>Good - The awful transfer flaws from 2014 have for the most part been fixed. Prices for players are far, far more realistic than FM 2014 where for example, 30 year old Darijo Srna cost 20mil, and 35 year old Lucio cost 18mil, just ridiculous. Now prices match real life. The new interface, whilst rather dumbed down, is ok. Hours and hours can still be sunk into the game very easily.
<br>
<br>Bad - The match engine has not improved very much over 2014; too many flaws including - far too many freekicks hit the woodwork, the opposition scores from almost every corner regardless of your tactics or personel, slide tackles won far too often land in the feet of an opposition player (not quite as often as 2014) and still, for some strange reason players almost never score in a 1 on 1 situation and never, ever after a run, it will always end in &apos;what a goal that would have been&apos; or &apos; he did so well until the finish&apos;. They never actually finish it. In fact the most common way of scoring is crosses, any other approach is useless. The tactics are also a bit dodgy - I find playing the 4-2-3-1, the formation that almost every top club plays today results in your team conceding goals laughably easy.
<br>
<br>Verdict - Even with the huge, infuriating fundemental flaws with the match engine and tactics FM 2015 is still playable but it is the worst match engine of any FM I have ever played. I have never felt less guilty about reloading a save before a game because most of the results seem to be completely random. Just an 5/10, a 7 if they were to actually fix the match engine. Worse than 2014 overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4934333">Expand</a></span>

I have been playing football manager since 2003 when I was 12 and I loved it the stats the numbers the stuff men like. But when coming to buy this game or any game for that matter that releases every year it is difficult to justify to yourself paying out that amount again.
<br>
<br>Apart from the side bar an option to do touchline team talks and scouting system tweaks where you don&apos;t instantly know everything about a player after sending your scout to do a report card (mimicking real life) there really isn&apos;t that much added. The 3d engine I can&apos;t really tell the difference to be honest.
<br>
<br>As for if you should buy it depends on which camp you sit. If you are  like me a hardcore nut then yes but if you are new to the series or more casual I would get 13 or 14 at a cheaper price form steam and download the current transfer database and you will have practically the same experience.
<br>
<br>The good
<br>Solid installment more of the same stat goodness.
<br>I like the touchline team talk helps you get in to the whole role play idea.
<br>
<br>The bad
<br>Difficult to justify spending &#xA3;30 on basically the same game.
<br>Tactics menu feels cluttered.
<br>Clubs still asking for ridiculous transfer fees I am not paying &#xA3;80 million for Hojberg
<br>
<br>The ugly
<br>
<br>A lot of questions asked by journalists are the same as last year with the wording having no attempt at being changed and little variety with the same questions repeated  game after game smacks of sheer laziness, you had a whole year you could at least change it a bit.
<br>
<br>Final verdict: 6/10 Would have been a 7 but some parts of the game just felt lazy so I deducted a point but if you love the series like me you will be able to forgive it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4685296">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Missing out on a couple of instalments means all of the additions over the years were lumped into one affordable Steam sale package. And after pouring 200+ hours into the game so far, I&apos;m very glad that I went and bought it. The increased player interaction and match options allow me to get ever closer to the complete footballing package.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5250911">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all, i have technical issues.While modern FPS or RTS run just fine this piece of **** slows down every now and then.No problem in the 3D match, but in every menu.For example i want to switch between players, the screen freezes for a short time.This is NOT a problem with my setup, like i said, other games run just fine.Im sure its a bug, but i dont care, its there and its not really fun when you need 1 minute for small things what would normally take 20 seconds.For that ill substract 1 point.
<br>
<br>Lets look into the &quot;new&quot; features:
<br>
<br>New interface:This interface is not new, its back.Why did they changed it anyway?Was one of my main critic points for the series.But still, the interface is bad.You need to search hours for things in this poorly designed wannabe interface.Look, the game is basically the same im terms of the features like....say FM2012.But its so hard to find your way.Poor job!
<br>
<br>TRaining:Wow, its gettin worse every year.I know **** about what is happening.Why?There is no real indicator when your training is too hard.Of course, youll see it when hundreds of injurys happen but thats a bit late, right?In my savegame i tried to use the happiness of my players as indicator,You can find that in the training section.Arround 90% of my squad is happy, rest content.Results after 2 months of preseason and training:NEARLY 20 INJURED PLAYERS!!!WTF??!!??Im playing the series since FM2008, injurys where always a problem.But i could tweak my training with a slider.A tried my settings for 6 months or so, less injurys, you knew that was the &quot;sweet spot&quot;.Now you dont have a slider, just basic categories like &quot;hard&quot;.WTF?Where is the satisfaction that this is MY training?Many other things are gone too.No more different **** and so on.Dumbed down, no fun,
<br>
<br>Matchengine and tactics:Oh boy, this is what destroys this game completely.Whatever this game is about, its not football.The developer tied everything on the pitch to &quot;roles&quot;.While in previous games this was something like a basic suggestion you could always tweak this is gone.You want a player to play in a specific role and SI things &quot;in this role a players will always dribble&quot; you cant cancel that.WTF??Im the coach, right?So you can look through aaaaaallll the roles in hope you find that combination that you want is there.For me, it was there, after 30 minutes of searching, great.Wastin my time, no fun.The matchengine is a joke too.You can read other reviews, i wont repeat what they write here, its true.What they are missing in my opinion is that AI sometimes will not react at all or the AI will choose the wrong player for the action!!!Some examples:My team got a penalty awarded.The kicker shoots, hits the woodwork, the ball rolls in slowmo to his **** feed.What happened?He forgot to react!!!!While he was just standin there with no reaction the defenders where able to clear the ball.Other example:3 defensive players, a long ball from the opposition, 2 of my players just standing there and the third, the slowest player in the team with the most distance to cover from his position had to make the run.Reasult:A goal for the opposition, first shot, 1:0.No fun at all!!Sometimes the players will ignore you orders, in my case that broke my gameplan completly.My game is slow paced and relies on retain possesion of the ball.My GK is ordered to distribute short balls to the defenders.For the 20 games i played he kicked most of the ball in the other half.Many balls lost that way, no fun.This engine is broken!
<br>
<br>Visuals:Im sorry, i know there are so many fans that say &quot;its not about visuals in a manager&quot;.Youre wrong, its nearly 2015 and this piece of **** looks worse then the fifal manager 5 years ago.No good presentation, no real, close-up celebration of goals, no visual reaction when a player is fouled.
<br>
<br>Something in general:This series is dead.SI is a lazy company because they know that there is no competition.There is no progress in the series since 2012, more steps backwards.Please stop to buy this **** and please stop to blame everybody with legit critic he knows nothing about the game.If its so hard to learn FM  than the developers done a terrible job in the first place.
<br>
<br>Final verdict:Better than 2013 or 2014 but still a bad game.FM2012 is still the best experience and thats what makes me sad!I would give this game a 4, but like i said, technical issues, -1 point.Dont buy it, even on a discount, its not worth your money.I hope they close this developer soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4778105">Expand</a></span>

well, it take me a bit before get familiar with but not that hard.

The worst thing for this 2015 version is about unrealistic of team movement and goal score.
- 60-80% of cross ball will be converted into goal without the way to defend.

<br>
<br>The worst thing for this 2015 version is about unrealistic of team movement and goal score.
<br>- 60-80% of cross ball will be converted into goal without the way to defend.
<br>- 20-30% of one on one situation will be end up with goal, super great goal keeper?? or useless striker??
<br>- hold up ball means nothing, defender will slide tackle from back side and 100% win the ball even though ball holder are in penalty area
<br>- etc
<br>
<br>In summary, I feel very frustrate when play this version.
<br>Those unrealistic stuff make me boring and I have to go back to version 2014.

<br>**** GK too many dump goal and i think defender still **** like 2013,2014  3 defender cant stop other team header when he just only one in front of goal and he not even good  ST
<br>
<br>and why god like winger still in this game after 3 years? every winger is like robben with ozil pass skill
<br>some time they sure suck but when they play good it just so ridiculous  some it just 3rd division player

<br>
<br>For example, the graphics engine somehow looks worse during the matches, whilst the sounds are atrocious (kicking the ball sounds akin to kicking around a bag of wet cement). These should be easy fixes in 2014; yes, they&apos;re not game breakers, and I&apos;m not expecting FIFA standard ME graphics here, but they shouldn&apos;t be actually worse year on year.
<br>
<br>The new layout feels very &quot;Windows 8&quot;-ish to me somehow, which is a bad thing. It&apos;s functional, but it feels like change for the sake of change so that they can sell you a &apos;new&apos; product.
<br>
<br>Everything else is much of the same, barring one big glaring issue - the match engine doesn&apos;t seem responsive to what you do. It may be just me, but I held fire on this review until I thoroughly tested it, and a 4-4-2 with attempts at charging wing backs plays the same as a 4-4-2 without, as does a 4-3-3 and so on. It feels like a game of table football, where you put the players in position and the game plays out. In earlier versions of the game, this was not the case, and you could feel the influence of individual players - 2015 does not have that.
<br>
<br>So this, for me, is the poorest entry to the series for quite some time. I wish SI Games would drop the yearly game cycle and concentrate on a fantastic release for FM 2017, but unfortunately we all know SEGA won&apos;t allow that. It&apos;s a shame, as this is a fantastic franchise with the core in place to make a blockbuster football management sim, but every year we&apos;re getting half-hearted efforts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4812304">Expand</a></span>

I am one of those who actually liked the idea behind last years version where things were simplified but as much as I regret to say it, hardly any of the match shouts and strategies seem to have any actual effect on the matches you play. You also seem to concede an obscene amount of last minute goals in this version making it an incredibly frustrating experience.

<br>I give it a 6 because I know that most of the hair pulling mistakes are going to get fixed at some point. At the moment the game is far worse and nearly unplayable. My recommendation is to wait until it&apos;s been patched at least twice before buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4666287">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m not gonna elaborate too much into the game. This is basically  the same game as 2014 with a few minor changes. I would advice people that have 2014 and are not addicted to the FM series to simply skip this version of the game. If you are the lover of the FM series, I just couldn&apos;t see myself for an example, not buying every single FM game there is. BUT! If they don&apos;t improve their next series I will have to reconsider that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5051093">Expand</a></span>

<br>even at this, i see major changes for the good, the scouting system has been improved drastically and is now more realistic than ever. The in game play is also a lot better. I am enjoying this game apart from the takeovers and i hope this can be resolved. These problems should be easily resolved and i think we will have a fantastic game on our hands.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4840563">Expand</a></span>

The user interface has been changed drastically and new options have been added - you could even call them slight RPG elements. You can earn licenses and what not. The match engine is pretty and there is just as much micromanagement as in the past. This will definitely be a time sink for me, MUST BUY! :)</span>

<br>The structure of the game got better in my opinion , you don&apos;t have actually do the everything in the game like the Football Manager 2014 which could take more long when you was playing.
<br>This one could say that is reduced but on the same you have to work hard to have a good game and it&apos;s this what I like in this fantastic simulator which I start playing from the first one when I was a child.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=4904697">Expand</a></span>

Sales are going strong because there is no alternative in this game genre and SEGA can&apos;t be bothered fixing the longstanding issues. It is a simulation game, very data intensive. Still they won&apos;t move to 64 bit version, giving them the resources to vastly improve the gameplay. If you load all the players in the game to have a rich world and fuller experience, you&apos;ll discover that it takes too long to calculate the game days. That&apos;s because they are still using only one cpu core for most of the calculations. These things were somewhat acceptable 5 years ago.
<br>
<br>This game could be so much more, but as long as SEGA faces no competition, it will be only switching up the menus and updating the club squads every year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5317099">Expand</a></span>

In real life there is two teams against each others and better team wins or at least have better odds to win single match. In football manager series, game ai checks your league position and rolls odds based on that, no matter what team you are against. So you might lose to very weak teams or win very strong opponents depending overall status. Also, in single game there seems to be few checkpoints where AI is looking for goals, like 47 minutes and also 53 minutes. If you make goal, AI gives opposite team chance to score and if initial check (depending on your league position) is on opposite teams side, they will very like to score. So, single details and stats on players or your tactics doesn&#xB4;t matter much. Game is looking for &quot;stories&quot; like losing many games in row, no matter what you do etc. This makes this game very frustrating as you really don&#xB4;t have much control on what is happening. Also, &quot;diplomacy&quot;, talking with boardroom or players is very very stupid. Sometimes players want to leave and when you try to offer them to clubs, they get upset because they feel they are thrown out from team against their will. Sometimes they accuse you are not keeping promises in very stupid ways (not offering contract, which you have just offered, not chosen them to team when they don&#xB4;t have work permit etc). Chairman acts like schizophrenic etc.
<br>So overall, lots of details and numbers, lots of information, much to do, but not much which really affects the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2015/user-reviews?user_review_id=5842633">Expand</a></span>
