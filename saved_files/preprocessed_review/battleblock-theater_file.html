I recommend using a controller however, as I would usually for platformers. If you are using a keyboard, I would suggest rebinding the keys, because the defaults are rubbish. The head/weapon system works well and if you really don&apos;t want to work for them yourself you could always buy them off steam market quite cheaply. The visual aspect is really appealing and the narration is excellent. The music isn&apos;t the best I have ever seen but it fits the game and is pleasant to listen to.
<br>
<br>All up it really is a fun game to play with friends - but not much fun by yourself. If you&apos;ve had enough of trying to beat Spelunky or FTL, this is a great game to chill with some friends.
<br>9/10 maybe single-player could be a little more enticing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleblock-theater/user-reviews?user_review_id=4315565">Expand</a></span>

And here&apos;s why; the narrator is absolutely out of his mind, the plot consists of cats who have somehow taken prisoners, and you get the opportunity to change your character&apos;s face and color each and every time that you play. Now if that doesn&apos;t make you want this game then you should have your head checked immediately, because something just ain&apos;t right up there.
<br>
<br>Aside from the hilarious lines and the evil evil kitties, this game is a surprisingly fun platformer that will keep you entertained until the very end. The levels aren&apos;t long, but can get extremely frustrating from time to time, especially if you&apos;re trying to collect every gem. And even though there aren&apos;t any &quot;bosses&quot; in the game, the last level of every floor is timed, and can be pretty difficult to get through. All-in-all, if you&apos;re looking for a new platformer to sink your teeth in to, consider picking this game up as it&apos;s one of the best platformers on Steam.
<br>
<br>And if you don&apos;t, then you&apos;d better watch your back, because the cats are surely coming for you. Oh yeah, and did I mention that the soundtrack is totally awesome? Because it is. And anyone who knows their platformers knows how incredibly important a killer soundtrack can be. What are you still doing here? Go! Now! Get this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleblock-theater/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920799">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>People are comparing this game to the likes of Castle Crashers, Super Meat Boy, Fez and even Minecraft. The truth is: it&apos;s nothing like any of those games. It&apos;s nothing like anything made ever in ever forever. It&apos;s an completely fresh and utterly unique platformer with colourful graphics and an absurd story-line.
<br>
<br>Most of the fun comes with finding out and trying to deal with how bonkers this game actually is... You play as what I can only guess are doodles of humans who shipwrecked onto a mysterious island. The captain of the ship, Hatty Hattington, is possessed by a magical top hat he is forced to wear by the humanoid ginger cats who inhabit the island&apos;s creepy run-down theater. If you&apos;re having trouble grasping this, then you are not alone. These humanoid cats, or at least the security-worker cats, name you and all other crew members of your ship their prisoners and force you to entertain the civilian population of the island, who are also cats.
<br>
<br>The humour had me laughing the whole time, and I played for four hours. I&apos;m not even anywhere near completing even the main story-line; the game has so many levels and only sometimes gets repetitive, even despite it&apos;s simple premise. On the rare occasion it does get redundant it throws in another mechanic or unlocks another weapon and the fun returns. The story-line is only two player, but there are some sports-styled games for four of you to anger each other over. Oh and Stamper as the narrator: Genius.
<br>
<br>There is just so much here in one tiny package. Good old simplistic platformer gameplay, colourful goofy graphics, tons of levels and collectibles, make-your-own-level content creator, huge replay value even if you aren&apos;t a completionist, funky soundtrack and everything about it is hilarious and entertaining throughout.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleblock-theater/user-reviews?user_review_id=4203469">Expand</a></span>

<br>battle block puts you through rage inducing heart aching, vein popping sitiuations (online mode).
<br>battleblock it just insanely fun but without a companion it can become dull. but thats like after you 14hous into the game so it doesnt effect the score at all. its just truly a great game all together. thanks for reading</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleblock-theater/user-reviews?user_review_id=4295115">Expand</a></span>

Single player is a lot of fun, co-op is an entirely different experience (you don&apos;t just go through the single-player missions with a second player, you&apos;re given all-new challenges that require cooperation). The online Arena modes feel like a throwaway feature, which is how I felt about the non-story modes in &quot;Castle Crashers&quot;, but opinions will vary here.
<br>
<br>Music is superb. The taunting narrator is a fun twist, but he does run out of things to say and quickly starts repeating himself. You can, however, disable the frequency of his comments, or turn him off entirely, through the &quot;Options&quot; menu.
<br>
<br>Controls fine on keyboard, but I&apos;ve always felt these games are best with a gamepad.
<br>
<br>I wish these guys could release a game every couple of years (it&apos;s now been six years since the original release of &quot;Castle Crashers&quot; in 2008), but maybe the reason they don&apos;t is because they&apos;d rather make inspired games than simply churn out something to keep their name in the industry.
<br>
<br>Two major drawbacks are the musical selection (there aren&apos;t that many tracks in the game, and they start repeating themselves very quickly), and the time it takes from confirming &quot;Retry&quot; to a mission resetting takes far too long for this kind of game.  It also would&apos;ve been a huge plus if they got the narrator voice actor to record even just 20 additional lines, as he starts repeating himself way too quickly as well.
<br>
<br>I got this game for $10 during the launch sale, and I highly recommend it at that price.  It&apos;s no &quot;Super Meat Boy&quot;, but I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll see a game that steals the throne for a long, long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleblock-theater/user-reviews?user_review_id=4193830">Expand</a></span>

Castle Crashers was a deeply rich and amazingly fun game, this game is not. It&apos;s like a crap follow up to an epic album. The &quot;platformer&quot; feels wonky and it&apos;s just boring... very very boring.  I made these thoughts in a Steam forum and I had a few people get mad at me, and even someone from the company addressed my concerns. I remember back when this game was in development way back in the day.... even bought a shirt... now that shirt will go to the Goodwill. Behemoth is better than this, this is a huge letdown. It tries to be funny, it&apos;s not... the characters have no soul and the story is incredibly uninteresting. Drop your Ambien and play this game instead if sleep is something you need.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleblock-theater/user-reviews?user_review_id=4380721">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>REVIEW: So I watched the intro and thought to myself: &#x201C;hey that narrator sounds really funny, that might be a fun game!&#x201D; I was both right and wrong: the narrator is funny until you&#x2019;ve heard everything he has to say many times, and the game is fun in some modes. There are some really interesting puzzles which actually quite stretch your brain, too. It isn&#x2019;t until the end where timing has to be precise, which is a good thing, because your character feels like a slow, earthbound sucker (double jump notwithstanding). This means that you can breeze through most of the game relatively quickly&#x2014;if it holds your interest for long enough, anyway. I know that I got bored and didn&#x2019;t come back for a few months. Still, the multiplayer modes seem fun enough when there are actually people playing them (I got the fireball weapon, and it was way too much fun burning the poor other players).
<br>
<br>There are significant drawbacks, too. This game doesn&#x2019;t really compare favorably to any AAA platformer I&#x2019;ve ever owned in terms of mechanics. I don&#x2019;t know, maybe you are supposed to get a charge out of being slow and hopping tiny jumps, but anybody can do that in real life&#x2026; Speaking of, there are some intensely frustrating moments after the difficulty ramps up and timing suddenly becomes critical. There are generally enough checkpoints to make this feel less annoying, but that won&#x2019;t keep you from running out of time on the last finale levels. Also, aside from the difficulty going up, the game doesn&#x2019;t feel like it is going anywhere. Sure the cutscenes are funny, but they lead you to believe that there will be some kind of coherent ending&#x2014;which turns out not to be the case. To summarize the game in the words of the narrator: &#x201C;that was&#x2026; adequate!&#x201D;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleblock-theater/user-reviews?user_review_id=4454447">Expand</a></span>
