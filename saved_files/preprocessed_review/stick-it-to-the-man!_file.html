Graphics, voices, music, controls, humor, there&apos;s nothing I don&apos;t like. Beat the game using XBOX 360 Controller, it was really smooth and easy. I do recommend this one to beat through. But maybe actually there is a thing I wish were better, this game is quite short (like, four-five hours, I think), but it really isn&apos;t something that may lower its score for sure. This game really made me want to buy some more copies just to thank developers for the amazing work they&apos;ve made there. Brilliant game. I wish there were some more like it around these days (sigh).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stick-it-to-the-man!/user-reviews?user_review_id=3920096">Expand</a></span>

<br>+Puzzles are fun and bizarre.  If you like Monkey Island puzzles, you&apos;ll feel right at home here.
<br>+Art and visuals are really well-done.  They do feel slightly reminiscent of Psychonauts, but the cardboard cutout look gives them a style all their own, and at times looks frighteningly realistic.
<br>+Music is catchy and effervescent, played by live musicians.  Sounds very similar to Grim Fandango.
<br>+There are some very funny, well-timed jokes, which is a hard thing to do in games.
<br>+Platforming physics are pretty solid and predictable.
<br>+Enjoyable world to play in.
<br>
<br>Iffy:
<br>-It can be hard to select whose mind you want to be listening to at times.
<br>-&quot;Stealth&quot; parts with henchmen are OK for a while, but get tiresome, and in the last few levels, feel like they detract from the flow of the story and puzzles.
<br>-Sometimes the voice actors sound like they&apos;re ad libbing and the dialog comes out a bit too &quot;bro speak.&quot;
<br>
<br>Something you should know:
<br>-It&apos;s pretty much impossible to describe this game without referring to a Tim Schafer game.  But I mean that in a good way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stick-it-to-the-man!/user-reviews?user_review_id=4857132">Expand</a></span>
