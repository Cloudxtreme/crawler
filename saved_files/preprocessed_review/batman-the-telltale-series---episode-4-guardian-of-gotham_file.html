While most of the choices don&apos;t have much of a impact it still gives the player freedom that the absence of free moving gameplay leaves. This could be the last great 360 game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series---episode-4-guardian-of-gotham/user-reviews?user_review_id=6832075">Expand</a></span>

The characters are presented differently than before. This universe has been reused so many times by so many games and movies, that it is really hard to somehow make the backstory fresh, but Telltale handles it pretty well, in my opinion. Just as an example (which is not a spoiler)- Oz Cobblepot is a skinny tall person and not a fat, short one as presented in many comics and other entertainments. The story itself is also pretty good, but in the beginning it&apos;s quite slow, however by the end it actually gets more and more interesting and so I caught myself wanting to play more of the game and see the ending. The gameplay is also good, the combat is really good, but I can&apos;t compare it to other telltale games, since I didn&apos;t play any except this one. Your choices don&apos;t matter as much as expected. The outcome of the situation is still the same, unless it is a big choice, which is mostly who to go to save and go as Batman or Bruce Wayne
<br>
<br>Overall: The game is really good and with Episode 1 free, I think you should try it out, but consider the first episode to be one of those mediocre pilots, so if you won&apos;t like the pilot, there is no guarantee that you won&apos;t like the full game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series---episode-4-guardian-of-gotham/user-reviews?user_review_id=6914068">Expand</a></span>
