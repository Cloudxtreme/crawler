Great story, great gameplay, great soundtrack and great characters what more could you ask for? Though it falls a bit short of a masterpiece, it&apos;s still is an amazing game in it&apos;s own right and any JRPG fan should play it asap. The HD remaster is worth purchasing if you haven&apos;t played the original game, the visuals are considerably better than the original PC release though unfortunately the visuals were never a stand out feature of the game. If you already own the game on Dreamcast, there is little point in getting this. However if you own the PS2 or original PC release it is worth it for the visual upgrade and bug fixes. Ultimately it is the best version to date and if you&apos;re looking to pick this game up, you can&apos;t go far wrong with this version. The game also comes with Japanese voices, full controller support and an extra difficulty level which was desperately needed as the original game was too easy. Overall Grandia 2 Anniversarry is the definitive Grandia 2 experience and is basically identical to the original Dreamcast version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grandia-ii-anniversary-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5431039">Expand</a></span>
