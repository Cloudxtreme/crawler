I like how simple, independent games like these always manage to get me to sink many more hours into it than any of the higher budget titles that are out.
<br>Unlike most shooters out, Payday forces you to play realistically. Your goal is not to rack up a body count, but to perform a heist. When a Rambo tries to run into the open, and play the bad-ass, they end up getting horribly raped, arrested, and then left behind as his teammates progress through the stage. The game just has a really intense feel as you yell at civilians to drop to the floor and shoot out surveillance cameras in preparation for police arrival.
<br>I have seen quite a few complaints about the AI being &apos;too sentry,&apos; but imo, it is very realistic. The task force units feel professional and trained as I would expect any officer charging into a bank heist, or general hostage situation, would be. However, they are quite careless about shooting around civilians and you will often find yourself feeling like you are trying to save innocents from a reckless police riot.
<br>Overall, this game is soo good I bought it twice. Once for PS3, and once for PC. The only reason I do not give this game a perfect score is because, regardless of how good it is, it could have been better. I would like to have seen more content in the game, and could come up with a huge list of easily implemented ideas that would have heavily deepened the game-play. Also, this game does not hold your hand. It took me too long to figure out how to access and change my progression tree. Many game features you may only discover through playing with others, such as hostage negotiations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=3181726">Expand</a></span>

If your looking for a thrilling game that will keep your heart beating rapidly as you try to escape the police, this game is for you. For the PC the controls are a little quirky which gets kind of annoying. After you play this game you will feel that you want to rob a bank, trust me. If your getting this for $20 (which is it&apos;s retail price), then it&apos;s totally worth it. This is a MAJOR break from Old, Boring, Call of Duty. This game is also very fast paced so you need some quick reactions, now I don&apos;t mean Call of Duty quick reactions like dropshooting or anything like that just plain out REAL reactions. This game is fabulous. I HIGHLY recommend this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2702711">Expand</a></span>

Bottom line_ get the game. It is very unknown and underscored, but believe me, It is one of the best FPS experiences I ever played that have had a somewhat low score. ( Killing Floor). Trust me, at the price this game is at, It&apos;s like Robbery.

There is alot to unlock, such as upgrades and new weapons. Personally i think that this is always a good thing, and to any fps gamer out there i think this is a great addition for your shelf. First off the graphics, they are pretty nice, not the best compared to the ones you can find in call of duty and battelfield, but in those games you don&apos;t get to hold hostages and rob banks. Gameply is like any other hybrid shooter, and in a way a bit like Call of Duty but it&apos;s gameplay is pretty linear. Find the objectives, kill cops and keep hostages, break into something or escort someone, and then hold out until you get to the final objecives. More and more cops keep piling at your doorstep and the AI is terrible, but that&apos;s why they have multiplayer, with 3 other friends you will have so much fun  you won&apos;t come out of your room for 3 days. Difficulty is also a great thing, you can be a n00b and play on easy and normal, or become a pro and start out playing on hard and overkill (overkill 145+ is your level 145) and it rewards you alot of cash, literally cash. Cash is used to level up with, levels are called rep and there are 145 levels (193 if you have the dlc) and there is alot to unlock. Masks are also a neat feature, you have your basic clown masks but there are a ton more to collect, sadly there are some you can&apos;t get anymore. This game is defiently worth buying and you should not hesistate to buy, but get a friend or to aswell, cuz AI sucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=3113408">Expand</a></span>

Its similar to left for dead some people argue to similar. Well whats funny about that is I actually am one of the few people who hated L4D and have never even touched lf4d 2 and I love payday. I guess its because of the heisting and fighting police instead of zombies and super zombies. Now there are special police units but they are rare and only 1 of them is silly the bulldozers. The game is fast paced and fun especially with other people and probably a blast playing with people you actually know which sadly I have not yet to experience. The game has a level up perk system that rewards new weapons and passive perks for the 3 categories. This is a good incentive to keep playing to reach level cap and get all the weapons and upgrades. You can also earn new masks.
<br>
<br>Every game has a downside. For me yes sometimes the cops are way too precise and numerous at the same time. When you have super troopers, swat breathing down your neck and they seem to never miss unless your completely behind cover it can be quite unrealistic and frustrating. By the end of the day you slay waves and waves hundreds of cops which is kind of dumb. Theres only 2 missions where finesse can even be applied and without perfection you will still end up fighting for your life.
<br>
<br>Another thing that bothers me is the lack of missions. There is 7 by default and the 7th is inspired by left for dead and is about stealing blood and breaking into the icu which is weird. The other missions are run and gun or hold the fort heists about hacking or stowing gold.
<br>
<br>The only actual heist mission is the first world bank where you actually rob a bank and then escape.
<br>
<br>There actually are not that many weapons either. Shotgun, mini shotgun, 3 pistols, a rifle, an full auto rifle, a heavy machine gun and trip mines.
<br>
<br>The dlc adds a new class and weapons and upgrades and more levels but its ten dollars just for 2 more heists and some more levels so I do not feel that its worth it especially with the low online population for the game at this current time.
<br>
<br>Of course the sequel is right around the corner and promises to deliver x 10 more and be what the original should be. Despite that this first payday is a fun co op experience that requires teamwork to outlast those dang police trying to halt your payday and put you into custody.
<br>
<br>You can trade hostages for captured team mates which is great but the police always try to rescue hostages so you cannot and you cant take hostages with you  you can only tie them down with limited cable ties and hostages cannot be used for anything else like delaying a police assault.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160521">Expand</a></span>

But just how I thanked the developers, I also curse you. This is because I can tell that it was unfinished. So much more could have been added to this game. Customization for example would be great. Also starting out between two weapons would be better then just giving you a gun and saying here. I&apos;m glad that in Payday 2 they added the customization and no I am not dissing the game just because I am comparing it to Payday 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=3425280">Expand</a></span>

It features a 4 player co-op mode in six different heists (two more if you have the Wolfpack DLC). It features a level-up perk system that differs from Call of Duty&apos;s because you choose which of the three (four with Wolfpack) trees you level up. The max level without the DLC is 145, and it gets up to 193 with the purchase of Wolfpack (9.99$). You couldn&apos;t call Payday&apos;s graphics &quot;amazing&quot;, but they are decent and enjoyable. Its fast pace is extremely captivating, when you have dozens of police officers marching at you at once. It&apos;s also a good feeling to be on the bad side for once. There are very little bugs (I haven&apos;t encountered any myself), and the heists aren&apos;t linear, they can change at several points (for example the game randomly decides whether the helicopter driver throws the C4 at the building&apos;s roof or in the back alley, etc.), and they all feel realistic and well-thought. Every heist is unique. The only thing that is bad with this game is that the AI can sometimes glitch out, making the officers just stand and do nothing. That happens rarely and they start moving after 2-3 seconds or after you shoot them. Overall, this game is fun, it&apos;ll take you some time to get to the max level (you can reset levels if you want to start from scratch again), it features unlockable masks which is also a pretty good system of customization and it costs mere 19.99$. You should definitely get it, and if you liked Left 4 Dead, this game is pretty similar to it, but with more diversity and a different setting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2760306">Expand</a></span>

Hopefully that&apos;s something that can be easily changed but it&apos;s only a minor problem as once you&apos;re in game it&apos;s forgotten.    The 9 is because WOW what a adrenaline rush. I installed the game expecting a bit of a left 4 dead clone (I mean come on who didn&apos;t) joined a hard game and about 20 seconds in was already down and cuffed. second time round we managed to get a bit further but it wasn&apos;t till I was in a good team that it started coming together. This game is hard and it is intense. Team work and 3 people who know what they are doing is absolutely essential on anything other than easy. The levels are all very unique from each other ranging from bankjobs to freeing prisoners from prison transports all of which require very different tactics. The skill progression is nice as well and makes you think &quot;maybe I&apos;ll come back to this level on a higher difficulty once I&apos;ve unlocked that&quot;. Graphically it is nice to look at and it all feels like you are a part of a bigger place and as a previous reviewer said they are clean. And the music track complements the gameplay perfectly with just the right amount of tension to really get the blood pumping. Overall Overkill software have managed to take the intensity of a game like left 4 dead&apos;s most nail biting moments and extended them to create something that never lets up and just keeps coming at you. Also everyone has guns aimed at YOU.<br><br>PS vochaisl If you are going to give a 0 please give a justification other than &quot;it sucks&quot; cos otherwise you are just trolling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=1803454">Expand</a></span>

At the end I bought it, because a friend had it and he said it was a good game. OH MY GOD, after I played it an hour I realised how awesome this game is. The idea of doing heists is just a very good idea for a game. Fortunately, there is an AI-Director like in l4d2, that means that everytime, the situation will be different (for example the bank manager will be at another place etc.) Also, if you kill civilians, more cops will come (and stronger types of cops, such as SWAT or special units). That means that the heists will never get boring. The gameplay is exactly what you want from a FPS, the weapons feel great and the controls are precise. There are also level ups (you can unlock weapons, perks etc), some kind of perks (you can choose between ammo bag or health bag or you can choose between having more ammo or being stronger for example). This class thing is also important, since you really need to work together and have a good plan. The game is quite challenging, so coop teamwork is essential. Because you have to work together its very fun and tactical, especially if you play with friends. The best thing is, that it only costs 20 bucks. The only contra thing I have is, that the upgrade stuff isnt explain very good (you have to press tab while in the game, and choose the class you want  to upgrade in the next level up). The graphics arent exactly crysis, but they look good (in my opinion). Finally I can only say, if you are tired of all these military FPS or just want to experience something unique in FPS or love movies like heat or the town or just want to play a great game, then go and buy payday.

With all of the replayability, upgrade progression and fun to be had with your friends the price tag is more than reasonable. The team themselves have said they will be continuing to support, patch and provide DLC for the game so there is a stage for even more fun to come in the future. As it stands, this modestly priced game is still the most fun co-op experience I&apos;ve had in a long time - there is something special to be said about robbing a bank and hearing your friends saying &quot;Start the heist&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m going to tie up the bank manager&quot; that brings an extra level of excitement to the game, especially with the very cool, well placed soundtrack that adds to the tension in the background. The levels are frantic even on easy as they throw hundreds of cops at you to get the adrenaline pumping as you make your way through the objectives.<br>-----------------------------------------<br>In depth: The video options are incredibly bare, only allowing you to select the resolution and brightness you wish to play with. It has been stated that advanced settings will be patched in which is good to hear but possibly this is something that should have been included from launch on a PC title and not an afterthought. The graphics are not the the pinnacle of 2011 gaming but they aren&apos;t bad either. When the gameplay and price are as good as they are, you can definitely overlook the graphics imperfections. The upgrade system is not explained even a little bit and that in itself is slightly strange, as is the the way the upgrade system itself works. The customisation and upgrade process is rather hefty and it will be very confusing for every new player due to the lack of explanation.<br><br>As for the actual gameplay, Payday ships with 6 maps which you can play co-operatively with friends, AI or you can play solo. They are not scaled around the number of people playing though so with more human players you should be able to crank the difficulty higher rather soon but playing solo or with just one buddy will mean you have to stick with easy-normal. The friendly AI is tremendously dumb and they only serve as cannon fodder and turrets with unlimited ammo - they will not contribute to the objective at hand and they will not drop any equipment items ie. Ammo/medic bags which can prove very frustrating. The co-op AI are good group fillers though; if you just want to play with a couple of friends and don&apos;t want to have to bring in a random player. On the other side of the AI-coin, the law enforcers are a lot better and more intelligent. They make interesting decisions and use different entry points to form attacks from different directions and as such no 2 heists will be identical.. They will free hostages, dive for cover when under fire and get more hesitant when you destroy CCTV cameras. There are also &quot;Special&quot; enemies just like in Left For Dead although these tend not to try and eat you. The special enemies you will face are snipers, shields, tasers, cloakers and bulldozers. They each have something unique about them and require a different approach to take them down for your crew to overcome the odds.<br><br>On the subject of the maps, they appear to be made in brackets. There are 4 difficulty levels to choose from (Easy, Normal, Hard, OVERKILL) and 2 have a minimum difficulty of Easy, 2 a minimum difficulty of Normal and 2 have a minimum difficulty of Hard.<br>The gunplay is good, but not perfect. There is no gore (so no loss of limbs when up close with a shotgun), no ragdoll effects (death animations are scripted and do not react to where you shot them) and the sound effects are punchy but not quite as perfect as in Killing Floor. The weapons feel good though, they look different as you upgrade them and the differences in statistical upgrades are noticable.<br>The audio in Payday is interesting. The soundtrack fits very well, the guns sound good and the playable character voice acting is great. The sound effects set can set a very tense atmosphere. Sirens that sound like they are slowly getting closer, helicopters flying overhead, radio chatter, screams from civilians and all this backed with the tense soundtrack I mentioned just adds to the experience as a whole.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=1803476">Expand</a></span>

Payday: The Heist is a game completely about fighting off wave after wave of police, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not fun.<br>It really felt like Left 4 Dead, but in a good way. It seems like they got everything that Left 4 Dead did right and put it into a game about robbing banks, but it still felt like it could stand up on it&apos;s own. It didn&apos;t feel like a Left 4 Dead rip-off, it was it&apos;s own game, but it&apos;s always a pleasant surprise to see some of the things they&apos;ve taken from Left 4 Dead.<br>It can get extremely hectic at times, and you need patience during these moments to be able to complete it.<br>This game is a bold step towards the things that some governments would normally censor, like taking Civilians hostage or robbing banks, But I think this is a good thing.  Video games is media too. People who play Video Games are not all children. This game really does a good job of practically rubbing itself in the face of the Australian government and governments that are like that, and that is always a plus.<br>And for only $20 on STEAM, This is a really great deal.<br>I really wanted to rate this an 8.58/10, but Metacritic doesn&apos;t let me, so I&apos;m just rating it a 9 for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=1831315">Expand</a></span>

Get this game right now. Except for there only being 6 maps, this game is as good as any AAA $60 game out there. DEFINITELY worth 20.<br><br>The good things: Most of the game. It&apos;s only $20!! It has very solid shooting, about 15 different guns, 20-25 types of enemies including 4 special &apos;boss&apos; type enemies that are difficult to fight alone if your not careful. It has leveling, skills, &apos;perk&apos; type things, and requires teamwork to do well. It does only have 6 levels but they are all rather replayable. So far I have only gotten bored of one level, but the other 5 have no end in sight. Also, the hardest difficulty is actually really hard. Some games have an &apos;expert&apos; and it&apos;s somewhat hard, but a group of good people can easily beat it, but in this its a challange even with the best. Also, this game has very few bugs, and no major gamebreaking ones.<br><br>The bad: A few minor bugs, but nothing more annoying than some wall clipping, or getting stuck in a menu every once in a while. Only 6 levels, additional ones would be nice, again a really minor issue due to replayability. Voice chat cannot be bound to a key. It&apos;s either you have a mic in, and broadcast whenever you make noise, or you dont have a mic in at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=1803955">Expand</a></span>

Decent graphics that play very smoothy, gameplay is great, weapons are great. My only complaint is that it can be a bit tricky managing your ammo.. you can sometimes end up with no ammo at all and having your teammates needing to kill an enemy so you can pick up some of there ammo</span>

The action is fast-paced and definitely requires teamwork to complete the heists.  There are some cons in my opinion, which are keeping me from giving the game a higher score.  One is the multiplayer aspect and how it&apos;s set up.  It&apos;s archaic.  There are no dedicated servers, so every game is hosted by a user.  This can be frustrating as the host can just decide to kick you out whenever they feel like, and if the hosts quits/loses internet connection, the game is over.  This also means that you cannot join a game in progress.  There are some comparisons to Left 4 Dead in this game, but the way multiplayer server/hosting is set up really bothers me.  The other thing that irks me a bit is that there is six heists.  Ok not bad, but some of them can only be played on normal/hard/overkill.  Only two maps can be played on easy, which you almost have to play starting because you have little skills/upgrades.  I have a heck of time finding an easy game to jump into (since I am still low rank), and once you find if someone does like your name or rank they can just kick you before you the game even starts.  The last con for me is the graphics options.  Game really feels like a console port if you look here...there are none.  No advanced options to speak of, so if you do have a low end or high end pc, good luck with the settings.  OVERALL though I give the game a seven, because it is a fun game.  I recommend it, just wish they had dedicated servers and more graphic options.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=1850077">Expand</a></span>

In fact, if you&apos;ve ever watched the movie Heat, you have a good idea of what&apos;s in store. This game does require a lot of teamwork to win, since you usually have to rely on teammates for ammo drops in addition to covering your ass. The campaigns are a good length and there are several levels of difficulty providing a challenge for any level player. Tasers, riot shields, bulldozers, cloakers, and hostages give it a well-rounded feel. It does lack a decent tutorial and the campaign objectives are not always straightforward, but the community has been pretty friendly in lending a hand. There are also some minor nuisances and deficiencies, but overall it&apos;s worth a look.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2198041">Expand</a></span>

All the innovation in this generation has come from games like Minecraft, Mount and Blade, and Arma II.  But since these guys cant pay off the big game reviewers, the mainstream generally shrugs them off.  Rant aside, this game is great! you play as a team of 4 robbers in a co-op effort against waves of police officers in an effort to complete successful heists.  The game manages to pull off a cinematic quality that ive yet to see in a multiplayer game.  When you first walk into a bank you notice a sense of tranquility about to be shattered. It reminds me of the first moments of the Airport mission from Modern Warfare 2. This game succeeds in making you feel like the bad guy, but a pretty badass one at that.  Once you start to do battle with the bank guards and the bullets start flying, its complete pandemonium. Bullets shatter glass, computers, statues and...glass. lots of it.  Civillians scream and run as you scream at them to GET THE F*** ON THE GROUND! and handcuff them to prevent escape attempts.  Killing them is a no-no, you will need them to bargain with the police if they arrest any of your cohorts and will lose money if you kill one.  Waves of increasingly difficult enemy types will swarm the building, trying to rescue hostages and kill you and your buddies. This game gets hard, trust me on that, but if you have good buddies to play with it is an absolute blast.  Graphically the game is decent, but nothing breathtaking.  It looks like a game from 2007, but a nice looking one. Considering what Skyrim was able to get away with, theres nothing graphically wrong with it. The music in the game is dark and energetic, but pretty repetitive.  The Guns sound weak and weightless, and feel that way too. Reminds me of Left 4 Dead in that respect.  Also there are not enough weapons.  Beyond the basic shotgun, pistol, machine gun, assault rifle, sniper rifle etc. there is not much varation, which is a shame. I would love to test out some more weapons on the cops, who act like the brainless zombies in Left 4 Dead.  Also, a versus mode where one team played as law enforcement would be nice.  If you are looking for a game with nicely balanced weapons, competitive play and sharp graphics, this is not the game for you.  If you want a game that tries to reenact the stylish gunplay and tense moments of movies like Resivior Dogs in a multiplayer setting, then there is no better way to spend 20 dollars (i spent 10 dollars on it, for a steam sale)  I would normally give this game an 8.5 because of some of the flaws, but im just going to round it up because im looking forward to further output from this studio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=1979262">Expand</a></span>

The above average graphics,  good level design, and surprisingly good re-playability for some maps makes me less bothered about the downside of occasional dim-witted AI, although it isn&apos;t always the case. I think my favourite part of the game is when you can get into the diamond vault without alerting any guards just because most times the security box spawns prevent you from hacking in fast enough. This game is best played with good, INTELLIGENT friends, and teamwork is essential. The other option of team AI is good in some cases, but it takes them a while to come to you if you call out to them. If they make a sequel, I&apos;d like to see AI improvements mainly, but I would also like to see how they could fare in making missions have multiple endings, and not just one, with different paths to get to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2162442">Expand</a></span>

You get overrun so easily near the end of the levels and it turns into just praying u get lucky to beat the level without your teamates dieing and you get tazed to the ground by the cops and lose. The levels are doable, but freakin hard. I speak from my single player experience. Single player on easy is hard and normal is way hard. Ive played FPS games since wolfenstein back in the day, so im no noob ( COD series is a joke compared to this) ...anyways, its a fun game, hecktic, fast pased insanity, fighting waves of cops from all directions, back, front, building roofs, heli swat drops, windows, snipers, seems like from everwhere as you try to rob certain situations...god, ok well back at er i guess, just thought id take a break and write this review and go have a cig before trying again, one more time on this level before i stop for the evening. Havent played online yet, but i hope its alot easier (guess it depends on who you play with, but the AI in this are retards)  happy heisting fellas, hope ya get rich :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2520797">Expand</a></span>

That will change the way the police deals with you (though they will still be trying to headshot you from afar). In the first mission I played, we had to free a felon who was being freed from prison - under a heavy stream of bullets from SWAT. The way the target is finally liberated from the scenario, just before you have to run away from the place, is... Epic, to say the least.<br><br>I&apos;m giving a 9 because the menus could be more intuitive, and it could have more explanation about the leveling system.

The difficulty scales very well with the settings and overkill setting will make even a seasoned player like me struggle. New features have been added (for free) with every patch. The only real fault the game has is it relies on enemy ai which as anyone who&apos;s played these kind of games know, can do some weird things. It&apos; s easy to exploit the ai, making the hardest and most pivotal moments of the heists a cakewalk. But this really just comes down to the play style. Another fault would be the lack of heists/weapons/enemies but the dev&apos;s tell us more is already on the way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2065832">Expand</a></span>

<br>the missions are fun and the game is realistic you actually fell that you are robbing a bank or a jewelery store or something.
<br>the bad thing in the game is the number of the missions i would enjoy it more if it has more missions</span>

The screen shaking/&quot;jelly&quot;/red tint effects are really obnoxious and annoy the piss out of me. It feels like I should be taking the game a little more slowly and tactically, ala SWAT 4, but it is far more rewarding to just rush a stage down. I think the perks system is nice, but any EXP system that insists on restricting your vertical growth (leveling up one job) to promote horizontal growth (leveling up multiple jobs) sucks ass, even if it is minuscule. Picking up team mates who are bleeding out should restrict others from trying to assist the same person. Some of the map objectives feel extremely tedious and grating, like Heat Street.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2061997">Expand</a></span>

The police don&apos;t have the best ai but it&apos;s not the worst either, I never really was shocked at how they acted. The game makes up for the weakness of the ai with sheer numbers - some people may be unhappy with this design choice, but for me, in this game, it works just fine. I&apos;m not sure why the critic reviewers are bashing this game so much, but I am very happy with the purchase and think the 20 dollar price tag is a steal. for a game of this quality, I would have expected to pay 30 or 40. The only real downside in my mind is that there&apos;re only 6 different missions, but Overkill has stated that they&apos;ll be releasing more in dlc. Free would be nice, but paid is perfectly reasonable to me considering the low price of the base game. Get this game, play it, and give it a 10 when you realize that it&apos;s a lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=1815305">Expand</a></span>

In Overkill, you play as one of four professional criminals (Dallas, Wolf, Hoxton, Chains) through several fast action heists, raids, and cleanup operations that will test your teams cooperation as you&apos;re swarmed by SWAT and whatever tricks they have for you. While at first glance, mission selection seems limited, each one is completely different, and even if you&apos;ve played through it 100 times, there is NO guarantee of even completing the first objective. Some people have complained about the lack of visible timers on objectives (&quot;How long until that saw cuts through, there&apos;s F***ING SWAT EVERYWHERE!&quot;), but I think it really adds to the experience, especially when the saws and drills jam and the fires burn out. It really makes you hope your teammates arent pinned or lazy, otherwise, you&apos;ll end up having to run through hell and every kind of special unit in the map to fix it. Game-wise, it works somewhat similarly to Left 4 Dead. If you run out of health, you enter &quot;bleedout&quot; which means you&apos;re on the ground and can only use your pistol until someone helps you up. If no one does before the timer runs out, you&apos;re &quot;in custody&quot;. This is where Payday really shines in innovation. With the &quot;hostage&quot; system, you can take civilians, or even police if done right, as hostages. After a set time has passed, your teammates can trade one of their hostages for you. Be warned, though, you have to make the change manually, a.k.a. actually go to the selected hostage. So if it&apos;s a hostage you caught at the beginning of the heist, you may be nowhere near him/her when the trade is authorized. Just a warning. As for customization, you can&apos;t change any of the robbers appearances; Overkill said they didn&apos;t implement that feature to &quot;create a sense of identity in the robbers&quot;. Translation: We were too lazy to put customization in. However, as you complete heists, you can unlock weapons, perks, and special equipment from one of three trees: assault, sharpshooter, and support. Each time you &quot;level up&quot; or gain another reputation level, the tree you&apos;re currently focusing on (changeable at any time during the heist) also gains a level. You&apos;ll see as you play with higher level teammates that their playstyles are significantly different. Some may use the M308 and the Locomotive 12Ga.,which plays significantly different than one using the M308 and the Mark 11, and these are just weapon choices. You can have your own perks, like increased damage resistance, extra ammo or supplies, increased accuracy, faster reload, etc. Since its release, and the passing of &quot;First Week Syndrome&quot;, most of the bugs are fixed, but there still are some glaring ones. More than once, the cops have stopped in their tracks and will just wait there, not doing anything, even if you shoot them. This is hardly a copy of L4D, or any other game out there, and there is a learning curve that it seems those who rated this game poorly just lack the mental ability to learn. As for the rest of us, I say it&apos;s a good game, and for $20, it&apos;s (I&apos;m gonne say it) a steal. Pick it up now, and you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=1825017">Expand</a></span>

But it will always have a higher rating then MW2, for the exact reason that you still aren&apos;t allowed to kill civilians. And the cops are American. Let me say that again; a game where you&apos;re killing AMERICANS. Seems there&apos;s still hope for the game industry&apos;s maturing. But back to the game; some aspects do get in the way of a smooth experience for me. The gunplay seems a bit iffy, or hit-or-miss at best, the screen effects tend to get annoying, such as blood from a melee kill being mistaken for being wounded/directional damage/etc., and other things I just don&apos;t understand how to use. Once you take a hostage, what do you do with them? Leave them there? If you&apos;ve got a group of decent players, nobody will be captured so there&apos;s no need to bargain. If you could take the hostages with you, that&apos;d add to the dynamic. Other things, like the ability to take hostages, a quick command/spotting mechanic, multiple enemies, perks, the heist, dialog, and the very fact you&apos;re involved in a frigg&apos;n heist (how awesome is that?!) make it worth playing, but I&apos;m on the fence about calling it a good game. It&apos;s decent, but still has a few small issues to work out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2089334">Expand</a></span>

The main complaint I have with the game is that 50% of the time the enemies will function in a typical fashion, the other 50% of the time they will just sit there doing nothing.  Sometimes waves of enemies will shoot at you, other times they just remain in a passive state after spawning, sometimes entire rooms will be full of brain-dead enemies just sitting there, and when you shoot at them they still remain unresponsive.  This really killed it for me.  When everything works, the game is decent, but from my experience, that was only half of the time.  I cannot recommend the game because of this, regardless of price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2161322">Expand</a></span>

I could only play for 30 seconds because there is no support for controllers. It&apos;s very simple, enable controllers and I will give a perfect review.</span>

                                        <span>A great fun multiplayer game. Its like L4D, but more objective based and instead of zombies its police and SWAT. Also alot of fun to try and level up your person and get the cool weapons. Overall really fun, but it truly shines when your yelling with your friends to save you while your getting tazed or beat by someone out of Splinter Cell lol 8/10</span>

I&apos;m really glad with my purchase. For the price your paying you can&apos;t go wrong. As soon as I installed it, went straight into multiplayer so I could get the gist of things from other players. The moment I started it I could tell it was a decent game, with multiple ways to play it, tactical, guns blazing etc along with the fact the spawns are different every time so you can&apos;t just camp in certain places. My only criticism of this game is the fact it&apos;s not really newb friendly, but after the help of some friendly online players I understood everything a lot more and had a great experience with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=1986218">Expand</a></span>

The control is generally smooth and it plays great for a game at it&apos;s price range.</span>

Just get a better PC, then start rating games from year 2008 to 2012. As for the PayDay Heist review, I personally enjoyed the game. It is full of action and it keeps your mind on the go thinking of faster ways to get things done. Graphics are not as complex as some other first person shooter and its to be improved on. Gameplay? I think its great, especially when you are in a co-op game all four computers next to each another. It takes team cooperation to another whole new level. SINGLE PLAYER, the AI are intelligent, compared to the previously released Left 4 Dead 2. The AI&apos;s are more cooperative and more dependable. They don&apos;t do all the work, but yea, they got your back good. All in all, its a great game to get for just $20. Hey! and paying to rob a bank and not get yourself killed! Thats another point! :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2101673">Expand</a></span>

It can be played single player and that&apos;s definitely a good experience.  But it SHINES when you are playing with your mates.  I was telling a friend of mine that I really haven&apos;t had as fun with a shooter co-op game like this since the first time me and him played Left 4 Dead together years ago.
<br>
<br>Indeed, the game shines in multiplayer and in addition to being quick with a gun, it builds on the features we loved so much with Left 4 Dead.
<br>
<br>1) It has an experience system.  The more you play, the more perks you get.  Extra ammo bags, more zip ties, etc. In Left 4 Dead, the game became stale to us after 3 years of basically playing the same thing over and over with no real difference.  In this game, we&apos;re always trying to better our experience ratings and it&apos;s not a grind at all, merely a byproduct of enjoying the game with only adds to the overall experience.
<br>
<br>2) The mission system is perhaps one of the best I&apos;ve seen.  Not overly complicated but not as dull as &quot;press the button, now live through a horde attack&quot;.  Truthfully, at first this kind of annoyed us as some portions of the mission send you all over the map to perform various tasks, but after a few hours we got really into it and after a while of playing the game, I simply don&apos;t know how we did without it before.
<br>
<br>3) The enemies fire back!  i.e. the AI in this game is fantastic!  There are various difficulty modes and it does what it says on the tin.  The easy modes are easy, but train you to better play the game.  The normal difficulty is great after you&apos;ve learned how to play the game.  The hard modes are absolutely a blast to try with your mates just for giggles to see how badly you get creamed by the enemy.  4) Replay value - you get your money&apos;s worth with this game!  The day L4D 1 and 2 came out we had beaten each level many times within the first day.  After that there wasn&apos;t really anything new to do and we continued to play because we loved the randomness of it.  This game is noticeably more difficult but in a fun way.  Each map has a good 30 minutes worth of enjoyment and often times starting out it&apos;s very difficult to even complete the level without dying or being arrested.
<br>
<br>This game is definitely one I&apos;d recommend to those who absolutely loved the Left 4 Dead series (people that like having fun and don&apos;t particularly enjoy hating life) but couldn&apos;t get into something like Dead Island or Borderlands due to those game&apos;s inherent RPG elements being both needless, bland and irritating to deal with as they feel tacked on.  In Payday the Heist, the leveling system is very much streamlined so you&apos;ve not constantly fidgeting with grossly misplaced tasks like repairing weapons or leveling up a skill tree.  In a shooter I find RPG systems to be completely out of place, sucking out the fast paced intensity that provided all the fun from shooters.  Buy this game now, get your friends to buy it (or gift it to them) and thank me later.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2528828">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>a very generic 4player coop shooter like l4d. However you will be shooting cops and robbing banks. The devs put extra effort in it by adding another layer of progression system. I do say it an upgraded version of kane and lynch bank heist. However i just prefer the appoarch kane and lynch2 did with its over and down system.</span>

The community also seems pretty cool.  If I had anything to gripe about, I&apos;d like to see more missions, as it only comes with six.  Occasionally Amazon will run it for $5.00 - $7.49.  Purchase the game download and activate your CD key using Steam.  You will still get all your Steam achievements. Good way to save money on such a great game.  I give it a 9.5.

I think its a good idea with poor execution. I was looking for something akin to Kane and Lynch bank mode but this is pretty far from it.    Alright here come my gripes. The controls feel loose and floaty, there is no bullet penetration, theres only one path to take, you cant pick up or use weapons you didnt enter a mission with, and the AI is far from intelligent. I got bored restarting this or that eight times in a row just to stretch out a mission.    On the plus side there is huge potential for multiplayer fun, the unique units add something different aspects to standard shooting, and it was only 20 bucks so i dont feel like I lost too much.    Overall I wouldnt recommend unless your just looking for L4D in tighter spaces with worse spawns but like I said I never did get to play multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=1819500">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gameplay score is pure 10!!! I&apos;m giving 8 only because bad graphics and too less maps which make game repetitive. Don&apos;t be fooled with bad graphics! This game is deserved to be played!</span>

To be fair, it is just like Left 4 Dead. Just as a blatant rip off with no improvement or adaption.
<br>
<br>See, in Left 4 Dead you have objectives to survive in a linear level and occasionally you have to fight off hordes of zombies while watching out for special zombies that can make your day even worse. If you get incapacitated you hope your teammates can pick you up further down and you get to rejoin the fun.
<br>
<br>In Payday, you have objectives to survive in a linear level and occasionally you have to fight off hordes of police while watching out for special police that can make your day even worse. If you get incapacitated you hope your teammates can trade a hostage further down and you get to rejoin the fun.
<br>
<br>If it seems I cut and paste that last paragraph, no worries, that is exactly what the developers did for the game mechanics. Instead of having zombies, you have brain dead hordes of police to gun down. Well done aptly named Overkill Software. Occasionally you have to deal with special police forces such as the martial arts &apos;smoker&apos; or the one hit wonder &apos;bulldozer&apos;. These are the police equivalents of the &apos;hunter&apos; and &apos;tank&apos; zombies respectably.
<br>
<br>There is a problem here though. First off, as you would imagine, everyone has a gun.So the developers put in a &apos;recovering shield&apos; system on top of a normal health point pool. This makes it a cover game. The problem of this is that in a cover game usually you then have the ability to lean out of cover, usually considered a standard feature. It is sorely missing from this game however, which forces you and your teammates to leave cover.
<br>
<br>This brings me to the next problem. Every cop is a marksman in automatic fire, uses automatic weapons, and is perfectly willing to shoot up a room to kill you. While that might tie into real life where police need to be proficient marksman, you however as the crook seem to have higher morals then the police since you get heavy penalties if you so much as graze a civilian. Said civilians loving to jump up and run into the line of fire. I felt as a criminal more of the protector of these poor AI imbeciles having to constantly tell them to stay down so that my teammates, the police, or myself didn&apos;t accidentally shoot them. Add onto this the police&apos;s ability to shoot at you from across the map without fail and no good way to tell where the fire is coming from.
<br>
<br>Speaking of AI imbeciles, don&apos;t even bother trying to play this game by yourself. Just like in Left 4 Dead you will have to do all the objectives yourself. But considering all the AI has to do in a zombie game is just shoot the zombies, having basic AI can be forgiven. In Payday you need to do things like set up drills that will constantly jam. This forces you to run over and spend several seconds unjamming it so it can finish up the five minute countdown before you get to the next objective. This SHOULD have been something you could tell either an AI or human player to do, or just have the AI do automatically. But it doesn&apos;t which gives a solo player more of a workload besides being the only human player in a town with more cops then a police state apparently.
<br>
<br>Overall, this could have been an interesting game. Had the AI for everyone been better, the objectives not tedious, the slew of reality flaws, and it not being a blatant rip off of another game just with guns this game could have been good. But it is only a year and some months  old and it feels even more dated then that. Save your $20 and the $10 for the dlc and buy something else, like maybe the better Left 4 Dead. If there was a way to get money back from steam for this, I would.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=3152459">Expand</a></span>

You are cocentrating on your objective and you&#xB4;re really into that &quot;I can play the bad guys&quot; setting.
<br>But, and its the same in every mission, after you set up a saw, for example, to break a door, which takes about 5 minutes which is ridiculous enough to break a door...., the bad thing begins.
<br>
<br>From now on, that game is about to shoot. And kill. And shoot. And kill. I could continue. All you have to do is to shoot the police, which is extremely boring, the game tells you like &quot; forget about your objective, just shoot as many cops as you can&quot;.
<br>After you did that, and the door finally got open, you have to break another door, of course you have to wait 5 minutes again and shoot as many cops as possible. Bad thing is, the shootings are not really spectacular. Graphics are kinda boring and dusty, gameplay is ultra 08 / 15.
<br>
<br>All in all, I am really dissappointed with that game.
<br>It starts very promissing, you try to get into the story, but after a minute, all you have to do is shoot shoot shoot and forget about anything else. Wow, sometimes you have to reset the saw, lol.
<br>I would N O T recommend it to buy, unless you want uninspired 08/15 shooting, but in that genre, there are 100 games out there who make it betther.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544659">Expand</a></span>

You can tell the game was designed to be &apos;Action Packed&apos;, every moment on the edge of your seat! However the outcome is not like that at all, it is just a grind through shooting police officers, and telling hostages to stay on the floor while you wait for task X to complete. The cops just keep coming, so killing them doesnt really give any gratitude, it just feels like a waste of bullets. For a game entirely based on shooting, you dont have much ammo, which some people might think makes it more challenging, but they are wrong, it just makes the whole thing stale, and makes you feel guilty for doing the very thing the game revolves around; shooting.
<br>
<br>Then there&apos;s the AI.... the AI is just rediculously bad, it is programmed as if it was a noob cheating on an fps game with an aimbot, literally as soon as a pixel of your body is out of cover 5 bullets are hitting it, its really frustrating because when you get hit it blurs your vision and you cant see the shooter, and so your forced back into cover, I found the easiest way to actually down police officers is to take advantage of nooks and crannys to shoot them, like the gap between a door and the frame, because the AI doesnt seem to see you there, however that just also takes the fun out, because then it&apos;s just a case of shooting a completely dumbass unreactive AI, and its then too easy. I gave it a 4, because I admire the idea, and it is obvious alot of effort went into the game. I also didnt pay much for the game, got it in the steam sale for a fiver, and to be honest... the fiver feels like a bit of a waste on it... It&apos;s just not that much fun to play...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2703581">Expand</a></span>

I personally found the aiming on the assault rifle to be terrible - specifically the iron sights (I see no option to turn it off either) which blocks pretty much everything your shooting at with your own gun. I&apos;ve played other games with iron sights that didn&apos;t feel like this. You spend most of the time waiting and fighting off hordes of cops.

It&apos;s described as &quot;executing dynamic heists&quot;, but you&apos;re not &quot;executing&quot; anything; the heist is merely the backdrop,  a story to an on-rails shooter where you shoot wave after wave cops and security personal in the head(or waste ammo on weaker hit-boxes). And that&apos;s what you do, move shooting guys in the head, stop, shoot more guys, move again shooting guys. Someone was right to describe it as left 4 dead, but with a different theme, but l4d&apos;s single player and coop bored me after I&apos;d done everything on expert, but at least that backdrop was compelling, as were the characters, and the scenery and graphics interesting. This has no real interesting story or narrative or characters on rails that makes you want to play for that, and the gameplay is pretty dumb for a game these days. The hitboxes are simply and easy, and it takes a while to unlock any interesting weapons, which don&apos;t change the game much, except like the grenade launcher maybe make the game stupid easy, and this game doesn&apos;t need anymore brain dead elements. My friends gushed over it during the last free weekend  (before the one at the time of me writing this) when I played it, and was bored before we were done the first run through, so I don&apos;t see the &quot;endless replay&quot; value they boast. But I guess any sense of a real game is gone from this generation. Just so you know what kind of gamers were talking about here, they have some of the most hours on l4d games, but complained about lack of &quot;realism&quot; in l4d2 (huh? who cares?) and despise the multiplayer...probably because they are so bad at it. So yeah, if you like games with no real variety or challenge, that you could probably finish smashing your face on the keyboard (what I was eventually doing for the weekend I was roped into playing this with those friends) Payday might be the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=2702575">Expand</a></span>

<br>Too few lvl.s  too stupid AI   Drills getting stuck entire time  maybe next time dont buy a chinese copy .
<br>Ugly graphics  Crappy movement   Guns unrealistic  M4 shoots its mag to empty in 1-2 sec like it&apos;s shooting 2000 rpm .
<br>Every police is a sniper even with shotguns  police shooting you through cars and spawning behind you or next to you .
<br>Police running through walls &amp; sometimes bugging out
<br>Taser police  really   after you shot like 100 cops they sent in a police with taser  ......................-.-
<br>
<br>TLDR  Buy a COD instead  this is just its little brother that tryes to be a bank robbery game but fails in it hard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=3185524">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Wow, this game is a complete waste of money, seriously! I really thought this would be a game with strategy where you can choose to rob a bank silently or with gunpower. Sadly the whole is just shooting police and killing thousands of them. no strategy at all just simple grinding and shooting. also pretty bugged.

It borrows a whole hell of a lot from Left 4 Dead and benefits greatly from it, delivering the same kind of intense, cooperative experience. It&apos;s a small game and it won&apos;t take you long to finish all the heists at least once, but you will find yourself playing them several times over thanks to the challenge, randomized elements and progression system.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/payday-the-heist/user-reviews?user_review_id=6508023">Expand</a></span>
