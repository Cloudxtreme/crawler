The music/sound was incredible (but too good for this game, kinda like the movie &quot;FM&quot;). I think this game had a LOT of potential but most of it was ruined by the dialogue/story text. Whoever wrote these little gems was obviously a hipster trying WAY too hard to be &quot;ironic&quot;. For example, your character is walking through a lush forest next to a beautifully reflective lake with Guthrie&apos;s soothing sounds setting the mood and you come across a man chopping wood. The dialogue box pops up and says something like, &quot;Woodmanbro thinks you are like, totally rad, bro.&quot; This continues for pretty much any dialogue/story text you will encounter. I played until a little ways into part 3 (there are 4 parts to the game, so a little over halfway) before I just couldn&apos;t stand it anymore. Every time I would start to really get into the game and the atmosphere created by Guthrie something else would pop up and ruin it with more hipster buzzword garbage, so I guess it&apos;s really no surprise that the game asks you to post every inane bit of dialogue you encounter to that other bastion of hipsterism - twitter. I suppose it&apos;s supposed to be &quot;ironic&quot; that they just don&apos;t care enough to create real story text, but really it&apos;s just annoying and makes the game feel unfinished, like the developers gave the game to their 16 year old brother and asked him to write the dialogue. The developers should go back and play the old Sierra classic Hero&apos;s Quest (also known as Quest for Glory) for examples of story text that are cute/funny/campy without being horribly overdone, painfully &quot;ironic&quot; and ruining the mood of the game.
<br>
<br>Also, the Zelda triforce ripoff just felt like more hipster B.S. - &quot;HAY HAY WE PLAYED ZELDA AND MADE A TOTALLY TOO-OBVIOUS REFERENCE TO IT ISN&apos;T THAT COOL/FUNNY/IRONIC BRO?!!!&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2451948">Expand</a></span>

The pacing, humor, art and music are all top notch. I went into the game not knowing what to expect at all, and came away more than a little pleasantly surprised. The tongue-in-cheek humor is endearing, and the plot takes on the abstract, dream-like qualities of absurdity and non sequitur. The puzzles are not difficult, and the trekking involved to travel were not long enough to instill boredom. I really enjoyed and was satisfied with my playthrough.
<br>
<br>That being said, the game is really defined by its atmosphere. This isn&apos;t a stat-grinding RPG or a twitch-reflex FPS game. It&apos;s not a timed-jump requisite plat former or a strategy game that takes great mental acuity and focus before every move. I&apos;d say it&apos;s much more similar to games like Machinarium or Monkey Island, but with an immersive atmosphere much more akin to Zork or Conan the Barbarian, though not quite as deep.
<br>
<br>I find it very odd that many reviewers were off-put by the postmodernism and absurdism present within the game in 2012. Hipster-paranoia has apparently reached such heights that any sort of pastiche at all can no longer just be appreciated. Or even worse, there is the case where a reviewer can&apos;t simply accept that it just isn&apos;t their type of game and flings meaningless insults. There are games that fit the niches stated in the above paragraph. This isn&apos;t one of those, and that&apos;s part of what made it so refreshing to play, obscure etymology jokes, oblique fantasy references and all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2752783">Expand</a></span>

However, it&apos;s weighed down by inane &quot;quirkiness&quot; through frequent outdated 90s lingo and overt Legend of Zelda influence (I mean, spoiler alert, you fight the pieces of the triforce in the same manner that you fight Ganon at the end of Ocarina of Time). This problem is shoved further down your throat as the game constantly reminds you that you can tweet every single phrase they put up on your screen. If you can ignore the niggling feeling that you&apos;re playing a game for hipsters, you&apos;ll find this game very rewarding in it&apos;s own unique way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2566918">Expand</a></span>

This feels like a prototype game concept which is ready to be fleshed out into an actual game, only they skipped that and just decided to release it.  I think most of the rave reviews are from people sucked in by how hard the creators tried to set it apart from a cliche fantasy/adventure/puzzle game and are overly impressed with its originality.  There is very little depth to this game aside from there being a dream world mirror of the real world and the connection with the moon (I won&apos;t give away what).  The game is otherwise completely linear.  When you remove the nearly funny, vague stylistic narration, there&apos;s really not much to the story.  Seriously, move along, this is not worth your time if it was free.  Points for a great concept only.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=3262172">Expand</a></span>

The setting, too, was fairly interesting to me, if only for the fact that you play as a Scythian.  Then, what&apos;s not so great: the controls are bad with a mouse.  It&apos;s very obviously meant for touchscreen devices, and minimal effort was made to port things like the battle interface to PC controls.  It&apos;s slow.  Now, I&apos;ve played adventure games.  I love Riven, and that game has about three puzzles in the entire game.  Slow-paced is one thing, but this is just slow.  It&apos;s atmospheric, sure, but without solid direction, it can be difficult to know what you&apos;re meant to do at points.  Its tone is very poor.  It tries to be half-epic, but covers its own ass by ensuring just about everything shifts into an ironically modern tone halfway through.  I could see this working as a distinction between reality and the dream world, and that could have strengthened the theme even more, but that&apos;s not the case.  And so, finally to the whale in the room: it&apos;s got Twitter integration.  Everything you read is packaged as a tweet, and can easily be tweeted onto your own Twitter account.   On some level, writing 140 character-long snippets of exposition is an artistic exercise of sorts, and if that was all, I wouldn&apos;t feel too strongly about it.  I might even like it.  But the way that it was used here, with that smarmy ironic writing, not only was enough to disrupt my immersion in the game world pretty harshly, but it came off as being far too confident of their own damn writing, that they wanted every bit of it to be able to be shared.  So points for art/music design, atmosphere, story as a whole, points off for writing, Twitter crap, overconfidence, and poor gameplay design/port job.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2507153">Expand</a></span>

If I was rating based on aesthetics alone, my score would be much higher. However, as a gameplay experience, Sword and Sorcery is dull at its best moments and deeply frustrating at its worst. The puzzles seem to rely predominantly on guesswork, and on more than one occasion I found myself randomly clicking around the screen trying to move the story forward (this may say more about my own intelligence than the quality of the game, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;m the only person to raise this complaint). I do hope these developers stay in the business, as I think they have the potential to make something truly special.

Simple gameplay that becomes repetitive and requires no skill (simply spam the button); nonsensical puzzles and plenty of walking and backtracking over and over through the same areas in a very small world. Far too little game here, and what there is isn&apos;t well executed.  Why the &apos;perfect&apos; reviews then?  Because  an indie game, with 8-bit style graphics, an atmospheric soundtrack, topped with snarky dialogue.  Hipster &apos;gamers&apos; rejoice, your checklist is fulfilled.  Too bad gameplay isn&apos;t on the list.

I&apos;d still recommend a playthrough though, as it&apos;s a pretty cheap and cheerful diversion. I had some fun with it, but mainly due to the presentation and not the gameplay.

The world and story (which are important to a point-and-click adventure) are nothing beyond the basal, formulaic medieval fantasy hero stuff.  The gameplay is pretty much disconnected from everything about the story, apart from how succeeding moves the narrative along, and amounts to quicktime event combat and simple shape-based puzzles.  The world is very nice to look at when zoomed out, but turns into just a bunch of garbled, chunky pixels when you&apos;re up close interacting with just about anything.  It&apos;s also very pretentious, in the most intimate sense.  It actively just masturbates all over you as you play by pretending that its simple, mindless elements are actually worth giving a damn about with unfittingly sarcastic writing and this annoying guy who pops up in between chapters just spewing mostly nonsense.  The only good quality about the game is its soundtrack, which is better off bought on its own, if that&apos;s at all possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2491115">Expand</a></span>

With a fantastic soundtrack from Jim Guthrie and amazing 8-bit graphics, complete with cute little sprites for the small yet memorable cast of characters, this game, if anything, is a treat for your senses. The fact that it is a port from  iOS is apparent, as a lot of the gameplay involves point and click, and different &quot;swiping&quot; methods used to advance in the plot. Speaking of the plot, it&apos;s highly unorthodox (as one would expect from an indie game), much of it coming from pop up text boxes featuring humorous and odd messages (&quot;We had bridged the chasm &amp; we felt super smart&quot; or &quot;We spied the solitary grave at the edge of The Perilous Precipice &amp; we wondered what was up with that.&quot;), or from equally entertaining thoughts projected from the characters via mind reading Megatome. The game is not without its faults, though, as it is infuriating to be asked to tweet every message that comes up via the in-game Twitter support. One mechanic comes to mind, too, that involves waiting for the phases of the moon to advance (although this is a very neat aspect of the game, and can be worked around with some cleverness).
<br>
<br>All-in-all, Superbrothers: Swords and Sorcery is a neat, quirky point and click adventure with fantastic visuals and a breathtaking soundtrack. Even if the gameplay itself can be lacking and involves mildly annoying features, it&apos;s a must try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2588006">Expand</a></span>

What does that mean? It means to play it you have to give yourself whole to the game and immerse into the world although it doesn&apos;t even has a tutorial... that&apos;s part of the voyage and the discovery.
<br>
<br>Beautiful -8 bits-like graphics that leave a lot of details to be filled by your imagination is something some young gamers won&apos;t understand, and intuitive try and try again gameplay and controls can be frustrating for those who wants to know everything right now. But everything clicks into place very quickly and you&apos;ll be able to breeze through it in no time.
<br>
<br>Non-complex gameplay is intended to enjoy the experience... this is not a game about challenges but a simple story told through our actions and errors. The music ties perfectly with this simple visuals and controls, peaceful natural sounds like a waterfall in the background with clear guitars.
<br>
<br>The game has some replayability too with some achievements that can be completed in a quick 2nd go at the game (once you finish it the first time the second time will go by very quickly) and there is at least two puzzles that have more than one solution and may keep you coming back to try another time.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a short game, but more importantly it&apos;s a deep experience if you are willing to give yourself to it and accept it as is. Simple graphics, simple controls, simple music, simple story... but a great experience.
<br>
<br>The tweeter thing is optional so don&apos;t cry about it! xD</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2496983">Expand</a></span>

As another reviewer commented before me (turbo_chuffa) - this game is pure Hipster Trash. It is pretentiousness at the highest annoying level - that level where it is so self-absorbed in its own supposed artistry. The only way I can understand why other people would give this game a high-rating is case of &quot;Emperor&apos;s New Clothes&quot; - pretending to like this trash so they can appear intellectually or culturally superior to others. Again, quoting turbo_chuffa - Ridiculous. Hipster. Trash. No 3 words are more appropriate to describe this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2456831">Expand</a></span>

<br>The &quot;game&quot; provides no challenge whatsoever, is extremely slow and has virtually no gameplay or story to speak of. Most of your time is spent walking around fairly empty screens, sometimes with a few &quot;puzzles&quot; that involve clicking objects in the right order.
<br>Combat is dead simple apart from very few sudden instant-death scenarios that you will easily pass after the first time they smack you in the face. Of course, you will have to sit through the slow, braindead first part of the fight again.
<br>The game also has a built-in mechanic that, at two points, forces you to wait X real-time days to be able to continue because the moon phase has to be right. It&apos;s nice finding that out via a walkthrough after shambling around every screen for half an hour. The mechanic is as stupid and nonsensical as it sounds, the moon phase has no relevancy on anything else in the game and you will just have to quit playing for a few days because you cannot progress.
<br>The game also has a gimmick that makes it possible tweet every single text box you get in the game. The texts are not particularly funny or interesting and it doesn&apos;t change anything about the game to tweet stuff from it. Pointless, really.
<br>The controls are strange to use with a mouse, but you get used to it and they work well enough. The art style isn&apos;t too interesting, but also not bad. However, the music is amazing. I got this with the Humble Bundle, so I also received the soundtrack, and I really recommend that one.
<br>In conclusion: stay away. This isn&apos;t fun, this isn&apos;t challenging, this is not a game. It&apos;s also not a playable novel because there is no story. It&apos;s masturbation with no payoff.
<br>But with really good music.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570828">Expand</a></span>

<br>The controls aren&apos;t that annoying. I prefer the PC version to the mobile version.

<br>I didn&apos;t use the Twitter integration at all, and I don&apos;t know why everybody was so annoyed by it. This game, in my opinion, should have received a much higher user score.

Really the novel visuals are all this game have going for it and they wear off quickly due to the poor content and play.  Get Limbo if you like novel visuals with interesting game play. Consider this game a nonsensical puzzle game, with dreary &quot;puzzles&quot; .  The story line is inconsequential and the game is basically a series of visuals tied to puzzles &quot;gems&quot; that include &quot;rubbing&quot; rainbows with a mouse curser.  Even in the original iOS format this game stinks.  Humor, sound track and plot sound and play out as if they were put together by a student of some poor art school and that is probably the audience who would appreciate the &quot;game&quot; the most. I think the developers should perhaps take up advertising design to pump out their drivel in the context of web and tv ads because they shouldn&apos;t rip off the paying gaming public with rubbish like this.  Readers, seriously reconsider any critic who has given this a great review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2326495">Expand</a></span>

Beautifully detailed 8 bit world. Clocking in at 6 hours the game makes the most of its limited environments without the danger of them becoming tiresome. There are a few gimmicky elements in the game that really don&apos;t fit. The game is very proud of its music and the musician that made it and that&apos;s fine, but it doesn&apos;t necessarily mean a vinyl record fits into the game&apos;s organic fantasy vibe. The ending is equal parts downer and nonsensical but there&apos;s enough of an epilogue that you&apos;re not left with your jaw on the floor. Overall I was satisfied with this game. I bought it this evening and couldn&apos;t stop playing until I&apos;d completed the journey. I can&apos;t wait to see what the guys at Capybara and Superbrothers can do next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2303202">Expand</a></span>

The music sets the ambiance well, whether you are peacefully trotting to your next destination, or fighting a golden triangle.

<br>You need to have patience, and an ability to appreciate their whimisical approach to exploration. Its not a stats ladden RPG. There&apos;s minimal violence. And nostaliga is a big part of this game; if you missed gaming in the 1980s on the PC or Nintendo, you might not catch some of the subtleties of this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2455597">Expand</a></span>

This was the first game I tried out of the bunch, and it looked pretty good, the music wasn&apos;t too bad. The story however was really generic, and the minute I started playing I realized this was the kind of hipster junk that put me off Indie games to begin with. I enjoy art, in fact I take quite a bit of graphic design classes, so I can say I appreciate the style, but this SHOULD NOT have been a game. I strongly reccomend against wasting your money on it. The only redeeming factor about all this is that most of my money will go to charity, and that I have four other games to try that look promising. As a game I&apos;ll give it a two, as a graphic arts project of some sort I would totally have given it a 9 or so, really cool designs and great music.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2456191">Expand</a></span>

The music by Jim Guthrie is fantastic and really has a prog rock feel to it.  Graphics are old-school and yet work really well.  This game just goes to show that you don&apos;t need powerful, high-def graphics to create a meaningful experience.  One of the highlights of the game (of many) is the battles with the &quot;trigons.&quot;  I don&apos;t know what it is, but the music and graphics are so intense, along with it actually being the only challenging part of the game, that by the end of each of these battles my heart was literally pounding.  I cannot remember the last time a game did that.  As you can see from the reviews, this game is quite polarizing.  It&apos;s not for your CoD type of gamer or someone who is into sports games.  If you like artful games like Limbo or Journey, you will enjoy this game.  It&apos;s only $8 on Steam and you get a free download of the soundtrack of the game, which is a great deal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2339405">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay was boring and sometimes annoying, it really did little to push me and to proceed to the end.</span>

To top it off there are some incredibly frustrating bugs. Have fun watching your character walk aimlessly for large amounts of time.

The fighting mechanic, exploration, story, and game pacing is fine. The music and visuals are very unique and amazing. I&apos;m happy I spent the money on this title.

<br>The art style</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This is one of my all time favorite games.  I fell in love with it when I first purchased it for the iOS.  When I heard that it was coming to the PC, I nearly broke my neighbor&apos;s ears with my fangirly screams of joy.  This game is intelligent and gorgeous in so many ways.  So if you&apos;re a fan of brains and beauty, take this little gem out for a date you will never forget.
<br>
<br>The art style of the game is bar none.  It&apos;s a modern-day version of an Impressionist painting, a pixelated masterpiece.  From just one playthrough, I amassed over 75 in-game screenshots that I now use as my desktop wallpapers.  Superbrothers really brought their A-game when designing recognizable, yet incredibly simplistic, characters that would feel right at home on my old NES.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is very slow, but encourages exploration.  This rhythm-based point-and-click encourages you to &quot;touch&quot; the scenery, often creating interesting reactions and cool sounds.  The high point of gameplay occurs during your own personal jam session with Jim Guthrie, the game&apos;s soundtrack composer. Being able to &quot;play&quot; along with Jim is absolutely fantastic.
<br>
<br>Which brings me to the soundtrack.  It is the best music you will ever hear.  Any other attempt to describe how perfect it is would not be enough.
<br>
<br>Some would complain that the story is dull, and the writing is poor.  That the graphics are gimmicky and wear off quickly.  That the gameplay is pathetic.  I say phooey on them.  Gamers don&apos;t believe in a simple. yet effective, story.  Not anymore.  This is a highly personal game that represents the awkward transition from snarky teen to responsible adulthood.
<br>Be warned: it does have a fairly limited playthrough value.  But the soundtrack makes it so worth it.  Check it out, so we can be cosmic friends forever, okay?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2491234">Expand</a></span>

It triumphes in sound and visual design and features a new take on musical gameplay and puzzle solving. The visual design is pixel-art&apos; tish or 8 bit type containing lots of particles and visual surprises. The puzzles are what make the game stand out from others as they require the player to constantly try out new possibilities. Some may not seem logical at first but the game gives certain hints after some time in form of a onscreen thought or through a dialogue with an npc hinting to a special way of solving a puzzle. There is also a combat part which is fairly simple and mostly includes pressing the right button at the right time. Fights never get annoying or fall short as they are well placed and don&apos;t  get on the players nerves while playing. In terms of story, the game features a very linear but good plot that makes the player want to see what happens next and never gets ahead of the actual gameplay as they both seamlessly fit together. Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery also has a great soundtrack that adds to the whole experience and makes the game stand out even more. The best thing is that the soundtrack is separately included also in the pc version of the game. It may not be a long game (took me around six hours to complete) but for 5,99&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2319943">Expand</a></span>

Anyone commenting on the graphics is looking at the genre of game wrong, unless they&apos;re saying that the art style and graphic display of that style fit the game well. Combat is generic and loses its novelty quickly, but still a very good game overall.</span>

Judging the game badly only on the fact that it is point and click game seems quite vague to me. But enough about that, lets discuss the game instead. In my eyes this game is truly a gem. It is by far one of the best indie games i have ever tried. The art is amazing, the music really catches the overall feeling of the game and i generally like all the references it does to other major games. But the reason im not giving it 10 is for one that I played it on PC and the controls and interface seems very much intended for the IOS platform (so go buy it for iPad). Another thing that annoys me is that the game keeps asking me if I want to post my progress on my twitter account. But overall an amazing indie title, and a game that really gave me much fun even though I was not expecting it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2533424">Expand</a></span>

This was buckets of fun. As the game itself describes within the telepathic Megatome, &quot;We have found that a relaxed, curious personality will result in an an enjoyable experience S:S&amp;S EP.&quot; After reading this, my frustrations with the game&apos;s dumb controls suddenly slackened (although you can doubleclick to navigate, rather than stump around by clicking and holding. A relief to discover). This isn&apos;t a gamer&apos;s game, it&apos;s an EP: a series of &quot;far out, man&quot;  concepts which you happen to play through. Metagame cameos, use of tropes, slight goofiness, and emphasis on music compel your advancement. The tacked-on social networking doodad is forgiveable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=2556161">Expand</a></span>

<br>Controls are bad, graphics are junk, music is forgettable, story is&#x2026;well, I&#x2019;m not sure there is a story aside from references to other games like Zelda. I thought this would be an amusing diversion for an evening but instead it put me to sleep. Literally. I struggled to finish the first part because I kept dozing off. Shocked at how many people are praising the visuals. It&#x2019;s nothing but blocky pixels everywhere, allegedly arranged in &#x201C;poetic&#x201D; fashion. Whatever.
<br>
<br>Superbrothers is sort of like Another World: there are action-type areas with puzzles mixed in. Except Another World is much better in every way, even the graphics, so you might as well play that instead. In fact, do anything else instead. If you have no other video game to play, read a book, surf the internet, eat a sandwich, exercise, anything. Your time will be better spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4040112">Expand</a></span>

To be fair, I was only able to get 30 minutes in before I decided that it was too boring to play anymore. The soundtrack isn&apos;t too bad but the gameplay is what makes a video game, and this game is sorely lacking in that department. Thumbs up to the art team, but the development and writing needs some inspiration.</span>
