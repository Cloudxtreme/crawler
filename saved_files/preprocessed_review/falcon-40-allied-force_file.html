Changes to Reference symbol and AG MasterModes: 
When the radar is in an AG mode, display the reference symbol instead of the bullseye, regardless of the ICP selection. 
In A-A Modes and BE mode deselected, the bullseye solution readout shows bearing and range from the current steerpoint to the cursors. 
In A-A STT Modes and with a locked target and BE mode deselected, the bullseye solution readout shows range and bearing from the bugged target to the current steerpoint. 
Do not display the radar cursors with an STT Lock. 
Change to the RWR newguy sound. Instead of playing the 3 beeps, play 3 bursts of audio at the emitters PRF.

Mission planning improvements. 
New modes added for Airborne Forward Air Controller (FAC[A]) / Close Air Support (CAS) / Battlefield Air Interdiction (BAI). 
Missile AIM 120-C5 added to 2005 / 2010 campaigns. 

[b]Configuration Options[/b]  
Setup options for intro movie, current player selection and Instant action scores are now stored in configoptions.cfg so they are not lost again during future patching, installing and uninstalling. 
Make sure to go over all of the Setup screen options once again after applying patch 3.

[b]FAC (A) Improvements:[/b]

The Airborne Forward Air Controller - FAC (A), has a pivitol role in helping direct aircraft towards ground targets. They were used extensively in Vietnam and more recently in the Gulf War conflicts. The FAC (A) flies ahead of a Close Air Support flight. It picks out ground targets and provides bearing and range. In addition, the FAC can launch &quot;Willie Pete&quot; White Phosphorous rockets which mark the target for visual identification.

The FAC feature was always present in Allied Force. But v1.0.4, will see a radical improvement in the way it works. It is more functional, more responsive and much more interesting to fly.

Up until now, the FAC would only guide you to the primary ground target. If the primary target did not exist, or one was not assigned to it, attacking aircraft were left without a target to go for. Now, the FAC will attempt to find the primary target but if it was destroyed or a primary target not identified, then the FAC will go hunting along its waypoints to spot and find you a target.

Lead Pursuit engineer Mike Laskey explains: &quot;Sometimes too when AI fighters would check in with the FAC, after a few seconds they would call &quot;Winchester, Request Relief&quot; then they&apos;d pick a target and attack. This has been corrected. AI fighters will check in and wait a few minutes. If the FAC does not assign a target within that time frame, the AI fighter will call in to the FAC with the request &quot;Send me your targets&quot;. If after another short period nothing is heard, then they will hunt around for their own targets and attack.&quot;

&quot;The AI will now have the correct logic to properly launch marker rockets at targets. In the past, the A-10 would launch all its rockets in one pass instead of just one at the particular target, and in fact the F-16 when flying FAC missions would not be kitted out with marker rockets at all. Both these issues have been corrected so that targets are marked by the AI FAC aircraft.&quot;

Mike says: &quot;We revised the logic so that the AI FAC will only launch marker rockets whilst the FAC has fighters checked in. If no fighters are checked in, then the FAC preserves its rockets, flies along its waypoints finding targets and waiting for fighters to check in.&quot;

The AI FAC will also fire a rocket at the nearest unit in the target battalion, to avoid overflying and getting shot down. Smoke has now been introduced for these rockets to clearly mark the target both day and night.

Maximum enjoyment can be had in multiplayer mode with a human FAC directing AI and human-flown On-Call CAS missions. Players can fly the role of the FAC, launch smoke rockets into the target and use the FAC commands to audibly describe target positons to his AI and player-piloted allies. 

During the mission, the AI FAC, when it runs out of rockets, will remain in the target area and continue to call targets. It will return home when either all the fighters have checked out, of when fuel is low.

Mike adds: &quot;Improvements are not just limited to the FAC. CAS, BAI and On-Call CAS flights have had their logic enhanced. Before they tended to attack the first target they came across. Now they will ignore ground opportunities until they reach the target area, and then start hunting as normal for the rest of the mission.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/falcon-40-allied-force/user-reviews?user_review_id=56891">Expand</a></span>

Rest assured that this has a huge community, looks great, is terrifically optimized, all while maintaining a very realistic experience. The one thing that can really hurt a sim experience is wonky communication, having to repeat commands, or them not working well. The command system is wonderful, asking for a taxi puts you in line and it&apos;s very organized, if you are a flight lead your wingmen will follow you on the runway, and you are seamlessly transferred from taxing to takeoff by doing one command. Another problem with flight sims is that a lot of the game is just learning the plane, and not much is put into mission design and AI, well AF does both beautifully. Though randomly generated, there are a nice variety of mission types and scenarios will mix things up. There&apos;s also a custom mission editor which has a relatively small learning curve compared to most custom mission editors out there. The AI is done well, the AI makes mistakes, but at about the right frequency. Stick support is great, while most will work for any game, some sticks comes with trimming wheels etc. and they may not be supported, my CH 568(a bit older) works well with all the wheels on it as well, which didn&apos;t work in IL-2 1946. I can honestly say this is the best flight sim on the market along with DCS a-10, however this is much more optimized and doesn&apos;t require a high-end graphics card to run. All around the game is incredibly consistent, looks great, realistic, runs great, lasts a long time, huge community, and modding support.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/falcon-40-allied-force/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570630">Expand</a></span>
