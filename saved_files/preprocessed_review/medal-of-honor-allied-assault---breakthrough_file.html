<br>Breakthrough in particular is a terrible game. Imagine a first person shooter where the enemies almost never drop any ammo and are bullet sponges on top of that. That&apos;s right: you&apos;ll have to quicksave constantly, and quickload whenever you feel you&apos;ve wasted too much ammo or health, which is all the time.
<br>
<br>Add to it some of the worst escort missions with suicidal AI that you&apos;ve ever seen, unbelievably bad turret sections and what I can only call aggravating tower defense minigames with instant-failure conditions, and you have a completely miserable experience to suffer through.
<br>
<br>There is no entertainment to be found anywhere within MoH:AA Breakthrough. Stay away from it at any cost. Play the base game if you have to, and don&apos;t touch any of the expansions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-allied-assault---breakthrough/user-reviews?user_review_id=7081611">Expand</a></span>
