<br>-- Very detailed enviroment.
<br>-- The ghost Katarina replaces the pet from Torchlight. She adds more life to the game, and you can adapt her abilities to your requirements.
<br>-- Price!
<br>
<br>--- Cons:
<br>-- Lack of impact noice when attacking.
<br>-- Combat seems slightly repetative.
<br>-- The &quot;powerups&quot; to your skills in the skill tree is relatively &quot;boring&quot;. For example, adding +50%    damage is one of the 3 powerups that is repeated in all of the skills. Some more interesting powerups would have been prefered.
<br>
<br>Overall, great game  but with a few fixes here and there, it&apos;d be even better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3174228">Expand</a></span>

<br>Price is nice, music is acceptable but a little too short. Graphics are very nice.  Skills, attributes and overall character development is great.

I&apos;ve never been more surprised by a game- for $13, I didn&apos;t expect an experience rivaling (and surpassing!) top-dollar ARPG&apos;s.

I jumped right in and played for hours. I was a little worried when I started the game and only had the choice of one character class, but once I started experimenting with the skill tree, I realized that Van Helsing can be a variety of character types such as a caster, ranged DPS, melee defensive/offense, etc. The ranged/melee swap feature adds a level of depth that can lead to some exciting builds. The environment and artistic nature of the game gives it a darker feel that I enjoy. Congratulations Neocore, I&apos;ll be keeping an eye on your future releases from now on! I can&apos;t think of a better way I could have spent my $14.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3176299">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m not sure that the movie was really what the devs. were thinking would draw many players, it was pretty bad, IMO as well and even the reviews here are pathetic.  You would think that they may have had other interests in mind than lamenting over the film when they chose to use the name or maybe not... The reviews here are at: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/van-helsing for those interested.
<br>
<br>Also, with regards to the skill and character traits available to customize.  I have found that with the 8 or so hours I have in the game, you can&apos;t (at least at my point) just level up all the skills and get the +50% in all aspects, there are too many.  This is what makes it so interesting to me.  You have to focus on a balanced set and work with them in order to truly level up and expect any useful skills.  While I do like to explore, I am now 8 hours into the game and I haven&apos;t seem but a couple of the maps shown on some other video reviews.  I expect those that found the game to be short might prefer the running and gunning to the quest point and getting it done as fast as possible.  Not me, I try to find all the hidden treasure there is to be had as well as the collectibles and achievements, so what may take them an hour could take me up to 3.
<br>
<br>The acting is great, IMO.  It&apos;s hilarious at points.  Just in the first town and subsequent quest(s) there are some great characters to meet.  The two headed cow and just around the corner, the drunk babbling (were they clues or nonsense, not sure yet), the alchemist who was cursed and can&apos;t speak anything but gibberish (part of a quest)  are just a few right from the get go that I though were very clever and funny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3176043">Expand</a></span>

It takes a familiar formula, and mixes it up nicely with in-depth character customization, likable cast, and an interesting world/setting. I personally couldn&apos;t get into D3, TL2 or PoE, but this game instantly had me hooked, and is probably the first ARPG thats really kept me playing since D2. Great work all around!</span>

Cet excellent hack &amp; slash &quot;old school&quot; fa&#xE7;on Diablo 2 prend tout le monde par surprise. Et tout &#xE7;a pour moins de 14&#x20AC;.
<br>
<br>Dans ce jeu nous incarnons le fils du c&#xE9;l&#xE8;bre chasseur de monstres, Van Helsing.
<br>
<br>Le visuel est globalement plaisant et l&apos;ambiance &quot;Van Helsing&quot; est bien pr&#xE9;sente au travers du bestiaire classique au d&#xE9;part puis plus steam punk par la suite. Les effets sonores sont correctes et les musiques collent parfaitement  l&apos;action et au st&#xE9;r&#xE9;otype &quot;Europe de l&apos;Est med-fan&quot;. Les voix sont en Anglais mais le jeu propose des sous-titres FR. De plus, le jeu se paye de luxe d&apos;avoir d&apos;excellentes r&#xE9;pliques, dr&#xF4;les ou sarcastiques, entre le h&#xE9;ros et le fant&#xF4;me de dame Katarina qui nous sert de partenaire tout au long du jeu. Sans oublier les nombreuses r&#xE9;f&#xE9;rences  d&apos;autres jeux ou films. L&apos;action est bien pr&#xE9;sente et on encha&#xEE;ne les packs de monstres avec plaisir. La difficult&#xE9; quant  elle grimpe pass&#xE9;es les 1&#xE8;res heures de jeu.
<br>
<br>Au niveau des m&#xE9;caniques de jeu, on retrouve pas mal d&apos;&#xE9;l&#xE9;ments classiques des H&amp;S et d&apos;autres instaur&#xE9;s par D2. A chaque level, on distribue des points dans nos stats et comp&#xE9;tences. En plus de cela, il est possible d&apos;obtenir des &quot;perks&quot; via les points de r&#xE9;putation obtenus en tuant des monstres &quot;non normaux&quot;. Le jeu propose une table de comp&#xE9;tences pour le corps  corps, les armes  feu ainsi que les buffs et auras. Le personnage dispose  tout moment de la possibilit&#xE9; de switcher entre son arme de corps  corps et son arme  feu. Un syst&#xE8;me dit de &quot;combo&quot; est aussi pr&#xE9;sent. Il s&apos;agit en fait plus d&apos;un syst&#xE8;me permettant de booster l&apos;effet de sa prochaine attaque en fonction de 3 crit&#xE8;res diff&#xE9;rents pour chaque comp&#xE9;tence. Ce syst&#xE8;me est aliment&#xE9; par la rage obtenue en tuant ses ennemis. Le jeu dispose aussi d&apos;un syst&#xE8;me comparable  celui des gemmes  sertir dans son &#xE9;quipement. Sauf qu&apos;ici il s&apos;agit d&apos;essence. Ces derni&#xE8;res sont am&#xE9;liorables et aussi m&#xE9;langeables afin d&#x2019;obtenir de nouveaux effets. Il est aussi possible de cr&#xE9;er son &#xE9;quipement  la fa&#xE7;on du c&#xE9;l&#xE8;bre cube Horadrim de D2 mais cette fois ci en passant par un PNJ. A noter que notre compagnon, la tr&#xE8;s morte dame Katarina, dispose elle aussi de stats et de comp&#xE9;tences  monter ainsi que d&apos;une feuille d&apos;&#xE9;quipement.
<br>
<br>Les 2 seuls points faibles que l&apos;on pourrait &#xE9;ventuellement trouver  ce titre r&#xE9;sident dans sa re-jouabilit&#xE9; et dans son relatif manque de vari&#xE9;t&#xE9; au niveau des r&#xE9;gions travers&#xE9;es. Ainsi, une fois le mode solo &quot;offline&quot; termin&#xE9;, il n&apos;y a pas de &quot;new game plus&quot; ou de possibilit&#xE9; de recommencer l&apos;aventure. La seule solution est alors de passer par le mode &quot;online&quot;. A noter que le mode &quot;online&quot; est actuellement assez instable mais que des patchs sont en route pour corriger le probl&#xE8;me. Et pour ce qui est de la r&#xE9;gion visit&#xE9;e, elle se r&#xE9;sume au final en 2 lieux principaux avec leurs quartiers alentours.
<br>
<br>Le jeu devrait vous tenir une bonne 15-20aine d&apos;heures avant que vous n&apos;en arriviez  bout. Ce qui est somme toute plut&#xF4;t honn&#xEA;te pour le prix et sachant que le mode &quot;online&quot; permettra  ceux qui souhaiteront continuer leur recherche de l&apos;item ultime d&apos;y passer encore d&apos;avantage de temps. De plus, il semblerait que le jeu prenne la forme d&apos;un jeu &#xE9;pisodique fa&#xE7;on &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. Bref, affaire  suivre certainement en fonction des ventes du titre qui, je l&apos;esp&#xE8;re, rencontrera le succ&#xE8;s car cette mise en bouche ouvre de belle mani&#xE8;re l&apos;app&#xE9;tit.
<br>
<br>En conclusion,  moins de 14&#x20AC;, ce serait vraiment dommage que de ne pas encourager le surprenant travail r&#xE9;alis&#xE9; par les d&#xE9;veloppeurs sur ce jeu. Le r&#xE9;sultat est &#xE9;tonnamment bon et ravira  n&apos;en point douter les fans de hack &amp; slash &quot;old school&quot; ainsi que les fans de l&apos;univers Van Helsing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3176475">Expand</a></span>

<br>Indie developers putting so much effort into their games compared to big companies nowadays, this is why i love indie games and this one is gonna be my personal favourite! 10/10!</span>

So many things work great in this game, though there are a couple small flaws.  If you enjoyed Torchlight 1/2 or Titan Quest, this is a well-worth purchase!
<br>
<br>The characters, Van Helsing and Lady Katarina (a ghost!), work great together.  It helps that the voice acting is incredibly well-done, something which seems rather rare for indie/lower-budget games.  NPC&apos;s are all voiced, which is pretty nice, but there are a few exceptions (but it adds to the humor!).  Your companion can be a bit of a smartass, which works well in the dark fantasy/mechanical (ish?) setting.  There&apos;s tons of wit in pretty much every part of the game and are also a number of references, as well.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is solid, though the pathing and movement can be a -little- off.  You will find that your deaths come from being surrounded quite often.  It isn&apos;t quite as smooth as Diablo III, but the enemies are, in general, better designed.  There are a lot of &quot;dodgeable&quot; things, which is ideal in an ARPG instead of everything just auto-hitting you.  You have both a sword and a gun to equip, along with all of the other usual pieces of gear.  You can also equip your lovely companion with some other gear and she has many options for combat and loot.  She can be set to ranged, melee, or passive (if you keep her passive, you get 10% all defense).  Also, you can set her to pick up any rarity of items and any item that sells for less than whatever amount of gold.  Of course, she has an inventory as well and can be sent back to do your shopping/selling/whatever.  Lastly, mobs don&apos;t seem to respawn in single-player...  which is a little odd.  It may get fixed, who knows.
<br>
<br>The other lacking trait of the game would probably be the number of skills.  There are two main trees, melee and ranged, and two smaller trees.  The smaller trees contain passives skills and misc. active skills of which you can only have two of each active at one time.  It would be nice if there were more trees or just more skills for the two trees.  The skills don&apos;t have a huge amount of creativity to them, but for the most part, are balanced.  There are a couple &quot;weak&quot; skills, but nothing too bad.
<br>
<br>But, don&apos;t let those small flaws stop you!!!!!!!  There are tons of &quot;hidden&quot; items and bonus content.  Quite a few easter eggs.  It&apos;s incredibly well-done in this regard, and trumps any other ARPG.  If you love finding hidden stuff, this is a perfect game for you! (Pay attention to every detail!)  I felt like I was playing a Monkey Island ARPG, almost.
<br>
<br>The music is good and fitting with the theme, but it sounds a little bit repetitive.  Still not bad though.  After a while, you may choose to turn on your own tunes, though.
<br>
<br>Definitely another great game for 2013.  A hidden gem, looking at how few main critic reviews there are so far!  It&apos;s an incredible adventure well worth the $15.  Certainly a better investment than Diablo III !
<br>Total bargain!

<br>
<br>The game is about 20 hours long to crawl all the side quest.  The polish seems great.  There were only a couple bad voice actors--most of it was good, and the dialog was witty and funny in the midst of a bunch of hack and slash awesome adventuring.  I hear the multiplayer is a bit buggy, but I didn&apos;t do any of that.  Single player was rock solid, with one exception where the final boss was able to attack me during his epic cut scene.  This was no biggie, as I had plenty of cash to just respawn in place.
<br>
<br>Perhaps my only complaint with this game is that I had absolutely TONS of gold the whole way through.  There were prices for things, and it really didn&apos;t matter what they were because I could never spend all my money because sitting there and buying everything from the random item shop is boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3187897">Expand</a></span>

But the replay value is actually low because there is only one class (even though the skill tree is diverse enough that you can play at least 3 playthroughs with it), and the dungeon is the same (they are not randomly generated.) So if you think 15$ is worth the 50 hours of entertainment (15 hours each playthrough), then buy it. But this is not a game you will spend 100+ hours on like Torchlight or Diablo&apos;s. This is more along the line of dragon age with less rpg factor.
<br>
<br>By the way, the producers seem to still work on the replay value by adding post-game stuffs. If that is improved, this game deserves a score of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3190633">Expand</a></span>

I bought it based on some decent-looking screenshots on Steam, but was surprised to find engaging story and quests, charming characters, good voice acting, a strong musical score. and really excellent graphics after I messed around with the brightness and saturation some. On launch, there were several bugs, and multiplayer is broken (5/25/13), but the company appears hard at work ironing out these issues. Otherwise, most of the game feels nicely polished.
<br>
<br>The story and setting are some of the game&apos;s strongest aspects. The world feels like it could be right out of the Witcher novels with an Eastern European allure, and while you don&apos;t have any options as far as selecting a character (you are Van Helsing and his side kick Katarina), the game instead develops a story and personality for these particular characters and you feel like you know them through their manner and idiosyncrasies.
<br>
<br>The biggest complaints that I have? I want more--more story for these two characters and a larger cast, especially to add some variety to the multiplayer. Four hunters in wide-brimmed hats with four ghost side-kicks is a little absurd.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3176941">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t offer you a deep intriguing story, but it offers a few puzzles, dialogues between Van Helsing and Katarina which in most cases make you smile, decent voice acting in terms of interaction with NPCs.
<br>
<br>Also I&apos;d rather not compare it with Diablo or Torchlight, because they are endgame-oriented games, unlike Van Helsing. Also it&apos;s ridiculous how people call D3&apos;s or (Critics have mercy) Torchlight&apos;s story better. D3&apos;s story fits ~2 hours of gameplay on normal mode, after that you can simply repeat it 3 more times (don&apos;t forget the grind for gear and 2nd/3rs classes or hardcore, so maybe it&apos;ll be 5, 7, 10, 20 times) of exactly the same story. How&apos;s that a better story? Who watches the same a movie 5 times in a row however good it is?  And Torchlight 2&apos;s story is linear and absolutely uninteresting with an attempt for a &quot;twist&quot; in the end which actually at first left me in a confusion, because it&apos;s ending was sucked out of vacuum and almost not related to everything we&apos;ve seen before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3263272">Expand</a></span>

I picked it up for a bargain and based on good reviews but I never expected such a fine rpg. Be sure, it is not a Diablo clone. This game has its own specific character and I love it. -----------------------------------GAMEPLAY This game just sucks you up as the time flies by. The controls are smooth, the user interface is fairly simple for such a complicated set of skills. You start slow from 2 basic skills and you end up with a whole arsenal of them, using all of them quickly to your advantage. There are multiple options and tactics how you want to set up your character. Generally it never gets boring, because the skills/tricks/auras system is very fine tuned to reflect the character  level progress. There are swarms of enemies thrown at you and beating them to the ground is very satisfying. -----------------------GRAPHICS are very cool. The isometric view I like very much, yet the maps are beatiful and first and foremost, they live. You can smell the stinge if the swamp and the industrial areas in this game. The models are pretty poor up close, but in zoom out view everything looks very good. If there is a complaint here I`d say it is the system requirements  often fps drop to low thirties which is wierd for such  simple graphics so I guess optimization lacks a bit here. -----------------------------------------------MUSIC is very good. There are basicly two main music tracks that play through the whole game, besides some of the laboratories and dungeons. All of them fit the atmosphere very well and never bore the player.-------------------------------------------------------------
<br>I should also point out that I liked the dialogues very much. They are both clever and funny and enrich the overall image of the game.
<br>If I would complain about something is that the walkthrough was a bit too short. Approximately 26 hours, but you have to know to sit about 1/3 of it through managing your stash and artifacts.
<br>But nowadays even 26h is pretty good, even more that the game features three completely different characters and has many skills that cannot be covered in a one walkthrough.
<br>My biggest surprise of the 2013 and easily an 8 out of 10. I am anxiously waiting for expansions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3735784">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphically it&apos;s wonderful, it&apos;s not a 10 due to the combat lacking, just a little bit too repetitive.
<br>Definitely recommended though, played longer than many games 2-4x the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3425004">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>At first the combat system made no sense, &quot;what are these modifiers for my left and right clicks?&quot; What&apos;s going on!? And then it makes sense and it&apos;s very exciting, a nifty system that I really like. But, here&apos;s where it falls short: It&apos;s really really limited in practice. You have rage as a resource and even though you have two bars of it, they both are depleted regardless of which skill you use. It would have been much better if each skill had it&apos;s own bar so you could juggle abilities. As it stands, you basically choose what you want to use and then you build up more rage by killing things. After you play for a while you really begin to feel how limiting it is to use basic attacks instead of combo attacks due to the rage system.
<br>
<br>The class system is also pretty cool, but again it falls just short as you have to heavily invest in a just a few skills, so even though there are various options, you will find that you&apos;ve gotten a bit tired of the same skills after hours of play, aka there&apos;s little variety unless you spend all your money to respec.
<br>
<br>Mobs are another good/bad aspect of this game. The good is that bosses are interesting, very fun fights. The bad is that everything else even &quot;special&quot; mobs are boring, really boring. They just run up to you and that&apos;s it. Now, yes, it is an ARPG, and that&apos;s generally what happens in ARPGs, but I&apos;m speaking very literally here. There&apos;s no mob variety in terms of what they do. They don&apos;t charge or teleport, or run away, or do anything. They just hit you. It&apos;s a real shame because the boss fights are actually top notch for the ARPG world.
<br>
<br>Music is also good/bad. At times it really fits the mood and then it goes off on this tangent where you feel like you&apos;re waiting in line for a Disneyland ride. Really odd dichotomy, threw me off.
<br>
<br>Lots of features and systems in place, nothing really cool happens with them. Alchemy, forging, stat buffs. It feels like they had a checklist of &quot;things to add to the game&quot; and then they did it, but they never put thought into them to make them special. I would have preferred only 1-2 systems, but done exceptionally well, maybe something that plays off of the combo system I dunno.
<br>
<br>Anyway, for the price it&apos;s worth giving it a go.

<br>

<br>mobs dont respawn, so unless you do things the creators obviously didn&apos;t intend, the possible xp is limited. Furthermore, there is no endgame; after 15-20 hours the game is finished and your only option for replayability is restarting with a new build or going hardcore.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t expect a full game for 12 euros however. There are only around 40 hours of play available, but those hours do count!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3180799">Expand</a></span>

It has an almost perfect balance between action and funny stuff (and the funny stuff/easter eggs are really well made and almost all of them made me giggle) and on top of that it has a bit of strange-horrorish feeling even tho it&apos;s not in big amounts. Overall i had a great time in this game and i am happy i was able to play it. Will give it a 9 considering it came out so well and it (from my pov) beat Diablo from many points of view even from a technical one when it comes down to skills, perks, stats and the actually USEFUL assistant with it&apos;s own skills, perks, stats inventory and options.
<br>
<br>Some minuses that for me would have made it a 10:
<br>- Mobs don&apos;t respawn once u kill them like in diablo after u log out/in again. That would have made the whole experience last longer. Now if u finish the game there&apos;s nothing to do in general.
<br>- The droprate (if any) for epics is almost nonexistent.
<br>- Combining yellow items 99.(9)% of times has no chance of giving u an epic.
<br>- More use of minigames like the tower defense. That from my pov is an extremely strong feature that could be exploited.
<br>- A bit better graphics/movies is always a  but as is it didn&apos;t ruin the gameplay what so ever.
<br>- SHORTER GAME NAME..come on...the name of the game is sarcastically long.
<br>- More character customization &amp; better looking items would be nice. Most of them are well done and in the tone of the game, but even so. Maybe the camera angle was at fault?
<br>- DLC. Definitelly needs DLCs and stuff
<br>- Even more hidden objectives/quests and so on those are awesome and something that is lacking in D3.
<br>
<br>Thanks to the developers for giving us such an awesome experience with this game. Haven&apos;t had such fun in this type of game since D1/2</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3182559">Expand</a></span>

Van helsing counters that by introducing new gameplay elements (it contains a tower defense mini game) keeping things alive and interesting, and the witty humor keeps you throughout the game entertained. Why not a 10, while it seems to do everything right? The storyline, although definitely not bad, could be better. Gameplay wise it introduces nothing new to the hack &apos;n slash genre. That said, this game is well enough to be recommended to people who are not fan of the hack &apos;n slash genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3193352">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphic style represents every clich&#xE9; about a land of werwolves and vampires, the graphic itself is detailed and nice to look at. Despite trees, bushes, hills and hordes of monsters it always seems clean enough to keep an overview.
<br>The sound is nice, music fits but is nothing that stands out, the voices on the other hand are brilliant.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is really enjoyable, attacks feel meaty and heavy and seeing packs of monsters explode into fine bloody mist is extremely satisfying. The mix of chaos and overview is well balanced.
<br>Though the character progression seems quite limited at first, a rather intricate skilltree design and the addition of a leveling companion add enough deep to support several different playstyles and definetly promote replayability.
<br>
<br>Last but not least the game is filled with hidden humor and nice banter with your companion.
<br>I liked this much better than Torchlight 2 or Diablo 3.
<br>I would say at that price, it&apos;s a must-buy for everyone interested in Hack&apos;n&apos;Slash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3172762">Expand</a></span>

At first I thought &quot;WTH there&apos;s only 20ish skills  some &apos;tricks&apos;?&quot;. As I leveled I realized that the use of skill, skills+powerups, tricks and weapon swap(i.e. different skill sets) gave a near perfect level of depth as well as actual   of skills.
<br>
<br>#2  Likeable (main) characters  The dynamics between Katarina and Van Helsing is nice to say the least. I truly felt like I was listening in on two old friends or siblings that were giving each other a little grief. Which makes for a comfortable enjoyable background to fill in the VERY rare luls between packs.
<br>
<br>#3  Very solid graphics  I have a fairly nice machine and a 2550x1440 dell monitor and am fairly impressed with how well everything looks. It looks good at any of the higher resolution/settings but scaled up nicely when I put my hardware to the test.

Graphic is very good, atmosphere is like you are in film about Count Dracula. So much to explore is more than welcome. Customisation of the character is very good, you have to choose what to equip making yourself better for fighting with enemies. Ghost companion is very helpful. I usually don&apos;t  play this type of games, but this one is keeping me in front of pc monitor for whole day. Everyone who is willing to spend some small amount of US dollars or EUROS won&apos;t make mistake by buying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3182702">Expand</a></span>

Their Arthur Games had great ideas and great art, but failed in terms of strategic (and tactical) gameplay. This game successfully mimics the ARPG style of Diabolo and Torchlight in grand style. The UI and skill trees are great. Graphics are beautiful. IT WORKS! Pricing the game at $15 was also  inspired, not because it is cheap, but because it reflects a realistic entry point for impuse buying. So many &apos;full-price&apos; games disappoint. $15 encourages a gamble with an unknown IP. No doubt millions will try it and LIKE what they see. Hope Neocore makes big money with this as a reward for their hard efforts and great work on this title. Thanks for the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3173880">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is just fun working out the best way to take down enemies and everything is just so super smooth at 60 fps or above.

<br>The atmosphere is well done as a Victorian/steam punk world with science gone wrong. This is despite some odd modern culture references which do feel out of place (although the Hitch Hikers Guide reference did make me laugh).
<br>The main problem is that it becomes a bit repetitive later on as some areas are enormous. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it is not boring but after a while I started craving for something different. I guess Diablo fans won&apos;t mind it too much.
<br>What you cannot argue with is the price. It is cheap and you get a lot of game for very little money. A LOT!
<br>Not the best game out there but well worth the asking price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3207177">Expand</a></span>

Didnt hit the end yet. Just from what i&apos;ve heared. However, gameplay and skill system is fun. It&apos;s not &quot;the answer to Diablo 3&quot; but it has a few innovations like the ghost sidekick which is really well done and feels like a step forward in this genre. Said sidekick you can either command to attack from afar, be the tank/melee or just be a buffbot (which some passiv bonuses when she is in this mode) also you can command her to focus certain enemies, collect stuff and of course she has items lots, skills and attributes. Which actually makes her useful and relevant to your personal play stile. The skill system sadly is no Titan Quest, but we will probably never have something great as Titan Quest again, so let&apos;s still with this: You have plenty of options to develop your own personal play stile. However, after a  few playtroughs you will find yourself bored since it&apos;s over at lv 30. But as i said, probably episodic. But until then, it&apos;s a whole lot of fun for that price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3176001">Expand</a></span>

With a ranged character, all of the mobs are always stronger than you, meaning the gameplay reduces to running round in circles letting off area effect rounds from a blunderbuss. The loot is mind-boggling, it&apos;s impossible to tell whether a drop is better than your current equipment without looking through the stats, and even then it&apos;s too complex to decide if the critical hit bonus or the elemental damage bonus or the attack speed is more useful. For a game with so many inter-related stats it works surprisingly well, and the mobs somehow manage to continue being exactly as much tougher than you all the way through the game, without getting noticeably easier or impossible to beat. I&apos;m tempted to think there is a much simpler system behind it all and the game just gives the impression you&apos;re tinkering with dozens of little plus and minus buttons on the character sheet that do stuff.
<br>
<br>The enjoyable futility of the gameplay and gear progression is a lot like Deathspank. But unlike that game, none of the monsters involve any particular tactic. Diablo is a much better piece of work than Van Helsing, and I think the positive comments here are probably due to the game giving an excellent first impression  for a budget title it is extremely well-polished and professional looking. It just has a crummy gameplay mechanic. A lot of reviewers seem to like the witty dialogue too, but I think the constant subtle references to other games like Skyrim, Dishonored, Orcs Must Die and probably some others I can&apos;t put my finger on are more fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3214371">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, I have hit three separate circumstances where I was unable to continue the game because triggers had failed.  The first such case was early in the game.  Five bosses guard an inkgate in Gallowsbog.  To continue, you have to defeat them and then use the inkgate they&apos;re guarding.  In my case, the bosses were unresponsive, and just stood there.  They could not be targeted, and the inkgate itself was inactive.  Fortunately, Neocore offered a hack that activated the inkgate and got me past the problem, but I never did get to fight the bosses that were guarding the Gallowsbog inkgate.  The second time I got stuck, I read on the Neocore forum that they don&apos;t have a hack to get around it yet.  So I cannot finish the game.  Okay, I decided to spend some time playing the high-level scenarios until Neocore comes out with a hack.  Alas, the second scenario I tried was again bugged and unfinishable.  Too bad Neocore didn&apos;t invest in more comprehensive testing.  It could be a pretty good game.
<br>
<br>Which is worse  spending money on a game that turns out to be not worth playing, or spending money on a game that is worth playing, but so broken that you cannot finish it?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3852367">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Like the mouse cursor not showing if you have a gamepad connected. And I have one. And no, I do not feel like giving my PC a reacharound every time I want to play a particular game.
<br>
<br>So, assuming you decide to grin and bear it. The interface is optimized for the mouse and optimized badly at that. The highlighting of menu items is nonexistent and managing inventory is quite hard due to no paperdoll being present and the actual inventory slots being switched with an ultra-precise tilt of a thumbstick. The top tier menu actually has many more items than are shown on screen. How many? Well, you&apos;ll just have to scroll through them and see, young man.
<br>
<br>Assuming you have managed to equip items and learn skills somehow... Moving with the thumbstick will also lock you in place for no reason occasionally. The character gets unstuck after 3-5 seconds on his own, though. Binding skills to buttons is done by going into the skill&apos;s menu and pressing Y. Press anything else - you&apos;ve upgraded something. Pressed Y? Good, no way to exit the binding interface. B(ack) will replace your B binding, obviously.
<br>
<br>The loading times are three to four times that of any other game, too.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay stuff such as mechanics, item variety and skills... This has nothing on Torchlight or Diablo. Those two are way more fun and way more player-friendly.
<br>
<br>The only reason to buy this would be the price tag and the latter levels which are rumored to be good. But suffering through the rest isn&apos;t worth much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3944821">Expand</a></span>

Interesting story, fun characters and dialog. it was a bit short for an rpg but every bit was fun. The game is a bit hardware hungry if you want to run it on high settings and the final boss is hard to finish of.</span>

<br>
<br>despite all its faults i was determined to bite my teeth and grind through the last few levels only to come upon a game ending glitch in the form of a 2nd defense mission, where u fight off 3 waves of nearly unending monsters. when the last monster on the third wave is killed the game instantly crashes to desktop every time, despite being uninstalled and reinstalled. Honestly im glad to be able to uninstall it, as its a joke that this badly producted of a game takes up nearly 20 gigs.
<br>
<br>the only people who can enjoy this are those who glorify the low budget and production levels of the indie games, those who can overlook glaring faults and disgustingly repetitive gameplay. dont excuse a game for its low price point and long grinding battles full of mashing the attack button over and over, which since it doubles as a movement button a la diablo (but not as well done) will force you to continually run up to monsters that youd rather stay away from simply because the first one finally managed to die thus leaving a void where ur character decides to suicide himself into.
<br>
<br>had this game actually worked throughout i might have given it a 3-4 rating however since i was spent 24 levels causing myself carpal tunnel syndrome with the exhaustive clicking only to reach a bug/glitch that made the rest of the game unplayable (since theres no way to save or go back to the prior quest) this game well deserves its rating of 0</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3451251">Expand</a></span>

The multi-player aspect... well, there isn&apos;t one. The game was marketed to have one, but it was released without one, and still doesn&apos;t have one. The game doesn&apos;t run through Steam correctly, so any character you use will not work online (assuming it&apos;s developed).</span>

Game isn&apos;t optimized... your gpu will get raped if you don&apos;t play thaumaterge. Certain mobs mana drain... wtf this isn&apos;t path of exile where you want to avoid certain content. Random loot forging is **** terrible. Throw 5 rares together, even though you choose the type, it can be an item FOR A DIFFERENT CLASS... such a **** waste of time.  poe is better, it has better depth, better to chill and essentially mostly has the same skills with better effects, performance and gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=5877276">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Few things I wish they did better was adding more combat animations! I was really getting tired of seeing the same 3 or 4 swings over and over and over and over again. If they added a few critical hit animations, that would have been nice.
<br>
<br>The town could have been done better with more interaction or a reason to care for the villagers.
<br>
<br>But, as I stated earlier. The game is really good for $15.00.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=4258724">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s not an easy game, but you don&apos;t need to grind. Sometimes you will feel like hitting a wall, enemies get a lot stronger, but you can catch up after some minutes of fight, and death maybe
<br>Skills. When I started the game, I was like &quot;wow, I can use just that?&quot;, and then I realized that &quot;just that&quot; was more than enough to make me happy
<br>Great follower. If you played Diablo 3, you know that the follower is just there to be useless. But your follower in this game is outstanding. She is strong, has tons of auras to help you and dies hard, can loot items for you too
<br>
<br>But there are bad stuff:
<br>
<br>Sounds are bad. The voice acting sucks, so does the music after the first hour
<br>Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong loading screens. Really, I think I spent more time in loading screens than playing the game. When I die, I prefer to pay a bit of my gold and get up in the same map than have to go to the base and face 2 loading screens
<br>Story doesn&apos;t matter. I expected more from that. The story is bad, I&apos;m almost in the end of the game and I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m playing
<br>
<br>Some people complain about the multiplayer. It doesn&apos;t really matter for me, I like playing alone. When they released the game, it was not working, but some patches made it decent. There is still a problem or two though
<br>
<br>The game can offer hours of fun, just don&apos;t let the poor story and the loading screens let you down</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3283688">Expand</a></span>

The item crafting system is a lot of fun to experiment with. Nitpicks: Van Helsing looks a bit weird, especially when you get him new gear. My avatar ended up looking more like a circus cowboy than a monster hunter. The Level Ups could be more visible (at times, I only realized I had leveled up when I was already halfway through the EXP bar again). The ending comes a little abruptly. I was sad when the game was over, but I guess that&apos;s a good sign. One playthrough takes about 12-15 hours. I didn&apos;t get all the abilities unlocked and didn&apos;t do all the quests so I would say it&apos;s good for another go.

<br>3. Level cap is too low for an ARPG, the level cap is 30.
<br>
<br>4. the speeches scripts is idiotic / lame.
<br>
<br>5. game size is too big, i know its not max payne 3 big, but its big compared with other ARPG,
<br>
<br>6. Complete Pack is not complete, 3 DLCs are missing.
<br>
<br>7. The dev expected us to buy the game again, to get the rest of the DLCs, by naming it Support Package, the point is, by buying the complete pack on steam = the dev doesn&apos;t acknowledge it as supporting them, unless we buy the ridiculously expensive pack on their site.
<br>
<br>8. Game got too much bugs.
<br>
<br>9. Patches are still coming, at a snail rate, and when it comes there are chances that it might broke the game even more instead of fixing it for some.
<br>
<br>10. a lot of quest is kinda broken, so it depends on your luck, if a quest is broken or not. (broken = unable to be completed).
<br>
<br>11. i owned it since 2013, but even now the game still got too many bugs.
<br>
<br>12. the game got DLC screen, and i don&apos;t know why the dev feels the need to let us know that we doesn&apos;t have all the DLC, even thought on steam its sold as complete version, and the only way to get those DLCs, is what i described earlier, i felt that its some kinda fraud, because buying complete version while it doesn&apos;t give us all DLCs = a fraud.
<br>
<br>overall : 0/10
<br>
<br>but because the devs are still trying to patch the game, i gave them a 2/10.
<br>
<br>but if they stopped patching it, and the game is still broken, then score is gonna be back to 0/10
<br>
<br>ps : this is only from my point of view, so i don&apos;t care if you guys love it or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=4030938">Expand</a></span>

<br>I guess many people fell into the trap of this game already and can&apos;t get a refund (since it was not possible before).
<br>Sequels of this title might be more &quot;polished&quot;, but currently this game is still a patchwork of a defective product.
<br>
<br>I have not run through any crash yet but everything is so clunky.
<br>Everything begins quite well but ends VERY BAD.
<br>
<br>So let&apos;s start :
<br>
<br>- Levels !
<br>They are VERY short (excepted at the very beginning of the game). Therefore, to allow your character to level up, they are OVERFILLED. YES overfilled with packs of monsters that all come to you as a single one once triggered (I&apos;ll speak about this later).
<br>There is no random generation of these environments, which mean you&apos;ll play the same levels again, and again, again and again (thanks Comodus).
<br>It starts quite well with quite good levels at the very beginning, but it&apos;s clear that they ran out of time, money, that they realized that their game was a mess or whatever you prefer. Mid point through the game, only remain generic level with very little level design. They are juste big square of layout pack VERY tightly with monsters.
<br>
<br>- Levelling your hero
<br>You might think that 3 classes archetypes are good, but the way your leveling is handled is very poor.
<br>Dexterity : add distance damage (guns, rifles, ...)
<br>Intelligence : add magic damage
<br>Strenght : add melee damage AND Healh.
<br>I guess you have already realized what was the problem. If you want to damage your enemies as a ranger, you have to points in dexterity, meaning you&apos;ll have a very low health pool. On the other side, melee is so frustrating because you WILL AGGRO ALL the monsters on the tightly packed map (and remember IT IS OVERFILLED by enemies).
<br>Feats for each branch (melee, magic, guns, ...) could be good, but falls short when you realize that the only useful spell / feat) is the one which does AOE damage over damage to a single enemy.
<br>
<br>- Enemies :
<br>Levels are OVERFILLED with OVERPOWERED PACKS OF DOOM. Yes quite much. You can&apos;t realize that at the begining, because they have planned their work quite toroughfully.
<br>At the begining, maps are quite large, and there is space between packs. Later they are all tightly filled. Starting middle of the game, you are fighting against augmented enemys (like electrical-beating werewolves on steroids). They run at you very fast, are very tough, doing insane damage to your poor health pool (remember when you had to choice between a bit more damage and health).
<br>Further more, there are a lot of enemies in each pack (YES A LOT).
<br>At this point, if you are a ranged character is to try to do kitting through the little empty parts of the map to avoid being SHRED by the RAMPAGING PACKS OF DOOM, while using all the stockpile of potions available to survive.
<br>You rince and repeat until the end of this... GAME.
<br>
<br>- Bosses and FINAL BOSS :
<br>As well, first bosses are quite OK. No special problems about them (most of them are glorified enemies).
<br>HOWEVER. The last boss is a BAD JOKE. A VERY BAD JOKE. Look at those walkthroughs  on youtube. You have to spend 20 min or 40 min to beat him, constantly followed by a  RESPAWNING MURDERING MASS OF ELECTRICAL BADASS WERWOLVES that can almost ONE SHOT you if you let them hit you (you have to be on the run constantly).
<br>If you managed to survive these 40 minutes, CONGRATZ you have finised the game !
<br>
<br>BEWARE : do not buy ! Or if you have already purchased it, try to ask for a refund !
<br>I have asked STEAM to remove it from my game list since i was so disgusted of it, so you won&apos;t see how much hours I had wasted on ... this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=5948413">Expand</a></span>

This gore-spattered romp through an alternate Eastern Europe awash with mythical beasts and weird science features much more in the way of character interaction then most titles in the Diablolike genre, casting the player as an established monster hunter of fiction (or his son, anyway: a lot of NPCs make this mistake) and giving him an amusing companion in the ghostly Lady Katerina. The two have no end of dripping sarcasm to share with each other and the denizens of the dark metropolis of Borgova. I only wish more games would explore gaslamp fantasy as this game does. Katerina acts like one of Torchlight&apos;s pets and can perform much the same functions, but with more complex behavioral options, the ability to use some of the same gear as Van Helsing and she even has her own attribute points and skill trees, allowing you to configure her to serve as the perfect foil to your build for Van Helsing himself. This game presents the player with very few skill slots, but vastly effective abilities to put in those slots, as well as a range of passives and powerful, game-changing &quot;perks&quot; acquired in much the same way as Torchlight&apos;s &quot;fame&quot; system.The game throws very large numbers of relatively weak enemies at you in comparison to either Diablo or Torchlight, something I always enjoy, but the difficulty is much more manageable then either game, clocking you in at far fewer stupid deaths overall. There are options for endgame characters to play random maps with monsters above the level cap to find better gear, and to replay the story with successively tougher monsters, but since you can&apos;t get higher then level 30 (a crippingly low level cap for a game of this type) your only chance of success is to git gud. I commend this title on its excellent mood music and voice acting, the latter of which makes up for any lack of quality with such hamminess as to be very enjoyable. I have a few complaints: the pathfinding is very iffy at times, especially when trying to move Van Helsing up a narrow stairwell, and the fights drag a bit towards the end of the story, though this is a common issue to most Diablolikes. I have only played the base Hunter class thus far, but I would be very willing to return to this title somewhere down the line to try either the Thaumaturge or Arcane Mechanic DLCs. I can personally recommend the Blue Blood DLC as well, as it vastly increase&apos;s Katerina&apos;s power and utility. I shall be moving on to the second and third parts of this trilogy before long and expect more of the same, which in this case is certainly a good thing. I have recently discovered another bonus: You can import your saves from this game into Van Helsing II, and begin at level 30 out of that game&apos;s cap of 60. All skills and items carry over, including Katerina&apos;s Blue Blood skills. An excellent feature, but be sure you have both games installed, as the second game requires that you have the first installed to detect character saves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507873">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The level design is better than both D3 and TL2 and with the help of great music, game creates a great atmosphere. Maps suck you in an you want to investigate every corner of the game. Skill tree is a little basic but it covers the main areas that are indispensable for the genre. Voice acting has some amateur taste to it but the dry humor throughout the game shows that developers don&apos;t take themselves very seriously. They obviously tried to create a great looking fun game and nailed it.
<br>
<br>The whole experience reminded me the first time a played Witcher and how pleasantly surprised I was with a game from an unknown studio. I will keep supporting this game by buying whatever DLC they release and I&apos;m hoping these guys will follow the footsteps of CD Projekt RED and make enough money to come up with an epic sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3200296">Expand</a></span>

This one seemed to be a decent Hack &amp; Slash, with a nice twist regarding the setting of central Europa and possibly legions of blood-sucking foes.
<br>
<br>In this game, you play a single character, Van Helsing, who is followed by a ghostly teammate, Katarina. You don&apos;t have to choose a class before playing, and just develop your character along the way, using several skill trees.
<br>
<br>Basically, you can eradicate a significant amount of monsters by using either a sword or a gun. Each weapon has its specific skill tree with numerous styles of slashes and shots. Each one can be leveled up, or customized with additional powers, triggered by Rage. Also, you can wander in the side of magic by learning strikes blending physical and magical damage, even pure magical damage. If not enough, you can learn passive abilities and active spells, that can take advantage of some specific situations or simply save your butt - leaving you with a fair amount of combinations to craft.
<br>
<br>The amount of damage you do or can endure is proportional to basic weapon and armor stats, plus the different levels of your character stats and skills, combined with the multiple bonuses you can get from gear. Very similar to Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2. So don&apos;t fall in love with that particular weapon or gear if the next one is seamingly up a notch, the impact could be tremendous.
<br>
<br>On top of that, your translucent female sidekick is not only witty, but can be used either as a melee fighter, a ranged shooter or a decent support. She also can level up and has her own gear and skill tree to become a tactical partner or a stat multiplier.
<br>
<br>At this point, it&apos;s pretty clear that this game targets an audience that loves to analyse how hundred skills relate to each other, carefully crafting the most badass character possible, something like &quot;hit once, obliterate many&quot;. It&apos;s a good thing to have a significant amount of depth that way (remember Titan Quest !) but for me it was just like &quot;too much&quot;. So I decided to focus on a restricted number of skills, low enough to keep me focused on the actual map cleaning.

<br>The game is linear, with some quests on the side. The levels are not really beautiful but varied, and the enemies compensate lack of intelligence by sheer number. Luckily, the dialog between Van Helsing and Katarina are funny so you can have a good time playing them.
<br>
<br>Something that kinda puzzled me was the introduction of a micro-game of Tower Defense. Not that it wasn&apos;t interesting or refreshing, but it seemed that the developers decided to put everything remotely cool in the game, thus pushing it in the Land of Blended Genre where chances of survival are slim. Luckily, the Tower Defense micro-game is nicely done, but too much thin for consideration.
<br>
<br>Overall, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a good Hack &amp; Slash, that can satisfy seasoned players, but could be daunting to newcomers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=4955958">Expand</a></span>

What an awesome game and I cannot believe it is so cheap.  Only &#xA3;10.00.  This is a fantastic hack and slash quite similar to the Torchlight games.  There is some great humour in this game mostly provided by Katarina who I absolutely love.  She is a very useful AI companion with a well thought out set of commands and behaviours that can be changed on the fly.  The combat system is great, nothing innovative or new but it works very well and is easy to pick up.  There are some very funny easter eggs hidden in this game that I won&apos;t spoil.  The online mode is a bit buggy at the moment but adds replay value and  the devs are working hard to fix these bugs.  I have not experienced any game breaking glitches or bugs. Patch recently has already improved things.  All in all I really love this game and highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3185883">Expand</a></span>
