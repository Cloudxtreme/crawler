<br>
<br>But we know what is going to keep players playing this for a long time is the multiplayer and boy has blizzard revamped the multiplayer options like the new co-op missions, archon mod and the daily tournaments every 2 hours or so.  I was very impressed they made it a point to update the multiplayer aspect of the game because it was getting stale by the end of Heart of the Storm.  I give it a 10 because basically the culmination of years and years of testing that finally blizzard nailed it on the head the multiplayer aspect of game.  The single player is worth the admission itself but the multiplayer is worth a lot more then what the price tag is because you will be playing this game for a very long time and that is what is going to give SC2 the longevity that some games lack.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5668150">Expand</a></span>

I stopped playing online when they made terrans more &quot;tactical&quot; when in fact they were distinguished by being bloody and not so weak.  So basically when you try to change traits without considering the proportionality of strength, speed, and cost, you get a faction that is useless against zerg and protoss.  I could beat someone easily with the zerg and protoss but losing against the same person with the same faction using the terrans.  Aside from all this, the game was really good.
<br>I bet that most of us who played the last three games muted the crappy ost and played the old one instead while playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=6085341">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is just a rehash of the two previous games with protoss flavor... If you haven&apos;t had your fill with the two previous expansion... Eat your heart out!

Missions themselves lack a bit in variety, but they are well though-out and enjoyable. Cutscenes and movies are better than ever, and the music is EPIC. Please check out Starcraft 2 LOTV Soundtrack on Youtube. I haven&apos;t played the multi-player yet, but I welcome the addition of automatic tournaments. Playing the campaign on BRUTAL is actually BRUTAL and very fun. Too bad that RTS games are not as popular as they should be (maybe 1v1 multiplayer is a bit too demanding and scares a lot of people), but I think this game will be played for at least 10+ years and have a very active pro-scene. Starcraft 1 was the big daddy of eSports way back in 1998 after all. It is only fitting it all ends with an epic expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5726944">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Playing through the missions themselves as &quot;OK&quot; at best. I never really finished a mission and wanted to play it again. With the horrible story and mediocre gameplay, I found the campaign to really drag on in the last few missions and I was ready for it to end. I had to put the difficulty on &quot;hard&quot; to get a modicum of a challenge out of most missions without it just being artificially difficult and I&apos;m by no means an SC pro. The missions are very linear and you generally had to complete the mission in the way that was laid out for you.
<br>
<br>All in all very disappointing and I feel Blizz has done to SC what they did to Diablo and of course Warcraft.
<br>Blizzard is definitely not what they used to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5845664">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also, it gets a most welcome update to the multiplayer, which might just break the dominance of Zerg players.

<br>One thing stuck out as not that great, while playing on Casual (just for the story, and then I move on upwards in difficulty for the challenge) is that the last two Epilogue missions were very hard. Supposing you, the reader, played already Wings of Liberty, All In mission on Hard difficulty is nothing compared the the last two from the Epilogue (coming from someone who finished WoL and HoS on Brutal). I didn&apos;t try yet these two at higher difficulty, but if on Casual I had to try at least 3 times each, I dare not ask how hard they are at higher difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5700123">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Single Player overall score (not an aggregate) - 2/5
<br>
<br>Core Gameplay - 4/5
<br>
<br>The game is unchanged from its original gameplay, and this is the expected Starcraft 2 goodness. No complaints here and no noticeable innovations, but its fun at its core, so deserves credit in that regard.
<br>
<br>Protoss/Campaign specific Gameplay mechanics - 1/5.
<br>
<br>This doesn&apos;t score a 0 for the following - the ship powers were interesting.
<br>
<br>Everything else was basically a reskinned version of what HotS originally had;
<br>
<br>Mission Structure; Terrans had the &quot;pick your route&quot;, Zerg has the &quot;pick a set of missions per planet&quot;, Protoss has &quot;pick a set of missions per planet, sometimes you get to go back to that planet...&quot;
<br>
<br>Terrans had Research, Zerg had Kerrigan leveling (but can re-choose her abilities at any time), Protoss has Spear of Adun leveling (but can redirect the abilities at any time)
<br>
<br>Terrans had unit upgrades dependent on credits, Zerg had mutations (but can re-choose at any time), Protoss has tribes (but can re-choose at any time). The Protoss tribes (with a few exceptions) are usually just reskins of the same type of unit with a slightly different type of attack or a slightly different passive ability. They aren&apos;t all massively different like High Templar compared to Dark Archon for example, or stalker/dragoon to the other ranged unit (can&apos;t remember the name)
<br>
<br>Any for un-related extras, Terrans had mercenaries and Zerg had evolutions, Protoss has...?
<br>
<br>Also, it was pitched way back that while the Terrans are about scraping by on resource, Zerg being about focusing on Kerrigan and evolution of her swarm, Protoss would be about diplomacy.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m paraphrasing but I&apos;m pretty sure the emphasis was implied that you are trying to get as many tribes on your side but you couldn&apos;t win them all. I envisioned a Starfox/FTL like scenario, where you start going down a certain path and you block off the option of other routes, based on the fact you are annoying certain tribes. For example, lets say picking Tal&apos;darim would inevitably annoy the Nerazim, which means you lock yourself from using Dark-Templar etc etc
<br>
<br>Story - 2/5
<br>
<br>How would I rate the story of Wol or HotS? 2/5. The story&apos;s are fine, but they aren&apos;t intricate or as deep or raw as the originals. They&apos;ve gone for the Hollywood-esque cliche form of storytelling, and that&apos;s fine I guess. It works, its functional, its a little interesting. But compared it could have been much more mature in its characterisation, plot and intrigue. Mensk was an interesting character in the first game, and now in the SC2 trilogy he&apos;s a cardboard cut out villain.
<br>
<br>Soundtrack - 2/5
<br>
<br>It sounds like a bit of a mish mash of WoL and HotS, which each had their own unique sounds, this feels lacking or borrowed from the other campaigns. WoL had the Folksy-Techno guitar which made you feel like a real cowboy struggling to fight with a rag tag band of misfits against much greater foes, but you had the old faithful human ingenuity on your side. HotS just had orchestral percussion making you feel godlike as you mowed down your enemies with a swarm of zerglings. This has... tracks from the other games a lot? Not really noticed it while I was playing (which is a bad thing).
<br>
<br>Level Design - 2/5
<br>
<br>50% of the levels are &quot;build up base, kill thing at x, maybe move near or kill thing at y&quot;. Don&apos;t get even close to WoL level design.
<br>
<br>Overall I hoped so much more from the Protoss campaign and while it wraps up things nicely story wise, it didn&apos;t do it to the gameplay quality it could have been, replayability is thrown out the window for something more generic , and makes HotS feel more generic by copying its style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5770123">Expand</a></span>

The previous 2 games hyped Kerragan and her importance to defeating the hybrids but she does literally nothing till the prologue. Also there isn&apos;t even the illusion of choice. The previous two games you could affect the story by making key decisions on which side to take or who to save, in this one, nothing. Also there is no variety in missions no fleet command or stealth infiltration just assault or defend. The heroes are fun to play with and enjoyably overpowered but they don&apos;t progress like in Heart of the Swarm and the upgrade system isn&apos;t very rewarding. The Spear of Adune should be an awesome ship with lots to do and see, but you are locked into three rooms and there isn&apos;t any of the detail or discoverables (that I have found) that are a Blizzard hallmark. It just seems like this expansion was phoned in, they released it because they had to. No interesting new units (other than the new mega turret which is way too expensive to be practical), just returns of old units or new skins. They made this game because they had to, it felt flat and empty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5771760">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve beat the game on hard, and now want to try myself at the Brutal difficulty. I believe that&apos;s the more realistic approach with the end-of-the-universe style of enemy that&apos;s portrayed in the campaign. Every mission is emotive, skillful and very well done. There are enough mission types to keep everyone interested. The core game play is very rewarding. Of the 3 Starcraft 2 campaigns, this is the strongest one. It really doesn&apos;t look at small scale warfare. It looks at global (or sector-wide) conflicts. This is truly a game that&apos;s geared for the person who wants to feel a great sense of accomplishment at the end of game play.
<br>There are enough new features in the game to easily justify the $40 price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5746137">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As for the multiplayer, I knew what to expect since I&apos;ve played with the game since beta. LotV is a completely different and better game. Sure some will say that starcraft competitive scene is the hardest out but equally the game now offers a redesigned tutorial system ,new modes like co-op ,archon and your usual team games (2v2 etc). Newbies will have a much much more easier time to either just play those for fun, use them as learning and practice tool to get into the 1v1 scene or both! Oh and did I mention automated tournaments? This for me is the greatest addition. The future sure looks bright for Starcraft, expect additional support from Blizzard as they mentioned they will continue releasing new contents, re-design the competitive ladder and continuously balance the game and introducing new units if they ever find it to be necessary.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5722721">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is made by true game makers who knows how to deal with balance mechanics, and not by some **** marketing decision makers.
<br>You can also rely on Blizzard&apos;s team to maintain it for years.
<br>
<br>Starcraft 2 remains without any doubts the best contemporary strategy video game, and the deepest as well.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5708113">Expand</a></span>

<br>The multiplayer has also been improved, fixing a lot of the issues players had with the previous iterations, making macro gameplay easier as well as having the players start with more workers, which removes the boring 3-4 min build up time which was required in every game pre LOTV.

<br>Looks very pretty, good UI and good additional game modes and features.
<br>Good cinematic and cut-scenes.
<br>Campaign is very well done. You unlock different variants of units including popular ones from broodwar as you progress.
<br>
<br>Neutral:
<br>
<br>Real-time strategy game with a very heavy RPG influence maybe also Action game influence as well. Lots of special abilities to use. People to talk to in your base and level up your abilities in between missions. Many missions are very restrictive and heavily scripted, feels more like an RPG level. Not a big fan of this element. remember how the primal zerg from heart of the swarm is essentially the same as the diablo 3 boss lord of lies? thats what I mean. This game is essentially a hybrid which makes blizzard Amon lol.
<br>
<br>Music comes across very strong and dramatic, even good, but not quite great. doesnt resonate with the scenes to generate excitement. Music switch between different screens however is not well done, its just cut off and a different track suddenly blast at you - partly because the track starts off on full blast. so 1 sec quite, next second full blast and its not a pleasant
<br>ther. just doesnt fit together well.
<br>
<br>Negative:
<br>
<br>Missions are nothing new. Pretty much copies of wings of liberty and heart of the swarm. Defend temple/artifact, run from oblivion and giant laser.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer game is too fast paced. New units are grossly overpowered</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5715534">Expand</a></span>

Not going to spoil it here but let&apos;s just say that I was literally yelling &quot;WTF ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!&quot; at my screen at certain reveal that really annoyed me. Also the final ending felt really flat, sappy, and groan inducing. At least for me it was. It does tie up all the loose ends I guess but honestly I would have liked it better if they had just stopped where the main campaign ended. Also the Xel&apos;naga look like discount Cthulhu monsters...really Blizz, that&apos;s the best you could come up with?
<br>
<br>Anyway that stuff aside I did enjoy the game overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5713004">Expand</a></span>

It ends the story that begun with Wings of Liberty and improves upon the already incredible mission design of Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm.

<br>
<br>That alone is enough for me to consider it a worthy buy and an easy recommendation but to top all this off there are the amazingly fun Archon Mode and Co-op Missions options, which both offer new and different ways to experience StarCraft II with friends.
<br>
<br>All of that combined with no serious drawbacks in my eyes make this one of my favorite games of the year and a product that anyone even remotely interested in RTS games should take a good look at.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5748094">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, they&apos;re few in number in the third entry in the SC2 saga. The second and third installments just don&apos;t measure up to the greatness that was Wings of Liberty, when the story was enthralling, the gameplay was innovative, and the graphics stood out. The engine is showing its age, and bizarrely Legacy runs on much lower graphics settings than Wings did, at least on my Mac. Graphical glitches are abundant, which is surprising considering its the same game engine and they&apos;ve been working on Legacy for two years.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is not changed enough to warrant much mention. It&apos;d take a pretty dedicated player to discern the new maps and units. If I took two months off from playing HotS you could probably convince me that nothing changed.
<br>
<br>I expected more innovation, new dimensions of gameplay, a reworked competitive scene, but in the end Legacy is really just more of the same. There&apos;s nothing new that couldn&apos;t have been put in the original WoL campaign five years ago. The missions are formulaic and not terribly compelling: hold out for 10 minutes, get from point A to point B but avoid the large laser. Really, I just thought there&apos;d be more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5758248">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My minor critiques:
<br>- For an ending sequel, I expected more majestic and grand-scale cutscenes, as I have come to expect from Blizzard.
<br>- Too many levels have &apos;destroy these three small structures to destroy this final big structure&apos; theme. A bit more variety was needed for level types.
<br>- A longer campaign: I think another 4-5 levels were needed for the game. Ended a bit quickly. I&apos;m saying this having also finished the epilogue.
<br>
<br>However, despite these critiques, the game is still a legend. I don&apos;t want Starcraft saga to end here though. After waiting 4-5 years, Blizzard should come up with Starcraft 3 series again, with a continuation to the story, rethinking game engine and and new mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5762326">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The multiplayer side is meh-okay.  I&apos;m mostly playing arcade, which is custom rules and mods not related to base game.  I might play ladder at some point but I&apos;m not really into the fast-paced micro-fest anymore (guess I&apos;m too old for that, i.e. not a teen).  I know it&apos;s supposed to be an RTS, but it seems like the Real part now stands for Hectic... I played a few unranked team games and I find the game usually is decided within the first 10-15 minutes, with very few options for either side to recover after that.  Also seems air is over-powered, but that&apos;s just me... in a team environment this in-balance leads to bunker mentality at start and air rush from cliff side... most of the time... yawn
<br>
<br>My high score is primarily due to the fact that I loved the campaign; and I have a soft spot for Starcraft in general. In Starcraft 1 I found multiplayer was better...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5882787">Expand</a></span>

SP is pretty fun, personally I liked the story (I don&apos;t take it too seriously like some people seem to), and the variety in units&apos; special abilities. And of course MP is still great, with the cool addition of the Archon mode for two players to play the same race together.</span>

And the typical multiplayer everyone knows for Starcraft. A good expansion to a great series.
<br>Cons: Story still do not live up to Starcraft and Broodwar originals. Most of the missions on single player were te same bit with new units.

Blizzard once again proves its talent for crafting a compelling RTS campaign. I won&apos;t lie. There are some very strong emotional beats in this game and Blizzard&apos;s excellent cutscenes deliver it with their customary flair.
<br>
<br>The mechanics are largely the same and the structure is similar to Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm. You have branching mission paths that allow you to choose which you want to take. As a result you earn new units which can then be augmented further into different variations. These variations offer an incredible level of control over the make up of your forces and allow for new tactics.
<br>
<br>What I liked the most about Legacy of the Void was just how different each mission feels. The objectives are varied and present some tense moments. All of these factors come to make one satisfying package that caps off SCII.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=6201260">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really wanted to love this game...While it&apos;s not terrible, it&apos;s just...lacking? It doesn&apos;t have the same amount of depth compared to WoL and HotS. It actally borrowed a lot from HotS but in a bad way. The diplomacy mechanic that was promised is non-existent, giving us a very linear approach of how we want to complete the game. The missions are almost all the same, there&apos;s nothing really new added to each, just mass a unit, press a somewhere on the map and just laugh at how easy it is. While normal isn&apos;t exactly hard, I remember getting a challenge out of the other two installments (somewhat, I&apos;m a filthy casual when it comes to RTS&apos;s.) but this game just doesn&apos;t feel the same, it just lacks heart, pure and simple.
<br>
<br>Story wise, there are plenty of plot holes and question marks. I was hoping to see Ulrezaj or maybe even half the damn heroes that showed up in the &quot;vision&quot; given by Tassadar, but they&apos;re all missing, not a single mention to any of them or whereabouts. At the end of the game, I&apos;m just left disappointed.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s the worst Starcraft to have come out, not sure if the Nova add-on will clear up the plot holes, but I still find that that&apos;s no excuse to leave so much content out on what is supposedly the closing trilogy.
<br>
<br>While it&apos;s the worst, however, I still would like to add that Starcraft itself is still a wonderful game to play and to have fun with, but if you&apos;re looking for a story or some closure, you&apos;ll be left sad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=6062549">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve played before, it is an unforgettable epilogue. But you&apos;ve never played, try to buy these gold pieces, because I guarantee one year nasty games.
<br>
<br>SUMMARY: It tells the story of race &quot;Protoss&quot; (there are two more races: Humans and ZERG); with individual stories of characters such as: Zearatul, the Xel&apos;naga, the great Reinor, Kerrigan, Artanis, Zelendis and many more.
<br>
<br>SINGLE PLAYER HISTORY:  10 Best of the Game; addictive.
<br>VIDEO AND GRAPHICS:    6.5

<br>SOUND:    7 Excellent
<br>MULTIPLAYER (online):    6.5

<br>
<br>ASPECTS OF THE GAME DETAILS:
<br>The graphics and video Use a CPU Alienware notebook gamer (I7, 16GG RAM, 256 SDD hd, nvidia 980m to take full advantage of the graphics options in &quot;ULTRA&quot; .- looks and feels amazing.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer platform , is in my opinion one of the best RTS of the global market , with online games with great prizes dollar sport where the digital age , it takes more and more fans . Look what is happening in countries like Korea, which is considered the &quot;digital chess &quot; and are increasing paid players in Latin America.

I played Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm daily, and was high diamond throughout those expansions. I am now diamond on Legacy of the Void, and I have encountered so many problems that blizzard has yet to address in ladder.
<br>
<br>Singleplayer and Co-op:
<br>Once again, blizzard delivered a work of art for campaign. It&apos;s Co-Op missions promote online play, however attract a different kind of people than those who grind competitive matches. The singleplayer and Co-Op, as well as arcade, deserve an 7/10
<br>
<br>Multiplayer:
<br>
<br>Being a player of all 3 races I can weight in about every match up. To be quite frank, a game&apos;s beta is supposed to be the time to balance units and promote fun gameplay; Legacy of the Void Multiplayer feels like it is still in beta.
<br>
<br>Zerg, a slimy race once based around the idea of overwhelming opponents with lots of cheap fast units, is incredible overpowered compared to the other 2 races. Playing zerg at a high level is barely fun anymore, as you end up defeating opponents who are clearly more skilled than you. The macro changes made from wol/hots -&gt; lotv were an accidental buff to the race. Over 60% of players above platinum play Zerg, and the average Zerg win rate is 56% (as opposed to the 48-52 percent for all races in previous expansions).
<br>
<br>Blizzard was many of times credited on being masters of balance, promoting skilled play. They failed horrible in LoTV.
<br>
<br>Another problem with the game is that blizzard is attempting a new matchmaking system to reduce times in queue. This however, has lead to common &quot;mismatches&quot;, where players as low as platinum play grandmasters (top 200 players in the region) often. This complete failure of a matchmaking adjustment takes almost all enjoyment out of many ladder games.
<br>
<br>Unranked play, however, is a lot more fun. Since there is no pressure of losing ladder points or mmr, unranked play has a calming tone to it. However, it should be noted that unranked players are often matched against players playing ranked. This is another problem with the multiplayer, as generally people who play unranked are trying wacky strategies or trying a different race. This leads to further mismatching.
<br>
<br>There are many other balancing problems regarding 1 base Protoss and Terran play in almost all match up, most of it revolving around the adept, liberator and siege tank, overall, the current LoTV mutiplayer is not in a playable state, does not promote fun play and does not help skilled players in races other than zerg be regularly successful. I give the multiplayer experience in Legacy a 2/10, and that is being generous.
<br>
<br>Although annoying at times, the new chat and visual overhaul that hit servers right before the release of LoTV is a large improvement of that found in Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm.
<br>
<br>Replays are something that is mainly unique to Starcraft, and remains with the new expansion</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5963680">Expand</a></span>

-Let&apos;s start</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I&apos;m giving it a 98 out of 100, probably because of the way I&apos;ll ponderate the different aspects of the game. First of all, I think this is the ultimate RTS game for the most competitive scene. It&apos;s the true e-Sport where you are alone all along the path to become World Champion.
<br>
<br>I will start in this review with the things that I&apos;d rate as the &quot;worse&quot;. The Single-Player.
<br>
<br>-Let&apos;s start with the A.I.
<br>It&apos;s really poor and casualized, there isn&apos;t a real challenge on Human vs A.I. Matchups from certain level, not even giving the A.I. the so called &apos;cheats&apos; (maphack, doubled income...). And there are proofs-of-concept that demonstrates what the A.I. could have been. They focused too much on the low player levels and forgot about pro scene in this -&apos;cos ladder exists, you know-. 10/10 for new players and casual ones, 0/10 for the elite.
<br>
<br>-Let&apos;s continue with something we all agree, I think. The Campaing.
<br>
<br>A) Story: 65/100
<br>They did a very good job with the plot althought its really &quot;Disney-esque&quot; and lacks that intrigue and twisted story which made BroodWar the story I loved all these years. I&apos;m still happy because the StarCraft Universe its full of literature and stuff for that time when you want to satiate that story-hunger. I&apos;d rate the plot with a 85/100. BUT when we first saw the characters, it looked like they have become a &quot;for all public&quot; target audience work, and so it is the way the story it&apos;s told. This makes a very flat and plain the story development and a bit predictable. On the other hand, I recall every time I&apos;ve cried with the beauty of the cinematics and the feeling of StarCraft becoming alive once again.
<br>
<br>B) Campaign gameplay. 95 / 100
<br>After having 2 terrible campaigns which &quot;Hardest&quot; difficulty mode were a joke, specially HotS - where you could easly win it with &quot;just&quot; Kerrigan as if you were playing Heroes of the Sworm - they have finnaly made something better.
<br>
<br>-The in-game missions at Brutal difficulty could challenge even the best players at some point, they made really good missions in my opinion, there is no longer a &quot;dream composition&quot; which you can spam for every mission. You can&apos;t even do some of the missions without the right units. The only mechanic which is a little bit repetitive its the blink use, but well... Its a damn Protoss campaign LOL.
<br>
<br>-The mechanics of the mission and units management were simple, as I think they should be. Never had a problem on that as I&apos;m looking for a real time strategy and always felt that like a secondary thing which made its function, making the in-game more complex and different.
<br>
<br>Music and Graphics.
<br>-The music was always a 10/10 for me in all blizzard games from Diablo I, II, LoD, WC&apos;s, SC&apos;s. This is no exception.
<br>-Graphics: I won&apos;t rate this as they are very good, BUT i&apos;ve got to say that since Wings of Liberty, they always had a big, big problem. The unit and movement dynamics designs were, sometimes, hard to distinguish. In broodwar you could find easly any unit in a see of them. Now try find that sneaky baneling in the big zerg swarm, ie. LUCKILY there are ways to improve this with the features they have been adding to change color intensity. I hope they can do more things about this, as the game is now finnished.
<br>
<br>Now, let&apos;s start with the multiplay. 100 / 100. Yes, I&apos;m not crazy!
<br>
<br>&#xB7;Let&apos;s consider first one thing, which is the thousands of mods and maps there are out there. Blizzard gave us something very valuable, allowing even third-party editors. There are stunning pieces of art, so even if you get tired of ladder you can always play a cool-new game. There are even old BroodWar reworks which you can play with the exact same metagame they had. How many hours of posibilities and fun!
<br>
<br>BUT. There is the competitive. OH GOD! THIS IS THE **** BEST  1 vs. 1 in the HISTORY of videogames! Yes, I was a broodwar fanboy. Yes, I went back to iCCup when sc2 sucked. But lets be serious. How much time took to balance StarCraft? How many years until it was finnished (since its the top-scene which had to have the last word).
<br>The new time and economy dynamics are awesome, the complexity of every race its now really hardcore, and the new skillset its huge. As a Terran player I love what the mirror matchup has become. Goddamn, its crazy! This new design is also very friendly with the new players and really accesible for all the range of playerlevels to enjoy the game.
<br>Could be frustrating? Yes. But maybe this is exactly what I&apos;m looking for in a game (not without rewards, but it does have some, winkle winkle). The old games between pros where a simply second in the micro would snowball you down are gone and no longer exist, this is totally about the S in the RTS thing now. Probably there will be a well defined metagame &quot;soon&quot;, but it will be as vast (or probably even more) than broodwar&apos;s. And this, ladies, its what makes it so perfect. A &apos;van Gogh&apos; painting, a &apos;Hemingway&apos; book, a dissertation work by &apos;Carl F.Gauss&apos; . A work of arts and science.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=6201526">Expand</a></span>

I was expecting SC2 to be the same. Not the same game with updated graph engine, but a fun game that would last at least the same 10 years.
<br>
<br>The first episode was fun on the campain side, but was frustrating for MP. Protoss was nerfed by losing goon while Zerg and specially Terra were buffed with stronger units.
<br>
<br>I expected the second episode to fix that, but it just made things worse. Protoss was limited to the &quot;Death Ball&quot; strat, while zerg was buffed even more.
<br>
<br>At this point I don&apos;t care anymore, I just wanted to watch the last episode and put SC2 down. I was frustrated that we barely had Protoss in CGs for 2 episodes and expected to have it fixed in last, and have all characters unitied led by Protoss.
<br>
<br>What LotV brought was even greater frustration. Story went into new and unexpressive characters and left Raynor and Sara away. There was no explanation at all on the consequences of Amon not being able to control the Zerg or a Sara x Amon fight for that control. On the ontrary, Amon was able to control the whole Protoss!!
<br>
<br>It looked like story writers lost their imagination for the last episode, or maybe they just left to another company and new ones were unable to hold?
<br>
<br>For multiplayer I didn&apos;t even bother, I&apos;m not wasting my time playing this game anymore. I give 2 score points for the intro video, the only good thing in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=6287662">Expand</a></span>

I waited 12 years for Wings of Liberty and although it was more of a Hollywoodish +12 rated sci-fi action movie than the dark sci-fi thriller what I expected I really enjoyed it and give it a 9/10 in my book. The Heart of the Swarm was also a great game in 2013, but it had a lot more flaws than its prequel: very easy and simple missions, an even more simple &quot;good vs. evil&quot; story, a totally unbearable main character (SC1 Kerrigan is the best female video game character ever, but this &quot;new&quot; incarnation of her is just simple super boring and sexist) - so let&apos;s say that HotS was a decent 8/10. The multiplayer was great in both games although the minor balance flaws. So I was really looking forward for Legacy of the Void... but as you can see my given score it&apos;s didn&apos;t really met with my not even so high expectations.
<br>
<br>- The story: the weakest part of the whole game, 1/10 at most. In the beginning I was &quot;oh man it&apos;s like 300 in the space, dumb but at least enjoyable&quot;. In the end then &quot;OMFG this s*it is like Twilight in the space&quot; (yes and I hate Twilight by heart). The protoss characters are 1 dimensional idiots (beside Alarak - that guy was really great), Amon is a really lame antagonist, there are no emotions, no explanations, the Xel&apos;nagas are copied from Mass Effect 3 Leviathan, and the f*cking romance subplot between Raynor and Kerrigan is so dumb that I can&apos;t even tell you and the ending is... I literally cried in pain. As I said above, without Alarak this would be a well deserved 0/10.
<br>
<br>- The sounds: although most of the voiceovers are generally good, the protoss characters has near to no special in their voices. The others are... good as ever but nothing special. Luckily for Blizzard the music is great and catchy so they got a 9/10 here.
<br>
<br>- The graphics: the gameplay graphics is generally okay as always, but really too cartoony. I was positively disappointed though in the cutscenes made with the game engine - those are really nice but still, not something really smashing. The CGI videos are great as ever. Here goes a 8/10 for this.
<br>
<br>- Singleplayer gameplay: a huge step backwards again, reminds of the SC1 &quot;Destroy all enemy&quot; type objectives with the base building and &quot;A&quot; mashing. The difficulty is a basically a joke beside the epilogue mission 2, it was pretty tough in brutal. The new units and the Spear of Adun are interesting at first but no big deal here either. The campaign gameplay wasn&apos;t boring just really mediocre afterall - so here&apos;s the well deserved 6/10 for it.
<br>
<br>- Multiplayer gameplay: surprisingly good! I&apos;ve seen this kind of coop gameplay here and there before but it&apos;s really enjoyable. The 6 six new units are varied between terrible and great: Cyclone is a joke, Liberator is interesting, Adepts are pretty annoying but also cool, Ravager is really forgettable, just like the Disruptor but Lukers are AMAZING - as a Brood War veteran zerg player I really like to use them again! All other balance changes are generally okay and the sped up gameplay is strange at first but ultimately it&apos;s not that bad. Summarizing all this I give multi 9/10.
<br>
<br>Verdict: this game is okay, but really mediocre if I want to be honest. The biggest problem is that this is not really &quot;Starcrafty&quot; anymore - ofc it has everything but this is still a mess without a real soul. For this my heart is bleeding but I have to give it 6/10... wait... this dumb garbage cost me 35 &#x20AC;!!!! For this overpriced DLC I could have bought 2 or 3 better games!!!! Let&apos;s lower its score to 4/10 and now my soul in peace again.

<br>This is another Blizzard masterpirce, almost perfect and very well polished game. There is nothing to complain about &#x2013; plot &#x2013; at least for first missions &#x2013; is great, same as in HotS and WoL, graphics are superb, difficulty is high enough &#x2013; playing on Brutal can really add some adrenaline to your veins :)
<br>
<br>Another thing I want to point &#x2013; is awesome cinematics &#x2013; both in-game and movie-like &#x2013; just great, you can really feel like you are watching a movie, you can fill epicness of the moment.
<br>
<br>However, I want to explain why I didn&#x2019;t put 10 in the review. The game is awesome, right, but majority of the features were taken from Wings of Liberty (HotS had the same problem too) &#x2013; same system with few things remade. That&#x2019;s why I didn&#x2019;t put 10 mark here, and that&#x2019;s why I say Wings of Liberty was better &#x2013; that was really new game, and this is not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5756199">Expand</a></span>

<br>One of the best Real Time Strategies ever. Single player campaign has one of the most epic plots ever, No bugs, No glitches, Available in most languages,  MP, is good but i don&apos;t play it too much so I cant say anything bad.</span>

It&apos;s worse than Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm, because at least the former are so cheesy that it&apos;s funny...whereas the Protoss race is just so serious and boring throughout.
<br>
<br>OK now for the good parts that make it the best RTS in existence right now.
<br>
<br>Single-player Campaign - Best designed campaign missions. Cool campaign exclusive units and abilities. As someone who mains Zerg, the campaign&apos;s learning curve was perfect to introduce me to Protoss game mechanics.
<br>The CG remains Blizzard quality, which means they are extremely well done and fun to watch. A total contrast to the crappy story and dialogue.
<br>
<br>Multi-player Versus -
<br>1 vs 1:  I gotta say it&apos;s rough coming back, the last time I played SC2 competitively was 2010/11 during WoL. It&apos;s depressing going from remotely good (reached Diamond Rank 12 of my division after 250+ 1v1s) to a straight n00b. APM dropped from 100 to like 50... but I digress. The overall changes were very positive, it encourages more action rather than the old meta of  &quot;harass each other while building a 200/200 deathball&quot; because you are forced to aggressively expand from the start. The beginning amount of workers went from 6 to 12 so your build orders will have to change, and it really enables players to pile on the aggression early on if they choose to, or if you are a Zerg, be really greedy and 3 hatch right off the bat. The new units breath fresh air into the game as well, you have to remember 1 new unit in an RTS game = many many new army compositions and strategies.
<br>Archon Mode: Fun alternative to your typical 2v2. It&apos;s actually pretty crazy what you can do with 2 mediocre players.
<br>Co-op Missions: Like Archon mode, it&apos;s another less stressful mode for less hardcore players. Some of these missions I feel like I&apos;m playing Dota or something.
<br>
<br>On top of all that you have user generated custom games in the Arcade mode...
<br>
<br>In conclusion, this is the best RTS game available bar none and I am certain Blizzard will keep improving the multiplayer with updates and rebalances to the meta.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5779188">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I play this game on an old laptop ( Dual Core 2,8Ghz, Radeon HD 4670 Mobility, 4GB Ram DDR2, Win 8.1)  and it runs decent, maybe some improvements will come with future patches.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is the best &quot;value per coin&quot; you can get, i spent easily thousand hours with all these mods, especially the remakes of old wc 3 maps. The coopmissions and Archonmode are the best thing, that could happen to everyone with a good friend, who is not into rts. Just try it out, and get addicted.
<br>
<br>Thanks Blizzard, and to everyone else: gl&amp;hf !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5771065">Expand</a></span>

The HotS campaign was a step ahead, but still not top notch like in the olden days (Starcraft / Brood War). Now with LotV Blizzard finally committed fully to achieve a great campaign - and I can tell you, they succeeded! I especially loved the atmosphere, the characters and the way how they implemented upgrades / unit modifications. Additionally for SC II veterans there finally is some real challenge with the brutal mode, which actually is really brutal.
<br>
<br>On top of that Blizzard did extensive modifications and improvements to the multiplayer mode, which make LotV appear like a completly new game instead of just a mere add-on.
<br>
<br>In short my faith in Blizzard is re-established with LotV, which is the best RTS game out there.
<br>
<br>Highly recommended to anyone who appreciates polished high quality games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5728815">Expand</a></span>

There were plenty of missions to play with a lot of units, including SC1 units. Co-op missions were finally added, which people have been wanting for ages. Also you&apos;re able to deploy things from your main battleship like orbital bombardment which is a nice touch. However there is no space battle where you get to use the Grand fleet. Also near the end the story became lackluster. There was 0 character conflict, everyone was in agreement. They hype up this battle against Amon but the Zerg and Terran are mostly nowhere to be found in most of this campaign except at the very end. Apparently they were pointlessly defending their worlds or something while the Protoss did the heavy lifting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5739474">Expand</a></span>

I am in love and awe with this game, it reminds me of the original butterflies of playing the first starcraft world. Thank you Blizzard in your care for this game, it was something us fans had been waiting for. My life for Aiur.</span>

<br>
<br>More multiplayer options like co-op and archon mode. While co-op itself is nothing new (players have been making co-op maps since SC1), the setting of commanders and the co-op group finder is quite interesting. Archon mode is also interesting.
<br>
<br>The story and lore of the LotV 19 levels. While I personally want to see more about other smaller Protoss tribes (like how LotV was originally advertised) and dislike the big concept of the so called &quot;end wars&quot;, but it really is HotS being bad and LotV can&apos;t really be successful coming in saving everything.
<br>
<br>Overall more Starcraft in a time when RTS aren&apos;t popular is always good. I have been an RTS fan for a long time - I don&apos;t like MOBAs. I have been playing a bit of lots of old RTS games such as C&amp;C series and loved many of them, but there aren&apos;t a lot of new RTS stuff right now.
<br>
<br>The not all that great:
<br>
<br>The &quot;into the void&quot; campaign. Big closure ... also big cheesy cliche.
<br>Only 3 levels to play as P/T/Z also leaves a lot to be desired. Revelation of Xel&apos;Naga is quite disappointing as well.
<br>
<br>The variety of campaign levels is also ... meh. Too much of &quot;there are 3/4/5 objectives on map, get them all&quot; stuff while at the same time, enemies spawn out of nowhere to attack your base.
<br>
<br>Artanis being somewhat too perfect of a character (and Raynor and Kerrigan in LotV/into the void). Raynor still gets drunk from time to time in WoL and Kerrigan, while very cliched, can still be a dark hero in HotS, the three race&apos;s &quot;protagonists&quot; suddenly become perfect in LotV.
<br>
<br>Overall not that much of an upgrade over the base SC2 - and at the same time not any bonus towards WoL/HotS players. But it&apos;s been like 5 years and I can understand that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5820862">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_5674247"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">If you don&apos;t care about the story of this game and just want a good RTS this game is really good, probably the best RTS right now on the market, the missions are ok and the difficulty is pretty balanced.
<br>
<br>As a fan of the original SC though I must say I am really disappointed how the story of all SC2 went down.
<br>I hoped that with the final expansion they would redeem themselves and give SC2 the proper ending it deserved.
<br>What we got instead was just more disappointment.
<br>
<br>Spoilers ahead so don&apos;t read any further if you want to avoid them.
<br>
<br>-First of all the protoss are protoss just for their look: if you just changed the looks of the protoss and made them humans you wouldn&apos;t really be able to find differences, their features as an alien race have long been forgotten, as Blizzard decided to take even the Khala out of the equation; forget the great epic speeches from Tassadar, Artanis and Zeratul from the original game too.
<br>-There are just 3 hybrids units in the whole game...
<br>-The death of Zeratul: it happens really, really early in the game and in the freaking anime samurai slashing style against a corrupted Artanis. It left a really bad taste in my mouth to see him go down like this and after not being used at all in this campaign aside from going into temples to read the profecy or whatever.
<br>Without writing too much let&apos;s go directly to the end of the story.
<br>-The long awaited XelNagas are revealed to be some elephant-squid giants (really Blizzard?) and Kerrigan becomes one of them because of the plot. She then returns to her love (that came out of nowhere) Jim and they walk into the light.  What a joke.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5674247">Expand</a></span>

However, my main complain is about MP balance and gameplay since Starcraft is a competitive RTS. Legacy of the Void pretty much killed Starcraft 2 for me. As a Terran player, this game is no longer fun to play. It&apos;s rather frustrating and stressful to be honest as a master league. The whole expansion pretty much nerf Terran from economic changes and unit designs. I won&apos;t get much into balance specifics, but it honestly feel like an uphill battle from the start. And once it gets to the late game like  when the 8 armored ultralisk came out, it&apos;s pretty much over. Terran used to have mid-early game advantage to secure a competitive late game, but that&apos;s hardly the case now. I think many of the pros share the same feeling and many legendary Terran players have retired since Legacy of the Void came out. Other pro players like Polt seems to share the same frustration.
<br>
<br>Balance aside, the worst part is that the development team took forever to make changes. The obviously broken Protoss adept, it took them over 2 months after release a slight nerf to it. They had the whole beta to themselves, and I just don&apos;t see how they release such a broken game. Hots was patched very quick like the overpowered hell bat drops.  At this rate, I feel like many Terran players will just move on and put SC2 to rest.
<br>
<br>I would honestly save your money if you&apos;re Terran players. Even if my argument is invalid, it&apos;s just not fun to play Terran anymore. It&apos;s going to require not only a simple balance change to the units, but also a fundamental changes how Terran work to make it more interesting in which I highly doubt it will happen. I can&apos;t even play mech anymore, and massing MMM for the last 5 years can get very old quick.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re casual players, the coop missions are free and I think they are better than the paid campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=6072762">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Plot: Biggest disappointment, Every second word in LOTS is about honour, glory, tradition, unification and other noble sparkles. Every third is void, misery, pain and bla bla bla. Lots of talk, no information at all. Why Amon wanted to destroy the world? What are his motives? Amon become Xel Naga like Kerrigan years ago, and now consider him as a antagonist because Blizzard says so? Whole Amon story is so weak, without good background, plot is flat as my exgirl chest.
<br>
<br>Gameplay. Repeatable. Single is single-use. Missions are forcing you to use one, fixed by developers strategy, mostly well know from HOTS and WOL. Multi - few new units, but ball of death strategy stays on, and that can get bored...
<br>
<br>And more from me. Its outrageous that blizzard games graphics are so similar. You can take xel naga power infused kerrigan and put her into diablo III. Explosions, rays and whole models in my opinion are repetitious. Even gameplay between starcraft and warcraft III is almost identical. Switch Iron claws to zealot psi blades. So big studio, and only one guy is developing graphic style?...
<br>Female Protoss.... Protoss with breast and bras... Well, when I was playing first starcraft I though that protoss are so telekinetic and so psionic that they dont breed like horses. How stupid I was... Only differences between terrans and protoss are again noble sparkles...
<br>
<br>In summary I am 28 years old big fan of Starcraft 1, maybe because, in my opinion, it was made by people to people, not by managers, market strategists, public relations specialists. I am no longer a marketing target to blizzard...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=5730877">Expand</a></span>

<br>Multiplayer features are great, but campaign ruined game for me.</span>
