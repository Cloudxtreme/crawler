It provides absolutely nothing but an annoying and dull experience&#x2026; I have read some of the comments on the forum where people have said once you get past the first few hours you will come to enjoy it! Really no, I don&#x2019;t want to waste my time doing that, the fundamental aim is to collect blocks and then use them again in a different area as a set of stairs or climbing apparatus&#x2026; That for me is not enough to make an enjoyable puzzle game&#x2026; I really try to find something good to say about a game, but for this I just really can&#x2019;t!

The plot is as follows: Alexey and Markus are working on a secret project: a small robot capable of digging blocks. However, when they said &quot;secret project&quot;, most people assumed it was a game. When no game is released, an angry fan sends some of his men to kidnap the game developpers so they can finish their game sooner. The problem: they have no game, just a robot. They decide to send their robot out to help them, however, the robot is not even in alpha. Thus, the robot has to upgrade itself if it wants to help its creators. The aesthetics are very colorful and pleasing to the eye, even if they are very simple. The game itself is a 2D puzzle-platformer with Minecraft-esque elements and tetranimoes. There are many types of blocks you can collect, each behaving like they do in minecraft (e.g. sand is affected by gravity, where as other blocks don&apos;t). Unlike Minecraft, though, you can&apos;t just place a block. In this game, you must arrange them into a Tetranimo before placing them. You can also eliminate a line of eight or more blocks to get them out of the way. These gameplay devices comes into play a lot. There are also &quot;boss&quot; levels, which require you to think fast. The platforming itself is smooth, and you will rarely find yourself mad because Tetrobot didn&apos;t respond quick enough. The humor in the game is also good, and you will often chuckle when Alexey and Markus reference each others games. There is also a level editor and a community level hub, so players can share their creations as well as play and rate levels made by other people, effectively adding an infinite amount of replay value. To sum it up, Blocks that matter is a great game with a simple but entertaining story, eye-pleasing aesthetics, fun and unique gameplay, smooth controls, humor and a level editor, and it&apos;s very cheap too (five dollars on Steam). I highly recommend buying this game, even if you don&apos;t particularly like Minecraft OR Tetris.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blocks-that-matter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1730007">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not that keen on the twitch gameplay of being rushed by giant bosses on the few occasions they appear, but I got through it without much trouble. The levels aren&apos;t that big, so it isn&apos;t that annoying if you have to start again after making a mistake. It lasts around 6-7 hours, which is good value for its cost. This game hasn&apos;t sold very well, unlike Braid and Portal, so you should support the developers who have crafted this great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blocks-that-matter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765021">Expand</a></span>

The Adventure Mode has about 40 levels total, and there are also about 20 optional bonus levels to be unlocked as you collect hard to reach blocks locked in chests through each area. You are also given access to several bonus levels that have tie-ins to other games that were included in the same Humble Bundle that must also be unlocked. If all of those levels were not enough, you also have access to numerous player-made levels that are available for download in-game. The artwork is cute and interesting to look at, but is not rich with much animation. The main character is a small robot by the name of Tetrabot, and it looks very much like a little clothes washing machine. The puzzles aren&apos;t too complicated, but I do find myself restarting each level many times in order to get them right. Especially the last ten or so levels are quite difficult and will require your focused thoughts and attention to hit upon a solution. Your goal is to manipulate blocks in the environment in order to gain passage to other sections of the levels and to exit through portals. The music is very good, and of the ambient chiptune genre. This is a relaxing game, and even its storyline is cute and fun. The chests (containing video game history trivia blocks) scattered throughout each level are mostly very difficult to reach, but they are not required to proceed. The premise of the game is very creative and does not resort to cheap gimmicks or pretentiousness to accomplish its goals. All puzzles are intuitive and logical, challenging the player in the most adequate of ways. Some levels are significantly more difficult than the majority, and you will retry many, many times, until you are able to pass it, but this does not subtract from the overall quality and enjoyment of the game. For completists, there are dozens of hours to be spent with Blocks That Matter, with all the additional content made available as bonuses and for free. The ending was adorable and continued to showcase the artists&apos; distinguished style. Even for someone such as myself, who does not enjoy puzzles as a whole, appreciated, rejoiced, and experienced hours of entertainment from this puzzle platformer gem. It took me about 9 hours to complete the Adventure Mode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blocks-that-matter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2096281">Expand</a></span>

I spent a good amount of time trying to figure out the bonus levels and they are really fun to play. Free updates have been coming for the game as well.

The built-in level editor and online level browser is just a bonus to this excellent indie game.  The light-hearted story, colourful graphics and memorable tunes really makes Blocks That Matter stand out from other indie games!  Highly recommended!</span>

The only thing that I did not like was the story. It was ok for a teenager&apos;s minecraft-and-tetris-fan-story, but it wasn&apos;t a decent video game story.<p></p>
<br>Anyway  I would recommend this game to anyone.</span>

<br>It&apos;s not awful, but it doesn&apos;t do anything to earn my recommendation. You might enjoy it if you like puzzle-platformers, but there are better examples of the genre out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blocks-that-matter/user-reviews?user_review_id=5665922">Expand</a></span>
