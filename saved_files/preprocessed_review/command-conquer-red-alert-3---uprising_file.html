<br>
<br>Anyway, there are 4 campaigns to choose, allies, soviets, empire and yuriko which is a personal story about the special unit the empire have, Yuriko Omega. You have to play the soviets first though a mission or two to unlock the others and the only two stories I like in this one is the soviets and Yuriko&apos;s because I could understand why they want to do stuff, but the other two is merely a grab for power and such.
<br>
<br>Alll in all, nice new units, but the campaigns are a bit short so it&apos;s a okey buy and you don&apos;t need red alert 3 to run so maybe buy it when it&apos;s on sale like I did, I believe. Unless you are a HUGE fan of C&amp;C.
<br>
<br>Also having completed it I have discovered the challenge mode. This is where you get to play as any of the three groups, however you have limited tech and the only way to get it is by defeating your opponent. For instance, the first test match is against an Allied general who uses only dogs (attack dogs being for first unlock) so the best way to win is just to build up basic tanks and bulldoze the place to nothing. Easy right? Until you look at the other missions involving far more advanced technology and it gets worse later when the generals have ALL their tech and you only have what you&apos;ve unlocked. Quite addictive though and requires more stratey as some maps even have unique units too like the bears map has giant bears that can actually destroy vehicles.
<br>
<br>Certainly not the worst C&amp;C game, but it really is just a expansion to Red Alert 3 even though it&apos;s seporate and the challenges are fun.  It&apos;s pretty fun and okay with a interesting story surrounding Yuriko Omega, but atleast it isn&apos;t C&amp;C 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3---uprising/user-reviews?user_review_id=3406890">Expand</a></span>

It starts out by adding a sleek new Japanese song to the introduction and showing a decisive lack of Multiplayer options. This was okay for me since I don&apos;t generally play RTS games online, since I suck so bad at them. However, I started getting into the campaign just to see that each campaign was &quot;blacked out&quot; until you played the first Soviet mission. I proceeded to play the campaign and although it was horrendously short, it was slightly challenging and gave for good gameplay. I then came upon the last mission, which borders on the near impossible, even when playing easy. If you&apos;re worried about spoilers, skip this part and go to the next paragraph. The &quot;FutureTech&quot; corporation, a monstrous defense contractor working for the Allies, has begun development of several superweapons which will help keep the Allies dominant on the battlefield and advance their own hidden agenda, which is completely left vague... The end mission consists of you assaulting the superweapon of FutureTech, the Sigma Harmonizer, which stops time for a short span of time. If this was not infuriating enough, the AI sends 4 insanely difficult and massively destructive Supertanks at you, which shoot small shots that expand and do massive damage to everything in sight. Its preferred tactic, go right into the middle of your base, shoot the beam until the whole thing is leveled. Setting up defenses doesn&apos;t work because they blow through them in a couple of shots. Massing units to bring it down doesn&apos;t work, since it kills them in a couple of shots, and trying hit and run tactics doesn&apos;t work either since it just goes to the middle of your base and shoots, ignoring the other units and causing horrendous destruction in its wake. Not only that, the AI sends land units, sea units, and air units to pummel your base into submission. I tried several times alternating units, tactics, and strategies and nothing worked. Oh yeah, forget about air units since an inaccessible airbase is somehow dominating the airspace on the map. I ended up rage-quitting and I&apos;m not sure when I&apos;m going to bother to pick the damn thing up again. They also added a new Yuriko campaign, which briefly explains how Yuriko came into being and what happened to her after the campaign. It was pointless to include it in the campaign. Like the other campaigns, it was short, and it explained little. Although seeing a more powerful Yuriko was slightly fun, it ended up just being incredibly boring and easy. While I really haven&apos;t seen all of the new units, particularly the Japanese ones, I have to say the expansion disappointed me severely. Some say Kane&apos;s Wrath was a terrible expansion, but I don&apos;t agree. Uprising, however, really sparks my anger, frustration, and rage mainly at the fact that I was willing to spend money on it the first place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3---uprising/user-reviews?user_review_id=732927">Expand</a></span>

Despite minor improvements such as the 50 challenge missions, a Yuriko campaign, 12 new units and new characters, this game is still very much the same and it&apos;s not as better as RA3. Even some game critics are calling out no MP, poor AI, unbalanced gameplay and lacking co-op play in those campaign missions. This expansion development rush makes me think only one thing: that Kane&apos;s Wrath deserved their uprising rather than Yuriko Omega and the Empire of the Rising Sun faction. With no epic units, no sub-factions, no Yuri, poor balancing, slow economic gameplay (with the wrong resources), fair AI, sexy characters and two wrong roles in RA3 Uprising (Ric Flair as Commander Hill and Jamie Chung as Japan Lieut.)makes me think this is one of the worst expansion packs in the C&amp;C series, even worse than Kane&apos;s Wrath! EALA continues to do their worst to ruin the C&amp;C franchise by making up the worst possible stuff they could ever develop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3---uprising/user-reviews?user_review_id=730329">Expand</a></span>

Step 3: craft a really lame and superficial campaign for each fraction as a wrap-around. Step 4: add Yuriko to the mix. Thus, Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert 3 Uprising has been born.
<br>
<br>Uprising isn&apos;t a bad game. However, it wants to do so many thing at once that it can&apos;t achieve a single one of them (well, except one: Yuriko). All three factions got a new mini-campaign which takes place after the original game with the Allies winning the war over the Soviets and the Empire. None of the stories are overlapping this time like they were in the original game. There are 10 levels for the three factions combined and all of them are hard as hell. Even on medium difficulty you will be constantly attacked by the enemy on land, water and in the air. Sometimes the game gets so difficult that it will be annoyingly frustrating. Some levels may require over 1-2 hours to complete on medium and not because they are so long, but because you have to retry constantly.
<br>
<br>The basic gameplay structure hasn&apos;t changed, but some new units were introduced on all 3 sides. Some of them are really unconventional and they can upset your good ol&apos; strategies. The building system remained the same, but less than half of the stages start with base building. On most of them you start off with a smaller group and you have to complete some tasks before HQ can send you an MCV. These commando missions are fresh at first but they very quickly became annoying...for all the players crying out loud: just give us a base and let us build an army! We don&apos;t want to play commando with conscripts and attack dogs against tanks and robots! This and the annoying difficulty will make you believe that the creators used these cheap tricks to make the game last longer. Even though it will last longer, they will remain cheap tricks.
<br>
<br>On the visual side the game looks great. Water movement is excellent, explosions are beautiful and devastating. You just can&apos;t get enough of a dozen Apocalypse Tank annihilating the enemy base. Splendid! Anyone who has seen a Red Alert game knows that its&apos; cutscenes are performed by flesh and blood human actors and actresses. Also anyone can tell that these cutscenes are missing one thing only and that is good acting. The actors are still unconvincing and disbelieving, not that the words that were put into their mouths are any better. Sometimes you just wish the next cut-scene will be a lot shorter and without any speech at all. The debrief ladies look hot though and the short skirt of that Gemma Atkinson&apos;s won&apos;t disappoint you.
<br>
<br>When you finish the campaigns you can try the most innovative and fun part of the game. Yuriko&apos;s mini-campaign. She is a psyche with mental powers capable of devastating armies. You have access to 4 powers at one time. After using a power you have to wait for the cooldown time. You can brainwash enemies to fight on your side, create black holes that suck everything inside or simply heal yourself with her powers. This game mode is really interesting, intriguing and its the greatest fun you can find in this game.
<br>
<br>When you are done with the mini-campaigns you can play Skirmish, where nothing has changed from the original or play Challenge missions which are actually a lot like Skirmish maps only with cutscenes and a limited arsenal. When you beat a challenge new ones will appear and by beating them you can unlock new units to fight with. Before starting a map you can always select your fraction. It&apos;s nothing groundbreaking but thanks to the limited arsenal and gameplay tweaks this game mode can engage lots of players. And finally, there is the multiplayer...oh...wait...there aren&apos;t any MP or Co-op modes in this game! No MP in an RTS game. Well played EA, just well played!
