<br>The storyline however is a bit disappointing as you can often get lost not knowing what to do unless you check a walkthrough online.
<br>It does manage to make you feel like a pirate and the environment is pretty well made with nice cities to interact with: You can purchase or sell materials to the merchant, purchase new ships, talk to the Governor of the city, check the tavern for crew mates or rumors, and some side quests that can help you out earning coins early in the game. I also like the feature of recruiting other ships into your fleet. That&apos;s quite interesting to have and it makes you feel like a pirate or, depending on what faction you serve, like a commander.
<br>The sea battles is where the game shines the most but the melee combat leaves a lot to be desired.
<br>This is definitely a difficult game where you need to plan carefully your each step and quickly adapt to the changes that come up.
<br>
<br>+ Nice graphics and a well shaped pirate world.
<br>+ A lot of ships to get and sail.
<br>+ Gameplay on the sea is really neat.
<br>+ Lots of paths to take in the story if you know how.
<br>
<br>- Difficult story to get into, some tips would&apos;ve been way more helpful.
<br>- Melee combat when you board or get boarded could&apos;ve been better but it does the job.
<br>- Takes a while to fully get into the game due to the difficult beginning and lack of hints and tips.
<br>
<br>Overall the game covers the pirate theme well and I would recommend it to any pirate game lovers.
<br>It&apos;s a gem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sea-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=6607505">Expand</a></span>
