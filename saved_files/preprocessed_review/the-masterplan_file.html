It puts players into control of a small group of crooks (1-4 people), the goal being to complete tasks each mission such as... stealing money, snagging memos (unlocking more levels) and taking fliers (unlocking more guns and gadgets). The beginning of the game is very simple and only gets more complex as you go on. If I had to compare it to any other game I would say its a mix between doorkickers and payday.
<br>The Masterplan has a great hostage system as well, allowing players to control and order hostages as long as they have a gun trained on them. These orders can be just about anything you can do with your own goons, this can be very helpful in situations were you need a helping hand to smash a cash register or to knock some one out.
<br>The game also has a decent detection and stealth system, using a basic cone of vision like most stealth games. When a guard spots you a red meter will fill up, when it does they will come after their target wielding batons. Civilians and camera monitors do the same except instead of attacking they will run to a phone to call in the police (who have guns).
<br>The tasks each mission usually revolve around stealing money, which is done by taking it from vaults, safes and people. Safes will need a drill to get into, Vaults need a key and people need to be taken hostage. Other objectives can include stealing drugs, useless items and jewelry which will in turn instantly give money. Along with money you can also find memos and fliers, for more guns, gadgets and levels.
<br>Although this game does bring a lot to the table i cant fully recommend it, because of the dreadful bugs . It may seem like a good game but when it comes down to it, the bugs are terrible. So far for me, the opening mission cant go 20 seconds without blurring the screen with random text in mixed German and English. Thankfully the first mission is skipped if the game is exited and reopened. The second mission, which is mandatory is also very buggy, the game is supposed to give you a pistol and some bullets which of course it doesn&apos;t. The next mission does the same thing...
<br>Bugs like this can ruin a game, and for new players it does. Especially with major bugs that start within the first three missions. Until these types of bugs are gone I would say to only buy the game on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-masterplan/user-reviews?user_review_id=5655806">Expand</a></span>
