Unfortunately, none of this can make up for the horrible multiplayer, the draconian DRM requirements (the game is forever tied to a single Windows Live for Games, or WLG, account), and the horrible technical support. The multiplayer server for the PC version of Section 8 requires an unique WLG Gamertag, so you cannot set up a dedicated server without buying an extra copy of the game. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t realize until after I had purchased this game that the community of active players is incredibly small due to all these problems. I tried signing up for the tech support forums 5 times, and although my account was created, I could not post on the forums or submit technical support requests. Section 8 could have been a great game--it had some pretty good concepts--but the implementation was all wrong. Game server companies couldn&apos;t even get Section 8 servers running until several months after the game was released, due to all the complications and horrible technical support from TimeGate Studios. Don&apos;t waste your money on Section 8--the reason there&apos;s no demo version available for PC is because nobody would have bought the full version if they had known how crippled the game was from the start.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8/user-reviews?user_review_id=742930">Expand</a></span>

The only thing new a game can bring to the table these days is story and/or graphics... or so I thought.  I disagree with the bashing of this game that so many others give so easily.  I for one am sick and tired of the run-of-the-mill shooters that are out there.  This game contains great science-fiction scenery and equipment, unique spawning, great visuals, and solid game play.  These days the game only costs $10 brand new.  How can you not justify a cost like that when much more generic shooters out there with no innovation whatsoever carry a $50-$70 price tag??  This game is balanced, unique, and rock-solid.  Don&apos;t listen to the moronic CoD fan-boys out there who bash games for not being CoD.  Every complaint I&apos;ve ever heard about this game relates somehow back to the fact that this game doesn&apos;t work just like every other FPS.  &quot;GOOD&quot; I say!  &quot;GREAT&quot; even!  Give me 100 more like this game before one more Call of Duty, Soldier of Fortune, Sniper Ghost Warrior, Turning Point, Turok, etc., etc., etc.,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8/user-reviews?user_review_id=1605548">Expand</a></span>

The single player is extremely simple and if you die, it doesnt matter, just drop back in and keep shooting. It also doesnt help that there are about 2 weapons that completely dominate and any other you have to camp or rush recklessly to get a kill. Every vehicle is so slow that an one guy (infantry) can easily take it out in about 15 seconds. Some say the multiplayer is great, maybe it is to them, but I dislike it. Fights between 2 full health people can last well over the recommended 30 seconds of intensity and become very boring. But if you are into nearly dying then getting shot in the back, and never getting above a 1.2 kill to death because everyone uses the same gun so there are no advantages, then spend the money on it, I wish I hadn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8/user-reviews?user_review_id=85357">Expand</a></span>

If you were a fan of the Tribes franchise then I would recommend this.

The multiplayer in Section 8 is fantastic. I will never understand why so many people have to compare games to others when they review. If you like another game better, go play that game. Section 8 feels very solid and simple, while having a bit of complexity underneath with its soldier attribute customization and arsenal choices. It is really something else to be taking a strategic point for the team, and then having to choose your next objective due the three or four side missions popping up while capping. In Section 8 you will multi task, plan, and customize. This game for worth the money, in my opinion, without a doubt. 9 for the great multiplayer experience. -1 just for it&apos;s lack of interesting campaign, but the campaign is really easy even on hard, so achievement hunters will like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8/user-reviews?user_review_id=84403">Expand</a></span>

The MP is 3/4 Battlefield 2 with the remaining parts made up of Tribes and Halo.  The primary game mode is like BF&apos;s conquest although I find it much less cumbersome to capture &quot;Control Points&quot; than in BF2.  There are 2 ground vehicles as well as a handful of stationary deployables at one&apos;s disposal that can be used for offense or defense.  Unlike Battlefield 2, I liked this game because the weapons have very little spread although it does take a LOT of damage to kill someone.  The trick in being successful is to get a feel for the shield penetrating range of the weapons or learn to use grenades, mortars, or detpacks to drop the shields quickly.  Yes, in addition to standard health (Armor) you also have a shield that protects you from longer range shots.  Because of the large amount of damage it takes to kill an opponent, this game rewards working in small squads.  My three major gripes for this game are 1) Slow strafe speed 2) The game comes with a lock-on feature that works like an aimbot.  It is important to note that the lock-on feature can be countered with a Sensor Blocker device. 3) It&apos;s easy to track enemy players through walls using the enemy indicator arrow.  This detracts from the &quot;cat-and-mouse&quot; of killing opponents.  I used to play some competition in other games so I&apos;m surprised the aimbot and wallhack functions haven&apos;t put me off this game.  I kept playing it and having fun and hope to get 3-6 months of enjoyment out of the game.  This game is very kind to newbies, so if you normally pass because it&apos;s too hard you should give it a shot.
<br>
<br>Singleplayer: This game was obviously designed as a multiplayer game with a singleplayer element tacked on at the end.  I did NOT buy this game for the singleplayer so I am fine with that.  Some of the things like orbital spawning work well in multiplayer but don&apos;t work well in singleplayer (one vehicle escort mission in particular jumps to mind).  The story and dialogue plays like it was written as high school fan fiction.  The dialogue in general is just a string of military jargon that reminds me of a bad 80s Vietnam movie.  The writer is straining so much to make the characters tough and hard that they forget to make them human.  However, the voice actors do the best they can with the material.  In short, the singleplayer is more training for the multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8/user-reviews?user_review_id=84420">Expand</a></span>

Those that say it takes forever to kill someone, they don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing. Each gun has a specific strength and weakness. If it takes them a whole clip to kill, then they aren&apos;t using their weapons wisely. The game gives way to many different styles and strategies. One load out may do really well one round, but the enemy can adapt and overcome with a new load out they create in the middle of the battle, on the field. DCM&apos;s (Dynamic Combat Missions) change the flow of the game and can usually only be accomplished by good team work. The dev&apos;s have struggled some, but they seem to be fairly responsive. Overall it&apos;s a very different FPS. It won&apos;t turn into the same point and shoot after a few days like the Halo&apos;s and COD&apos;s. It&apos;s different each time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8/user-reviews?user_review_id=738187">Expand</a></span>

You might as well skip the singleplayer as you can still learn everything in multiplayer. With that in mind, this game is by far one of the best multiplayer games I&apos;ve played and will surely keep me hooked for months to come. The game is entirely about teamwork. While some would say that games that revolve around teamwork never work out, the teamwork in Section 8 comes out organically. Everyone wants to work as a team because it&apos;s the only way to win and score points. Fighting by yourself will get you nowhere, fact. The game forces you into squads and gives you extra points and money for working with your squad. People work together in Section 8 almost all the time. There are tons of customazation options. You can choose 2 weapons, 2 tools, and 10 passive modules which work similar to CoD4&apos;s perk system, except you can choose how much of each perk you want. The balance of loadouts is usually between specialization and versatility. If you want a well rounded loudout, you would pick a variaity of weapons, tools, and modules. But if you wanted a loudout made for one thing only, like destroying tanks, you would probably pick a missile launcher, mortar, det packs, and cash all your modules in on damage. You would destroy tanks like no other for sure, but you&apos;re not as versatile as a well rounded class. There&apos;s where more teamwork comes in. If you combine your firepower with other members of your team, no one man can stop you. Everything is about teamwork, and you&apos;ll be working with your team even without realizing it sometimes. I recommend this to any fans of Battlefield games and Tribes games.

If you have a somewhat old system, you can be sure that your system probably would be able to handle it. Gameplay-wise, Section 8 feels a lot like the Battlefield series, except that it is more fluid in that weapon loadout can be customised in-field. It also operates on a squad system, but individual infantry are much tougher thanks to the Power Armour they are equipped with. (Which I highly suspect that they took the idea from Warhammer 40k). Vehicles are rare and not easy to obtain, but insane firepower can be assured once a tank is on the field. Each infantry is able to fly for a short time(4 sec+/-) due to the power armour, which introduces a third dimension into the FPS. To counter the benefits of flying, each infantry is also able to lock-on their targets for a short time. Personally I find both features to be a great addition to an otherwise boring sci-fi version of Battlefield. Perhaps it is just me, but I find that infantries are far too tough. One would think that a sniper could take out another infantry easily, long-range. But due to the nature of the power armour (equipped with a force field) it would take an entire magazine to kill someone, which I personally find quite ridiculous. Overall, I find the experience to be great for multiplayer. But the single player campaign is pretty terrible, which pulls down its ratings. Try it if you like the Battlefield series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/section-8/user-reviews?user_review_id=84593">Expand</a></span>
