The best part is that the puzzle solutions are still logical, but are difficult enough I authentically got stuck twice (with hints off), which never happened to me in any of the previous episodes. Took me 5+ hours. Would be an 8, but I tacked off one point for Moai voice acing (they don&apos;t sound like stone statues...) and for the beginning, which did not feel very well put together (a triangle chasing Sybil?

I did get through the game with liberal uses of a walkthrough, but I didn&apos;t like the fact that I had to use one :P Some people did like the challenge, but for the rest of us who have a real life and want to get back to it as soon as possible, games that are too difficult aren&apos;t very enjoyable. Also, I suffer from a very short term memory which made the game that much more difficult. For example, there&apos;s a part where stinky sells a &quot;basalt sandwich&quot; which you need, but she&apos;ll only give it to you later in the game when you get transformed into youngsters (it&apos;s a &quot;kid&apos;s meal&quot;). Trouble is, by the time I needed it, I&apos;d forgotten what the kid&apos;s meal consists of (she tells you early in the game), and stinky doesn&apos;t tell you (she only tells you that it&apos;s only for kids). For someone with an abysmal memory, this wasn&apos;t enjoyable at all</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sam-max-episode-202-moai-better-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=2926417">Expand</a></span>
