I&apos;m only a few hours into the campaign but so far the story is compelling and the tactical and methodical nature of the single player is a refreshing diversion from the chaos of multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5074824">Expand</a></span>

A risky break from traditional Battlefield, and a risk that has sadly failed. I participated in the Alpha and Beta, and pre-ordered the game &quot;hoping&quot; they would get it right... Sadly they didn&apos;t.... Whilst Hotwire can be fun to play, its about all their is to the game, the weapons are unbalanced, with Guns like the K10 awesomely OP comapred to the rest (fastest rate of fire, and the most damage per bullet??), It needed a massive patch from day one, EA admitted it, but 2 months down the track, nothing, nada zip zero.... Player base? non existant, if you want o play Hardline, buy it on the PS4, its the only platform with any semblance of a community playing it. Yes it is still &quot;fun&quot; and the single player a bit better than other BF titles, but in short, it just leaves a sour taste in your mouth..... so much so I hopped on EA support and asked for a refund after 40 hours gametime, and 2 months after purchase..... Suprise suprise, they actually refunded the money too.... A sure sign that all is not well with the title.... If you have money to burn, then buy it, you might play it now and again, if you are on a budget, buy something else.... This game is not value for money, and is just a massive disappointing for any &quot;true&quot; BF fan. It should have been released as optional DLC for BF4, as that&apos;s all is really is....
<br>Dont hold your breath for Battlefront either, EA and DICE seem to have lost the plot lately.... Heres hoping some other studio use&apos;s the Unreal 4 engine and makes a decent FPS game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5275073">Expand</a></span>

I paid 130 bucks for bf4, totally upgraded my computer thinking it would fix the crap crashes, didn&apos;t work.  This game is just a skin from bf4.  booo DICE.  thanks for ruining my favorite game of 8 years DICE. Hardline stinks of DICE btw.

Then comes the multiplayer - the only part of this game that was even a tiny bit fun.... however you only get a couple hours out of it before you&apos;re just like &quot;okay.... is that it?&quot;  And yes.... that is it. Oh no one last GREAT feature of this game is how easy it is to send DDOS attacks to other players. I literally got DDOSed only 147 minutes into my playtime. And that was the end of my attempt to enjoy the game.
<br>
<br>I really don&apos;t like giving any games a zero, but considering the wealth of the people who produced this game - Battlefield Hardline must have really required absolutely NO effort.... and therefor earns my first ZERO ever... and hopefully my only one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5237064">Expand</a></span>

Hardline maps feel really small, time to kill you is too quick, hardly any guns to choose from, there are no tanks, ships, etc..It feels like this game should have came out 10 years ago. bottom line, DON&apos;T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME on Hardline.</span>

Too many chokepoints. Balance? Don&apos;t make me laugh. Relies on DLC, and who  is going to buy premium for a dead game?</span>

Because in all honesty in the first hour there was 15 minutes of gameplay and most of that was tutorials. I don&#x2019;t know about others but I seriously dislike this &#x201C;sitting along for the ride&#x201D; controlling the mouse and randomly staring at unimportant features of the game world as I listen to the constant droning of the story.
<br>
<br>Battlefield does this a lot, mixing the idea of storyline and game, but it has yet to achieve the balance. Personally I wish it would stop altogether, you don&apos;t see people signing up to the BF servers for the storyline and it&#x2019;s true about fps games in general. Storyline is an added benefit, if done well can be the cherry on top, but by no means important in this game genre. So don&#x2019;t give me story immersion and then force me to sit through it, because I&#x2019;d rent a cop movie if I wanted that.
<br>
<br>So the added features for this game is the Arrests, as instead of shooting you have the ability of a &#x201C;peaceful takedown&#x201D;, a novelty that wears off in a matter of moments. Seriously if you as an officer of the law booked in that many criminals in one day your colleagues would hate you for the paper work you had just descend on them. So what is the point of arrest in this game? Just the points, the moral alternative that has no purpose except tricking you into believing that game and real life are the same&#x2026; and by that extension you are a good person.
<br>
<br>In the quest to become something more than a fps Battlefield Hardline has gone soft. In the attempt to offer something more realistic in the battle scenario department, it should charge for criminal offenses. For trying to make me believe that life in the police force has any resemblance to this game it should be sentenced for perjury.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5427862">Expand</a></span>

<br>Hotwire is a nuttshell is a gamemode where you drive in circles and not doing anything and placing C4 at main roads so you can stop them.
<br>The heist is the only iconic gamemode where there is kinda suited for this game.
<br>The conquest is stupid becouse it dosent have tanks.apc.and jets.
<br>The competative mode is stupid aswell its just a cut down version of bigger maps.

<br>if you use any form of sli or crossfire, the game have a memory leak that will crash your game 5 min into playing. Google BFH Directx error sli and you will see plenty people having that problem. I run 2x 660 in sli and without sli I can barely run the game at the lowest settings. with sli I can run ultra settings 100 fps but only for about 5 min because of the memory leak.

<br>&quot;You are running windows 10, its your own fault&quot; - people might say. And yes I do. And play GTA V, The Witcher 3, most blizzard games and countless other steam games, all with the same system and OS. All running ultra settings, from Full HD to 4K/Ultra HD (use Samsungs cheap 4k monitor). SLI works for all the other games. 3 crashes in the Witcher 3 after 100 hours of gameplay. GTA V have a few more crashes, due to network

<br>I bought this game yesterday, waiting for EA/Dice to work out its flaws. I am such an idiot.
<br>You know what they say &quot;EA fool me 34 times ... &quot; Not again. My last BF game was BF3. Skipped BF4 because of its problems but was missing BF so I got this one. Well time for me to accept BF is a failed and milked to the max franchise, same as Dragon Age and I will be holding out on Mass Effect till I can pirate it(have both franchises legally on my origin account). I already payed for it with this 1 hour played overpriced garbage that I can not refund due to 3rd party seller..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5428624">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game feels so much like Battlefield 4, only having less.. fun. It&apos;s not completely terrible, but it doesn&apos;t work as a Battlefield game. Battlefield games are meant to be exhilarating and action-packed, but the lack of any fun or high-action really makes this game not work as well as you&apos;d expect. The gun balance isn&apos;t good, the maps are smaller compared to other BF games, and it&apos;s lacking in the one thing that makes a video game good: FUN. However there ARE some redeeming qualities about this game; the campaign is solid, the writing is funny, and.. wait is that it? Come on! I wanted to give this game a 7/10.. oh well. Overall, this game is easily the worst Battlefield game in the franchise so far, it just didn&apos;t work as well as EA wanted it to.

<br>Where to start? Let&apos;s start with the horrible, horrible weapons balancing. M16A3, M416 and K-10. If you&apos;re not using any of these three weapons you are at a stupidly large disadvantage. They are so over powered It Isn&apos;t even funny. I&apos;m not the type of player who likes using OP weapons, I like to use the less OP guns, If you feel the same way you will not enjoy this game - not one bit. 95% of the player base uses those three weapons and it doesn&apos;t matter If you start shooting two seconds ahead of them, they will kill you. It&apos;s just not fun at all. You&apos;ll want to smash things.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s buggy as hell, I can&apos;t believe nobody has mentioned all the bugs. It&apos;s actually as bad as Battlefield 4 was at launch, Examples; Set your loadout before you enter game? Nope, the game will give you the loadout you was using originally no matter what. You&apos;ll need to respawn/die to get the one you want. Want to change attachments for a weapon? It&apos;ll not register as that and It&apos;ll try changing the actual weapon. You&apos;ll want to smash things.
<br>
<br>Want to set a Sabotage bomb? It&apos;s random as to whether or not it will actually let you. It just doesn&apos;t register sometimes, or, only lets you put It on the smallest part of the vehicle / door or whatever. It&apos;ll get you killed and frustrate you beyond belief. You&apos;ll want to smash things.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve only really used Operator and mechanic thus far and found plenty bugs on both sides, can only imagine what the other two classes are.
<br>
<br>The games bugs will kill you, nowhere near as much as the M16, M14 or K-10 but a buggy game killing you Is very bad. You&apos;ll want to smash things.
<br>
<br>The assignments, the unlocks, the weapons you can use per class. Oh dearie me they are pathetic.
<br>
<br>Each weapon syndicate &quot;assignment&quot; takes you about 30+ hours, for one weapon unlock (It&apos;s actually three assignments in one) Battlefield 4 you could get them in two maybe three hours.
<br>
<br>The amount of weapons In the game Is a joke, want to use your favourite weapon In more than 50% of your playtime? Well, you can&apos;t unless you get 1250 kills with It first, then, purchase It for around oh i don&apos;t know $50,000. Seriously, 1250 kills? I just checked my battlefield 4 stats to find something close, one weapons has a kills per minute ratio of 2.1 and 1400+ kill count and I used It for twelve hours In total.
<br>
<br>In short, to unlock your favourite weapon so you can play with it as you please you&apos;ll have to put 10+ hours Into it. probably more like 24 hours if you&apos;re not averaging 2 kills per minute. Just to play with your weapon of choice on both factions. Oh and let&apos;s not forget half the time you&apos;ll not be able to use said weapon because It&apos;ll not be unlocked on the other faction. So you&apos;re looking at maybe 20-48 hours game play, half of that with a weapon you probably don&apos;t like at the VERY minimum. You&apos;ll want to smash things.
<br>
<br>And we all know after you&apos;ve put those seemingly countless hours Into the game to get what you wanted EA will just turn around and sell the weapons for unlocks on either side for $10 or whatever. Mark my words ladies and gentlemen.
<br>
<br>Literally no reason to have any weapons for operator and mechanic classes In this game apart from the M16 the M14 and K-10. They might as well delete the rest of the weapons from game and free up some hard drive space.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not like I&apos;m new to the series, I&apos;ve done 1000+ hours in both Battlefield 3 and battlefield 4.
<br>
<br>Can&apos;t get a refund now because I&apos;m too late to use Origins great game &quot;guarantee&quot; because yeah, you can totally work out If you like a game or not when you start downloading on the evening, wake up, go to work, get back play for like two hours, rinse and repeat. I&apos;m not even going to get Into the whole EA thing. We all feel the same way. They make us want to smash things.
<br>
<br>The campaign, I just.......I just, just no. It&apos;s bland and boring and you can&apos;t skip the god damn cut scenes that last ten minutes at times. I gave it a shot but found myself doing some additional housework or cooking as soon as the scenes would start. Yes, they are that god damn boring I&apos;d rather do housework than waste my life watching them.
<br>
<br>This game is going to die, the player population seems to be crazy low already compared to Battlefield 3 and 4. GTAV Is just around the corner with games like Witcher 3 and MGS5 a stones throw away amongst many more awesome games. Please don&apos;t waste your time and money (especially time) If you have Battlefield 3 or 4 don&apos;t get this game, they are 100% superior. In fact, if you have any other FPS don&apos;t get this game. Just don&apos;t get this game.
<br>
<br>Lots more things to say but I have to go walk the dog. I may come back and edit more Information In later if that&apos;s possible.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not possible, pretty much used all my 5000 character allowance.
<br>
<br>I want to smash things just typing this out and thinking about the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5115101">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Im deeply regretting buy this game once again, up until this day I bought every bf release and premium and I can say I enjoyed every single one of them. While BF hardline had a relatively smooth launch its a cash grab with a terrible progresion system and an awful single player campaign. If you re new to BF just get bf4 is at its best state at this moment but by all means avoid this cash grab</span>

<br>Unfortunately the game play is probably the worst I have ever seen in the Battlefield franchise, mainly the TTK (Time to kill) is so extremely low that it removes any amount of fun or skill that might otherwise be required. Small maps, limited guns and poor balance also add to the frustration.
<br>
<br>To any shooter fan I would say avoid at all cost, this game is not worth the money and you would be much better off purchasing Battlefield 3 or 4 both of which are outstanding games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5250974">Expand</a></span>

<br>Single Player is decent, bordering on bad.
<br>Multiplayer is decent, but I could just as well continue playing Battlefield 4.
<br>It does not take the theme they brought in seriously. Its a a mix of Payday 2 and Battlefield.
<br>
<br>While I still play it, I expect myself to return to Battlefield 4 before long due to a lack of variety.</span>

The only thing I can think of is the fact that the multi-player car chase mode is quite unique and not a rip off like everything else in the game, don&apos;t get too excited though all the maps are tiny. How you manage to take the battlefield 4 engine and end up with a laggy, less visual quality, less game play quality game is beyond me. The single player is a laughable clich&#xE9; unfortunately it&apos;s not even done ironically. Within the first two minutes of the game you&apos;re partnered up with someone who &quot;doesn&apos;t need a partner, chief&quot;. The clue system is more frustrating than interesting. I gave this a good 18 hour try but it was just a waste of time. On the plus side EA is offering that great game guarantee so at least you&apos;ll be able to receive a full refund.

<br>Hardline is not &quot;Battlefield&quot; anymore, more &quot;Modern/Urban Warfare&quot; - hopefully next time they&apos;ll add &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot;...

<br>THERE ARE FEATURES FROM BF4 TAKEN OUT OF HARDLINE AND SOLD AT THE SAME EXACT PRICE.

                                        <span>The game gets stale really fast. The general look and feel of the game isn&apos;t very impressive. So for all the other people complaining about wasting their money on it you can head over to EA request a refund. You can get your money back if you didn&apos;t like the game within 24 hours of launching it for the first time. Hope that helps some people.
<br>overall game is ok, but not worth the money</span>

<br>2. Downgrade in graphics. Cities, buildings, everything unnatural, not realistic.
<br>3. Maps are boring. Starting from BFBC2 and BF3 maps downgraded to BF4, and now worse in BFHL.
<br>4. THE PRICE. ARE YOU SICK? And Premium AGAIN?
<br>5. Soon GTA 5 on PC, why  would i buy a BFHL?</span>

<br>As other reviewers have noted this game really shares nothing positive with the real Battlefield series.  The cops and robbers theme is not executed well - in most modes you hardly even notice which side you&apos;re on.  The vehicles are awful to the point of being ridiculous - the handling model is based off a supermarket trolley.
<br>
<br>The graphics are shockingly bad.  It is very hard to believe that this is a successor to the realism of BF3 and BF4.  The environment has had no effort put into it and if you see the water effects you&apos;ll be left howling with laughter.  There&apos;s really no way to put it into words but from the very first game you play you&apos;ll realise that immersion in the game is something no one even had on the radar.
<br>
<br>The progression system in multiplayer now requires you to collect money.  Which of course you can buy.  If you don&apos;t however you&apos;ll need to act as cannon fodder for better-equipped players for many hours.  The starting weapons are so bad you can barely get your aim up before someone with a SCAR or ACW has instantly killed you with a shot to the leg.  Good luck to anyone who can pull through this as I couldn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>This is the most disappointing and misleading game I have ever purchased.  As other reviewers noted it is not worth anywhere near the $60+ price tag.  I&apos;d think twice at even $10.  Please don&apos;t waste your money - stick with the real Battlefield games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5091066">Expand</a></span>

The game is made in a way where you cant play strategy or developpe any teamwork through time. there is not enaugh guns and after you spend 3 hours to collect money and buy the gun you want. you figure out that you cant use it in all games. i dont know why but depending on the map or the game category, the guns are different. ALSO  Please cut the crap of 64 players games ... its not fun at all and all peaple do is pron and shoot.
<br>
<br>Any way except for the good graphics, this games is bad... Back to BF3 witch was the best so far... i also have BF4 and barely play it...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5103227">Expand</a></span>

You can play recon but it is only good for sniping and even then is **** &apos;cos bullet velocity is mind numbingly slow. Sniper rifles are the worst gun in the game (including dmrs) The game has very little destrucion and the Levolution is a joke. A sandstorm and a crane falling. Vehicles are extremely boring consisting of a few different cars and choppers with MGs. It&apos;s like only having jeep and transport chopper in BF4. I tried the campaign and quit after 1st episode. There&apos;s just not enough action and the reward system forces you to use non-lethal takedowns. It&apos;s not a horrible game, but if you expect a Battlefield game with Battlefield like gameplay you&apos;ll be disappointed. Gameplay feels much more like CoD then BF.

<br>BFH is a game where teams are almost always unfair bad servers and a story they tell like a TV show? srsly WTF? a TV show really EA????

This game cost me about $13 an hour. It&apos;s short, it&apos;s confining, the plot is - actually it isn&apos;t, you make no decisions which impact the game and you honestly never care about the characters.
<br>
<br>The graphics are marginal, characterization is great if this were a 2008 game. They are not on the same level as Dragon Age Inquisition for example. You make no choices on this game after the initial cops/robbers selection. You are stuck in the story line, in a very confined area doing a specific thing. If you select cop, you are actually a  &quot;cop&quot; for about half the game... which makes you wonder about the warrant and evidence stuff later in the game.  There are no side missions, other than collecting evidence and capturing some bad guys with warrants. Who knows why you are collecting evidence.
<br>
<br>Vehicle combat... a piece of one episode has any real &quot;vehicle&quot; combat. The rest of the time you drive and your gun is useless, or are the passenger trying to hit something with your revolver, or sniper rifle... what , forgot to pack an automatic?... Die and you can equip with what you really need -I hate that.
<br>
<br>Tons of weapons and accessories available, over half of which I never actually managed to unlock - don&apos;t know why.
<br>
<br>The game says you can complete episodes using non-lethal means - don&apos;t see how. Some episodes have &quot;survival&quot; situations where you cannot proceed until you eliminate waves of opponents. I really don&apos;t enjoy that stuff, but some people apparently do.
<br>
<br>Again, the plot isn&apos;t changeable. Your character makes decisions in cut-scenes, even the ending. All you can do is watch. And speaking of the ending... really!?
<br>
<br>I should have waited for this one to go on sale. All the extra content that comes with the Ultimate isn&apos;t released yet. And the unless you are into the &quot;gangsta&quot; stuff, the music either sucks are is very forgettable.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll tell the boys to wait until this goes on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5079544">Expand</a></span>

<br>m16a3, don&apos;t need to explain?
<br>80%!!!!! doesn&apos;t do objective, just playing CoD Teamdeathmatch. Camping roofs, corners, stairs and farming k/d.
<br>
<br>NO improvement from beta, all unbalanced weapons still unbalanced and same **** netcode.
<br>
<br>Worst melee system I&apos;ve ever seen as well, 5 seconds to melee someone from behind? 2 hits to melee someone from the front? I think I&apos;ve meleed about a 100 people from behind and actually managed to kill 5 because the rest survived as it took AGES.

                                        <span>This game is a combination of weak points of both Battlefield and CoD. From the battlefield they took low mobility and gunplay that is utterly boring in close quarters, and from CoD they took tiny closed quarters maps and retardedly low TTKs. The end result is something that you&apos;d never want to play if you played either CoD:AW or BF4 previously.</span>

The progression curve in multiplayer is tilted towards circumventing the bad starting weapons, so the easiest way to win is to pay for the Deluxe Edition ACW-R or to play Hotwire until you can buy the strongest weapons. After that, Heist and Blood Money will be a breeze, especially if you buy the K10 and the Armored insert combined with Gas Masks and Gas Grenades. The weapon licences take way too long to unlock and the faction weapons are distributed in favor of Criminal Operators, Cop Mechanics and Criminal Enforcers. RPG Trunk Upgrades for cars makes the car chases in Hotwire less enjoyable and the tactical map control is thrown out of the window. It is instead best played riding shotgun with the repair torch and a 40mm noob tube. This is awkwardly the best way to rank up and you can even play it with one hand. The singleplayer has some nice missions, but in the end it is too easy and the enemy character models are too similar to warrant the excessive use of uninspired takedown animations. With a lack of interesting stealth weapons (such as sleeping darts), the guns blazing approach becomes much more attractive. But this is pretty counter intuitive for a cop crime drama and it simply feels like you are playing against the Mirror&apos;s Edge AI with a Call of Duty loadout. With some multiplayer rebalancing of the obvious top weapons and some spawn fixes for TDM, Hardline could easily have gotten an 8 from me. If they had let us play the singleplayer as a dirty cop and double cross the entire cast of characters with cunning force, I could even have given the game a 9. But sadly it places us in the familiar shoes of the &quot;rookie&quot; good guy who gets shafted by the more interesting characters while the plot twitches almost as bad as the terrible motorcycles we get to drive in Multiplayer :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5079869">Expand</a></span>

BF3/4 were PC gaming benchmarks that many other games strived to even get near, in terms of graphics. Play BF4 and then this, and this game looks like it came out in 2007. I know visuals aren&apos;t everything but man.... why the huge downgrade? This is a first for a BF game and a huge disappointment. It kills the atmosphere and just doesn&apos;t look like a modern game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise this is just OK. Not incredible or innovative. It feels more like CS or CoD than Battlefield, big time. That Battlefield feel is barely there. I understand this is a spin-off, but it doesn&apos;t have that epic all-out war feel. It just feels like very quick skirmishes between police and robbers. There is a ton of camping, too.... a ton. People just wait by a road with an RPG in Hotwire and they get instakills way too easily. Netcode problems are still rampant: I had 4 trades in my first hour of play and I died behind cover twice, as well. Vehicle physics improved by about 3%--yeah, hardly anything, really. Vehicle movement and physics are still unrealistic and poor.
<br>
<br>Campaign isn&apos;t too bad. The story is very cliche, but it&apos;s occasionally funny. Visuals still suffer in campaign.
<br>
<br>Hardline brings some new things to the table (modes, etc), but overall it lacks a Battlefield-feel and a comprehensive sense of quality and fun. I&apos;m not sure Battlefield is Visceral&apos;s cup of tea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5080425">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In long, the gunplay is very refreshing, the maps are balanced and amazingly designed, hotwire is a bit silly, yes, but it is really fun. The Netcode is much better, I have not seen any glitches yet. And I haven&apos;t seen crazy spawncamping or grenade spam, unlike Battlefield 4.
<br>This one has so much better balancing gameplay, and it&apos;s a big step forward from Battlefield 4, we have to look at that, it&apos;s still not IT, it&apos;s still not the master Battlefield game we&apos;ve been expecting, but the launch is so much better.
<br>
<br>If in the next Battlefield, hopefully Bad Company 3, they combine the gameplay and balancing from Hardline, and the graphics of Battlefield 4, it will be one of the best shooters ever.

<br>
<br>Hotwire itself is probably the most played game, and is interesting until people get their hands on rocket launchers.
<br>
<br>It has enjoyable gunplay, but a very limited pool of guns that all feel the same. Reload animations are nice, to say a bit of a reverse nitpick.
<br>
<br>Battlefield Hardline certainly isn&apos;t a BAD game, but it&apos;s just a repackage of Battlefield 4. It&apos;d be a standalone game if **** actually happened. Instead, as I opened with, it&apos;s two opposing teams running around shooting eachother. The game itself is solid, but putting objective based gameplay that forces you to actually help the team in a Battlefield game is like putting a guinea pig in a ballet.
<br>
<br>In short, again... Pick up Payday 2 if you want cops vs crims. Pick up GTA V if you want bloods vs crips, pick up Battlefield 4 if you want Battlefield. And bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5092289">Expand</a></span>

<br>Multiplayer was a Cluster  **** with everyone running around doing their own things and it was very unenjoyable for me!
<br>Luckily for me i did not have to spend $60 on this boring generic movie meets video game since my friend let me play his copy on steam to check it out.
<br>I am not sure if it is even worth $20 let alone $60!
<br>So i score this a 3 just for the fact  it at least played well and looked better than COD advanced warfare which is always in competition with the Battlefield series. for single player gameplay advanced warfare was better so that just shows you how much this game disappointed me! :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5199212">Expand</a></span>

Overall not a 60$ buy unless totally sold, only 9 maps and 8 modes (less than bf4), but is worth a buy if you like battlefeild a lot. 7.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5141736">Expand</a></span>

<br>True, this is supposed to be a cops and robbers game but shouldn&apos;t be given the title &quot;battlefield&quot; since it has nothing to do with being in a real warzone. They could of just gave it another name and wouldn&apos;t make so many people upset since what we are basically getting is a watered down version of the game itself. Although some game modes are fun and innovative like &quot;blood money&quot; and &quot;heist&quot;, it cannot make up for the lack of replay value this game really has. It gets boring quick and its not that much different from what you have seen in previous battlefield games. Seems like the franchise keeps getting worse since Bad Company 2 and this is a new low for this franchise. Sorry i&apos;ve tried to like this game but just couldn&apos;t and I have bought every battlefield game to date since BF2.
<br>For those of you who havent played over 24 hrs yet, you can still request a refund through Origin. Believe me, you&apos;ll be happy that you did. Save your money for something else or wait for the game to be on sale. Not worth its required price for what we have been given.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5076896">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A re-skin of BF4 but with worse graphics for some reason?!! And you get this for a jaw dropping $120.
<br>I am no longer surprised at the theft and deception that EA now deploys. Unfinished games, Millions of $$ on marketing &amp; advertising and bought / paid for reviews.
<br>

This is the reason I sticked to Battlefield since Bad Company. I was even enthusiastic for Battlefield 4 when it launched. I was excited about Hardline after I played beta, but the fact is they have given two best maps to beta testers to play. Maps are chaotic, there is absolutely zero tactic (eg. Hotwire - you just drive around the map) to play. Hardline is basically Call of Duty styled game, if you don&apos;t like Call of Duty, you won&apos;t like Hardline. This game isn&apos;t worth 50USD I have paid for it. Wait until it is around 10$.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5082493">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have been a gamer from the beginning.  Atari, C64, The 2600, then to PC.  I have played them all.    EA should be ashamed.   The Graphics are poor,  the online interface is 5 years old and it was terrible back then.  The game play is weak, slow, cluttered and boring.  This is millions of dollars of wasted time and effort.
<br>
<br>This is nothing new here at all, just a sad state of gaming. In the mid 80&apos;s gaming collapsed because of very poor releases.  We are poised to repeat history.   The last year or two of action games have not evolved and we the players are done.  If I want a movie, I will go to a movie.    EA, I will NEVER pay for a new release from you again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5076970">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Everything that makes a Battlefield title is missing from Hardline, save the engine, which is nowhere near being utilized to potential.  Destructable environment?  Nope.  Expansive and adaptive maps?  Nope.  Strategic combat?  LOL, not even close.
<br>
<br>This game feels more like a poorly executed Battlefield mod than a standalone title.  I have played Battlefield since it&apos;s inception, and am a retired pro.  This title does not deserve to wear the Battlefield name.  Shame on DICE.  Shame on Visceral.  Shame on EA.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re really looking for a cops and robbers type game, PayDay 2 would probably be a better match for you.  At a $60 price point, this title is little more than an obvious cash grab.

<br>
<br>The pace is extremely fast in most of the games. Bullets flying everywhere, it&apos;s quite chaotic but still very enjoyable.
<br>
<br>My main complains:
<br>Starting kits - they&apos;re terrible, so any new player is forced to grind money to grab any weapon that doesn&apos;t suck.
<br>
<br>Exclusive weapons that came with more expensive versions of the game. Currently you can&apos;t obtain those weapons in any other way.
<br>
<br>On top of that I&apos;m a bit disappointed with the amount of weapons and ONCE AGAIN devs made the same mistake of mixing medic class with best available weapons, so everyone and their dog is runing an operator.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5083244">Expand</a></span>

<br>* The single player campaign is undeniably gorgeous. However looks alone do not make a good game.
<br>* The single player characters are well established and at times funny. It reminds me of the humor of the Bad Company series. Probably one of the best attributes the sp experience has.
<br>* I felt the cash system in mp was a nice change.
<br>* The vehicles in mp are fun.
<br>* The new game modes are great. Blood Money, and Hotwire were both worthy additions.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>* Atrocious UI - Particularly in SP the creators felt they had to put a disgusting icon over anything you could interact with. Even worse is that the further you are away from it the larger the icon is on your screen. I felt they were trying to create the same awful UI from the Far Cry series. At least in Far Cry they give you the option to turn almost all of it off. This is a continuing tragedy among the FPS. They treat the players of a M rated series like monkeys, babying the user through the entire experience. My remedy to this was to use ui.drawenable 0 which removed all of the UI. Guess what, I was able to complete the entire game this way with no fuss.
<br>
<br>* The MP experience doesn&apos;t feel like battlefield. There is an overall lack of destructible objects. The first obvious disappointment was in Dust Bowl where the walls of all the buildings are invincible.
<br>* None of the weapons feel as powerful as they once had.
<br>* Players can take way too much damage in Hardcore.
<br>
<br>After giving the game 3 days to charm me, it hadn&apos;t, and I chose to return it. I will be waiting for a better release to spend my money on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5081667">Expand</a></span>

Trust me, if you loved bad company 2, you are goin to most likely enjoy hardline more then you ever enjoyed bf4 or bf3. First of all- everything has a significant value when it comes to itemization. No more cookie cutter weaponry, you will be only a bit less effective with weapon you like than with the op one, which u hate. Maps finally have a MEANINGFUL LEVOLUTION, which changes the gameplay in a significant way. Also, easter eggs, humour and pace make this game my new fav battlefield title to date. :) Oh, and don&apos;t mind the fact that there are no jets, tanks or lavs. Thanks to lack of those, light vehicles like cars, finally have an important, and FUN TO PLAY role.

Hotwire is like battlefield 4 conquest mode i never really like it. and DICE&apos;s new E-sports mode with is super fast everything you do matters and much more what you need to know is the Battlefield Hardline is a good game which need&apos;s to have a franchise Battlefield HARDLINE get&apos;s a 8/10 look&apos;s way better then console.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5074602">Expand</a></span>

You play as Nick Mendoza, a hot headed cop who has a really terrible partner. Really terrible. But who cares about arresting drug dealers and bland car chases!? I wanna play Multiplayer!!!!! I stepped into 7 minutes of Bank Heist, and there was so much stuff on screen, I shot a guy, got shot twice and swam in money. That is Bank Heist, bros. I thought that Visceral could make a gritty, fast paced heist mode like the one I spent hours with in GTA 5. But then again, its EA. EA announced this at E3 making it look all pretty and polished, but it appears that I traded in my PS4 copy and used the 30 bucks EB Games gave ne to get the PC version, just because I heard it looks better. I love my PS4, I get every new game on it. But not this one. So, I only used my Pc for LoL, Starcraft, Dota 2, basically every PC exculsive. Running Hardline was a pain in my ass. I upgraded my cooler and my graphics card, just to smoothly run the damn thing. And after 3 hours, success! I hate the whole Origin thing, you need it to play every new EA title, it ruined NFS Rivals, Garden Warfare, BF4 and Hardline. Servers crash 80 percent of the time on PC, but only 30 percent of the time on PS4, depending on your internet connection. So BH takes a lot of computer space, upgraded coolers and graphic cards, but it still doesnt look as good as PlanetSide 2, that uses a low graphics resolution. The frames per second have inproved, but the game has lost it charm with more loading screens and pop in textures. Overall, its the same crap on PS4, but looks a tad bit better. If this is worth a buy, is up to you, the game isnt any good, and from what I have seen it wont improve in updates as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-hardline/user-reviews?user_review_id=5143560">Expand</a></span>
