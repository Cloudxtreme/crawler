These days, games that carry the title are much less about horror and more about things jumping out at you for a cheap scare. Even the survival aspect is often pushed to the back burner in favor of making an easier game accessible to a more general audience. As a result survival-horror fans are getting action games with a few scary moments shoved down their throats.<br><br>Amnesia isn&apos;t like that. Amnesia focuses on three things: atmosphere, survival, and, above all else, horror. Before players start the game, a warning is given that the game should not be played to win. It should be played to allow one&apos;s self to be absorbed into the world of Amnesia. Those that follow this advice will be in for the ride of their life. From the very beginning of the game, Amnesia&apos;s immersive and completely unsettling world will have you questioning if that sound is something moving, or if you&apos;re just going insane. You&apos;ll be afraid to go around the next corner, lest something horrifying is there. But you won&apos;t be able to stop.<br><br>With the recent release of the same development tool kit that the creators used to make the game, players can make their own stories. With a bit of creativity and just a bit of that sadistic love of horror, we&apos;ll be seeing good things come from Amnesia for a time to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1375354">Expand</a></span>

In fact, some times I would hear something to the left, and I would look away from the monitor myself.  And more than just being creepy is the realism of the game, although some things are designed unrealistically on purpose, it just makes you feel like you&apos;re going crazy.  I must admit I was scared many times, and the subtle revealing of the plot as you advance gives you more understanding of the situation, yet makes you feel even more scared.  It doesn&apos;t require much puzzle-solving, but its goal is to scare me stiff, and frictional games did an excellent job of that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1375591">Expand</a></span>

This game will have you jumping in your seat when even the slightest odd thing happens, let alone the real scares, some of which created a genuine feeling of terror for me. Seriously, this game blows the Penumbra (up until now my favorite horror games) completely out of the water. Ten times over. Bottom line: if you loved the Penumbra series, get it. If you did not play them, get it. The 15-ish euro price tag is just stealing the game, because i would have still bought it if it where 40 euros. Frictional Games, you truly outdid yourselves. Already can&apos;t wait for a new game from you. I love you Frictional Games!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1371389">Expand</a></span>

There were a couple times when after a few minutes of hiding from a monster, listening for his footsteps and creeping little by little out into the light, trying to figure out where he was; only to have him appear and charge me: The second or two before he killed me, my skin actually tingled and I involuntarily drew breath. I felt the feeling of actual terror.<br><br>The puzzles were another high point. They were intuitive and fun, you needed just enough brainpower to solve them that you feel satisfied afterward without just guessing randomly until you get it. The story, while standard spooky fare was more than adequate and the voice acting was better than most AAA titles. Won&apos;t win any oscars, but it wasn&apos;t bad enough to take you out of the story, like some games that cost 10X more to make.<br><br>The graphics were Average at best, but the lack of visual POW never took you out of the moment. My big issue with the game was the mechanics. You have to constantly manage your light sources, which seems like an afterthought. Since you have no weapons in the game, they can&apos;t add challenge by making you manage ammo, so they just use light. Which was distracting because you have a lantern that burns out faster than Gordan Freeman&apos;s flashlight (and doesn&apos;t recharge) and a bunch of tinder boxes. These appear to be as big as beer cans, but for some reason can only be used to light ONE light source each. And as important to your survival that a single candle is... you can&apos;t pick it up and take it with you, even though it is obviously just sitting on a table. It feels like they decided that the game was too easy and needed something to make it more of a challenge.<br><br>And I get why you can&apos;t have weapons, the feeling of sheer horror as some abomination sees me from across a dark cellar is something I have never felt in a video game before... but... there are weapons literally everywhere. In your puzzles, you use huge wrenches, fireplace pokers, metal rods, flammable lamp oil, shovels, BOMBS. but your character never thinks to use one on the roughly man-sized monsters that are wandering all over the place. The last thing that really bothered me about the game is one of the first things you see when you fire it up: Some tip of advice that says something along the lines of &quot;don&apos;t play this game to win, instead, let yourself become engrossed in the story&quot; or something to that effect. Just because you&apos;re an indie studio, don&apos;t ask me to give you the benefit of the doubt. Just make a great game. In closing: This game has some really mind-blowing elements. You can tell the creators really love electronic gaming and bring a level of craftsmanship that a lot of the mega-titles can&apos;t touch. The sound is some of the best I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. But in the end, a lot of the game play mechanic is contrived and serves only to artificially add complexity. To everyone who gave 9s and 10s:Lets hold indie developers to a HIGHER standard, not a lower one. Because they have the passion and innovation to truly create the next great games:  not the EA team working on the latest Nazi Shooting FPS ported from XBOX.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1452409">Expand</a></span>

The pacing of the game is much more fluid than similar titles within the genre - Thief, System Shock, Bioshock, Penumbra, etc. Puzzles for the most part are logical and most of the time come natural. This is what sets the game apart from the packs. Using an inventory system taken from classic adventure gaming - combining objects, yet the puzzles that utilize the inventory objects are never nonsensical in the way many other adventure games use the mechanic. Since the levels are heavy in atmosphere the level design is fairly simplistic which only benefits to keep the player engaged and helps to move the puzzle solving along.<br><br>The sound design is top notch. The sound designer took field recordings were really well recorded; feels very real, atmospheric, foreboding. Amnesia is just as much an aural experience as a visual experience, sometimes the sound is so intense with the gameplay that I&apos;ve taken off my headphones just to continue. It can be that intense. The story is actually very well written and sinister. Though, largely the environments are seemingly empty they are alarmingly alive with past atrocities.The &apos;find-documents-along-the-way&apos; game mechanic has been done so many times in this genre. But, never has it been done so well. The story is very well written and will capture your attention unlike in other games that deploy this element. They are somewhat reminiscent in tone with the Thief series and it definitely helps that some are very well voice-acted.<br><br>The visual insanity mechanic is wonderful. I don&apos;t want to spoil it but it is visually much like tripping on LSD. Which is swirling textures, disorientation... it&apos;s pretty neat.<br><br>The physics mechanics, the atmosphere, the story, the pacing, the presentation. It&apos;s immaculate. It&apos;s very polished and much more fluid than Frictional&apos;s previous endeavors and that is saying a lot. This game is simply a must buy for those into Looking Glass type games, horror, or innovative games in general.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1371071">Expand</a></span>

The penumbra games were restricted to a specific os from a purchase. So I&apos;m happy they followed 2dboy in doing this way. However there was very annoying bugs in the first version and the linux patch were published much later than the windows one...<br><br>Also about the story I&apos;d like to say the end was quite frustrating. Some ends kick you to the credits only with a small comment. It&apos;s more like a game over...

The ability to pick up and move a good amount of things in the environment was greatly executed. The slow pacing followed by sudden shrieks or lourd noises kept me on my toes throught the whole game. I just wish some of the puzzles were more well thought out. Some of them were very difficult while others were quite easy. I wish they had implemented the ablility to stack boxes or other items to reach other areas better. The story was quite interesting at first but it began to lose steam towards the end and i ended up kinda forgetting what was going on when i did reach the end. I also felt that the ending scene was unfulfilling as well, no matter which of the 3 different endings I received. Overall it was an enjoyable experience, those that are fans of the genre should definitely look into it.

<br>
<br>These folks have fear down to a science. Suspense that makes you remind yourself (hopelessly) that it&apos;s just a game, scenery that&apos;s to die for, music expertly integrated into your nervous system, sounds that quickly match your heart rate, a story I can&apos;t believe didn&apos;t come out of a novel, and seamless game play between fleeing horrors your friends won&apos;t understand and Valve-worthy physics puzzles.
<br>
<br>The only hurtle for me was that this game did not immunize me to horror, but had by all means destroyed me. Thank you Frictional Games. Indie delivers again.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a shame Amnesia was not made by Russians, because you don&apos;t beat this game. It beats you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2086999">Expand</a></span>

Was it really that difficult? Anyway, enough of this obnoxiousness. I thoroughly enjoyed Amnesia despite it&apos;s clunky controls. Genuinely terrifying with a very well told story that requires player exploration instead of intense cut-scene overkill. The removal of combat that was present in the Penumbra series (also made by Frictional) really helps keep the pace and prevents frustrating mouse swinging angst. You survive by running and hiding. The shadows are as much your friends as they are your enemies adding an element of risk to all of your actions. To a certain extent it has the same appeal as a well thought out point-and-click adventure with simplistic gameplay that allows you to get absorbed by the terrifically dark atmosphere instead of having you scrolling through inventory lists and entering attack combos. This game won&apos;t be for everyone, and many people will simply be bored by the lack of action and direct story telling. But I don&apos;t think this game was ever trying to grab a mainstream audience and all its appeal is rather quite niche. But nonetheless, it is a game that most should at least visit, for it truly is a welcome sleeper indie hit for us horror fans. This game is best played in a dark room with a decent headset. In fact I refuse to play this game during the day! It&apos;s also a good idea to have your face pressed up to the screen so you sh*t yourself quicker.

It may not be very scary, but it does give you a rush of adrenaline when you need to evade enemies. The puzzles are pretty original and symbolic, and you get a good feel for Daniel&apos;s psychosis, even though he never speaks when you are playing as him. The very beginning areas of the game, to me, were pretty boring.  It kept me from playing the game for a few months (I forgot that I owned it for a while), but I eventually began to enjoy it.  This game has become the popular &quot;scariest game in  the world&quot; on Youtube, and you it&apos;s almost impossible to find a Partner who hasn&apos;t done a Let&apos;s Play of it (while also slapping a video of his face over the gameplay so you can see him pretend to be terrified).  I think you&apos;ll enjoy it, but please, don&apos;t ham it up and pretend this game made you cry for your mommy.  So in conclusion, I think this game is worth checking out, but more for the puzzles, and not for the scares.At its core, it is fun, and that&apos;s what matters.  I recommend the  Penumbra games if you want more.  And I do mean a whole lot more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2135635">Expand</a></span>

I have, and boy was I with mixed feelings while playing this game. Amnesia: The dark descent is a game in which you do not have your guns with which you can shoot monsters between the eyes, nor blades with which to cut them to shreds for trying to kill you ... nope. The dark atmosphere, blood spills from paintings, screams that you hear in the begining of the game that echo in your mind until you finally lose the courage to continue on and just Save+Quit is what you will expirience in this game. Darkness is all around, making you lose your sanity and the only thing that could probably help you out is a little candle or a oil lamp - that is what keeps you from losing your mind in the game - light ! I will not spoil the story and start telling what you will see and thus spoiling all the &quot;fun&quot; you will expirience. The only thing I can tell you is this - must buy for all horror fans ! And even if you ARE an extreme horror fan - do NOT get overconfident - this game will crush you if you take it lightly ... think I am joking ? Play it at night on a widescreen monitor with all the lights turned off, doors tightly shut, headphones strapped tightly to your ears and dare finish the game in one go ... I dare you ! The story and game is said to be 4-5 hours ... well it took me 5 times starting the game with 2 hours of game time ... I couldn&apos;t afford any more of it, else you can&apos;t sleep at all !<br><br>For those that are &quot;graphics obsessed&quot; I can say that the game may not be in CryEngine 2, but the atmosphere from the sounds and everything else will make you stop paying attention to how pretty that rocking chair in the room is and make you ask yourself non-stop &quot;Oh my God, what is that behind the corner ?!?!?!?!?!&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2374303">Expand</a></span>

Unlike most horror games, this one focuses less on &quot;monsters jumping from the closet&quot; scares and is chock full of psychological and moral horror. Even without the literal monsters, the plot is full of human monsters; torture, human sacrifices, black magic and sorcery make the game reek of evil. The immersive sound design and well-implemented screen &amp; graphical effects feed the fear of being cornered by other worldly monsters and human abominations. Without any weapons to fight back, this is a genuine &quot;survival horror&quot; game that you should pick up and lose sleep over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2872858">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t punish you for being killed, but it instead seeks to inmerse yourself completely in the game so you truly feel fear for not knowing what&apos;s around the corner or hiding in the dark. And, the puzzles themselves are at the same time challening but with solutions reached by the use of reason and exploring.<br><br>Graphics are quite good considering the minimum requirements that the game asks. I have seen a review from one critics that he struggled on making this game playable. I don&apos;t really know what game he was playing, but this one didn&apos;t require from me even a minor tweak to get good fps or to fix any bugs. It simply sets the recommended settings depending on what graphics card that you are using.<br><br>The story is quite good and makes your moral compass struggle between what&apos;s right and what&apos;s wrong. This game is also about collecting clues to regain a sense of what happened and why you don&apos;t remember anything.<br><br>So, to sume it all up, it&apos;s a must buy and it really has an excellent value considering the $19.99 price tag on steam. Hell, if I would have known that it was this good, I would have payed $49.99. It truly is better than most titles that reach the $49.99 price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1395844">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What Amnesia gives you is a first person survival that reminds me of elements from Half-Life puzzles, Doom 3 sudden enemy appearances and events, and enemies that are so twisted and flayed that I would expect that Alma from F.E.A.R. to do.
<br>
<br>To recap I intend on setting aside of few nights to stay up all night and experience the terror that Amnesia will have in store for me in the full version of it. It created a hunger for utter terror in me that I&apos;m not sure that I should be ignoring it or concerned about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1403062">Expand</a></span>

I was pleasantly surprised therefore that Amnesia: The Dark Descent really does live up to the hype (which I suppose I am adding to!).  Amnesia exceeded my expectations in almost every regard:  the graphics, while not on a par with AAA+ games, were strong (excellent for such a small developer); the audio was truly superb; the levels were well designed; the puzzles were (for the most part) logical and necessary and the story was compelling.  All of this combined to great effect to make an incredibly immersive game that simultaneously drew me in while making me want to stop playing and go outside into the sunshine for a while - with clear lines of sight and heavily armed just in case...  So why not give the game 10 out of 10?  Aside from a couple of occasions in the game where I was unsure what to do next, which in reality probably says more about me that the game, my only criticism would be that ending was weaker than I&apos;d expected.  Maybe this is something to do with how well constructed the rest of the game was but the ending felt quite abrupt. After playing Amnesia I am keenly aware that this is what a survival-horror game should be.  Other games I have played recently using that label, such as the Left 4 Dead games and Resident Evil series, do not come close.  Amnesia introduced me to fear, the need to survive by hiding in the shadows on the edge of sanity, the dread of knowing there was nothing I could do should I be found, before unveiling the horror of the reality in which I found myself and which both fascinated and repulsed me...  Somehow I just don&apos;t think facing horrors with a shotgun will ever instill that same sense of fear and dread...<br><br>Frictional Games is definitely a developer i shall be following in future.<br><br><br>Overall Amnesia is an experience I would recommend to everyone... except those under the age of 18 or with a weak disposition...  :-)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1403699">Expand</a></span>

Anyone who&apos;s an avid gamer knows most survival-horror games involve a larger-than-life hero, toting mass arsenals of highly destructive weapons used mainly to plow through waves of demons, zombies, mutants, etc...<br>Well, Frictional Games took a different, and highly innovative, approach to surviving a nightmare; they made the lead character as weak and fragile as possible, then threw him directly into a story of mystery, violence, shattered memories, and impending doom with only his cunning, and a small lamp at his disposal. This combination of great story, challenging puzzles, dark atmosphere, and realistic characters make Amnesia: The Dark Descent a masterpiece of survival horror and a great addition to any genuine horror fan&apos;s gaming library.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1433830">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re looking for something original, this game tries some things brazenly.  In the end, it becomes repetitive.  Thank goodness it&apos;s fairly short.  I generally take a long time to finish games, as I&apos;m something of a completionist, but this game was done in 12 hours.  Games like Deus Ex: HR took me closer to 50 hours, and games like Skyrim took about 100 hours. -------
<br>----
<br>That said, those are the game&apos;s two major flaws: narrow world which makes it short, and a repetitive game play.  In the beginning, when the game play hasn&apos;t had a chance to wear on you, it&apos;s a fine and novel game.  You sneak around, you get scared, you run, you plan your escape routes methodically, you wonder what is going on in this hellish world.  All wonderful things.  And if you&apos;re like me, you&apos;ll relish the immersion, so you&apos;ll put on a pair of headphones, turn up the volume, and turn off the lights.  Make sure the kiddies are asleep because you won&apos;t want them catching a glimpse of this little horror bit.  It&apos;d give them nightmares.  But it doesn&apos;t do this through cheap thrills and gore - though there&apos;s a little of that.  Much of it is done through understated mixtures of sound and visuals.  ----------
<br>----
<br>Still, eventually you long to be able to use some of the things you find to at least hinder creatures.  It feels like I should be able to use some simple lamp oil to set these nasties on fire - especially if I felt like wasting my precious oil, or if I&apos;d been especially careful about saving it, as I was.  And eventually you get the hang of the AI, but I can&apos;t complain too much about that.  For what it&apos;s worth, the AI is better than new games like Deus Ex: HR.  Probably the worst offending part of the repetitive gameplay is that the game actually gets easier if you reload more than twice.  That&apos;s sad.  Being a completionist, I *enjoy* the challenge of retrying the occasional situation a third or fourth time.  That should be rare, since it breaks the immersion, but so does a monster totally disappearing from a zone because I happened to be taking a sip of beer on the first playthrough, and didn&apos;t quite get it right on the second playthrough.  It detracts from the game&apos;s serious attraction: brutal and unforgiving horror survival.  That gameplay would also be seriously enhanced with more to do in the game and more to explore other than the single dungeon.  There were many times I asked myself, why would I stay in such a deathtrap??  I&apos;d like to at least break a window and climb outside in the snow and discover that I couldn&apos;t travel far without the wolves attacking.  Perhaps that would lead to some interesting gameplay with me exploring the stables and finding a demolished wagon, or perhaps I&apos;d find that the roads leading to this castle were treacherously steep as poor Jonathan Harker discovers in Bram Stoker.  These diversion would make sense, give me a break from the monotony of the castle, and immerse me in the world a little.------
<br>---
<br>All in all, though, I&apos;d be lying if I said I didn&apos;t enjoy the game for the pennies I paid.  The game studio deserved my money, and perhaps we&apos;ll see more developed games from them in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2510037">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A crossing, I stop for a second. Which way to go? As I turn around both left and right to see where they lead I stop at the left way. What was that? Did I just see something moving over there, or was it just my imagination? I stand completely still, afraid of moving. After ten seconds I notice I wasn&apos;t breathing. After twenty seconds I pulled a deep sigh, it probably was nothing. I turn around to remember where I came from and there&apos;s someone there. Something there. It&apos;s running towards me, and I can&apos;t react. I&apos;ve never been so scared or surprised in my whole life.
<br>
<br>Do you remember Penumbra? The survival-horror game from Swedish developer Frictional Games? If you do, you already know the basics of their new game Amnesia: the Dark Descent.
<br>
<br>Amnesia starts out as your character, Daniel, walk along a pair of corridors in a castle that seems desolated, mumbling to himself. After not long you find a note that you apparently wrote for yourself, and that&apos;s all you know from the beginning, and the more you continue on, the more you get to know about the story. As you carry on you&apos;ll see flashbacks, and find notes from your diary, from which you can finally understand what you are doing in that medieval castle, and what you&apos;re going to do. All this while trying to stay away from the shadows that are hunting you, to kill you.
<br>
<br>Something that Frictional Games gets right, that most other developers of horror games do not, is just that, horror. They understand that we&apos;re not mostly afraid of what we know, but what we don&apos;t know. Every time you round a corner in Amnesia you&apos;ll think that something will happen, every time you open a new door, only because you don&apos;t know anything about it. And since you do not know about what horrors await, you will imagine your biggest fear there, not far ahead. It never does, even thought every sound you hear tells you it is. The sound of footsteps, a woman crying for help and mercy, whispers that you do not understand. You can&apos;t help but think: does this mean something is coming? Is this just created to make your imagination go wild? Is it in-game, or only in your brain? You can never know for sure, without asking whoever you got over to hold your hand if they had heard it too.
<br>
<br>Another thing adding to the horror is the horrible look of enemies, and the fact that you got nothing at all to defend you with. Sure, you can pick up a chair and throw it, but they are mostly faster than you, you can&apos;t run away that often. You have to hide, run around a corner and hide behind a pair of barrels. It&apos;s your only way to survive, this time there&apos;s no rocket-launcher with auto-aim to help you.
<br>
<br>Even though all this Amnesia do have some flaws. At certain points in the game you could easily have continued, but you&apos;re not allowed to. You can&apos;t move those rocks, and you can&apos;t use anything to break a locked door, it&apos;s very annoying and sometimes even breaks the atmosphere. Sometimes you have no idea what you&apos;re doing, and that also annoys me. Sometimes, though, it&apos;s none of these thing stopping you from moving forward, you&apos;re simply to afraid to continue, sitting in a corner behind a crate, hiding, from whatever your imagination came up with.
<br>Sometimes I had to quit playing, because I was close to throw up. I won&apos;t say much, but there was some rooms that should show how torture and experiments worked at that time, and since torture is my big fear... Well, you can guess what sort of horrible scenes my imagination thought up. Those images are still terrorizing my mind.
<br>
<br>This is a first-class survival horror game that will make your mind go crazy. Not in a bad way, since you&apos;ll always want to go back and continue the story, but in a good way.
<br>It&apos;s an amazing experience, and even if I hate my mind for coming up with those images I&apos;m also glad it did.
<br>For 14.99$ this is the best horror game you will ever find, just make sure you have three hands; One for the mouse, one for moving around and one for pressing escape to pause the game, while yelling curses that you just made up. Honestly, that will happen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1433993">Expand</a></span>

Great story up until the anticlimactic ending. Recommend playing at night in an unlit room. Probably worth waiting until it goes into the $5 bucket due to it&apos;s lack of replayability.</span>

I only managed to make about 30 minutes in before chickening out. This game is on a WHOLE NOTHA LEVEL. Quote me on that. If any game is going to beat this in horror, it need to be where the main character only has a box of matches in a graveyard while it&apos;s raining.</span>

You play as Daniel, a Londoner who just experienced a terrible &quot;amnesia&quot; and woke up on the floor of a big mansion, armed with nothing at all but cinder boxes and a lantern to lit the darkness where the fiend of the mansion may hide and stalk your back. Reminded me of how a survival horror game should be, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is really the ultimate interactive horror software that horror mongers should enjoy, with a good and deep story telling keeping you tense on the edge of the seat on most of the playtime. The sanity feature really gives an identity to the game, as no game before this has it. Will you prowl in the dark hiding from the &quot;residents&quot; of the mansion stealthily and go nuts, or lit everything that can be with the risk of being seen but stay sane? Definitely a must buy for the true fans of the amazing genre survival horror that is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1544685">Expand</a></span>

There is one level that simply horrified my friend early on, nothing but loud shrieks coming from mid 20s grown men. After a few hours we would have to take a break for a few days to get the urge to scare ourselves to death again. Excellent atmosphere, sounds, good graphics, good puzzles. I got this for 10 bucks, and regularly its 20. THIS IS AMAZING FOR 20 BUCKS and a steal at 10. Buy this now and scare yourself, but be warned, for me I couldn&apos;t play the demo more than 15 mins alone. Then my friends made me buy it and we played it together. Our wives must think we are wimps to scream this much at a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1563980">Expand</a></span>

Games like Doom, Resident Evil and Dead Space are scary, but when you come face to face with a monster that has their jaw hanging down to their chest, and you have nothing, NOTHING, to defend yourself with, a jolt of terror runs through your whole body. It goes beyond scary and frightening, it makes you scared for much longer periods of time, rather than just getting startled and regaining your stature. I found myself many times running for my life, with the growl and footsteps of the monsters following closely behind me. Both of my arms would be shaking because I was so terrified and it would be harder to open and close doors because I couldn&apos;t click on them properly, being out of control scared was something I literally have only experienced in nightmares. The graphics are nothing to be bragging about, but by no means are they bad. They provided a good well balanced environment that fit the story and the fear perfectly. The thing that impressed me the most about this game, were the sounds. Very masterly done. I played through this game with a pretty high grade vibrating headset, the sound quality was outstanding. The voice acting, some of the best I&apos;ve ever heard. I can honestly say that if I had played through this game with no sounds, it wouldn&apos;t have come close to the level of fear produced as it did with sounds. Between the terrifying monsters that the characters only hope of surviving was running for his life, and the sounds, this game delivered a 1-2 punch straight into my fear center. I found myself quitting because I was too scared at times. Puzzles are another important factor of this game. Fun and intuitive they kept my brain from getting too relaxed. Difficult at times left me wondering if I would ever get past them, I did have to cheat a little and look up solutions. Overall: A very, VERY fun game. very scary and deep, it has an amazing storyline that doesn&apos;t leave you with questions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1589049">Expand</a></span>

While it&apos;s definitely the scariest game I&apos;ve ever played, I can&apos;t help but feel that it could have been a bit scarier. More non-despawning monsters would have accomplished this nicely I think. The story is subtle and non-intrusive, but satisfyingly rich if you look for it. The only gripes I have are the lackluster endings and the outdated graphics.</span>

This game does well on what it focus&apos;s on for example, the atmosphere and the puzzles are brilliant, and the monster encounters are totally scary, I have never got scared from a horror movie and the only other game I know that is this scary is night mare house 2. Amnesia brings back survival horror, you have to keep your lamp full of oil so you can see, but monsters are attracted to light so you have to be careful when you use your lamp, you can also use tinder box&apos;s that are scattered around the game which can light up light sources like candles.If you like horror games amnesia is your game, if you like survival then amnesia is your game. The graphic in the game don&apos;t matter, they are descent enough to play and they are quite good for an INDIE DEVELOPER! So help them out, buy this game, you will have a hard time playing on it because it will send shivers down your spine when you even look at it on your steam games list. That&apos;s my review, I will be reviewing more in the near future to save this site of idiot reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1670322">Expand</a></span>

It kind of lands somewhere between Penumbra 1 and 2, gameplay wise, keeping to the same style but bringing back some of the real danger and stealth elements that were (sadly, I think) toned down for the sequel. Still, most of your time is spent crawling through the dark, keeping track of your tinderboxes and lantern oil and looking for ways to progress deeper into the castle.
<br>
<br>Around the halfway point, however, the game somewhat falls apart at the seams. The second half feels a lot more low-key compared to what came before it, and sadly fails to live up to the truly nerve-shattering set piece moments of the first. The whole experience loses some of its very compelling sense of dread and mystery as you go on, especially as it often fails to throw any real surprises at you.
<br>
<br>Amnesia loses even more of its luster if/when you figure out its one big trick for keeping you on your toes - for me, this coincided with getting into the latter half of the game. Suffice it to say that it made the formerly exciting and horrifying monster encounters less so, though even then it managed to sneak a few satisfying scares right in my face.
<br>
<br>In the end, it&apos;s worth playing through if you&apos;re at all interested in the type of games Frictional makes. Still, the first half seemed to promise so much more, and if only it had lived up to itself Amnesia would have been an exceptional game rather than a good, interesting but flawed one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1899807">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well, Amnesia is a real survival horror game. It&apos;s the first game to actually make me nervous and keep me nervous since I was 9 years old. You&apos;ll fear the dark, you&apos;ll fear the little grubs that hide in shadows, and you&apos;ll fear the scratching noise behind your eyes. Most of all, you&apos;ll be scared the moment you realize that you literally don&apos;t know if something is right behind you.
<br>
<br>As if Amnesia isn&apos;t good enough, it&apos;s moddable and allows players to create their own stories. There&apos;s a ton of fan-made content online.

This game was definitely one of the scariest things I&apos;ve ever had the chance to witness in my entire life and I loved it. Now that probably makes me a little bias for this game but I don&apos;t really care at this point. The biggest thing this game has going for it is the atmosphere. Frankly I&apos;ve yet to see anything come close to the kind of atmosphere this generates throughout most of the game (the beginning is a bit boring but once you get past that it gets really good). You will be freaked out immensely by playing this game and that&apos;s the best part. Yea there are some things that this game doesn&apos;t do well, including a lack of conveyance on where you need to go at times and what you need to do, but it&apos;s easily something you can get over if you are REALLY into scary things. And take it from someone who&apos;s seen tons of scary movies and games over the years: this will freak you and anyone else you know out so much you might not sleep for days afterward. Buy it and you won&apos;t regret it (or you will after you play it for awhile....but that&apos;s the best part :))</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2061926">Expand</a></span>

That knowledge that something is there hunting you down and is constantly getting closer to you that brings us to the masterpiece that is Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  I can honestly say I have walked away from my computer at times screaming with shock and terror from what has come from this game.  It truly brought back horror into my heart.  While the game still produces fear in me, I still question some of it&apos;s elements that make it the horror game it is.  There is no way to defend yourself from the creatures hunting you.  And while this aspect is what defines the horror in it (meaning all you can do is run and hide with what dignity you have left), I daresay I would be one of those hero&apos;s in the story to pick up a rock or stick to defend myself in dark dungeons and labyrinths.  I cannot count these as cons to the game because the creatures are truly unearthly.  The very chill they send through your spine is the stuff of nightmares and I doubt even I with the logical sense to defend myself could stand in front of one and not panic.  This game redefines horror showing us all how it&apos;s done.  Not for the squeamish or faint-hearted but then again, even the most fearless of gamers have walked away from this game shaking!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2477635">Expand</a></span>

<br>The invisible boss requires you to jump too accurately and run too fast. After a few times dying I didn&apos;t see why I should frustrate myself further.

This game dwarfs Dead Space, Resident Evil, and Silent Hill.  Besides the alluring environment, the creepy atmosphere of the game will keep you on your toes.  I had heard of how scary this game was so when I first began playing it I was overly expectant of something to pop out at me.  Finally, after not seeing anything scary for a level or two I let my guard down, and boy, did I pay the price.  This game has its jump scares but it has no need to rely on that; this game is a psychological horror.  The moment you&apos;re expecting to turn a corner and find a monster lurking there, naturally, it won&apos;t be there.  The monsters aren&apos;t the most terrifying things in the world once you&apos;ve seen them up close for awhile, but they still managed to get my heart racing and elicit a sense of urgency when they appear from the shadows.
<br>
<br>The story in this game is another riveting aspect of it.  Daniel&apos;s journey through Brennenburg is one of self-discovery.  Notes written by Daniel in a pre-psychotic time provide a wonderful backstory as to Daniel&apos;s motives for his vendetta and the lore of Brennenburg&apos;s history.
<br>
<br>Amnesia is a game to be immersed in; not won.  None of the 4 possible endings to the game offers a definitive sense of victory, only one of appeasement; accomplishing your goal.  Some ignorant people may denounce this game because of a lack of action, story, etc.  but that&apos;s part of the experience.  Sure, games like Dead Space and Resident Evil are more action driven, but I think that takes away from the horror of the game.  Moreover, The past few entires in those series haven&apos;t been as scary and more shooters than survival horror games.  Amnesia as no weapon, your main method of defense is running and hiding from monsters.
<br>
<br>All in all, Amnesia is one of the best games to have arrived in recent years.  It sets the precedent for what all survival horror games should strive to hope to achieve.  That&apos;s not to say I want to play a carbon-copy of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but basic innovations on the concepts introduced in Amnesia could create an enthralling masterpiece that goes down in video game history as the scariest game ever.  as it stands now, Amnesia has clearly owned that title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=3215038">Expand</a></span>

It dosnt have a combat system so your only chance for survival is to run and hide which makes the game a lot more scary. You never feel safe. It got a scary atmospher and it works. It also has a good story line. Some scary dark places and scary monsters there will give you nightmares. Short said everything is scary. And then there is something special that made me keep playing for a long time. You can go to websides like: MODDB and download costum maps made by other players. And there is a LOT! You can also take your time and make your own costum map. It is a great and scary game. I would wish that there was more different monsters because you get tired of the same monsters every time. But the good thing is that you can make your own monsters if you make your own custom map and there is some people that did that very well. The graphics could have been better but i won&apos;t take the game down for that because it don&apos;t need it. It is nearly perfect as it is. Trust me on this one. This game will play with your sanity and it will scare you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=3182950">Expand</a></span>

Right up until the last hour or two of playtime, that is. Before then it&apos;s creepy and atmospheric: you&apos;ll find yourself nervously looking around corners, jumping at sudden noises, and yelling as invisible demons chase you through tunnels, smashing doors that you throw closed behind you. There are a smattering of old school adventure game elements to contend with, but the puzzles are all easy and don&apos;t detract from the experience. This changes towards the end. The puzzles start to take center stage and there are long stretches of wandering around, scanning the floor for items to pick up, pulling levers, and randomly trying to combine inventory elements. Granted, it never gets as unintuitive as Sierra or LucasArts games did, but it is a letdown given how intense the game was up until that point.
<br>
<br>And the ending is so, so lame.
<br>
<br>Amnesia: TDD is well worth experiencing for the first half alone, but overall it doesn&apos;t live up to its potential. I&apos;m looking forward to seeing if the upcoming Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is able to correct these flaws and deliver a more cohesive experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=3303876">Expand</a></span>

Monsters are well designed and very scary! And at last thing that i liked the most in Amnesia... Custom Stories!!! You can play on a map which is made by another person  So this is the best scary game ever!</span>

As others have suggested, if you&apos;d played any of the penumbra series, you will certainly enjoy this game. My biggest recommendation for players is to do what the game says, turn your lights off and use a really good pair of headphones; be aware however... you may have nightmares.</span>

I really love Amnesia because all the games that qualify themselves has &quot;horror-survival&quot; are not scary at all, I think about Left 4 Dead or Resident Evil 5 (even if I love these games too), when you see a zombie, you kill him with a shotgun and that&apos;s all.

The fear is omnipresent, when you hear screaming voices, when you open a door, when you go into the darkness of a room without light, your heart is going crazy.

Throughout this entire game, terror and suspense had me edging constantly through the world, carefully managing my lantern and tinder supply, and apprehensively peering around corners into pitch black darkness hoping nothing was waiting for me ahead.  That is, until I realized how easy it was to dodge monsters.  The reason I only rate it a 5 is because once you figure out the enemy AI and once you understand how to conserve tinder boxes and lamp oil by not lighting every candle you come across, the challenge (and more importantly the terror and anxiety) largely evaporates.  If you&apos;re cautious, it&apos;s super easy to avoid enemies without them ever seeing you even when the game punishes you for being in dark areas near monsters for too long as your sanity drains, vision blurs, and stealth level decreases.  Monitoring your sanity does not require you to constantly light your lantern.  All you need to is maneuver through natural light sources or light an out of the way candle to rest near.  Monster AI and pathing seemed odd.  Too often I would be spotted by a monster and forced to duck into a small room with no way out or no place to hide.  All I had to do was crouch in a corner near the door.  The monster would open the door or bash it in, stand in the door way for a few seconds, and then leave never actually entering the room.  After a while, this got really old, and monsters felt more like an annoyance to sit through rather than a threat.  Exiting the room into a narrow hallway or dead end with only one way out, the monster simply vanished, no where to be found.  I even went so far as to look for trouble, finding no monsters.  Monster appearences seemed to me to occur only after steps in a puzzle for a certain location were completed.  For example, gaining an item needed to advance or unlocking a door would trigger an event which I would unfailingly avoid through the method described above.  The only challenge left in the game were the puzzles themselves which were excellent.  They required just enough thought that you felt accomplished solving them and they weren&apos;t so difficult as to feel tedious or mind numbing and forced.  The pacing and placement of these puzzles was also excellent.  The story was also engaging though the three endings leave a lot to be desired.  Unlocking the different endings is as simple as reloading save to the final minutes of gameplay.  Nothing you do throughout the game affects which ending you will receive - only what you do at the very very end of the game.  If you&apos;re a horror game fanatic, you&apos;ll enjoy this game more than I did.  Otherwise, it&apos;ll feel like a puzzle game with a half baked stealth mini game of avoiding monsters thrown in the break the flow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1720432">Expand</a></span>

The atmosphere, the locations, the bone-chilling horror, are all done well; however, the horrendous English voice acting really pulls the player out of the experience - enough so that I feel 8.5 would be the right score. This is a shame, because Amnesia is one of the best &quot;survival horror&quot;, or whatever you want to label it, games available. One minor complaint are the flat textures and somewhat sluggish controls. However, I fully realize that this is an independent game, and the budget and resources available are far less than a developer like CAPCOM or Konami has to work with. All things considered, and with the exception of the voice acting, this is probably the scariest, and best-conceived game I have played in this genre since Silent Hill 3 and Fatal Frame 2. I also applaud the creators for taking a considerable risk when they could have easily made another sequel to their prior games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1481587">Expand</a></span>

Scary as in the obvious, &quot;OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT THING AND WHY IS IT CHASING ME?!&quot;. The horror of Amnesia is something I have never quite seen in other games. Instead of little startles here and there to momentarily freak out the player (games such as Dead Space 1 &amp; 2 express this quality in bundles), Amnesia goes for the masterpiece symphony kind of scary, where the horror is carefully crafted with the players emotions and feelings in constant mind. There is no set place that a monster will be in at a time, rather it patrols the area that you are or could be in. This not only triggers the scared, yet curious emotions in the players brain, it also adds a great deal of immersion into the atmosphere. You see a room you haven&apos;t explored yet, one half of your brain is telling you to go in and explore, &quot;You might find something of value in there and progress through the game, and after all that&apos;s what it is a GAME&quot;. But the other side of your brain is pleading with you, &quot;Don&apos;t go in there! There&apos;s obviously going to be a monster in there that wants to eat yo-WHAT WAS THAT?!? I heard a moaning noise!!! I am NOT going in there!&quot;. In the end curiosity gets the better of you and you decide to explore. And you either find a clue or item to help you progress, or you find a monster that wants to use your face skin as a napkin after enjoying a nice, tasty dinner of your intestines, in which case you want to hide somewhere and hope that the monster passes by without noticing you. In some cases you&apos;ll find both a monster and an item. Another use of the word &quot;scary&quot; is used as in such phrases &quot;this game has a different all together play style of any other game I&apos;ve ever played...it&apos;s...it&apos;s scary&quot;. Amnesia isn&apos;t your average first person shooter, as in it takes out the word &quot;shooter&quot; as there are absolutely NO weapons at your disposal (which in turn, makes the game a LOT scarier), and replaces it with &quot;fright fest&quot;. It also adds an item that I really enjoy, puzzles! There are a plethora of puzzles scattered throughout Amnesia. They range from collecting bits of a machine and putting them together, to pressing buttons or pulling levers in a certain order. These puzzles create a nice island that is your piss and excrement from the insane scariness everywhere else in the game. Finally, scary can be used such as in the phrase &quot;this game is scary good!&quot;. Which this game most certainly is. You can&apos;t find a scarier monster film, book, game, or story that tops the Fright-skyscraper that is Amnesia: The Dark Descent! This game is perfect for a group of friends looking for some fun entertainment, or a single person that&apos;s just looking for a good time. For $20, and hours upon hours of mind bending, scary fun, you can&apos;t go wrong!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1663842">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not like this is glued to it. Second, the jump mechanic was awful to me, making an entire flooded section be so difficult to pass that I literally turned the game off and never picked it up again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1694549">Expand</a></span>

People love to throw that word around, but the thing is, you can &quot;immerse&quot; yourself in ANY game - The question is why did you choose to do it with Amnesia, as opposed to any of the other games in the world? And honestly, I couldn&apos;t tell you. You spend a large portion of the game walking around in an open room, nothing to fight, nothing significant to do. When you first encounter an enemy, you can&apos;t fight it. Your character is apparently afraid of them, so I guess you have to be too, even though they&apos;re not actually scary. And I mean what&apos;s the worst thing that can happen? You would die and have to reload the game? That is the worst possible case scenario. It&apos;s not like something is going to come out of the screen and torture you if you do badly or something. I know I&apos;m mostly talking about the philosophy behind the game, and not the gameplay itself, but that&apos;s because there&apos;s really not much to talk about as far as gameplay. You just walk around doing insignificant little things, like finding matches so that you can light torches, so that you don&apos;t have to watch the annoying screen effects when your character starts to go crazy because of the darkness. This game simply has no appeal to me. If you aren&apos;t into horror related games, don&apos;t buy in to the hype. It&apos;s just a very generic, typical horror game. Nothing more, nothing less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2015841">Expand</a></span>

The level design, in some places anyway, is pretty solid, and you actually feel like you&apos;re in a massive castle. And then the horror elements come in. At first, they are genuinely scary. Monsters are intimidating in every way, be it by the growls they let loose to let you know of their presence, the tell-tale footsteps and grinding noises, and the possible rage they get into when they spot your sorry behind. They&apos;ve definitely roused their fair share of scares from a number of players. But I&apos;m not really one of them.<br><br>For starters, the AI in this game is almost non-existent, following a seemingly on-rails methodology. This is ALWAYS the case in the game. Yes, there is pretty much one monster that doesn&apos;t follow this system, but it&apos;s for the only genuinely scary part of the game which doesn&apos;t last. When a monster appears, simply hide somewhere, wait for it to go out of sight, and it&apos;ll disappear from the level outright. The trend never dissipates, which is disappointing in the very least. This definitely makes the monsters more of an obtrusion than an actual enemy that could pose a threat to you. Even sadder is the fact that Penumbra did a better job in this regard.<br><br>Music is pretty good, though. Mikko Tarmia is the composer, and he knew what he was doing with the game&apos;s soundtrack. Rather than give a sense of total isolation like Penumbra did, this one makes you feel like the walls are closing in. Graphics are mixed. There are solid effects here, like the SSAO lighting and higher-than-average polygon count, considering the low budget at work. Monster designs are a plus, so Frictional did a good job here. However, you can&apos;t help but feel like it is outdated. Hardly to the fault of the developers though, who may have earned enough cashola to warrant an improved engine.<br><br>Physics is sort of important here. You can interact with pretty much anything in the game world, but other than opening doors, flipping levers &amp; switches, and picking up items or notes, you don&apos;t do much of anything that makes you want to interact with the game world. While they did add the ability to fully rotate some objects, there isn&apos;t really a reason to. It could have been used to better effect, like say, to investigate an object that might have a nook or cranny containing a key or some other thing. Story is alright. There&apos;s little to involve you in the game, and there&apos;s no narrative. Every bit of the story comes from the notes and mementos you come across in the game. Plus, you might find yourself wanting some kind of landmark to come around to break the monotony you happen upon. You only come across one character that kind of interacts with you, but it&apos;s kind of creepy and you would have to have a suspension of disbelief to cope with it.<br><br>You can play custom stories, even with things you make yourself, because the developers added features to elongate the game&apos;s replay factor. At least they accomplished that.<br><br>It&apos;s a disappointing title, considering that Penumbra (sans &apos;Requiem&apos;) was a solid series of horror adventure games. This one is convoluted, gets predictable quite fast, and could have been improved in so many ways (don&apos;t make the enemies so pointless, for starters, as they are only there to give you the chills or scares for a few moments). Hopefully, though, they&apos;ve learned their lesson and they try something better next time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/amnesia-the-dark-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=1754644">Expand</a></span>
