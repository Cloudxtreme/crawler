Attack with one button, jump with the other &amp; you get a charge style attack that changes depending on the spell you have equipped. It&apos;s a very good metroidvania style game.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a very heavy emphasis on exploration as well. You really have no idea on where you need to go &amp; the game gives you very little direction. There are several places in the beginning that you can enter but if you lack a certain upgrade you won&apos;t get very far. I found this out the hard way.
<br>
<br>You are very weak in the beginning &amp; will die a lot but you get health upgrades from bosses, find them in the world &amp; can buy them from certain shops. There are also various enemy types that will remind you of other games. One in particular is a blue hedgehog that attacks you with a spin dash. The bosses are hard at first but they each have a set pattern that once you learn will be able to beat them easily.
<br>
<br>Overall I haven&apos;t gotten very far in this game yet but I have seen enough that I can already recommend it. If you want a classic NES style game &amp; you thought Shovel Knight was too easy then you should pick this one up. It&apos;s also good for anyone who wants a decent metroidvania style game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castle-in-the-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=5052777">Expand</a></span>

<br>The world is filled with a variety of traps, enemies, and death around every corner. Some areas you will be stuck in for hours dodging spikes and cleverly placed traps.
<br>Along the way you find numerous weapons, armor, magic, and items to upgrade your hero so you can slay the 50+ unique bosses and progress through a beautiful 16-bit world with pixel perfect control.

First things first, before getting into this game you need to realize it&apos;s very challenging, and you&apos;re probably going to have a lot of trial and error. If you&apos;re just not good with old-school game difficulty then you might want to back off, otherwise expect a very rewarding and enjoyable experience. I think that the beginning parts of the game are definitely some of the most difficult, simply due to the player&apos;s lack of experience and also because of how quickly you die. I&apos;ve played through the game twice, the first time I died countlessly as I hopped and flailed my sword around not really knowing what to do; the second time I gracefully defeated the bosses and dodged spikes with very infrequent deaths. In other words this is a game you need to learn how to be good at, and it&apos;s very precision based. All of the bosses have particular patterns they follow, and some have weaknesses you can exploit.  I also should not forget to mention that the soundtrack for this game is really good, some tracks, like the Sunken Temple theme made me sit still for a while just to listen to them.
<br>
<br>The only complaint I have is about the bugs. The first time I played the game I couldn&apos;t get to the Torture Chamber because of a glitch. It&apos;s also possible to get stuck in the Sunken Temple if you go there without a particular item from what I&apos;ve heard.
<br>
<br>Anyways, Castle In The Darkness is an awesome game. If you&apos;re looking to scratch your retro platformer itch, then I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It gets a 9/10 from me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castle-in-the-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=5258835">Expand</a></span>

Music is better than I thought, it&apos;s really good. Gameplay is amazing. Story is somewhat regular but with some twist which makes it superior to most nes games.
