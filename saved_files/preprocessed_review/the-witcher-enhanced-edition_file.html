This is my third time picking it up in the past few years.  The first two times I couldn&apos;t make it past the second chapter.  I could rave on and on about the good stuff: yes, it&apos;s pretty.  Yes it&apos;s nice to have a world where real people hate each other for real reasons.  Yes, there is a LOT of character customization options.  The flaws are there, however, and for me at least, they bog down the game to no end.  1) The fighting: As a few other reviews have said, the fighting is at first a breath of fresh air.  The timed click events are unique to the RPG realm, as far as I know.  The problem is the lack of fluidity.  Want to cast a sign?  Make sure that you&apos;re done with your swing.  Want to switch styles?  Make sure you&apos;re done with your swing.  Want to ... You get the idea.  Add this to the inevitable boredom that comes with all gameplay styles eventually, and I was craving an autoattack.  2) The voice acting: Normally, I would brush over this.  But this stuff is BAAAAADDDDD.  I respect the fact that it probably sounds great in Polish, but really...  Youtube some cutscense if you don&apos;t believe me, then imagine those voices for 40+ hours.  I have to listen to it in French so I don&apos;t punch Geralt.  The problem is that if you don&apos;t read fast enough, you&apos;re toast for the rest of the conversation.  Add this to the fact that there are a ton of cutscenes, and you&apos;ve got a HUGE problem.  3) The storytelling: This is different than the story, which is actually quite good.  You know when your grandpa used to tell that awesome story, then you try to tell it to your buddies and it just doesn&apos;t come out quite right?  That&apos;s the Witcher.  The tone is off, the writing style is off, there are words that are out of place for characters, there are words that are out of place for the world, it&apos;s just sad.  No, really, I mean sad.  The story really is relatively deep.  But it is better told on the wikia site.  4) The girls:  I&apos;ve got no problem with a little hanky panky in my games, but this is nuts.  It really takes away from the reality of the background.  The problem isn&apos;t that girls throw themselves at you, it&apos;s that they throw themselves at you at oddball times and in oddball ways.  It&apos;s mature, but in a sappy sense.  Sure, you can ignore them, but you can&apos;t ignore that they threw themselves at you.  5) The supposed choice system: It&apos;s not that it&apos;s not there.  It&apos;s that it&apos;s missing a key piece: neutrality.  There was time and again where I wanted to say &quot;Ya&apos;ll are idiots,&quot; and the only options are to pick a side.  There might be a lack of a morality meter, but trust me, the morality is there.  Again, this isn&apos;t a big deal expect for the backstory.  You&apos;re a sellsword for god&apos;s sake!  Act like one!<br><br><br>I tried this game again so I would know what was going on when I gave the Witcher 2 a try.  I plugged through it for that reason.  It&apos;s palpatable for that reason.  But for those of you looking for a fresh take on RPG&apos;s, look elsewhere.  The pros where enough to garner a loyal following back in the day, but the cons will turn off those who weren&apos;t interested from the start.  It&apos;s not a horrible game, but it&apos;s not one that ages well.  Here&apos;s for hoping that #2 is better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1729326">Expand</a></span>

After I have been so disappointed by latest Gothic III game which virtually wasn&apos;t playable even in latest version - this game made me absolutely excited. Somehow similar to Gothic series but more realistic, with a very nice and believable characters and sophisticated story and quests. This game is definitely worth to buy and play (for several times).</span>

<br>Combat is somewhat automatic, you click on the enemy to attack, then wait for your character to combo until the cursor flashes and click again.  There&apos;s a few spells but they are not too interesting. The alchemy is well done, it involves collecting ingredients and mixing potions, allowing you to heal or gain temporary buffs.
<br>
<br>The plot and exploration are linear, you progress to the next chapter and cannot go back (except between chapter 2 and 3).  There are some interesting points in the story in which you are forced to make a decision, but the overall plot is largely unaffected by these choices.
<br>
<br>There are a LOT of cutscenes. At one point there was a cutscene, then a brief fight with 2 normal enemies, then another cutscene.  You can click to speed up cutscenes which is nice if you read fast.
<br>
<br>Good graphics, but is very CPU intensive even on my new computer.  Occasionally crashed and lost some progress.
<br>
<br>Played 41 hours, cost $1.50.  Recommended on sale and if you have a good computer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7210106">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The first thing I noticed was the gameplay. The game is pretty old now, and this concerned me. The gameplay is one of the things I appreciate most in games, along with immersion and story. The combat reminds me of MMO combat, where you click on your enemy, and you attack. The combat here is deeper than that, but not by mutch. But once you begin exprerimenting with alchemy, it gets much deeper. With the right combination of potions, blade oils and bombs, you can make a hard fight much easier and funnier. You can also upgrade your fighting moves.
<br>
<br>The worst part about this game in my eyes, is the walking. The map is quite huge, especially when you have to walk everywhere, from quest to quest. This made me feel like I was wasting time. The cutscenes are also quite awkward, but the story makes up for it.
<br>
<br>But the best part about this game is the story, watching you decisions have consequenses. The choises you make, feel like they matter.
<br>
<br>I spent 50 or so hours on this game, I always do sidequests and such, but the main story is about 30 give or take.
<br>
<br>All in all, great game with great characters, and the end make me so pumped to play though the next one :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7485049">Expand</a></span>

This is what an RPG should be, excellent story, excellent gameplay, stunning visuals, reaslitic dialogue, and a unique alchemy system. I really can&apos;t think of the last single player RPG I&apos;ve enjoyed this much. Kudos CDProject for delivering an amazing gaming experience.</span>

This version of the witcher is by far a huge improvement, while all the details are not instantly apparent, they show themselves to you until you finally realize the scale of added details. Fantastic masterpiece.</span>

The storyline(s) are all actually interesting (unlike most other RPGs I&apos;ve played), not because of the overarching goal (kill bad guy), but because of the way you can watch it develop, if you give it attention. This isn&apos;t a game that will force everything of note into your lap, you have to go out and find it. It does not reward lazy playing. Choices are of course, in. Not &quot;Will you eat the baby or give it candy and love&quot; sorts, more like &quot;Will I help the sociopathic terrorists being about racial equality and end persecution or will I help the religious zealots bring stability and order?&quot;. Decisions can be hard and have consequences impacting the rest of the game. Every choice you make can very well leave you thinking &quot;Am I helping the right people here?&quot;. Personally, I love it. Probably not so great in terms of replayability (thus the lower score), gameplay can get tedious towards the mid-points of most of the chapters (&quot;cmon mister mayor, don&apos;t make me run all the way back to the swamp, I just got back from there...&quot;), but the shortcomings are made up for by the story, easily.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=419636">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t hold your hand too much, but only slightly pushes you in the right direction, letting you make the decisions yourself. A game that doesn&apos;t treat you like an idiot five-year-old nowadays is a much needed breath of fresh air. The storyline is very good (despite the memory loss clich&#xE9;), and the main character is interesting. The gameworld is not a fairy tale world with a simple good versus evil nature, but is very grey, which forces you to think and sometimes make hard decisions. The gameworld is very immersive thanks to very good graphics, and a world that feels very alive. The fighting gameplay is good and varied enough to keep you entertained while the story progresses. If you are a fan of RPGs, or games with good stories in general, do not miss this modern classic!

The makers of the game have paid loving attention to every detail -- even the conversations you overhear on the streets are interesting, and I&apos;ve never said THAT about a game before! The loving attention that&apos;s been lavished on this game reminds me of what Peter Jackson did with The Lord of the Rings movies -- this game is extremely well done. And it&apos;s fun! It&apos;s a game for adults, and I don&apos;t mean the much-maligned sex cards. It&apos;s a game where the story really matters, where the player must make serious moral choices, where instead of Good and Bad, we have lighter grey and darker grey. The people in the slums swear, and the people in the rich section of town are stuck-up. And the fighting animations are GORGEOUS! They did motion capture with professional stunt men to do the animations for combat, and the player character is amazingly graceful in the beginning. As the game progresses, he goes beyond graceful and becomes downright acrobatic -- there were times when I wished it were possible to automate the fighting so that I could watch it more closely, and I&apos;ve never thought THAT about a game before! I could go on and on, but I&apos;ve said enough.

The Witcher team has created a dark, stunningly realised world, full of great characters and satisfying moral choices. A 9+ is the only mark you could give this gaming achievement - its that good. The reviewers that gave this game a 4 were either not to bright or distracted with a ball of string.</span>

I enjoyed it&apos;s mature story and the world it takes place in is beautiful with a rich history. Decisions you must make are complex and require thought as they have an impact on the later parts of the game. The developer, CD Projekt Red, is one of the best out there. They care about their games AND the fans. If you enjoy RPG&apos;s and are looking for something different you owe it to yourself to pick this game up. You will not regret it.  Oh, although I like the first Witcher better, the second it also fantastic and picks up right after the first. Both brilliant games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2147534">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve since finished it as the Enhanced Edition. It&apos;s improved but still far from perfect: the overlapping quest chains can get tangled and be confusing-- sometimes a quest will bug out and be incompletable; the number of NPC models has increased only by a handful; dialogue trees with nonsensical headers have been improved greatly but you still must zone to see a new dialogue if you&apos;ve done what the NPC wanted and they have something new to say, and you also have to stop your conversation if a NPC gives you a quest, even though they have more dialogue choices available; most of the truly cringeworthy voiceover has been replaced with professional-quality work, although some perfectly fine stuff from the first version was inexplicably replaced with a lesser quality iteration. Anyway, what makes the game truly great and a truly adult one (once you cut through the pretensions to maturity like profanity and casual sexual encounters and dirty playing cards featuring boobies) is the narrative. It is why the game has such a following; I didn&apos;t see it their way at first, but they were right. The dialogue is good stuff, and the themes are &apos;adult&apos; in the real sense of that word: there is no good and evil, only choices. Moreover, the gameplay is old-school cool as well: The Witcher doesn&apos;t condescend to hand-hold like nearly every other game of any genre on the market today; you have to pay attention and have patience. No one will explain it all or make it easy for you. Thankfully, in The Witcher, you are not in a vicarious first-person movie in which the gameworld caters to you so much you might as well be a virtual cow in a virtual chute. Oh, and the combat system has a charm all its own; it&apos;s a simple single click mechanic that gets more complicated fighting multiple enemies; a skilled player can turn any fight into a slick ballet of death: the motion-captured swordplay, acrobatics (and the gory finishing coup de graces) are loads of fun. But this is getting too long, so I&apos;ll say it like this: The Witcher is a flawed masterpiece: 3 parts one-of the-best RPGs-ever made and, regrettably, 1 part bargain bin title. The recent controversial heir to the RPG throne, Oblivion, was technical perfection and a great game in it&apos;s own right; but in terms of truly engrossing story and depth, it can&apos;t hold a candle to The Witcher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=417998">Expand</a></span>

However, Witcher Enhanced--was fairly solid for me. A few crashes here and there after long hours of gameplay--but not at all bothersome. As for the game-- I haven&apos;t loved an RPG like this since the Baldur&apos;s Gate series (tho I really liked Oblivion &amp; Bioshock). This is definitely a game for mature teens &amp; up (i&apos;m sure some adults aren&apos;t even mature enough to handle it). Marvelous gameplay/moral relativity and just a solid storyline even among a genre that&apos;s chalk full of cliches (this has them, but done well, you don&apos;t care). Great job and I hope they continue with a second Witcher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=421816">Expand</a></span>

The 3D version in terms of details that flesh out the world and characters of Baldurs Gate 2. At first i was disappointed with the combat system but you learn to overcome it quickly and it actually becomes very fun if you pick up the potion/ bomb and weapon coating making. The consequences of your actions are always there to remind you to be careful of what you say and do and the world you play in feels very alive. Its a very dark game with mature themes that do get presented believably and the language is realistically harsh as well. This is very welcome indeed. RPG bliss in all its glory even if it is a fact that you play a predetermined character. Night and day cycles, character schedules, trust and betrayal, neutrality, cause and effect, action and reaction, its all there to be experienced the way the player wishes. You have a place in the world and it shows. The game grafically is dark, gritty, realistic and especially unwelcome. You are always feeling in constant danger which is a good thing. Music is well done and fitting throughout the game and acting performances are also good enough without winning any oscars. They are just universally well done enough to not detract between great - horrible as many other games of the genre tend to do. If you can bypass the initial shock of the bemany style combat system and sink your teeth a little deeper you are sure going to find a game worth of your time and money and now with the Enhanced edition things are even better since most of the serious flaws that plagued the initial release of the game are no more (like loading times who are now at a perfectly acceptable level instead of absolutely unbearable). Just go get this game and see what the fuss is all about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=741902">Expand</a></span>

But now, after quitting WoW, and having a week of free time to kill, I decided to give it a shot. Plus, you can, in fact, buy the original game and upgrade it to enhanced version for free (this saves you about 25 bucks), This is the RPG that really aged with the audience. I&apos;m not as old as some of these guys, but I grew up with FF6-7, Chrono Trigger, etc and as those types of RPGs progressed, they really didn&apos;t change much as my tastes mutated in leaps and bounds. I mean, you look at final fantasy and it&apos;s basically the same melodrama infested RPG it used to be, just now they take more cues from JPOP and anime (which in my mind is a severe detriment). The Witcher, on the other hand, is far more gritty and real. It&apos;s a step above the Oblivions and the Fallouts in its story and setting. The game play and graphics still need some work, and the camera takes some getting used to, but this game is just really engrossing, and it pushes the boundaries of the RPG genre to a more adult oriented ground. The main problem I had with games like Oblivion/Fallout and other types of open world games was the lack of a significantly well made plot. The Witcher has a great plot that really keeps it in the focus instead of throwing it to the backburner. In Oblivion, I really never bothered about the plot, preferring to simply do the Assassin&apos;s Guild quests and leaving it at that. In The Witcher, there&apos;s no such problem. The Witcher does have a myriad of issues though. I don&apos;t really care about loading times on my computer, they&apos;re not such a big deal. However, there are issues with the graphics/models; they&apos;re not very polished. Reviewers say this is the best the engine can do though, so whatever. Another HUGE problem is the map. It blows really bad. Another issue is the camera. Unlike WoW, where right-clicking and holding will allow you to turn the camera, the mouse in The Witcher simply turns whenever you move the mouse. This is really annoying and causes the user to pause a LOT to mess with inventory instead of doing it on the move. I also didn&apos;t find any key for auto run. In short, The Witcher is the next step in the RPG genre as it ages with its player base, and a game no RPG fan should miss out on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=422647">Expand</a></span>

Aside from a few small issues with the quests and a bit of confusion traversing the map this game is a true diamond. Considering some of the rubbish out there saturating the game market this is seriously a must have for true gamers.</span>

Despite being a sword wielding witcher, combat revolves around using the right potions/stance for the job and clicking every once in a while at the right time. This is true for the entirety of the game. While it is not very engaging in combat, the story is VERY engaging. From courting every talkative female you come across to fistfighting drunks in every bar you enter, there is a world for you to conquer. The actions you take have a dramatic impact on the characters you come across, and you&apos;ll never quite be able to decide if someone is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;, because nobody is a shallow stereotype in this world.
<br>
<br>People who seem like sleazebags often turn out to be kind at heart, and others who seem like valuable allies force you to make decisions you don&apos;t want to, turning them into enemies.
<br>
<br>When I beat the game I was compelled to look back at all the people I interacted with and how their lives turned out. Despite doing my best I couldn&apos;t avoid killing people I had once been trying to protect, and in the end I felt like a pawn in a game that I didn&apos;t understand, yet somehow I had still come out the end a hero who had done all he could to keep peace and order.
<br>
<br>If you have the patience to deal with combat that isn&apos;t very engaging, and a lust for good storytelling, you should without a doubt play this especially if you have any interest in playing the other Witcher games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5325458">Expand</a></span>

I am stunned that this is such an underrated title. Get the word out about how good this RPG is! It is up there with Oblivion, Mass Effect, World of Warcraft, etc.</span>

<br>
<br>The combat system in the Witcher seems confusing and cumbersome during the first few acts- but once you level up a few times and get used to the quirks to it this ceases to be an issue.  The middle levels are quite enjoyable- the gameworld is well developed and reasonably original.  The RPG combat and character development is well done and the artwork holds up a half decade after its original release.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately the questing is largely fetch quest based.  In the latter portions you end up doing a *lot* of back and forth over familiar terrain either grinding monsters or fetching quest items.  This was a showstopper for me on the original version- but the enhanced edition vastly decreases the load times and makes this somewhat less tedious.
<br>
<br>Not my favorite RPG of recent years- but probably worth the price of a movie ticket if you are a fan of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2786221">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Dislike:
<br>- Combat is terrible, click enemy wait for sword to glow, click again succeed and repeat or fail and start again.
<br>at first didn&apos;t like how the combat felt, but after getting used to it past the first boss, it doesn&apos;t seem too bad and is worth putting up with as the story is good. And once you start getting combo&apos;s into the 3&apos;s to 5&apos;s it&apos;s quite fun to watch Geralt do elaborate multiple swings and backflips.
<br>
<br>-Not fond of the easy, trashy women, every woman I come across in the game wants Geralt. None of them seem to have any morals or respect for themselves. And don&apos;t have old fashion values of courting, romance or being wooed properly.
<br>
<br>-Monster hunting side quests a bit boring and repetitive.
<br>-some quests have a lot of back tracking with no quick way to travel.
<br>-inventory is so small with no way to expand it.
<br>-unimportant NPC&apos;s have many replica&apos;s such as old peasant women all look the same, the merchants all are fat richly robed etc.
<br>-A bit too linear, can&apos;t go back to previous areas.
<br>-A bit disapointed at the end to obviously what Alvin has become in the future.
<br>-even playing on normal mode, didn&apos;t need alchemy much, mostly just used swallow, Cat, white rafford&apos;s Decoction and the occasional oil coating. Didn&apos;t bother with bombs.
<br>-With the signs only used Aard for knockback and Igni for Incineration, didn&apos;t find the others that useful or necessary.
<br>
<br>Despite the things I didn&apos;t like, I definitely reccomend this game, especially for those who like RPG&apos;s and a good story. This game to me is a must play. Not quite worthy of an 8 as the combat is rather clunky and not very good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5401777">Expand</a></span>

The story in the Witcher has a very deep scope as it follows the journey of the witcher Geralt of Rivia to reveal the imbroglio in a nation and all the dark secrets. The game features a lot of moral choices which will yield different consequences in the later game and you have to do a lot of dialog choices to uncover various quests. Combat is entertaining and somehow tactical, you will need to choose right fight styles against different types of enemies as well as use effective portions. Inventory is the only disadvantage because the space is really limited, so strategy is needed. Overall it&apos;s a great rpg with a deep storyline driving it. The game still has problems, long loading time and instant crashes do occur but not often enough to ruin the immersion. If you enjoy games like dragon age origins, I am sure you will love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1748608">Expand</a></span>

The different attack styles and weaknesses of enemies will keep you on your toes, and your playstyle and propensity for exploration will very much determine your success in the game as well as the difficulty. Do not be discouraged by the first boss fight; it&apos;s easily the most difficult fight in the game. For reference, I died against the first boss approximately 23-25 times, and I died less than 10 times for entire duration of the remainder of the game. I had a great time playing this, and I would recommend it to not only RPG fans, but anyone at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2078100">Expand</a></span>

My main gripe isn&apos;t that the combat is boring - personally I found it quite decent and pretty fun even after 30 or so hours - it&apos;s that the game itself is boring. There&apos;s a lack of any real excitement throughout the game and each quest is more work than fun. The game&apos;s got a lot of great aspects including a superbly downtrodden and realistic atmosphere, it&apos;s also got a very mature and practical feel to it (although it does go overboard with the amount of women you get to bang with such little effort), but throw in lots of micro management with the inventory and labourious quests that involve a lot of going back and forth and it just feels like to much work to play through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2403738">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m going to make it short and sweet.  Right now I think this game is on line for being one of the best RPG&apos;s out there.  There are just a few things and a few bugs that keep it from getting the highest of scores in my opinion.  I&apos;ll break it down to things I like about it and things I don&apos;t like about it:<br><br>Likes:  Great graphics, Incredible storytelling, fun gameplay and combat (once you get used to it), wonderful music score, original story and content, nice interface, runs great on my system at max settings 1920x1200<br><br>Dislikes:  Can&apos;t jump or jump off anything, the Witcher is glued to the ground, many of the NPC&apos;s have the exact same faces (redundant), the Alchemy system is not very intuitive, SLi bug . . . there is a known bug where nVidia SLi users can see lights through the terrain.  Like looking at a stone wall and you can still see torch light and window lights through the wall.  This is a known bug with no fix, you can disable SLi and the problem goes away, but that is hardly a fix. Some of the cutscenes in the game are a bit long in the beginning and some of the voice acting good be better.<br><br>Overall I&apos;m really loving this game, I think you need to play the game for a few hours before you can really start to appreciate it.  Some games hit like a truck right off the bat and you never look back.  If you pick up The Witcher, take some time with it and get used to the combat system, in the end you&apos;ll probably really like the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1404227">Expand</a></span>

The environments are beautiful and some of the quests are highly original. The basic storyline is overrated and a bit mediocre as you are part of an elite group called witchers who are attacked by a gang of Bad Guys(TM) whom you pursue for most of the game. The other parts of the story are much better. Your character faces a problem of identity. He has to balance his life as a witcher with dreams of being a family man. He has friends and lovers. He gets caught up in political machinations. All of this stuff has been done before in games, but this one does it thoughtfully and with rarely seen subtlety. TW1 is a game where things are not always as they appear, and some banal details later turn out to be highly significant. The game is also big, with a lot of maps to explore and a full five chapters plus epilogue and prologue. There are downsides too. While the art for the environments is beautiful, too many of the characters look as if the programmers drew them. Also, some of them look like their texture maps are low res or bugged. The combat, while usually painless, leaves very little room for developing individual strategy. The same can be said for promoting your character. You ultimately acquire 75% of the talents in the talent tree, and most people playing the game will have the same build by the end. The game also lacks selection in weapons and armor. The potions can be cool, but you only get the more interesting ones in the last fifth of the game. Another problem is that the quests require too much running back and forth across a huge map, often with the sole purpose of getting a new dialogue option. The other complaint I have is that the story doesn`t always make sense on the ``neutral path``. Overall, however, it`s still a solid game for the mature gamer with an ounce of patience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1796332">Expand</a></span>

<br>Why?
<br>Because this game can only be truly appreciated by a real hardcore RPG fan, which I&apos;m not.
<br>To be honest I&apos;m more of a linear RPG/ action adventure game fan like Bioware used to make.
<br>
<br>So what did a liked in this Game:
<br>
<br>The story which as some really unforgettable moments
<br>The amazing soundtrack
<br>The art work, which is beautiful and detailed.
<br>The game world that felt alive and vibrant, with day and night cycles, dynamic weather, NPCs doing their daily work during the day and returning home at dusk.
<br>The strategic element through the use of potions and magic.
<br>The choices you make have significant consequences to the way the story unfolds and to the ones around you.
<br>
<br>What I didn&apos;t Like
<br>
<br>The pacing of the story which begins at a very dull tone and slooooooooowly starts to gain momentum.
<br>The difficulty spikes
<br>The boring combat mechanics that made me quit this game more than twice.
<br>The excruciating booooooooooooooooring fetch quests
<br>The dull sound effects
<br>The hit or miss voice acting
<br>The immature and borderline distasteful approach to sex in this game.
<br>The anticlimactic and boring boss fight with Azar Javed.
<br>The fact that everything in this game is too expensive which forced me to side track from the story to look for loot, that in 70% of the times is food and booze.
<br>The lack of customization, armors, interesting weapons (the steel sword you start with is actually better than 90% of the weapons in this game).
<br>The fact that after a cut scenes, that precedes a fight, I would immediately be surrounded by enemy&apos;s and attacked before I could respond.
<br>The lack of interesting puzzles
<br>
<br>In conclusion
<br>Considering this is the first game from CD Projectk Red, and the low budget they had, i&apos;m very impressed with the final product despite it&apos;s multiple faults.
<br>
<br>I rate this game a 7 out of 10. But be warned  this game is not for every one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3491086">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m trying to find game with worse combat system, but i think it&apos;s impossible. I stopped game after few combats. Also characters are typical supermen, story is typical &quot;we are the best and we can rule gods....&quot;.
<br>I have better fun with old MDK, which I bought on GOG. And Witcher is in Trash folder on Steam, where he belongs.</span>

<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the fighting mechanics and menus/inventory are a mess and it hurts the gameplay quite a bit. Managing the inventory takes too long and the fights don&apos;t really feel fluid. Switching between stances quickly becomes tedious. The game also crashed a few times.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s still a great RPG, especially if you are looking for a good story.

This game is quite a bit older than the two others, and has a different style.
<br>HOWEVER! What this game has going for it is another strong story and a lot of atmosphere. This is what the company got right even in this first game. It is obvious that the team truly loves the source (the books and stories) and the world and story in this game, IMO, is VERY immersive.
<br>
<br>The playstyle is quite different, just like the graphics. It reminds me a bit more of Diablo, as it&apos;s click-to-move. You have different stances which you switch with keys, according to what you are fighting. Of course, alchemy and signs are in this game as well, as they are just of a trademark of the character as the two swords are.
<br>
<br>The game is showing it&apos;s age, as the graphics are of course not comparable to the later games, and it&apos;s quite interesting to compare the mechanics of the games, and see how the series developed.
<br>But even though this game has weaknesses and will feel VERY different compared to the later ones (total readjustment especially regarding combat), it still has tons of atmosphere and, as I said, a fascinating story. It&apos;s actually quite impressive how much the (back then) small company put into this game.
<br>
<br>If you don&apos;t mind the fact that the game is a bit older and therefore is very different regarding graphics and playstyle, if you care about the characters (of course, many of the beloved characters from the stories and the other games appear here, for example Triss and Vesemir) and the story, you might find yourself quite immersed, and if you are willing to adjust to the very different movement and combat, you might enjoy it a lot. I sure did!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6090309">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It has great music and great environmental effects. The combat system is not bad, the fights are dynamic. I like that there aren&apos;t millions of quests like Elder Scroll saga. I suppose it has great graphics for the year it was released.
<br>
<br>This is a story I have read,  watched or played like thousand times, I know that most of people think that is great, but I found a bit boring, maybe after playing The Walking Dead or reading Game of Thrones everything is different... xD
<br>
<br>Many people say that this a mature story... I think that it is dark and there is sex in the game xD... but that doesn&apos;t mean that is mature. I agree that is cool that the decisions that you make affect the storyline... but this is not new... you can see it in most of rpgs, maybe in this game the choices are more &apos;mature&apos; or more ethically complex than in other games like Dragon Age o Baldur&apos;s Gate, but as I said before... veeery far from Telltale Games choices gaming (maybe is unfair to compare with Telltale Games I know...).
<br>
<br>The types of quests are quite repetitive. The cuts between scenes are awful. There are many bugs, and the controls are a bit unresponsive sometimes.
<br>
<br>I think this game is quite overrated. I had probably enjoyed it more if people hadn&apos;t  told me that was a great game. I give it a 7 minus 1 to counterbalance its reputation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3846954">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Witcher Enhanced game uses the Bioware engine made famous from games like Dragon Age or Knights of the Old Republic. For some people that might be enough info to stick this game in the bin - for me it should have been.
<br>
<br>The game starts with an excellent intro and then you go through a tutorial section where many of the games systems are played though. The story was quite different than the normal D&amp;D realms as it has an Eastern European influence and the world is gritty, racist, sexist etc. Quite adult sometimes, it is not a family game. You can encounter Elves and Dwarves in your travels and a varied array of monsters. The graphics and sound are pretty good. Nightime can really scare the pants of you and the effects of water, the style of buildings etc is pretty good.
<br>
<br>Witchers are specialist monster hunters that have been through extreme training that has somehow changed their biology. They can craft potions and use magic. Combat is interesting, a timed clicking experience to build up attacks. Silver weapons work better on monsters and steel is better for humans. There are three diffent styles of fighting depending on whether your opponent is large and slow, quick or if you are fighting a group. Alchemy was completly incomprehensible in the earlier version but has been updated now and easier to manage. Easier, not easy. Everywhere you go plants can be harvested for ingredients and then made into potions. Although, before you can do that the recipe must be known. Oh - and you can get drunk and stumble around for a while. Sometimes you can even acquire key objectives through getting drunk.
<br>
<br>First time around I could not for the life of me figure how to rest or make potions. The &quot;Enhanced&quot; version makes this easier and you normally have to find a fireplace where you can medidate, level up and create potions.
<br>
<br>I did like the journal where you have to learn about certain things before you can action it in game. For example, reading a book about zombies will allow you to recognise how to beat them in combat and then what part of their bodies can be harvested for alchemy or profit. That is a neat idea which I liked. The auto map is pretty decent and sometimes you have the option to flag quest objectives on the map where help you go where you must.
<br>
<br>Now, I tried to play this game a long time ago and gave up in chapter one. This time around I have decided to give it a good go and now have given up in chapter two - no more chances!
<br>
<br>The game is simply not fun. It feels like a hard day&apos;s work after you come home from a hard day&apos;s work. I really tried to persevere as in those other Bioware games but just could not do it. The game environment just breaks the illusion too many times. In other games, the limits of the engine is normally visible at the edges, to places you wouldn&apos;t want to go or where it makes sense you can&apos;t go. In this game the limits of the engine just slap you in the face every five minutes. Now, the journal is pretty good and can help you navigate the various quests. It is easy to go back and check the bestiary to remind yourself of what style to use against certain monsters etc
<br>
<br>What killed the game for me apart from the engine was that the over reliance of having to do something or talk to someone at a certain time or in a certain sequence - otherwise you are doomed to go from point A to B to C to D in an eternal loop trying to figure out which objective out of 500 objectives is the one that must be completed before all the others. Hours of trawling through Witcher Wiki suggests talking to certain people about certain things which then don&apos;t come up in game.
<br>
<br>You have a quest to kill Zombies which pays handsomely.
<br>You can&apos;t get into the graveyard as it is off limits.
<br>You can get into the graveyard by clearing the debts of the undertaker or getting a city pass.
<br>You can&apos;t clear the debts without talking to Ms S
<br>Ms S won&apos;t talk to you unless you meet her at point (X,Y,Z) at the precise time and location
<br>Old hag won&apos;t let you see Ms S unless you do something.
<br>To get a City Pass you must solve a murder involving 3-4 people.
<br>To clear one person you must get into the location where there are Zombies.
<br>Go to the top.
<br>
<br>Not quite how it is - but that is is how it feels - but with five thousand lines and consequnces. Otherwise the game is completely bugged and can&apos;t keep track of it&apos;s own quests. Now, I started playing a game called Arx Fatalis which some people say is the spiritual successor to Ultima Underworld. The graphics are a bit naff, the controls taking a while to get used to - but for some reason I am enjoying the game.

Not because it was hard mind you, but because I really had to push myself to keep playing on multiple occasions.  Having read all the prequel books I hoped for a lot more from the story.  Minus a few references and recurring characters, the story from the past is almost entirely not expanded upon.  Geralt &quot;lost his memory&quot; which was an infuriating way for them to just skip all the lore from the past entirely pretty much.  The gameplay is boring a lot of the times, but I like the dialogue.  Overall pretty mediocre game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6586946">Expand</a></span>

Went back to play the first 1 and whilst i&apos;m moderately enjoying the story, the combat is practically broken. Gameplay is slow and laggy and getting through the game becomes a chore. It&apos;s amazing how you can go from this nonsense to the Witcher 2 &amp; 3.</span>

I knew it would be good but I was too busy playing the RPG&apos;S I thought were probably a lot better. Finally, I started reading the novel&apos;s and playing The Witcher. What I found was a franchise that was true to the heart of a classic CRPG player. I was amazed to find that I enjoyed it much more than Dragon Age and The Elder Scrolls games. It is not only more enjoyable but the writing is fantastic. This is largely due to the fact that it is a game based off of an accomplished author&apos;s work unlike similar series where a group of average writers write an average story and later if success has been had, the best of the average writers writes an average novel. By the way, the novels are great. I only wish they would keep publishing the rest of them in English.<br><br>Final though: PLAY THIS GAME!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1685096">Expand</a></span>

The Witcher is a new kind of RPG; one that allows the player to make choices that actually affect the world. Some modern RPGs, such as Mass Effect (2) allow some of this, but with The Witcher, you are making choices left and right. And these choices change how later levels play out. One particularly important one changes how the final 5 hours of the game plays. I also loved the combat, and if you play the game enough, you will too. Most people who say that they dislike it are right in doing so, because the whole concept revolves around combos which you unlock as the game goes on. And if you only play until the second chapter, then there is no unlocking being done, and therefore the combat is depthless.<br><br>Another area where the game excells is in story. Though the english translation can be a bit spotty at times, and voice acting can be a bit poor, all the important characters are well voiced. The story is rich with backstory, and there is a living world behind you. This is the only game where I have ever considered going back two hours in saves so that I could change one of the choices I made.<br><br>The graphics are also quite nice, though compared to modern standards, they are a bit behind the times. Of course, the game is now 4 years old, so that is to be expected. The lighting is beautiful, and there is a full day/night cycle.<br><br>There are only two areas which I dislike: There are some &quot;impossible&quot; boss fights. If you fail to prepare for them, they are quite hard, and the game doesn&apos;t do a very good job of warning you that they are about to occur. The other thing that I take issue with is how easy it is to miss some quests. If the quest isn&apos;t a primary quest, then it is usually given by some NPC. How was I to know that I should randomly go into the blacksmiths&apos; house? I don&apos;t know. You can sometimes miss large parts of the story, or atleasty backstory due to this. Luckily, there is a good wiki for the game, where you can check to see that you have done all required. Just watch out for spoilers on there, they seem to be in the most mundane places!<br><br>To close this up, The Witcher is a great game for any RPG fan. If you don&apos;t have it, get it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1548522">Expand</a></span>

By this I mean that you have to consider the cultural difference of the game. Just as Stalker is very Russian, and Mount &amp; Blade is very Turkish, this game is very Polish. The interface is like nothing else I have seen anywhere, the gameplay is quite unique, the story is of its own style, and everything else is also far from what we are use to. So if you aren&apos;t in for something new and different, you will likely be too disoriented, befuddled and confused to enjoy yourself. Either way, you get use to how things work in this game, and they work very well. The more you play this game, the more you enjoy yourself. Recommended and 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1457737">Expand</a></span>

The simplest tasks take endless resource grinding, the combat is repetitive, and you&apos;ll spend lots of time walking from one place to another to pick up this or that from this or that NPC. However, every so often, I find myself wanting to get back to this game. I never truly lose interest in the story or characters, I love the gritty feel of it, and yes--the mechanics of combat are dull, but it&apos;s presented in a very cool way that closely resembles what a fight in a real medieval setting would look like (though the game really does give you more weapons than you really need, at least at first). It&apos;s complex, but all good RPGs are, and for the most part the complexity doesn&apos;t feel unnecessary. Keeping in my that it was the developers first game, I&apos;m excited in what direction they go from here; perhaps this game&apos;s sequel will be less tedious and more streamlined.&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1475496">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t like it right away and needed to give it a thorough chance before it grew on me.  That said, this game is very fun.  The only thing holding it back from being a great game is the engine, character movement, physics, and combat.  The engine is the Aurora engine, which by the time this game came out was already showing its age.  To compare, Neverwinter Nights came out in 2002 and used the same engine, whereas The Witcher came out in 2007.  Most all flaws I just listed come from how bad the engine is.  The positives about the game are its attention to detail with the string of characters and narrative you encounter.  The crafting system, alchemy, is very in-depth which myriad possible combinations; another good example of the attention to detail in this game.  Combat may seem intimidating since it&apos;s quite different from other RPGs, but it honestly is easy to get used to.  In fact the combat almost becomes *too* easy (even on the hardest difficulty) later in the game with upgraded talent trees, enchanted weapons, and a good amount of magical powers.  The talent trees are another aspect of this game where depth and attention to detail can be seen.  The story starts off fast, throws a lot of things at you in a short amount of time, but the game took me 40 hours to beat and I&apos;m sure I missed a few side things here and there.  The narrative in this game gets quite complex, with mystery becoming involved, betrayal, and even prophecy.  The narrative weaves together beautifully to present a coherent and complex storyline.  Overall, this game is good, has a few things holding it back, and it grows on you.  It&apos;s definitely an esoteric title, which is why I can&apos;t recommend it to everyone.  Give it a chance, see if it grows on you the way it did for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3240583">Expand</a></span>

What problems? Where do I begin? Glitchy alchemy, awkward combat, numerous crashes/freezes, bad voice-acting, confusing interfaces, VERY slow start, distorted difficulty curve, fights against cheesy mobs, awful AI, etc. It&apos;s not until the third chapter (~20 hours in for me) that the game started to even develop, and I had to wait until the fourth and fifth chapters until I felt like I was enjoying myself for more than five minutes at a time. Why a 7 then? Simply put, the pacing of the game once the fifth chapter hits is very good. It&apos;s action-packed with interesting quests based on the issues of the characters you&apos;ve learned about. The best answers to your problems aren&apos;t clear and you have to simply make decisions based on gut instinct. You see the outcomes of your decisions unfold into an ending that made me scratch my head. It&apos;s the pacing of this last chapter that really shines. There&apos;s no more bs about getting some guys honeycombs from his friend 3 towns over; you are thrown into the middle of a substantial political conflict and the fate of who lives and who dies is up to decisions you make. In my opinion, it&apos;s enough to shine above all of the disgusting bugs I mentioned at first. I give it a B/B- overall, and an A- for the fifth chapter and the epilogue</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2094702">Expand</a></span>

I realize I am playing on hard, but this is just ridiculously... not fun. At the particular part I&apos;m at, it autosaved before a long speech that I have to skip through each time I die, or when the person with me dies (because I saved them, this person dying would obviate the whole point to everything). Right after the long speech is a boss battle. At first I was thinking &quot;Yay, time to put interesting mechanics into a fight instead of the regular click-at-intervals-until-something-dies&quot;, but instead, it&apos;s the same thing but now you have another person to worry about. On top of all of this, it&apos;s pretty vague where or how to do things, and not in the good, find-it-yourself way. It&apos;s more of a &quot;walk around the entire map hoping you find where that guy wants you to be.&quot; The friend who gifted me this game said it was the best RPG he&apos;s ever played... I&apos;m trying to believe him, but I honestly can&apos;t find anything good with it. I mean, if you like it, more power to you, but I feel more obliged to play through it just to get to the second one...
<br>Gosh, this review looks unfocused and sloppy... but then, so does this game... Hopefully the second one will be better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3649263">Expand</a></span>

It did crash on me a time or two. The combat mechanic took a little getting used to.
<br>But mostly I got caught up in the plot. Its been compared to a lot of games. Some of its generation, some coming after. But I don&apos;t know how anyone can compare it. Its as dark and mature as a game can come. But its not an open world. Its a kind of sandbox game, though the box is big enough you hardly notice it. Its a game driven by people and motivations. Really this game is like an engrossing novel. Without spoiling anything. This game is sporting the best twist in a game or show I&apos;ve ever seen.
<br>Its a game that doesn&apos;t condescend. It is made for adults. (Unlike so many RPGs these days). The characters are characters. No one feel one dimensional. And the characters drive the plot.
<br>
<br>I liked how when given dialogue options the character took your suggestion and said something along those lines but different. It added an element of unpredictability to dialogue.
<br>The whole thing with toxicity. Potions have a toxicity value. If you drink your way over 100 you die. As you get close to that point you see red flecks floating across the screen. The whole world changes when you drink Cat. All these things added a flavor to the game. Its like the first 2 Max Payne games. It has a style all its own. Its a game you play because your following the story and want to see what happens next.
<br>
<br>And  CD Projekt RED may just be the last bastion of sanity in the DRM craze that is sweeping games these days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3975506">Expand</a></span>

<br>And this game is the only one that has alchemy system that I actually wanted to use and had a lot of fun doing so.</span>

I couldn&apos;t be bothered to give a f*ck about him or anyone else in this game. The side quests are mostly boring fetch quests, and the main quest is boring and unimaginative, plus the way the game handles quests is annoying as hell. Trust me, when you click on &quot;Quests&quot; and 400 quests show up (side quests + main quests mixed all over the place) you just feel like turning the f*cking game off... which I found myself doing quite often. Then there&apos;s the sex: every woman in this game wants to have sex with your character (apparently women go crazy whenever they see a guy with long white hair, lizard eyes and no personality whatsof*ckingever (ah, so THAT&apos;s what I&apos;ve been doing wrong all these years, thanks for the tip developers!)) and as a &quot;reward&quot; (besides herpes and god knows what else) you get a &quot;sex card&quot; (you don&apos;t actually get to see your character having sex, instead you get to see a card where the woman you just boned shows you her **** Wow... I&apos;m so excited... but I&apos;m sure the 10-year-olds who gave this game an 8 or higher are enjoying themselves. After all, we can&apos;t have a &quot;mature&quot; RPG without including sex, can we? Idiots... &quot;mature game&quot;, my *ss.

<br>&quot;&quot;The Witcher: Enhanced Edition&quot; is really just enhanced garbage. How people can rate this unpolished and mediocre turd of a game so highly is beyond me. The character you play as, &quot;Geralt&quot;, is about as interesting as watching paint dry. I couldn&apos;t be bothered to give a f*ck about him or anyone else in this game. The side quests are mostly boring fetch quests, and the main quest is boring and unimaginative, plus the way the game handles quests is annoying as hell. Trust me, when you click on &quot;Quests&quot; and 400 quests show up (side quests + main quests mixed all over the place) you just feel like turning the f*cking game off... which I found myself doing quite often. Then there&apos;s the sex: every woman in this game wants to have sex with your character (apparently women go crazy whenever they see a guy with long white hair, lizard eyes and no personality whatsof*ckingever (ah, so THAT&apos;s what I&apos;ve been doing wrong all these years, thanks for the tip developers!)) and as a &quot;reward&quot; (besides herpes and god knows what else) you get a &quot;sex card&quot; (you don&apos;t actually get to see your character having sex, instead you get to see a card where the woman you just boned shows you her **** Wow... I&apos;m so excited... but I&apos;m sure the 10-year-olds who gave this game an 8 or higher are enjoying themselves. After all, we can&apos;t have a &quot;mature&quot; RPG without including sex, can we? Idiots... &quot;mature game&quot;, my *ss.

I was hoping a gameplay like Assassins Creed with more elements of RPG but I was wrong. The gameplay is a  you dont even need the keyboard to play, you just click on the enemies, double click on the ground to parry, uses some potions and The Witcher keeps attacking his enemies.. The response of the character is the worst I&apos;ve ever seen. You just double click and he stops attacking. The cutscenes is full of graphics but with no physics and no character expression, even PS1 cutscenes are much better than this cutscenes. If you like playing a game and doing boring quest only for the story go ahead and buy this game, but I prefer watching animes or movies if go for the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3251192">Expand</a></span>

I got it at some random shop I walked into for 2 bucks, mainly because of the wolf head on the cover. Man, did I luck out. No idea what it was about prior to buying it. Of course, there are a few issues, like not being able to jump/ walk over small bumps. I just bought it again on steam for 2.50 because I like the convenience of steam, and figured I should pay at least 4.50 for such an awesome game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3449505">Expand</a></span>

Finally one weekend I decided to revist it, and witcher 2 was absolutely fantastic. the sheer amount of detail they put into that game was fantastic. I loved it more then most rpgs that i&apos;ve played. so i decided to look into getting the first game which i thought would be a less graphically saturated version of the game. I was thinking it would be just as intense, but maybe less graphically spectacular. After looking into the ratings, and seeing that they were mostly positive i decided to purchase the game, when it was only around 9$ which i thought didn&apos;t seem alot especially if the game was going to be anything like the second one at all. What I found out to my surprise is that this game was COMPLETELY different. IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. rather than engaging combat where skill is required to some degree, it was quite possibly the MOST BORING COMBAT SYSTEM I&apos;VE EVER SEEN. Hits on a timer that only worked in succession with the first successful hit, which could take up to 5-6 clicks. At first i tried clicking away when i was unsure of how the combat worked, and then i realized i&apos;d have to stand there and wait for it to work the first time and then light up. absolutely HORRID combat mechanics. who would have thought that 2007 game could be equatable to one made in 2001-2002. Hell i&apos;d say i&apos;d rather play pick up diablo 2 again, then deal with this muffled garbage. Where are the high scores coming from? Is everyone on this site crazy? Do they really enjoy standing around and waiting for a cursor to light up to yellow to hit something, and do it repetitively for 40+ hours. I was not about to do that, even with all the claims of &quot;good&quot; storyline. As soon as the first few fights happend, I knew EXACTLY where this game was headed, and I was not about to embark on that ship. Thank god i played the second game first because it was superior to the first in every respect. It was like playing out a much better dragon age origins with more drive and intensity, and story. This game however, from the get go was about as intense as watching paint dry. I threw up in my mouth a little. To whoever said that the first game was better than the second.... I....I..think you&apos;re some kind of hunchback lunatic with nothing better to do than to click in mind numbingly repetitive patterns. As for graphics in this game, they seemed to be &apos;ok&apos; given that it&apos;s from 2007, but the animations were also pretty horrid, the way the witcher would sway with the sword over his head looked foolish as **** pardon my french. so overall i&apos;d give this game a 2.5/10. I&apos;d much rather go read a book or replay the second witcher another 3 times due to the way the game plays out in different fashions given character choices. To anyone looking into the witcher series get the second one, it&apos;s a solid 9/10, could have been a teensy bit longer (but thats just my covet for the game) can&apos;t wait for the third one. looks DOPE AS HELL. so, again, if you&apos;re looking into this series GET THE SECOND ONE, ITS WAY WAY BETTER.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4329197">Expand</a></span>

It consists of clicking the mouse at the right time for the hero to continue a combo, switching combat styles and weapon, considering what type of enemy you are facing. You do a LOT of pointless running back and forth, as there is no fast travel system, and that get really tedious. The amount of re-spawning enemies are - ridiculous especially low level enemies are all over the place! and it can get rather boring hacking through hordes of monsters all over the place. The dialogue scenes are just.....weired. they are poorly executed, the voice acting is dull, the characters has no animated facial expressions, and the way they express them selves with their bodies are strange to put it mildly. Personally I&apos;m a big fan of open world games like oblivion and fallout, and this games i very restricted in the freedom of your movement and in the story. It is extremely buggy! throughout my first play-through I hardly used the quit game button, as the game crashed all the time. BUT all this considered i still really liked this game a lot.<br><br>The visuals were good, maybe not technically, as the game is a few years old now, but the atmosphere created through the music, sounds and the visuals I thought were excellent. The whole tone of this games was done really well including the flawed personality of all the characters, the underlying conflicts and difficulties i the world the is set in (The plague, the war between races etc) made this a very interesting setting for the game. The story is good, and deep with a lot of twists and turns, minor subplots that are all  connected with each other, creating a long a very deep and strong story for the game.<br><br>The choices you have to make are.....heavy to put it mildly. all from what side to choose in a threatening civil war, to whom you save or don&apos;t to which friends to rely on or whom you alienate. That choices are many and have often unforeseen consequences, making the story even stronger, and give you a good platform for several play-throughs, playing a game with a slightly altered story every time.<br><br>So all in all this i a very good RPG game, with som issues and flaws, most of whom is technical. I&apos;m really looking forward to the next game, where, if they can create a just as strong story and setting, and removes the bugs and flaws of the first game will make a really strong game that will be a favourite with most gamers, fans of the RPG genre or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1520874">Expand</a></span>

After completing the game I must say it is one of the best games I have ever played. Yes there are some glitches. Sometimes you feel like running a little too much around. Some of the bosses in the game are very difficult etc.
<br>But the beautiful setting, the deep storyline and artistic graphics totally compensates. And if you are a little bored with the &quot;run to the next exit and shoot some monsters on the way&quot; games the market is full of then pick up this game, it is still available on steam at a rather low price and I promise you a very interesting journey. On the other hand if you like to learn tricky keyboard combinations to fight with very special moves, if you like to snipe, or just enjoy exploring &quot;high tech&quot; places, this game is not for you. The fighting engine is very special with your character doing all the moves and you just have to click the mouse at exactly the right time. In the beginning this is kind of frustrating until you learn but after a while I actually appreciated this action style very much.
<br>
<br>Can&apos;t wait to play the sequel. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1479957">Expand</a></span>

It came out right about the time Dragon Age: Origins came out and I was way too busy with that game. Now I have to look back and wonder if I should have been way too busy with this game. This game is a breathe of fresh air in the RPG category. I wanted to see if it was any good before I played the sequel to it and I was amazed. It didn&apos;t try to cover more than it should have with it&apos;s storyline and gave the player enough. Every decision you make will count at some time or another. You will be rewarded in a good or bad way for the things you do at some time or another. The story doesn&apos;t leave you wanting more and it actually closes what it started which is pretty unheard of in this gaming age. The combat system is unique and I want to say skill based but I can&apos;t really because by the time you are ~30 hours into the game you will hear the same sound and know when you attack again. Some of the later sequences are bit harder to listen for though which was a nice change. The quests in this game are diverse and many. There are the standard kill this and get X from it on every act but those are optional and are usually completed by doing other optional quests or primaries. If you want to take a break from questing you can do dice poker or bar fighting which was fun to do every so often. I didn&apos;t really have high hopes from an indie game company to produce something of this quality but I was blown away. The only really thing I can say negatively about this game is the fact that it is easy. Once you know what to do with your spells it makes things a push over. I was playing on the hardest difficulty and relied on alchemy. I was hoping it would be harder to obtain the mats for said pots but they were littered everywhere on the acts. It made the hard version of the game very easy being able to be potted all the time. With that aside I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone even if they don&apos;t like RPGs it is just that good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1633785">Expand</a></span>

I told my self, that I will not waste my time on these books... but some time after the release of the enhanced edition I gave it a try... and I got drawn into this world within minutes. The cursing dwarfs, the shady elves, the false priests, the corrupted officials and the sultry prostitutes shaped a world, which was unique among the fantasy worlds I came across. (After my first playthrough I read all the 7 books in an instance...)<br>Ok, this game does not offer a character creator, but instead You get a well defined and interesting anti-hero, whose story and background is a far superior feature, than a tabula rasa character. The music is so dense and folklore, the graphics are so stunning, especially compared to the great Dragon Age: Origins. I have to admit, that the facial animations are very stiff, and a lot of faces are the same, but that is the only downer in terms of graphics. The night and day cycle, the living towns and the dynamic weather are so immersive, that you cannot not play for hours. This game also features the most interesting choices, were every choice means sacrifice, were all one can do, is choose the lesser evil, where a Hollywood-style happy ending is not an option. Many people complained about the combat... It needs to get used to, yes. But it is not bad, it is a lot of fun, and when you add the potions, the bombs and Geralts skills to it, the combat becomes a very strategic gameplay, where the intelligence of the player is tested. In short... If you know what you are doing, you can defeat the game on the highest difficulty with ease, but the hard part is actually remembering and mastering all of it.<br>So... in it&apos;s time, this was the second to Mass Effect 1 best looking RPG, it was definitely the most mature story-based game (I know... the sex cards... but I do have a deck of Playboy-cards myslef and I still consider my self mature) with a very deep combat system, it featured the most difficult choices, it was not afraid to punish you.<br><br>What shall I say... I love CD Project games as much as I love Bioware games, and I am not a fan of this recent troll-war between the fans of these games... people, do yourself a favor and enjoy those games... in the end, it is of no importance which is better... they are all great and they ARE worth your money!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1631585">Expand</a></span>
