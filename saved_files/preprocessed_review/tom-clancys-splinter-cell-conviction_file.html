It shouldn&apos;t even be TITLED as a Splinter Cell game! It pretty much drives you into starting massive shoot-outs. Only later I found out I could partially stealth through the game, which was kind of fun, but got frustrating every time I found out the good quick-saving system was replaced by a debilitated checkpoint system. It eventually drove me into doing both strategies, which I didn&apos;t like as the mixed gameplay was not pleasurable at all to me. I tried to figure out why the hell it turned into an action shooter, and I found out. The new director Maxime B&#xE9;land came in and brought a bag of horse**** with him. I don&apos;t know what was wrong with this guy&apos;s life beforehand, as it seems he must&apos;ve been a hopeless drunk or junkie, feeling that the &quot;black-and-white&quot; effect when you&apos;re in the dark reminds him of his early artwork or something like that... Well, what he did is fix what wasn&apos;t even broken in the first place and ended up making it a disappointment. The story for the game was good, to be honest, it fit with the past games, which I appreciate.
<br>One thing that I felt is that this game was produced by 12-year old because of the most idiotic and immature dialogue of enemies I&apos;ve ever heard in my life of playing games. The endless amounts of hearing A-hole and the F-word pretty much make up 90% of the dialogue. It isn&apos;t even funny after the first few missions. I can understand the thugs in the game would say something like that, but even the goddamn Third Echelon soldiers say it, making it unrealistic and turning it into an immature joke. Ubisoft really shifted from a nice game company into a an evil group of greedy game developers who care only about getting customers&apos; money and care none for the fans of the older games. The fact that Michael Ironside still voiced the game is why I give it a rating of 2. Well done, Ubisoft, you&apos;ve really shape-shifted into a despicable little greedy imp.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=3582844">Expand</a></span>

Sorry my English isn&apos;t any better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=3752739">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- The game consists of going from point A to point B mindlessly killing enemies (heck, it&apos;s even worse, you can even COMPLETELY SKIP the firefights, just run like mad and wait for a checkpoint to pop up, suddenly enemies are no longer chasing you).
<br>- Levels are absolutely linear, no exploration to speak of, no computers to hack, no side objectives, nothing.
<br>- The game is way too short, just 11 levels, about 20-30 minutes long each depending on play style and difficulty. This could arguably be a &quot;pro&quot; due to the repetitive nature of the game.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Graphics are nice, although you get some weird slowdowns even with a modern GPU, it looks like the game is quite CPU dependant.
<br>- Soundtrack and audio effects are decent, although for some reason your weapons sound really weak.
<br>- No graphic glitches or major bugs on PC (unlike all previous games in the series, except Chaos Theory).
<br>
<br>The game is essentially a third rate cover shooter with the Splinter Cell name and characters/back story stuck in there for no good reason. I give it a 4 because at least it&apos;s playable, stable and has nice graphics, but by the end of the game you&apos;ll just be wishing for it to end. Luckily it&apos;s mercifully short.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=4725272">Expand</a></span>

You have to press the crouch key first to stand yourself up and THEN press the melee key. This alone will cause you to fail more missions than anything else, because it will throw off your timing. Another great example is the contextual &quot;use&quot; key. If you&apos;re standing next to a climbable ledge and there is a weapon on the ground that you want to pick up, you have to sit there for two minutes and rotate the camera just right until the weapon is highlighted instead of the ledge. It is very disappointing how poorly Splinter Cell: Conviction was executed, because it obvious has enormous potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2532742">Expand</a></span>

From what I have seen, the only thing that improved in this game are the character&apos;s visuals, certain graphics, objects and environments, and certain physics, among a few other things too... Not sure why(because I have a good PC system) but the sound cuts in-out and the video pauses frequently during level loading... However, SC-Conviction&apos;s overall game play is just &apos;mindless&apos; and nearly automated for &apos;dummies&apos;, (what happened to the Free-Interaction and Total-user-control? )... and what is up with the fake illuminated projections on the walls that &apos;help&apos; you to a destination(objective), such as: &quot;Climb&quot; or &quot;Reach Window&quot;, or the infinite ammo... (those just aren&apos;t appealing features in a game)... Seriously, if you need to be shown exactly where to go and exactly what to do in a game, or if you need infinite ammo, etc., then your real game skills naturally STINK! ... (and it just takes out the fun and realism from the game). UBI seemed to design this game for dummy-gamers who don&apos;t have enough patience or real skills to play such a game. It&apos;s not a &apos;Realistic&apos; or &apos;Stealthy&apos; game, as an example: I opened a door(it made a loud enough noise) and the people were right there looking toward me but still talking to each other, yet they did not react to what I was doing in the doorway(about 7 feet away), WTF!?.. I mean come on, that is NOT realistic stealth-based interaction, and it happens too often... Also the obstruction-programmers didn&apos;t do such a good job because even though a door was completely closed the enemy&apos;s &apos;ghost&apos; gun was slightly sticking out, though it was shooting at me, LOL! .... The Controls(movements) are not that steady or precise compared to other games, and it&apos;s not as easy to approach(align) to certain objects (user-character movements really stink!!), and not only that, but you&apos;re only able to jump in certain pre-programmed hot-spots, seriously WTF happened to Splinter Cell!? The designers/programmers are wrong for making and allowing this game to be this way...  Also, the required online registration/log-in is total crap (thanks to all of the poor-bastard rip-off software-pirates for making it a big hassle for all of us!!)... anyway, if you Really Like the game play (surreptitiousness) of SC-Chaos Theory, you&apos;ll probably DISLIKE SC-Conviction. Overall, it&apos;s an OK game, but it&apos;s not great and it could of and should of been much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=1595030">Expand</a></span>

The stealth element which is what has always set the Splinter Cell series apart is completely abandoned in favor of a huge frontal assault and fending off waves of enemies. Honestly I&apos;d rate the game higher if it wasn&apos;t a splinter cell game but it suffers so much by comparison to its predecessors that it&apos;s hard to see it as anything other than a complete waste of time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=1570938">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> I have to say that this game was really a big disappointment. This game really lacks the stealth feeling the older series hade. You can pick up a machine gun and kill everything in a room without any tactics what so ever. If your a fan off Sam Fishers story I would recommend to wait for a price drop becouse its not worth it now.</span>

Complete and utter destruction of a great franchise.They turned this awesome stealth action game into a third person shooter. Sam Fisher is now the new Prince of Persia.</span>

The cover system has been updated and works as good as any I&apos;ve seen.  The stealth system has been updated as well.  Instead of watching a stealth meter, the game turns black and white when Sam is invisible.  It works surprisingly well.  There are usually multiple paths through each mission/level.  The main story is challenging and will provide hours of gameplay.  The cream of SC:Conviction is Denied Ops.  It has three game modes -- Hunter, Infiltration, and Last Stand -- playable on five unique and challenging maps.  Hunter requires you to move through the maps killing bad guys.  If you are seen, the bad guys call in reinforcements.  Infiltration requires you to move through the maps killing bad guys.  If you are seen, the alarm sounds and the game ends.  I haven&apos;t played Last Stand so cannot speak about it.<br><br>Infiltration and Hunter when played on &quot;Realistic&quot; turn into multi-hour experiences as you try to isolate and kill bad guys one by one.   Enemy AI is tough, will flank you, and is fast on the trigger.  Also, there are motion-sensitive cameras and infrared lasers to deal with.<br><br>There is a co-op mode that I have yet to try.  Supposedly, you and your partner play as two agents (one from Third Echelon and one from a Russian agency).  You two work your way through five or six maps with your own co-op storyline.  It sounds good and there are plenty of youtube videos of co-op gameplay.<br><br>This game is a steal at $20.  Denied Ops alone is worth the $20.  Make sure you get the &quot;Insurgency DLC&quot; too.  It comes with four more maps for Denied Ops -- San Francisco, Salt Lake City, New Orleans, and Portland, OR.  San Fran is a shipyard/cargoyard, Salt Lake City is a mysterious industrial office.  New Orleans is a graveyard - -where you fight above ground and in tunnels underground!  Portland is an old prison.  I&apos;ve logged easily 200-250hrs in SC:Conviction playing the main storyline and Denied Ops.  It&apos;s a boatload of fun that will challenge most PC gamers.  Highly recommend.<br><br>PS:  Note that SC:Conviction talks to some Ubisoft servers during startup and possibly during gameplay.  It was a hassle sorting things out but once it was working, it did not interfere with gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2088191">Expand</a></span>

However Splinter Cell has built a reputation as being an excellent stealth shooter and its hard to even put this one in that category.  Some of the core mechanics of the game were updated and improved but others were diminished or left out entirely and the writing was utterly unconvincing.
<br>On the mechanics side they added one of the better cover systems where you can pinpoint exactly where you want Sam to dart to and in what direction.  They also removed the light meter in favor of fading the screen to black and white when you are concealed.  Another nice touch which was added is a a circle with a broad arrow which appears on the screen when you catch an enemies attention.  The arrow points in the direction of the enemy and narrows as their attention focuses on you.  Once they realize it is a hostile the arrow changes from white to red.  Finally when you take out an enemy with your hands you enable one use of the execution mechanic.  This allows you to mark 2-4 enemies (depending on the weapon you are welding) and hit one button to take them all out in rapid succession.  The cover system worked very well for the most part except for the minor annoyance created by the fact that roll and cover are the same button. Sometimes in a tense situation you right click to roll away from someone when too close to a wall and Sam will take cover instead.  Both the light and attention system changes are useful and intuitive.  The execution system was entertaining but diminished the need for stealth.
<br>Unfortunately, that is not the only way in which stealth suffered in this game.  Ubisoft may have thought the mechanics above were enough to give players the ability to play the game using stealth and guile but for the most part they were mistaken due to the fact other more critical stealth mechanics were removed.  The first omission is the lack of a save function, quick or otherwise.  It is replaced with checkpoints.  I&apos;m an older gamer who remembers a time when this was the norm but it was still a shock to not have it here especially in what should have been a stealth shooter.  You get used to it however the checkpoint system strongly favors quick aggressive action so that when you fail to reach the next checkpoint you only wasted 1 or 2 minutes instead of 10 or 20.  Next your pistol now has unlimited ammo which means there is no reason not to spray fire with it if you can&apos;t get close enough to stealth kill or if someone notices you.  This also places a strong bias on aggressive action.  Who is going to take 2 minutes sneaking up on or around a guy when you can just go straight at him and empty 5 rounds into his chest in 10 seconds.  Next picking up anything is completely removed.  That means no bricks or cans for distraction but more importantly it means no moving bodies to cover your tracks.  This makes some sense though because a dead body is simply a trap for any enemies who see it.  They run straight up and stand there for 10 to 15 seconds begging you to shoot them from cover 5 ft away at which point they are added to the body trap.  Removing the body would just be a waste of time once again.  Finally they removed all of Sams non-lethal skills.  There are no locks to pick and no gun terminals to hack.  Not only does this remove stealth options forcing the player into run and gun tactics but it also removes some variety and the potential to enrich the story through reading emails as Splinter Cell normally allows.
<br>This leads me to the story and the writing.  I&apos;m not saying the writing and plot of the other Splinter Cells were literature of the highest order but they were entertaining and coherent.  In this one 3rd Echelon somehow becomes a terrorist organization in the 3 year period since the last game ended.  The writers try to patch that massive plot hole by saying that a mole in the organization became leader of it upon Lambert&apos;s death and that the president was going to shut the program down and they thought that made America too vulnerable.  So basically they are saying the highly trained, highly selective organization Fisher was in turned into a cult of personality in 3 yrs after a sudden change of leadership.  That or the entire staff somehow felt the US was so threatened by 3rd Echelon potentially closing that they felt the means of EMPing all of DC and killing the president were justified by the end of keeping 3rd Echelon open.....for the safety of America.  The writers pretty much just ran the entire Splinter Cell story line off the rails with this one.
<br>After everything is said and done this game on its own is around average.  The mechanics they had were polished and entertaining which balances out the poor writing.  However, when you put it into the context of the stealth shooter Splinter Cell series is as a very disappointing turn for the franchise.  The neutering of the stealth element is really disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2567379">Expand</a></span>

I respect them for going out on an edge and trying to veer from the repeated stealthy gameplay, but that&apos;s what it&apos;s all about. They already stepped close enough to the edge on double agent and I&apos;m afraid Conviction will jump off the cliff. The only three good ways in which this can end are as follows. 1. This is the last game of the series. 2. Somehow they manage to make this new outfit work without the stealth and gadgets. 3. Just stick to what they know, get Sam Fisher back into the agency. I already know what my vote will be, no matter the outcome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=400399">Expand</a></span>

Out of the roughly 15 or so guns in the game only four or five actually have/can be fitted with silencers. It&apos;s hardly at all about stealth and there&apos;s even a level where &quot;Sam gets mad.&quot; and it allows you to just run through an office building shooting scores of trained paramilitary mercenaries in night vision with only a pistol whom die in one shot on the hardest difficulty. It should be called Tom Clancy&apos;s Gears of War. There&apos;s also a multitude of in-game ads for Philips Razors, Nivea for Men and Cisco. The game is half-assed, overall pathetic and I honestly want a refund. The game is complete trash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=747559">Expand</a></span>

Based on the massive gap between critic reviews and the user scores I am now convenced that Ubisoft buys ratings. In fact this game is so bad I will likely never buy another ubisoft. First off this game was rushed because they had a good final product and then had it all thrown out because they thought it was too much like Assassins&apos; Creed. So then they started over and rushed this garbage game out. To start, my brother and I both finished this entire game in one few hour sitting, each in the same day on the hardest difficulty. That&apos;s right. This game is good for about 4 hours of entertainment on the toughest difficulty. The gameplay has turned fisher from a modern day ninja into a Jason Borne on crack. The normally slow moving and strategic stealth is replaced by movements and animations that are so unbelievably fast that they are comical at times.The engine is dumbed down compared to the previous installments. Despite being labeled a stealth game you cannot move bodies.. bodies still alert the guards regardless. And even though there are less stealth abilities compared to the last game, they&apos;ve upped the penalty for being spotted on some missions. If you are so much as spotted in some levels the game ends. The only kind of people that this game should appeal to is people that have never touched a controller in their life. The massive ad campaign was the only thing that saved the sales on this monstrous garbage. 30% of the ubisoft forum crowd canceled their preorders after just playing the demo. I could write a six page essay on all the things wrong with this game, but I&apos;d rather not. Hopefully I&apos;ve saved people some money with this. I would only get this game if it dropped down to about ten dollars. Then I could get it for my friend who is horrible at games so she can feel like she can accomplish something on game nights.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=1361277">Expand</a></span>

I picked up for $5 at this years Steam holiday sale and played the single player campaign over two days. It probably took me about 8-10 hours.  Yeah, it&apos;s short, but it&apos;s a pretty tight, character-driven narrative. It starts out with the Red Dead Redemption style &quot;government people are screwing you over by forcing you to do stuff for them by withholding info on your family&quot;  type scenario, but unlike Red Dead Redemption, they actually keep feeding you enough information to make it not seem like they&apos;re stretching the premise. I&apos;ve also heard that the co-op missions, and some of the other game modes add a bunch more hours of gameplay too, but I haven&apos;t tried them. But yeah, if you&apos;re just interested in single player campaign and story, this was definitely worth playing. Yes, it was short, but the narrative was tight and fairly emotionally gripping and it never (to me) felt like the premise was being stretched too thin. And, plus, it&apos;s fairly easy to get a copy of it for $10-$15, so... :P<br><br>Side note: the main theme song is absolutely gorgeous! ^_^</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2074688">Expand</a></span>

The game is different from the other splinter cell- You are no longer a &quot;company man&quot;, but you are still being played and overall the storyline doesn&apos;t feel much different. The center of this game is sam fisher, not thrid echelon. Gadgets, Weapons, Items, are all replaced and you only have sam, who is now more dangerous than ever because of is rage and... Whatever. The story is not really intresting, (Maybe you will like it, Presonally I no longer consider Dead people coming back to life a twist). Sadly, the game has been simplified. The tag and execute system pretty much means that if you kill one guy in melee you can automaticly kill 2 or 4 more with gun, which is wierd idea that put some action in the game while damaging the gameplay in my opinion. no more dark or light metter- the game turns black and white when you are in shaldow. This annoyed me at first but now I think its better. Instead of the optic cable you have a broken mirror you took from a car- Works just the same, how come sam havent thought of that before/ You have portable EMP that stun everyone but you and X-vision that show you whats behind the wall but thats pretty much all that is new. The cover system works fine, but controls are sometimes annoying- too few buttons actually being used. The co-op is the best thing about this game, but if you dont have partner for it don&apos;t count on the matchmaking to find suitable one for you. All in all its a decent game that I suggest to buy if it costs 7$-2$</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2536413">Expand</a></span>

<br>But if you can get past this and focus on the actual game created by the developers and at least enjoyed the plot from the previous game (Double Agent) then you may or may not enjoy this addition alot more. The story begins with a nice little kick start that doesn&apos;t take you into a 10-20 min tutorial without any shooting and killing, and off you go down Ubisoft&apos;s continued plot left off from Double Agent, sneaking or blasting through the levels as you travel deeper into the rabbit hole.
<br>
<br>The game mechanics have changed a fair amount allowing for more fluid transitions that make you feel as though you are controling a real person rather than a T-700 that looks like a person, giving you a more fufilling feeling as you continue to go around executing your enemy from the shadows in new fashions. Ubisoft made a delightful change, in my opinion, on how you go about the levels, whether you choose to shotty people out in the light while breaching a room or silently moving unseen using the shadows and structures to your advantage. There are certain parts where they force you to be open about your killer presence, but it does fit with the situation Sam would currently be in and forces players to be ready to change tactics if such an event occurs.
<br>
<br>If it wasn&apos;t for the connection problems and high improbability of ever finding someone waiting for matchmaker to work at the same exact time as you then the multiplayer would be great. Though I really must say that I still prefer Chaos Theory&apos;s multiplayer I do like the switch from vs. to more of a coop that doesn&apos;t fry peoples nerves and cause people to throw dirty accuasations back and forth. Speaking of coop, the coop for SCC is well done and is a great addition to the single player storyline, which is actually a sequel to the coop. I think the greatest thing SCC coop did was build each players&apos; love for the two characters, Archer and Kestrel, and in the end put a sad twist which only heightened your disgust for the antagonists from the singleplayer.
<br>
<br>Overall I think it is a great, proactive addition to the SC series that provides a fresh new way to play while also retaining a majority of the original gameplay that makes SC so much fun to play. If you can get past the DRM and not be hypercritical of the additions then you&apos;ll see that Ubisoft has done a really nice job with SCC considering the delays to its release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=1482191">Expand</a></span>

But the first game didn&apos;t impress me, since countless times i couldn&apos;t do a teorical perfect strategy. Only 1 possible solution for each screen, so the game became a puzzle and lost it&apos;s touch. Since then, I came back in contact to the series in 2011, with Chaos Theory, since Double Agent was terrible on the PC port. Again, disappointment. This time, I always have the feeling I didn&apos;t do exactly what was expected from me, and then, I need to restart the level. Since I never got the feeling of doing something right, the game lost it&apos;s touch. One time the game hangup and I never touched the game again. Then I get Conviction. the narrative is not generic, this time it&apos;s personal, and for the first time, the story got me (and I don&apos;t even know anything about any of the characters). The action is great, just enough action, preventing the game to become boring and just enough stealth to keep you on your toes. The execution technique makes things easier, but far from easy, since it&apos;s not always so easy doing a melee kill to earn it. The only negative is the DRM, i had to uninstall the launcher, because it came from other Ubisoft game and only after uninstalling and re-installing again it let me launch the game, but it&apos;s still a 10 to me. Maybe this game disappointed the series fans, but if you, like me, never got into Sam Fisher&apos;s mind, do yourself a favor, ignore this score and get this game now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=1757525">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Conviction is a whole new story in the Splinter cell-series. The new ways to kill your enemy&apos;s is awsome! I absolutly love the mark &amp; execute one. Like in the other Splinter cell games you&apos;ll have some special attacks such as &quot;Death from above&quot; &amp; &quot;HumanShield&quot;. I think Ubisoft has done a great job on Splinter Cell Convictions!!</span>

Ignoring the fact that a lot has been pissed on with this game its still a hell of a lot of fun with a fairly solid platform meaning less focusing on spotting bugs like guns won&apos;t reload properly or some b.s. like that and more focusing on immersing yourself into the story</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2313641">Expand</a></span>

The graphics up close are great, but once you look beyond the foreground you have static skies, pixelated graphics (for some reason the game won&apos;t let me play it at my laptop&apos;s maximum resolution), and 2D buildings. Stealth isn&apos;t as key as it was in the other Splinter Cell entries, with the exception of co-op and one mission, if you get detected you can still survive. There are even several missions where stealth isn&apos;t even really neccessary, theres a flashback sequence in Iraq where you play as a one man army, numerous survival missions and apparently the top of the range enemy agents have the same sonic goggles that you aquire that let them see people through walls, so with them its sort of gestured at by the game that you don&apos;t need stealth. But personally, the lack of stealth suits me fine. Being a fan of Tom Clancy though, I did notice some things that contradicted against the books. In The Teeth of the Tiger, I clearly remember Jack Ryan junior being in an exercise where he has been told not to put his sidearm to his cheek action movie style. However, as Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell Conviction, that is the animation that you do when you get in cover. They were trained in different places but if one secret black ops complex thinks a simple thing is stupid why would the other do just that? Personally this just shows that the name Tom Clancy is just there for marketing, and nothing more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2051181">Expand</a></span>

Weather they are gonna patch and improve this, I dont know. But users have been complaining about the fps only set to 30, so I hope they do fix this. But despite the fps this game looks great and gameplay works smoothly and is easy to get used to. Singleplayer is abit short to, but Co op works great, no problem there what so ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=747560">Expand</a></span>

I have been a fan of every Splinter Cell game, and have replayed them all recently in preparation for Conviction.  They are all similar, but increasingly different with each release, and that is what makes moving from one to the next so intriguing.  One of my complaints is not with the game but my choice to play on my 8 year old Dell Dimension.  Even though I have a newer decent graphics card, and lots of memory, it got sluggish on my system when there was lots of objects in play.   I am interested to play on a dedicated console, but I will not fault the game for my choice of aged hardware.<br><br>I am bugged by some of the negative comments and I guess I have not experienced any of the concerns of these people.  I had no problem with Digital Rights Management or the consistency of my Internet connection, I had no concerns about the plot (um its a GAME, not a blockbuster movie). Sure it could have been better, but I also find joy in playing Backgammon, which has no plot at all.<br><br>As far as those talking about lacking the Stealth feeling, I disagree.  I think it was quite a bit harder to maintain stealth in then game.  I found that the AI actually were more aware of your presence, and having to choose better times to sneak through a room, or jump out of sight was much more narrow than in previous versions.  This is a GOOD thing.<br><br>I will say that GI magazine had a good comment that referenced the Chatty Kathy enemy, their presence was more akin to &quot;Dr. Evil&apos;s Henchmen&quot;.  This is true.  They did annoy me quite a bit.  It just gave me more reason to quickly dispatch them and move on.<br><br>I cannot comment on co-op play.  I am not a co-op fan.  I like th single player only, so I can lend no review to the co-op side of things.<br><br>I was not as pleased with the Ops portion of the game, it was more like just doing Stealth training in different situations.  Not bad, just not extraordinary.  I wish they could have put more development into a long Sam story and leave the Ops out completely.<br><br>I hope this is truly not the end of the Splinter Cell series.  I think it could be taken much further.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=1365165">Expand</a></span>

An ultimate killing machine that can bash the door or kick the car instead of the enemy. A super-predator that will spend a minute trying to find a place, where climbing up and not jumping around the table is possible. An agile hunter, for whom lying bottle can be an invisible magic wall. Thankfully, post-soviet countries don&apos;t have to pay 60 buck for this game, otherwise i wouldn&apos;t have rated it 8. P.S. And co-op and multiplayer?

It is an action game, with a strong focus on shooting. Most of the moves you could do are gone, instead replaced by better shooting. And shooting was never supposed to be SC&apos;s strong point. There is less stealth (including a entire mission which is nothing but shooting), you are always detected, so the game is basically focused on using the new last known position indicator to play cat and mouse. A lot of the game play also revolves around silently killing one enemy so you can use the new mark and execute feature to kill everyone. By taking out core SC elements, Ubisoft has created a mediocre game. They screwed up Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, and now Splinter Cell. The whole plot is also weak, based off of (Spoilers) Sam killing Lambert to maintain cover in Double Agent. Something I doubt he would do, and carries over with Sam&apos;s daughter actually being alive and used to keep Sam going. Sarah dying in Double Agent was stupid anyway. At least the technical side is decent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=1383414">Expand</a></span>

Wow, what a great game.  The plot is excellent, the levels have just the right difficulty, and the single player campaign is just the right length.  It&apos;s true that this is not the same Splinter Cell that came out nine years ago, but I very much like what it&apos;s become and I had a great time.  If I could fault this game, it would be the following; heavy-handed DRM; wow, what were they thinking?  The DRM didn&apos;t affect my experience, but requiring a persistent connection is a bad call.  Also, the cut scenes should have all been rendered in real time.  It&apos;s a bit jarring to go from awesome, crisp Unreal engine graphics to lower res cut scene footage.  Beyond that, this is a AAA title.  I don&apos;t think we&apos;re going to get many hot releases in gaming this year, so it&apos;s a good time to go through the Steam collection and do some bargain hunting.  This is a good game to get and the price is definitely right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2270425">Expand</a></span>

I tried them (after buying them at a deep discount on Steam) but didn&apos;t care for the clunky controls or the tedious gameplay. Conviction on the other hand is really fun to play. As others have mentioned, the single player campaign does go by pretty quickly. There&apos;s some replayability if you ratchet up the difficulty and try to work through the levels without being detected. The inability to skip through some of the &quot;story telling&quot; bits on subsequent plays does get annoying.<br><br>The Deniable Ops pack gives the casual action gamer a nice variety of missions that you can play through in 10-30 minutes depending on how you want to play them (run &amp; gun vs. stealth). These are highly replayable as you can experiment with a variety of tactics and approaches to each level. Given that I bought this game years after it&apos;s release, I haven&apos;t played much multi-player. Seems like it would be fun over a LAN though.<br><br>For the next release, I&apos;d love to see a few improvements. While you can use the &quot;human shield&quot; feature to grab someone, pull them into the shadows, and dump their body somewhere it won&apos;t be noticed, it&apos;s pretty clear that the feature wasn&apos;t designed with that scenario in mind. It would also be nice to have ways of disabling lights without shooting them (cutting wires, unplugging lamps, etc.). It would also be nice to be able to do knife take downs instead of always using your primary weapon. It would also be nice to incorporate some other close quarters combat options. I&apos;d also like to see the &quot;realistic&quot; mode be a little more realistic :). You can discharge a silenced weapon in the same room as an enemy and they won&apos;t respond. I do love the interactivity of the environments. There&apos;s a level with a grandfather clock you hear ticking as you creep by. Vaulting, cat-like over a desk can disturb objects on top of it. Vaulting over a chain link fence produces the appropriate sounds. And, contrary to some of the other reviewers, I found the controls (with practice) to be extremely fluid - much more so than any other game of this type I&apos;ve played. I would like to see even more interactivity in the sequel: running through puddles, climbing onto objects, etc. should produce the appropriate sounds.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2343908">Expand</a></span>

The only downside is you must have internet access to play the game, so if your internet is down, you can&apos;t play. In my opinion it&apos;s worth the 60$ but I would suggest getting the deluxe version, it adds a new mode in denied ops which is really fun, it also gives you the scar-h for a new weapon. Overall its a very good game, and worth the buy. I&apos;m giving it a 9/10 because needing to have internet access at all times sucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2456286">Expand</a></span>

Sam Fisher is one of the truly great characters of gameing, in no small part thanks to Micheal Ironside, whose rasping irony sets the mood right from the first sentence. The people who voted this game so low are probably the same pack of wankers we voted Dragon Age Origins RPG of the year.

It&apos;s not Splinter Cell as i played it (by being as stealthy as possible).

Another thing that makes the gameplay great is the fact that there are multiple ways to approach each mission.  It&apos;s brilliant honestly.  Unfortunately the game runs like **** and comes with Ubisoft&apos;s stupid DRM.  But the DRM doesn&apos;t run all the time, it just runs with and closes with the game.  You need a very powerful machine to run this game at a decent framerate, which doesn&apos;t really make sense considering the graphics aren&apos;t anything special.  I wanted to score it higher, but because of the optimization issues, 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2535075">Expand</a></span>

Conviction (either unfortunately or fortunately, depending on your take) decides to stray from the stealth-based aspect that made the original splinter cell so amazing and go in a more action-driven direction. It&apos;s not a bad game, in the least, but it is different, and somewhat difficult to get used to. But once you get over that hurdle, you start to see that it really is a great game. The story&apos;s pretty interesting (and told in a sort of Dan Brown, ending&gt;present fashion), and the shooting works well. The Mark and Execute feature (which I was a bit skeptical about, at first) is surprisingly fun and very well implemented. The Last Known Position feature is a perfect addition for a Splinter Cell game, but it&apos;s arguable that it may make the stealth aspect a bit dumbed down and unappealing. The action is fast paced and has you thinking on your toes, and, thanks to the new stealth system, is easy to integrate with your sneaking abilities. A few things continuously nag me about this game, however. First of all, the sound aspect is almost completely wiped out. So long as Fisher is walking or crouched, enemies never seem to hear him. Secondly, the stealth system is very black-and-white (no pun intended). Rather than having the normal feature where your level of stealth is dependent on how much light is shining on you, apparently, in Conviction, you&apos;re either bright as a search light or dark as pitch. So long as your screen is black and white, an enemy isn&apos;t likely to see you, even if your bated breath is passing feverishly across their neck. Finally, perhaps my biggest peeve of this game is Sam&apos;s age. From the original all the way up to Double Agent, Sam&apos;s always taken it somewhat slow and professional. He had acrobatic skills and upper-body strength, sure, but he wasn&apos;t superhuman. Now in Conviction, despite his old age and emotional breakdowns (of which he&apos;s had quite a few), he seems as ripe and ready as a spring chicken. Scaling walls is now a breeze and he moves faster than he ever had in his previous years. Overall, the game is wonderfully entertaining, but compared to its predecessors, Conviction just doesn&apos;t live up to the Splinter Cell name.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2020986">Expand</a></span>

<br>overall this is a great game that is recomended for everyone. its not a hardcore stealth game, but it a great game!!! even if you dont always like stealth games you should try this. buy it!!!!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=3292660">Expand</a></span>

I get what they were doing here, as they put all their effort into developing new gameplay mechanics.  But, they need to bring back: Light meter, body dragging, the knife (silent takedowns with a pistol seem not so silent), the hanging neck snap, whistle, can/object throwing for distractions, etc.  If they brought these in while keeping the current changes, it would be a great game.  Oh and we played through the co-op on realistic, it was incredibly difficult.  The AI is much smarter in this game, and they use their flashlights much more effectively than previous games.  -The Kvlt Kitty</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2806139">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are much better, the third person camera adds clarity to everything, and they added more fun to it. The game modes are the best, the campaign, the co-op, and the deniable ops mode. I would rather play this than any other Splinter Cell game. I can also compare this to Hitman: Blood Money, they are nearly the same thing. Shimmying across small ledges, climbing through windows, stealth killing people, the whole nine yards. The fact is, Conviction is better than Double Agent. But, I would not say Conviction is BETTER than Hitman: Blood Money. Hitman had the entire package, where as Conviction does not have as much as it should. I think Conviction is underrated, and it needs to be brought up to a more suitable score. For now, I am going to somewhat recommend this game, but not highly. If you&apos;re looking for a REAL and GOOD &quot;stealthy&quot; game, buy Hitman: Blood Money before you waste your money on a Splinter Cell game that you might not like.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2888594">Expand</a></span>

I think that would have made the game more replayable and interesting. controls are similar to tomb raider, prince of persia games where you climb walls, etc. but this game you can be more tactical and shoot out lights and stuff.
<br>
<br>video- the graphics are pretty good. as long as gameplay is good.
<br>
<br>audio- music is solid and effects are great, helps to have surround sound.
<br>
<br>overall- the game could definitely be better but its not all that bad. in my honest opinion, i feel that the older ones were much better. solid game overall, just not as good as the previous ones and left me wanting a bit more than was given.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2945399">Expand</a></span>

<br>UPDATE: and it happened.

The man has had enough and is at his peak physically and mentally. He simply doesn&apos;t care anymore and wants it all behind him. Micheal Ironside gives his best performance yet, and with some really great level and sound design (Amon Tobin never ceases to amaze), it&apos;s quite memorable in parts. The coop is also brilliant and incredibly fun with a friend.
<br>
<br>It isn&apos;t nearly as stealthy as its predecessors, but that doesn&apos;t mean there isn&apos;t any stealth, and it&apos;s by far a &apos;very bad Splinter Cell game&apos;. Playing Chaos Theory, Double Agent and Conviction back to back is an absolutely solid video game experience.

It was a bit confusing and difficult to follow, but that&apos;s no big deal.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is solid but a bit formulaic, with tight linear levels lacking multiple approaches, and dumb AI that would do well to eat more carrots (they can&apos;t see in the dark). The stealth mechanics based around shadows and &#x201C;last known position&#x201D; work fairly well, but are a bit too arcade for my tastes. Multiplayer matchmaking is dead, which is sad as co-op missions seem like fun.

<br>As for those who keep saying this is much worse than the old games like Chaos theory, I slightly disagree, its not significantly better or worse. I am ok with the slightly more streamlined and faster paced direction they have taken, the difference is not as big as many make it out to be.
<br>
<br>As a console port, this is fairly good. There is sadly a checkpoint save system, but it is not as bad as in many other games. Otherwise, there are enough settings, no mouse acceleration and skippable cutscenes. On a geeky side note: the unreal engine used here is excellent as usual (allowing me to sleep my pc while fullscreen and later resume right back into the game in 1 sec).
<br>
<br>Worth getting in a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=4904676">Expand</a></span>

Shooting controls  are pretty unpolished, all the time i was struggling to get a good aim from cover, cuz the reticule shifts away when you wanna get a headshot and makes you miss a lot alerting enemies of whom some can survive several shots to the head. Maybe not an issue on game pad with its aim assist, but serious one on mouse + kboard if youre playing without hand holding.
<br>
<br>Its also not a worthwhile action game, if you want to go guns blazing, and anyways there are sections in game where its demanded from you to kill everyone to proceed, it doesnt feel that satisfying, guns have piss poor range, aiming gets inprecise as you fire several rounds, and if you aim down sights frame rate drops making it hard to hit what you want. Movement can be clunky, entering, exiting sprint can cause issues.
<br>
<br>And the story is not that all interesting either, i barely followed whats going on. But atleast overall presentation is pretty good, apart from gimmicky black/white screen effect when you enter darkness, plus game doesnt run all that well on PC.
<br>
<br>Overall its not bad as some make it look, there are quite a few gripes with it but overall its an OK game, its still decent fun when game works more like a standard stealth game with more open levels and required stealth approach.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/user-reviews?user_review_id=7551215">Expand</a></span>
