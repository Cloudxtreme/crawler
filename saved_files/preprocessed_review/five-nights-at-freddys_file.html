<br>The game has an incredibly simple interface.  You sit in the guard&apos;s office, and have access to locking doors, lights and the restaurant&apos;s camera system, which is accessed via a tablet.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s an interesting idea that falls pretty flat and gets very boring, with super limited game play fairly soon. The game is so short simply because there isn&apos;t enough content to expand upon.
<br>
<br>It also feels incredibly cliche as far as survival horror games goes, it&apos;s just another indie developer jumping on the survival horror train, throwing something together and cashing in on STEAM. Honestly I feel STEAM greenlight has done more bad then good for the game industry.
<br>
<br>Anyways, the game is plagued by  limited game play, short play times and awful graphics. If you were going to do something like this, at the very least you could do a better job with the graphics.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not even worth the $5.00 cost for admission. Maybe if you got it in the humble bundle, for a dollar with multiple other games included.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4424413">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>While the idea behind it is clever and well put-together, FNF fails to deliver in many fields. First of all, if you don&apos;t like jumpscares and want a lasting scare that messes with your head, look elsewhere. In fact, look on the other side of the world, as far away from FNF you can get, because jumpscares is what FNF is entirely based around. I realize there is a lot of love for this game and this will probably get disliked to hell, but this is my opinion of the game, and I&apos;ve played through over 100 games, and I&apos;ve tried hundreds more, and the horror genre is my all-time favorite for movies, games, books, anything. So take it from me when I say this is not a horror game you want to play if you enjoy the genre.
<br>
<br>You sit in a small room the entire game (not even a 3D one, it&apos;s just a panorama), and the only scare that are offered are inevitability and jumpscares. The main scare you&apos;ll experience is something popping up with a scary sound. If you think that&apos;s horror, then by all means go ahead and play FNF. If you think that&apos;s a bad way to get some cheap, short-lasting scares (like me), then stay away from FNF.
<br>
<br>The graphics are decent, but look very aged. Graphics aren&apos;t that much of a problem for me though so that&apos;s fine, the gameplay is what I have a problem with the most. It basically consists of you clicking buttons over and over again, spam clicking and then jumping out of your chair when a cheap jumpscare occurs. It&apos;s a clickfest, and you can&apos;t explore or do anything else. There is basically no animation as well, most things are just pictures copy and pasted into the game, there are like three occurrences where you actually experience animation, and it&apos;s poorly done.
<br>
<br>The difficulty is also unnecessarily hard, though very difficult games seem to captivate many people, so while they&apos;re not for me, I don&apos;t knock FNF for being difficult. The difficulty curve, however, is what I think could&apos;ve been done much better. The first level is basically a piece of cake; an intro, and you&apos;d think the second would be difficult but still playable. Well if you don&apos;t study patterns and practice the first level a good amount, you probably won&apos;t get past the second your first time around, or even your second or third. And once you do, the difficulty spikes so heavily after that that you probably won&apos;t get past the third before you get bored and throw the game back on the dusty shelf in the back of your closet.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s another problem, the game is difficult so a new player will have to restart a lot, but the game is just too dull and repetitive to play through again, even if you only have to repeat the last two levels. Maybe it&apos;s just me, but I&apos;m baffled as to how this game was rated so high, especially by critics. Maybe because it thinks outside of the box, and I will definitely give it that; it&apos;s a good idea and it&apos;s very simple, and provides a lot of scares-albeit cheap ones. But aside from that it&apos;s very dull and the scares don&apos;t last, jumpscares just raise your heartbeat for a short time, and then you forget about it ten minutes later. Games that mess with your head and have you on edge for hours after it&apos;s done are what I look for, and if you consider yourself a fan of the horror genre as well, I would hope you also agree.
<br>
<br>All in all, Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s is a good idea, it&apos;s creepy, it has a constant inevitability and foreboding feel to it, it provides jumpscares, and that&apos;s about it. If you&apos;re looking for a low-budget flash game that makes you jump out of your chair but that&apos;s also very forgettable and dull, grab FNF. The price tag of $4.99 isn&apos;t too bad, though personally I would never buy it for that (I got it on sale just to try it because I was curious as to why everyone was talking about it). All of FNF&apos;s fans say it&apos;s an amazing game simply because they&apos;re favorite YouTube let&apos;s players played it. If you actually saw how much time these &quot;fans&quot; put into FNF, while many haven&apos;t even played it, most of them will have an hour or two, because it&apos;s just too dull to play more than that. I have multiple friends that worship this game simply because they saw someone make funny faces at it on YouTube, they say it&apos;s an amazing game yet I look on their Steam accounts and they&apos;ve played less than an hour.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t be fooled, this is a fad more than a game, and if you&apos;re looking for a quality horror experience do not waste money here. Get Amnesia, Penumbra, The Cat Lady, Outlast, Scratches, or even Anna, just to name a few better alternatives.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=5319059">Expand</a></span>

True, true, it&apos;s scary but after a little while your heart will jump a bit, then disregard the whole thing with an &quot;Ahh f**k you!&quot;
<br>
<br>It has little replayabity, mostly because the game has very little to offer, you won&apos;t really use the &quot;Custom Night&quot; feature much other than the infamous 20/20/20/20 (or maybe putting Foxy on 20, the rest on 1).
<br>
<br>However, what I found the biggest problem here is the complete lack of immersion, simply because the game is about you sitting in one place for basically no reason, without any way you&apos;d at least try to defend yourself other than shutting/opening the doors, again, for no reason.
<br>
<br>On the upside, the characters are unique and frightening (for that rough two seconds they clatter their teeth five centimeters in front of you), each having different characteristics and tactics, so it&apos;s easy to pick a favourite, or one that you despise. It&apos;s gameplay mechanisms are clear and are easy to understand, as well as easy enough for new game developers to see the &quot;board game&quot; behind the curtains of the sprites that you&apos;re looking at while playing.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a fair little game of resource management, however, it&apos;s horror aspect is based on pretty much only flashy, noisy, and after time, annoying jumpscares, which, while sometimes can be good, shouldn&apos;t be overdosed in horror games. Adding the nonsensical elements mentioned above also axes from much of the score.
<br>
<br>If you are a fan of jumpscares (for some weird reason), this game is just for you. If you want quality horror that really sends chills down your spine, I suggest saving your money.
<br>Still, for 5$, it&apos;s not a bad deal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4535425">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Another thing that kinda ticks me off is the wasted potential. Hell when I saw this game I was expecting to actually explore the restaurant you know as an actual security guard doing his rounds. But all I got was one room that I was forced to not leave and just watch the monitors. Granted I&apos;ve played games that used such a mechanic really well such as nighttrap, but in this game it kinda gets old fast.
<br>
<br>I will say one positive about this game though, It did nail the atmosphere and did tell a genuinely spooky and chilling tale. I would recommend just getting this game when it is on sale though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=5370528">Expand</a></span>

We have seen games like Amnesia scare people with it&apos;s constant creepy atmosphere, chase sequences, and horrifying visuals. This game however does its best to scare you in a very minimalistic fashion. barely any animations, movement, basic narrative t and simple mouse point-and-click control.
<br>
<br>For a normal novice horror player, this game will feature a very spooky atmosphere and quite a few legit scares. And some management puzzles as well! But I have to say this as a seasoned horror game veteran, this game is not as scary for me. The chilly ambient atmosphere that the game creates is quite good, but the horror itself relies way too heavily on jumpscares, and for me that is just annoying. The power management puzzle is pretty neat though, a nice new spin on the horror genre as surviving the nights is completely up to your use of energy. Also I&apos;m not the one to ask questions about logic in video games, but electricity powered doors which close if you run out of electricity. Really? Couldn&apos;t come up with something that makes a bit more sense? Oh well, that&apos;s just nitpicking.
<br>
<br>On the technical side, the version 1.0 that I played is just a joke. No basic audio settings, can&apos;t change resolution, brightness, gamma. Nothing. It was just frustrating in that regard.
<br>
<br>In general, the game would be pretty scary for a casual horror novice, but for me personally it wasn&apos;t all that scary, and quite annoying at times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4461121">Expand</a></span>

However, FNAF is simply Youtube bait, nevermind the unique setting whose Freddy Fazbear&apos;s pizzeria textures remind me of FMV cutscenes back in the Sega Genesis days, nevermind the downright jumpscare infused game designed which is the only fuel of terror in this game. What bugs me the most is that close to little effort was actually made into &quot;scaring&quot; you. It&apos;s certainly not a well told story, I could leave a few hints myself about the animatronics and anyone can twist their own theories to fit however. This game is amateurish is best and to see this game compared to Silent Hill makes me want to hurdle a kitten into a flaming pit of lava.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4893730">Expand</a></span>

It isn&apos;t scariest-game-of-all-time, but it does satisfy at some points. The location even seems a bit generic.
<br>
<br>The Positives: The gameplay is something that isn&apos;t seen much. You can&apos;t move. You only have three actions: shut the doors, turn on the lights, and check the camera. It&apos;s blended together to create a well placed im-gonna-die feeling. The game may sound simple, and it is, but it also presents a challenge that I oddly haven&apos;t really experienced in other games. The game is difficult, and if you screw up on later nights just a little, then you can officially say you&apos;re dead. The story, also generic, presents itself in a way that makes it vague and makes you want to piece it all together. Once you do, there is room for even more thoughts and speculation.
<br>
<br>Other comments: No. This game isn&apos;t 100% scary. The animatronics and the setting won&apos;t scare you. It may make you feel uncomfortable, but that&apos;s even only for a little bit. The scares come from the fact that you can&apos;t move, and you can only do a few functions. That kicks in survival mode for people. You don&apos;t want to get caught, and that&apos;s where the scares are. You won&apos;t be able to fight back. But again, the scares can be short lived.
<br>
<br>Is the game worth $5? Yes. This isn&apos;t a must-have game, but if you have the cash, I would recommend looking at this game. It&apos;s really fun, but just know that this game will only last for a few hours.
<br>
<br>Then why does it have a 7? Well, it&apos;s painfully generic with the story. I looked at it and even found myself saying &quot;Really?&quot; It&apos;s an entertaining game, and this is a great start to a series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4519355">Expand</a></span>

Still enjoyable and if you don&apos;t mind spending the few bucks, it&apos;s a pretty decent cheap horror. I guess with all the hype I&apos;ve been hearing of it, I was expecting more.</span>

And let me be clear, these are not animatronics by definition but instead are &quot;automotons&quot;. They will move and try to find you. Unfortunately for you, there is no leaving the office or moving all that much; you control security cameras and the 2 doors that lead to the office, all of which drains the little energy you absolutely need to run the shift rather quickly.
<br>
<br>I give &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s&quot; a 7 out of 10 simply because this is a game review and I will not lie, the game is not all that amazing. And as fun as it is (and rather boring to some extent, with no replay-ability), it fits the genre well! For horror game enthusiasts, gamers who want a scare, and those of you who share a fear of animatronics with me, buy Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4526257">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_4421990"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">When I first viewed Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s, I thought it was a cheap game full of jump-scares. However, I was clearly wrong, as this is a very unique style of horror. Despite this being considered a scary game, I found the game to be less scare inducing and rather more tension and paranoia inducing. As many other reviews said, you cannot do to much about these freaky mascots approaching you until they&apos;re in range of your light or in some cases, running down the hallway or outside your door.
<br>
<br>The game-play in this overall was amazing, you have an amount of power you use and have to make it last all through the night. Using doors, lights, and even the camera all cost power. Another gameplay aspect are the bots and their different behaviors. Bonnie is the most active of the robots, commonly appearing outside your left door and quickly leaving. Chica is the second most active. She tends to linger and stay in rooms longer than the other robots, even when appearing outside your door, she&apos;ll tend to stay longer than most. Foxy is unique, he will appear if the player checks Pirate Cove too often or too little on night 3 (could also appear on night 2) and later. Foxy has 4 frames in Pirate Cove, one will show him hiding behind the curtain, another peering out of the curtain, then one moving towards the left side, and then one even closer to the left side. After the third frame is shown, a little while later if the player checks the hallway, Foxy will be charging down the hallway, giving the player a few seconds to close the doors. The last one is Freddy, unlike the others, he&apos;s kind of a mystery. You will hardly ever see him move around the room early in the week, only standing on the stage looking at the camera. He will only appear if the power runs out, and a song will play for 30 seconds before he attacks, unless time runs out. In the later nights however, he will go against normal strategy, being able to teleport through closed doors, and rapidly moving towards the player. Sometimes, Freddy will work with Chica, Bonnie or Foxy to fake out the player. This strategy involves Chica, Foxy, or Bonnie causing a distraction to keep the player occupied, and allowing Freddy to get to the player. Also, as Freddy becomes more active in the later nights, the bots become more erratic as they move towards the player, often twitching and moving in unusual ways.
<br>
<br>With all of these behaviors, you&apos;d think the game would keep you always on edge. While this is mostly true, I believe it would&apos;ve been more interesting if the bots could take more than 1 route, because as you see more of the game, you will begin to think, &quot;Oh, Chica has left the stage. Well, better keep checking the right door.&quot; Okay, while that may not be entirely true because you have to focus on the other 3, it would have been more scary (and possibly drive many Lets players to insanity) to have the bots randomly decide which hallway they take. So you could have Chica and Bonnie take the same hallway, and have to deal with both of them. However, this is just a minor nitpick, and considering how much the game is worth, I shouldn&apos;t have the same expectations as I do for the Sims 4.
<br>
<br>Lastly, the sounds in this game add to the atmosphere and sometimes give hints to an approaching bot.
<br>
<br>All in all, I can conclude that this is a horror game that is far more just jump-scares, and I would recommend this game to anyone interested.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4421990">Expand</a></span>

It masterfully puts the player in a horrific spot of waiting, just waiting for the inevitable jump-scare.
<br>That being said, there is little else to the game beyond those mechanics, since the player&#x2019;s fear is actually used to enforce bad habits in the player and work against them, rather than for them as some games might warrant. Naturally, this comes at the price of lying to the player a bit (or at the very least using a bit of subtle misdirection) and thus forces multiple play-throughs and lengthens the game significantly. The real difficulty of this game is learning patterns and getting good sets of random circumstances, and thus it really lacks a great deal of depth.
<br>But, for a low priced game, is it worth buying? Of course! If you like this kind of stuff, that is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4418057">Expand</a></span>

Although this seems very unrealistic (really? a guy would work at this place for only $120 a week?) but the concept is very good and the result is a terrifying game to help reboot the horror genre.</span>

In this game you can&apos;t move at all and the only thing keeping you alive is the cameras, lights, and doors. The worst/best part of this game is you have to watch these terrifying animatronics and constantly check your doors. But sometimes that doesn&apos;t even matter like on day 3. If you are extremely unlucky a golden Freddy (who lacks an endoskeleton and eyes) will appear in the security room and you have a tiny amount of time to look back at your tablet or else his face will jump you and crash the game. The ai is well designed as each one has certain behaviours like foxy if you monitor him to much or to little he will rush down the corridor and try to attack you. You also have to be careful how much you use your cameras or other equipment because your employer is an evil ba****d and gives you a limited amount of power which drains over the 9 minutes of each night. Freddy is the main threat in this game. During the first two days he does jack except sometimes stare at the camera evilly. But on ghe third day he activates. It&apos;s incredibly hard to see him in the dark and often uses the bunny and the chicken to distract you. However Freddy has a downfall as it takes 15 seconds to kill you. Freddy will cause paranoia and nightmares because of how sneaky he is. Also when you run out of power he will stand at the left door with his back lit eyes for about 30 seconds before he kills you. There is no ambient music. The only sounds are the camera static, the light humming, footsteps and occasionally pans if (I think it&apos;s Freddy you need to research that) one of the animatronics walk through the kitchen. The game is different to other horrors because of the tension. It never lets you get comfortable in your surroundings and you feel helpless because you cant move or fight. It&apos;s sort of papers, please in the way of each day something new is going to kill you. Initially the story is delivered by a dead pan voice who tells you what he thinks happened but if you look carefully at the papers you can find the true story beneath it all. Lastly lets talk about how the game is made. This game is 3d but it has been made in a 2d only engine. They achieved 3d by warping the textures and using gif animations for movement. If that&apos;s not a case of making do with what you have then what is? Recommendations for five nights at Freddy&apos;s: do not buy if you easily get nightmares/traumatised/paranoid because you won&apos;t sleep very well at all. If you think you are a hard core mother trucker then buy it! Just don&apos;t expect to sleep after wards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4428569">Expand</a></span>

You keep watch over a group of 4 animatronic animals (bear, rabbit, chicken, and fox) in a Chuck E. Cheese-esque kid-friendly pizzeria as they wander at night. While the game itself LOOKS like &quot;another typical indie horror game&quot;, it&apos;s really not. The mechanics are very simple and unique in that you don&apos;t even move, and you only have 3 controls: Check the monitors, close the left and/or right door, and use the left and/or right door lights The 4 animatronics all have their own unique AI and will come after you in different ways. While the gameplay is very light, the true strength of the game and why it&apos;s rapidly growing in popularity is the hidden story and horror elements thrown in. These animatronics are incredibly creepy and will disturb and unnerve you to no end, even if you&apos;re just watching someone else play it. The cheap jumpscare visuals/screamers aside, 5N@F PERFECTLY plays off of the player&apos;s anxieties, OCD, and paranoia. If you don&apos;t have any of those mental conditions or aren&apos;t even slightly creeped out by animatronics, then you will not be scared nor enjoy this game. The game also has an interesting hidden story that barely any of which is told through playing the game; you actually have to look into it (in-game, or just by cheating and going to the wiki). I&apos;d give it a perfect 10/10 if it didn&apos;t have jumpscares/the scream could be toned down just a tiny bit, because those really are the cheap shots of the horror genre (just like a fart noise is the cheap shot of comedy), but it&apos;s still an INCREDIBLY well-made game that will scare the **** out of you and keep you paranoid, panicking, and OCD the whole time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4424270">Expand</a></span>

It masterfully puts the player in a horrific spot of waiting, just waiting for the inevitable jump-scare.

You are a security guide who is responsible for looking after a pizzeria at night. I saw some screenshots of this game before and was wonder why so many people give high rates for this awkward faces of toys and what it is all about. I got a pack of popcorn and started the game thinking that will beat this mechanic toys easily. However, once, I realised that one of the animatronic robots disappeared, my shivering hand began to click on all cameras in hope to understand what was going on and where was this ugly bear. I failed the first night almost falling from the chair when the creepy face apperared on my screen.
<br>I now fully agree with all positive marks for this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4660156">Expand</a></span>

It takes the usual horror game tropes and throws them out the window. If you are used to games like Slender, Amnesia, or SCP: Containment Breach, you WILL be lost and confused.
<br>In a lot of horror games, they try to make you feel alone and confused by presenting you with a puzzle and making you solve it without showing it to you directly, or they try and do so through the story. In this game it is so different from everything else, it takes time to get used to the game mechanics, which you don&apos;t have. You may end up floundering around a lot not realizing what does what, and you may do something wrong without knowing why. This causes panic and confusion for the player and it&apos;s not reliant on anything in-game, but rather the player&apos;s mistakes. In games like SCP: CB, which are procedurally generated, a lot of the confusion relies on the fact that you just get dropped in and are expected to go to these certain places in this certain order when you are never told any of this. In this game, they cryptically explain to you how to play, you still don&apos;t know what is happening and why, especially once you get further in.
<br>A lot of horror games also try to create a sense of dread. A feeling that keeps you from wanting to continue down the next corridor, even though you don&apos;t want to. This is portrayed very well in a game called Dreadhalls for the Oculus Rift. Dreadhalls comes in as a close second to this one for me as &quot;The Scariest Game Ever&quot;, and that unbelievable feeling of dread is the cause. But Dreadhalls gives off the same vibe a lot of other horror games do, just amped-up tenfold.  The biggest reason I think that this game is better, is because it gives off a completely different feeling.
<br>You get an IMMENSE felling of paranoia while playing. You have no control over your character or his surroundings other than the doors, door lights, and the security cameras. All you can do is literally wait to die. No matter how much you check the cameras, they can, and will keep moving towards you and you can&apos;t do anything about them other than closing the doors. You can only do &quot;so much&quot;, and not everything you do actually works, so you have to try everything to find out what works while trying to do what works. You know that you will die, you just don&apos;t know when.]
<br>If I were to reccomend this game, I would say that nobody could play it by themselves. They would need a motive or a friend to beat it. So buy it for $60 if you can.

And I am not even generally a fan of horror games. 5N@F leaves a chilling lasting impression and is a satisfying game experience. The mechanics are simple and easy to learn, yet they get progressively more difficult to control effectively, making this game all about strategy. For the entire game you feel an extreme sense of vulnerability as you have to leave yourself helpless and open to attack for much of the game in order to conserve resources and survive the night. In that alone, it excels where the survival horror genre often falters. The graphics and animation are simple, but very effectively spooky. The ambient sound not only sets an eerie atmosphere, it can be utilized by the player to help guide your choices in the game by alerting you to unseen activities your aggressors are carrying out.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t have any complaint with the jump scares as others do. They are the reason you are trying so hard not to fail. If they weren&apos;t there it wouldn&apos;t be as tense and you wouldn&apos;t dread failing so badly. I like how the tension keeps high because of them, despite that I hate jump scares. They&apos;re good incentive in this game and cause you to really get paranoid and have to fight your own fear to keep your wits and use proper strategy.
<br>
<br>My only reason for not giving this game a perfect 10 score is that the difficulty level seemed to spike for me quite badly at one point. I replayed one particular night several more times than any other night before succeeding simply because that night was one that required you to learn a new strategy to outwit your attackers. Generally, other nights did not seem to require much learning of new strategy and were only harder due to increased activity. The game became frustrating at times and it seemed there were nights when due to the characters&apos; randomized activities you simply were forced to use up your resources and could not win. The time spent playing a level only to be fed with that outcome was quite frustrating. This game treads the fine line between challenging and frustrating, which is okay for its genre, I think, but it is a dangerous line to tread, nonetheless.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d have liked to see more moments later in the game where the strategy needed to change more. Here&apos;s hoping for a sequel!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4427172">Expand</a></span>

Amnesia and Outlast are leading the charge with indie scares, while the triple A creeps of the Evil Within and Alien:Isolation have ensured that the big publishers are still interested in delivering quality horror games. Steam Greenlight is one of the many services that is encouraging small developers to bring out their dream projects and Scott Cawthon is one of the many developers to embrace this service. Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s embraces the current trend of not allowing you to fight back against your enemies... and that takes that further by not allowing you to run or hide either. It&apos;s a silly sounding premise with evil teddy bears and bunnies after you, but this is one of the greatest horror games of our time... and it&apos;s all built on jump scares.
<br>
<br>You play as security guard, Mike Schmidt. He has taken a low wage job at the popular eatery Freddy Fazbear&apos;s Pizzeria. It&apos;s a lovely place during the day and brings joy to many children, with its kid-friendly design and &quot;cute&quot; animatronic animals. Then it goes dark. When it reaches 12am... things start to happen. You&apos;ve taken the night shift and you simply have to sit in your office and watch cameras. However,  the animals seem to move and some of them move fast... It is a very simple premise, but the game builds up its story through some deceptive phone messages that also tutorials and also through the environment. Apparently, the animals are so evil because a man stole a Freddy suit in 1987 and abducted a bunch of children- all of who were never seen again. Apparently they stop their charge for human blood at 6am for unknown reasons. Apparently they stuff you into an empty suit when you caught... and put a metal skeleton through you. It&apos;s some creepy stuff and after this game, you&apos;ll never look at animatronics the same way again.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-wise, there is almost nothing to this game. You sit in an office the whole time, checking cameras, turning your head and clicking buttons to turn on lights and at the worst possible time, shut doors. You need to survive for around 8 or 10 minutes in real time and the only way to do this is to monitor the creatures. When they get close you shut the doors. However, you have to be quick with the fast Foxy and the massive Freddy. Once the animals get in the room, you cop a jump scare. So  what&apos;s to keep you from shutting the doors the whole time- power. You have a constantly dwindling power supply and every action saps your electricity budget. Even staying still and not touching anything will drain power, due to a constantly running light and fan. When all the power runs out, you are pretty much doomed unless it quickly hits the magical number of 6am and the night ends. But once you see the screaming face of an animal on your screen... you&apos;re already dead.
<br>
<br>After the third night where things really hit the peak, it becomes very repetitive. The game never fully advances and you don&apos;t learn any new skills or moves. While the animals become more active and you&apos;re more likely to be killed by Foxy or Freddy, there are some really cheap deaths on display and the game can become immensely frustrating. The main five night campaign takes around 1 hour, but you also unlock a 6th night and a more inviting Custom Night. The thing is, once you&apos;ve finished all of this and earned three stars, you won&apos;t want to really play this again and you may not even get through the bonuses. The only seeming Easter Egg is an annoying Golden Freddy who crashes the game and he&apos;s easily unlockable. The graphics are also very poor. It may be a one man team making this, but this looks like something out of the 90&apos;s. The sound design is very good though, with a haunting atmosphere, a darkly creepy voice over from &quot;Phone Guy&quot; and a startling amount of screams and yells. Play this with headphones if you want nightmares.
<br>
<br>Five Nights is only around $5 which is a good price for what you get. It is definitely scary in some places and is designed well, but repetition and a lack of replayability hold it back. If the next time we go to Freddy&apos;s manages to innovate a little, then Scott will have a real winner on his hands.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4774499">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Animatronics:
<br>The animatronics did well in this game. The only
<br>thing wrong is they give me nightmares!
<br>
<br>Easter Eggs:
<br>The golden freddy easter egg in this game was decent content
<br>in the fact that you have to look at the cams in order to survive after
<br>staring at the poster the west hall corner.
<br>
<br>Jumpscares:
<br>The jumpscares in this game are petrifying in this game.
<br>Especially in your face.
<br>
<br>Now what do I think of this game?
<br>Fairly great. If you have a different opinion
<br>go and write a review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4429818">Expand</a></span>

This is possibly the most unique horror game I have ever played. Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s manages to frighten you without all the gore and violence of other games in the horror genre.</span>

Creating the illusion of fear with a quick loud noise a scary image that you couldnt avoid thrown into your face. Five Nights at Freddys perfects the horror genre at sets the bar as a result. Instead of throwing jump scares at you left right and centre, the game builds up to them, the fear is no longer even the fear of the jump scare, because the atmosphere, the setting, the mood and the danger is so personal to you and so real the fear is not wanting to be caught by those creepy animatronics, complimented by a jump scare that you as the player had the ability to prevent by your skill and strategy.
<br>Im no good at the game. The fear aspect of it us so real for me i just freeze up when playing. I keep the doors locked, run the power out and press the escape button. My fiance is the true master of this game. Completing all the nights without fear. If youre not scared of being caught by the creatures of this game then you shall succeed fairly more than those like me who are scared.
<br>This game is so perfect in terms of the horror and atmosphere. The gameplay is simple and if you play this game with headphones on, volume cranked up to max, 12am and lights turned off, youll get the full spooky complete experience that this game has to offer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4649591">Expand</a></span>

<br>Night 1-okay,so it turns out that you are a security guard in a small office and your job is to listen and look out for the anamitronic robots with limited power,security cameras,your eyes, and your ears.the first time i played this game i shut the doors and just kept looking for foxy or freddy.but i when i got out of the cameras i saw a huge gold teddy bear aka golden freddy and i didnt know how to stop him.
<br>okay well that was night one, i actually never got past that one honestly.but theres something about the story i didnt tell you about.the reason why you are taking the night shift is because the last guy before you took the day shift and when freddy fazbears pizza opened there were 5 kids that went missing oh and one more thing listen for little children laughing and that should mean that golden freddy is probably in your office. please buy the game and  see for yourself how fun this is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4817259">Expand</a></span>

The supernatural angle and the &quot;lore&quot; of this game are absolutely silly.  It comes off like a bad R.L. Stine novella.  The limited animations, the ridiculous creature designs and the fact that every major Lets player on the planet is cashing in on its &quot;spook&quot; factor is starting to smack of irrationality.  Its also a very short game that the developer is making far too much money from when in all likelihood you will drop it after about an hour.  Much like &quot;Slender&quot; and other low budget &quot;horror&quot; games, Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s has a very short life-expectancy in terms of legitimate enjoyment to be gained from playing it.  Its unclear as to why its become such an enigma, but I&apos;m certain its just another flavor-of-the-month in a pool of mediocrity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4431851">Expand</a></span>

It isn&apos;t the most scary horror game, but that doesn&apos;t mean it would be bad at all. I would have give this game a 10, but the graphics would need little improvement and the game is quite small 9/10.</span>

<br>Make your friends play this. Hooked up my PC to a 32 in. TV at a friends house and played this game, my friend hid in his closet after his first jumpscare.</span>

                                        <span>Fine Nights at Freddy&apos;s is an interesting take on the horror genre. I like how it mixes horror and strategy. . There are five animatronics who are going to kill you. There is also some more story which you can see in the newspapers. While I do think some youtubers are overreacting it still is a scary game with plenty of jump scares to have.</span>

<br>At later stages, your hand will be sweating from pressure as the 4 animatronics keep assaulting your office.
<br>Every animatronic is unique in their own way!
<br>Also the game gathered an extremly huge fanbase, in which you will most likely to see furries... yeah.
<br>But furries aside, I would give this game 9/10.
<br>Why 9/10?
<br>I give that because the game is 5 bucks.
<br>Bad argument you say?
<br>Well the whole game is about 1-2 hours long (Excluding 4/20 mode)
<br>But it still amazing even if it&apos;s not that long. It just makes you come back for more... or not.
<br>I think the game is worth buying.
<br>Also... if you we&apos;re scared of Chuck &apos;E Cheese when you were little... Have fun ;3</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4777977">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>lets get into the good stuff shall we
<br>-the horror in the this game is a nice change most big horror games are non-stop gore fests all about showing us the most guts in the most brutal way, but then we have game like this we can not move only close two doors and have to deal with a power supply which really makes this game intense, i think if this game was set up any other way it would not be that scary (for example slendermen) but in this game when you see one of the animals out side your door all you can door is close the door on the side and hope that it goes away soon you cant just pull out an m16 and shoot your way out of this issue
<br>
<br>-game-play its so simple yet so hard at the same time. when you start out the game fells really easy i mean it is just check the lights and see if anyone is outside (if one is close door) and check cameras to see where everybody is at  sounds easy right? well for night 1 and 2 its that simple, night 3 comes freddy starts to move you hear him laugh you don&apos;t know how he attacks night 4 comes then wow it takes  a few tries but fun
<br>
<br>-story to my surprise there is a really good story here to be found not going to spoil it but its something your going to want to check out and in the end be ready for mind blown</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4781298">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s game-play is simple to grasp, but hard to really master it unless you play it for a long time (Ahem, Markiplier). You are a night guard in an office, and you can check the cameras, check the blind spots next to the doors, or just just the doors so that some animatronic gets in and stuffs you in a suit full of metal. But, all of these things decrease you power, and when you power is at 0%, you are dead, UNLESS you make it to 6 AM. In fact, to survive a night, you&apos;ll need to manage your power AND the animatronics until it&apos;s 6. Now, be careful, because there is this one camera that you have to check moderately, or else a pirate fox -again- stuffs you in a suit filled with metal. The visuals are very dirty and dark, which just adds an atmosphere. Same with the sound. No gore or blood needed. Scott used the Uncanny Valley perfectly and also mixed it with nostalgia of Chuck E. Cheese&apos;s. It&apos;s story is told throughout the series very subtly, but carefully (except for a few loopholes, but still). It doesn&apos;t have much music, but the game didn&apos;t need it. The price is awesome, at 4.99 US dollars. THAT&apos;S UNDER NINE DOOOOOLLAAAARS!!! Final Statement: It&apos;s better than Beiber, I mean, Bonnie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=5171774">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gameplay-The gameplay is Ok but it isn&apos;t worth the &#xA3;2 you pay for it, It is more the gameplay of a flash game as it is easy and doesn&apos;t support it self well however it is easy to master flicking on the camera and turning the lights on and off it isn&apos;t the gameplay that&apos;s so cheesy about this game
<br>
<br>Graphics-The graphics are as i said before that of a unity flash game their not terrible but their not amazing either The graphics are highly pixelated in most parts however the animatronic design is fairly creative and well drawn
<br>
<br>Scare factor- The game isn&apos;t scary. You may say that&apos;s my opinion well it is, But Five Night&apos;s At Freddy&apos;s relies on the cheapest factor in all horror games, JUMPSCARES! And the only jumpscare that could possibly scare you (unless your a 6-year-old hardcore gamer) Is Bonnie&apos;s the only one that has a hint of scare. The 2nd and 3rd games improve on the scare factor of the atmosphere but still the jumpscares don&apos;t get much better
<br>
<br>Characters- There is 0 character in this game. The only real character who has any story that hasn&apos;t just been made up by fans is Phone guy (also known as Jeremy) On Night 4 dies (or that&apos;s what we believe anyway) This has spawned theories hundreds of them in fact this is basically the  only character development we get a night-guard dying that&apos;s just pathetic.
<br>
<br>Story- The story isn&apos;t too bad but it focuses on secrets rather than straight up explanation however this does make the player want to look further
<br>
<br>Overall rating- I give at a 5 out of 10 because it is defiantly the worst Fnaf game and deserves no better
<br>
<br>Conclusion- It isn&apos;t an insanely bad game but it needs improvement to be classed as a good game after all it started a beloved series so it deserves a 5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=5283194">Expand</a></span>

Could be Played in under an hour, very nice.</span>

The atmosphere is however ruined by jump scares that don&apos;t really feel creepy or planned out to make you uncomfortable, just unpleasant. The looming feeling of being hunted with nothing to defend yourself but wits does out-shadow the jumps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=5316233">Expand</a></span>

<br>Would you say this is the story of the game Easter eggs? The guard worked for 5 nights and got the money this story? The man who killed the children and their souls go to costumes robots (Rave theory) is the story? Rave! It fafula

<br>I&apos;m still in shock as normal people to appreciate the game as well-researched game!

The game is a nice change compared to any other horror, or just any game in general. It adds a brand new, fresh game idea and mechanics. It isn&apos;t just walking around a haunted asylum, or spooky mansion, while poorly designed monsters pop out at you. In the game, you&apos;re actually trying to do this job for a reason. If you don&apos;t do it right, there are consequences... That&apos;s one of the problems i had with Slenderman. You were literally wandering through a forest trying to find PAPER!... It didn&apos;t make you feel like you had a connection with the character at all. In Five Night&apos;s At Freddy&apos;s, you&apos;re scared for yourself, and your character. You also have to take into account that this game was made by ONE GUY! ONE... GUY... Considering how the graphics aren&apos;t half bad, and the mechanics are new/fresh, i&apos;d have to say that&apos;s pretty impressive.
<br>
<br>Breakdown for Rating:
<br>- New and Fresh Game Mechanics and Ideas
<br>- Pretty good graphics and animations
<br>- Doesn&apos;t feel the need to use blood to scare you
<br>- Made by ONE GUY</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys/user-reviews?user_review_id=4678177">Expand</a></span>
