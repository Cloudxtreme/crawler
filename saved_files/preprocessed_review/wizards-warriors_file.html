<br>
<br>The first thing of note is the very old graphics and graphic style of the game. You might be thinking, well, that&apos;s what games looked like in 2000. You&apos;d be wrong and the lackluster visual aspect of the game was a major complaint by most even at the time of release. The game had taken so long to develop, and had such a poor and archaic visual style even from the beginning, that it simply never was revised and updated to become competitive in a market with RPG&apos;s such as Baulder&apos;s Gate. Not even close.
<br>
<br>The game play, combined with an equally archaic interface, was and is tedious right from the start. The game lingered between wanting real-time and turn-based game play, even offering the option for to the player to choose as they like; unfortunately, they failed to successfully deliver on either format, causing combat to be convoluted and as uninteresting as the mechanics that went with it.
<br>
<br>Once released, many were literally shocked at the horrible game that DW Bradley had directed from the doors of Heuristic Park. In hindsight, with the later example Dungeon Lords to further cement both Bradley and HR as incapable of producing a quality game, it isn&apos;t quite as surprising as it was back in the day. That it received the marks that it did from the press is a testament to the media&apos;s willingness to be lenient to Bradley, at least in 2000.
<br>
<br>In all, there is really nothing to lend a positive note about regarding Wizards &amp; Warriors. Despite some reviewers waxing how &quot;close to tabletop&quot; this game is supposed to be, it even failed miserably in that respect, paled by competitors and the designers own failures alike. Now, as then, the game is best avoided (especially as its horrible graphic issues are only compounded on modern machines and operating systems). There are worse games, but not many.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wizards-warriors/user-reviews?user_review_id=24313">Expand</a></span>
